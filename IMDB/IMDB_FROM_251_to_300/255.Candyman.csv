0,TheLittleSongbird,Delivers on pretty much every level,8,22 February 2011,"You'd think perhaps from the title that the film wouldn't be as good as it turned out to be. Based on Clive Barker's excellent, intelligent and very chilling book, Candyman is a very good film.The production values are great and very stylish. The cinematography is beautiful, and the setting and lighting is suitably atmospheric. The atmosphere also really helps, and the more disturbing bits do not thankfully come across as laughable or fake, thanks to the atmosphere and other factors it is genuinely chilling. Phillip Glass's hypnotic and goosebump-inducing score is also very effective, Bernard Rose directs brilliantly, the story is always gripping with Candyman's origins especially well done the dialogue is thought-provoking, intelligent and fits each scene accordingly.The film is a good length and goes at a well-judged pace. The performances are impressive too, Virginia Madsen is simply terrific in a difficult role while Tony Todd is absolutely terrifying down from his posture to his voice. In fact, for me the only real downside was the ending, it was a sort of ""it's not over"" ending, and for me(I may be biased as I am not a fan of this type of ending) it felt tacky. In conclusion, an atmospheric horror film that delivers on pretty much every level. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Candyman
1,SnoopyStyle,Clive Barker terror,7,14 October 2013,"Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) are researching an urban legend about Candyman who has a hook for a hand. He appears to those who say his name five times in front of a mirror. The pair goes to Cabrini Green, a gang ridden part of Chicago, to investigate some deaths attributed to the legend.Based on a Clive Barker novel, this starts slowly. The rundown setting and the gang violence really amps up the atmosphere. Virginia Madsen has brought a compelling performance without overplaying the victim. Tony Todd is amazing as the creepy Candyman. This isn't just a slasher movie. It's more a psychological thriller. The pacing does have some slow spots, but it never stops the tension. It's a great little horror movie.",Candyman
2,Prismark10,Candyman,5,11 September 2020,"Based on a Clive Barker story that has been transplanted to Chicago by British writer/director Bernard Rose.Candyman is part Urban Legend/Gothic Romance/Psychological Thriller/Slasher Horror. It is because Rose plays around with horror tropes to move away from being a Freddy Krueger style rip off.Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate student researching urban myths who hears a story about the Candyman (Tony Todd.)If you recite Candyman five times in front of a mirror, he will appear with his hooked hand. Helen starts to investigate some deaths in the Cabrini Green district which might be attributed to Candyman or it could be just local gangs.However are some of the incidents in Helen's head as she is accused of murder or is she under some sort of spell by the Candyman. Even Helen's husband, a university professor has doubts about her sanity.There are lots of themes explored in this film including social class and race. Some of the characters such as Helen's husband have ulterior motives. Rose goes for disturbing images rather than just purely gore.There is a very nice opening scene as we see overhead images of traffic moving. It gives the film a hypnotic beat. However it does not always hold together well, becoming preposterous as it goes on. Tony Todd is an imposing figure as Candyman.",Candyman
3,claudio_carvalho,Her Disbelief Brought Him Back,7,5 November 2007,"In Chicago, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) are researching for their thesis about urban legend in the University of Illinois, where Helen's husband Trevor Lyle (Xander Berkeley) gives classes. Helen becomes obsessed by the legend of the Candyman (Tony Todd), a son of slaves whose father became rich in 1890 after inventing a device for mass producing of shoes. The educated Candyman was an artist, but when the daughter of a powerful man got pregnant of him, her father hired some hooligans that saw off his right hand with a rusty blade, took him to an apiary with dozens of hives with hungry bees, smashed the hives and smeared honeycomb in his naked body. Candyman was stung to death by the bees, than his body was burnt in a giant pyre and the ashes scattered on Cabrini Green. Candyman stays alive in the legend that says that he would appear if his name is spoken five times in front of the mirror, and the skeptical Helen summons Candyman. Helen and Bernadette go to Cabrini Green, where two unsolved murders had happened, and the dwellers blame Candyman for the crimes. Helen's disbelief brings Candyman back; the dog of Cabrini Green's dweller Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams) is slashed and her baby vanishes, and Helen is blamed. Later Candyman kills her friend Bernadette, and Helen is accused of first degree murder and arrested, while she unsuccessfully tries to prove that Candyman is the real killer.""Candyman"" is a gore and well-developed horror movie with a character visibly inspired in the urban legend of Bloody Mary. The screenplay sustains the ambiguity of Helen's sanity, and it is never clear if Candyman does really exist or the murders are committed by the disturbed and impressed Helen. Virginia Madsen is excellent in her performance of a woman in the edge of insanity and Tony Todd is amazing with his strong and dark voice. The great music score of Philip Glass fits perfectly to the movie and is another plus. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Mistério de Candyman"" (""The Mystery of Candyman"")Note: On 21 July 2020, I saw this film again.",Candyman
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Be careful what you wish for.,9,2 September 2021,"When studying her subject, Helen Lyle gets more than she bargains for when she summons The Candyman, a malevolence in human form, with a hook for a hand.It's some time since I last saw this film, and it's just as good, if not better than I remember. It's imaginative, creative and very dark, and whilst it does have a few of the typical stereotypes, it generally steers clear of the usual rules.The central figure Helen, though attractive is not a teenage airhead, she's a strong, intelligent woman, and fortunately she doesn't run around screaming, she's intrigued by her subject as opposed to terrified.Tony Todd, the only real word for him, is iconic, it's one of the great horror performances, he is awesome as The Candyman, he's so smart, so suave, but incredibly menacing.The scares are still very nasty, it's relentless and unforgiving in equal measure. Horror films nowadays rely so much on gore, that other elements are often forgotten, such as tension, intrigue and fear, this classic movie delivers all of those in abundance.The music is so good, and so alarming, it still works very well.It's an out and out classic, 9/10.",Candyman
5,gavin6942,Classic Horror Film and the Birth of Tony Todd,7,30 June 2014,"The Candyman (Tony Todd), a murderous soul with a hook for a hand, is accidentally summoned to reality by a skeptic grad student (Virginia Madsen) researching the monster's myth.Horror fans will appreciate the Ted Raimi cameo (and it is interesting to note that this same year, director Bernard Rose appeared as a ""fake shemp"" in ""Army of Darkness""). Although Rose co-wrote and directed this now-classic horror film, he seems to have never before or since been involved in anything very memorable (besides being a production assistant on ""The Dark Crystal"").The lecture hall scene early on is an interesting precursor to ""Urban Legend"", which borrows at least a similar theme from this movie if nothing else.And best of all, this film launched Tony Todd into being a horror icon. Sure he was already a known actor with ""Platoon"" and such, but he is now, forever, known as the Candyman.",Candyman
6,lee_eisenberg,Any relation to the Grateful Dead song?,7,12 February 2006,"Urban legends always make for neat horror, but ""Candyman"" takes it one step further. While Chicago college student Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is investigating the urban myth of the Candyman - a hook-handed maniac who appears in the mirror if you say his name five times - various and sundry events begin to suggest that he might be more than just a myth.More than setting up scenes for people to walk into rooms to get slaughtered, this movie looks at urban decay and stereotypes. But definitely not for the faint of heart. Madsen displayed the same flair that she would later bring to her Oscar-nominated role in ""Sideways"".By the way, anyone remember the Grateful Dead song ""Candyman""? It went:""Look out, look out, the Candyman/Here he come and he's gone again/ Pretty lady ain't got no friends 'til the/Candyman comes around again...""",Candyman
7,jboothmillard,Candyman,7,2 October 2007,"It's most likely the first time I watched this cult scary movie was whilst I was in college, I'm glad I got to watching it again a few years later, based on the book The Forbidden by Clive Barker (Hellraiser), also executive producer. Basically, in Chicago, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate student at the University of Illinois researching urban legends. She becomes most interested in the Candyman, a spirit who appears when a person says his name five times in the mirror and kills them with the hook attached to the bloody stump of his right arm. Helen learns about a woman named Clara (Marianna Elliott) who was murdered while babysitting presumably after calling Candyman's name. She also learns from two cleaning ladies about a woman named Ruthie Jean rumoured to be killed by the Candyman in the notorious Cabrini-Green housing project. She discovers there have been twenty-five murders in the area. Sceptical, Helen and her friend Bernadette ""Bernie"" Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) say Candyman's name in the bathroom mirror five times, but nothing happens. Helen and Bernadette are working together on a thesis and go to Cabrini-Green to the scene of Ruthie Jean's murder. There, Helen discovers a room where apparent offerings have been left for the Candyman. They meet Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Estelle Williams), the neighbour of the deceased victim, a single mother raising a baby boy, Anthony (twins Latesha and Lanesha Martin). Anne-Marie is initially hostile but talks a little about things that have happened. That evening, Helen and her husband Trevor (Terminator 2's Xander Berkeley) have dinner with Professor Philip Purcell (Michael Culkin), a snobbish folklore expert who tells the backstory of the Candyman. The Candyman, real name Daniel Robitaille, was born in the late 1800s, the son of slave, who became a well-known artist, painting portraits for wealthy white people. However, he fell in love with the daughter of a white client, and she became pregnant and gave birth to his child. Enraged, the man hired people to attack the artist, stripping him naked, cutting off his right hand, and smearing him with honeycomb (hence his nickname), attracting a swarm of angry bees that stung him death. His corpse was burned, and his ashes scattered across the land on which Cabrini-Green now stands. When Helen returns to Cabrini-Green, she is attacked by a man who calls himself the Candyman. After surviving the assault, escaping with only a black eye, she identifies her attacker, who turns out to be a gang leader. The police assume he is responsible for the murders. After leaving the police station, Helen is walking in a parking garage, and she hears a voice calling for her. There she encounters the real Candyman (Tony Todd) who hypnotises her, he urges Helen to become his victim. He explains that the belief in him by hundreds of people is what allows him to go on living, but she has discredited his legend, so he must shed innocent blood to perpetuate it. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood, finding Anne-Marie's pet Rottweiler's decapitated head and Anthony has been taken. The distraught Anne-Marie attacks Helen, who is arrested by the police, whilst she is holding a knife defending herself. Trevor bails her out of jail. She looks at some photographs she took at Cabrini-Green and sees the Candyman in one of them. The Candyman then appears and cuts Helen neck, causing her to bleed and pass out. Bernadette arrives at Helen's apartment, and when Helen wakes, she finds Bernadette has been murdered. Helen has been framed for the crime, she is sedated, and taken to a psychiatric hospital and kept in restraints. Helen is interviewed by psychiatrist Dr. Burke (Stanley DeSantis) a month later for her upcoming trial. She wants to prove her innocence and looks in a mirror to summon the Candyman, calling his name five times. The Candyman appears and kills the doctor but allows Helen to escape. She returns to her apartment and finds Trevor now living with student Stacey (Carolyn Lowery), who he has been having an affair with. Helen confronts him, then flees to Cabrini-Green to confront the Candyman and rescue baby Anthony. In his lair, the Candyman tells her that if she surrenders to him, Anthony will be safe. Offering Helen immortality, the Candyman opens his coat, revealing his ribcage swarmed with bees. The bees pour out of his mouth as he kisses her and stream down her throat. He vanishes with the baby, and Helen awakes to discover a mural of the Candyman and his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to her. The Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him strike fear into Cabrini-Green's residents. Helen crawls into a pile of wood and junk to rescue Anthony, clutching a hook, which is spotted by a child who believes in the Candyman. Residents gather around, splash the junk pile with petrol and set the wood on fire, creating a bonfire, with Helen, Anthony and the Candyman trapped inside. Helen grabs a burning piece of wood, penetrating the Candyman's chest and trapping him to burn in the bonfire, while she crawls out from the fire. Helen's head is on fire, and she dies from the severe burns, but baby Anthony is saved, and the residents, led by Anne-Marie, go to Helen's funeral to pay their respects. At home, Trevor is wracked with guilt and grief. He looks in the mirror and says Helen's name five times, whereupon Helen's vengeful spirit appears and kills him with a hook. In the Candyman's former lair, a new mural of Helen dressed in white with her hair ablaze is seen. Also starring Gilbert Lewis as Detective Frank Valento, Ted Raimi as Billy, Bernard Rose as Archie Walsh, and Rusty Schwimmer as Policewoman. Madsen gives an interesting performance as the young woman examining and getting too close to a dark figure, and Todd with his gravelly voice is suitably sinister as the hook-handed mythical killer. I will admit, watching it again, there are a few scenes that are slow-moving and perhaps cheesy, but it is atmospheric, gory when it needs to be, and can be classed as a contemporary classic, a worthwhile supernatural horror. It was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",Candyman
8,Woodyanders,One of the best and most effective horror movies made in the 90's,9,11 November 2007,"Headstrong graduate student Helen Lyle (a terrific performance by Virginia Madsen) is working on a thesis about local legends and urban myths. Helen and her loyal friend Bernadette ""Bernie"" Walsh (winningly played by Kasi Lemmons) go to a dangerous rundown projects area of Chicago to investigate tales about popular bogeyman figure Candyman (a superbly creepy and mesmerizing portrayal by Tony Todd), a hook-handed supernatural killer who appears in the flesh if you say his name five times in front of a mirror. Helen discovers that Candyman is all too real -- and very deadly. Writer/director Bernard Rose, adapting the story ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a grimly serious and despairing tone while shedding plenty of fascinating light on contemporary inner city blight and the need for myths in a bleak and unforgiving world. Moreover, Rose tells you just enough about Candyman to make him a palpably frightening source of fear and dread, but thankfully doesn't over-explain things with a lot of unnecessary excess exposition. It's this welcome and refreshing element of eerie ambiguity that makes this picture so scary and unnerving. Madsen and Todd both contribute top-notch work; they receive sterling support from Xander Berkeley as Helen's smug, faithless professor husband Trevor, Vanessa Williams as feisty struggling single mom Anne-Marie McCoy, De Juan Guy as scrappy kid Jake, Carolyn Lowery as Trevor's foxy student mistress Stacey, Michael Culkin as smarmy academic Philip Purcell, and Ted Raimi as bad boy teen Billy. Philip Glass' beautifully moody'n'spooky score, Anthony B. Richmond's fluid, sharp, striking cinematography, several startling outbursts of brutal grisly violence, the gritty locations, Bob Keen's excellent make-up f/x, and the chilling downbeat conclusion all further enhance the haunting, stately and elegant superior quality of this exceptional shocker.",Candyman
9,ccthemovieman-1,Only A Moron Believes These 'Urban Legends',3,3 March 2007,"You have to have a strong stomach at times to watch this horror movie as it has its share of disgusting scenes and disgusting political correctness (racism, mainly, wrapped around an ""urban legend."") The only thing pleasant to look at was Virginia Madsen's face and figure. Otherwise, especially if you are petrified of bees, stay away from this Clive Barker-written ""shocker.""This movie is strictly made for shock value, which you get here and there with bloody, gross scenes. Storywise, it's so ludicrous and so full of holes and that ""urban legend"" nonsense that only an ignorant Liberal would believe, that it's almost laughable. The ""race card"" used in here is an insult. Speaking of laughs, this film could have used some humor. It wasn't well-enough made to take itself so seriously. Some humor would have helped immensely.",Candyman
10,Tweekums,Superior Chiller,8,19 June 2008,"While this film might not have quite as much gore as many more recent film it certainly has plenty of chills. That said there are some fairly gory moments just not always when I expected them.Virginia Madsen plays Helen, a young woman who is researching urban legends, most she hears are fairly mundane but one grabs her attention; the tale of a hook handed man who appears if you look into a mirror and say his name five times. At first she thinks it is just another of the stories her students are telling her till she hears that a murder on the Cabrini-Green Project (a Chicago slum) has been attributed to the eponymous Candyman.She is even more interested when she learns her own up-market apartment was originally intended to be part of the project till planners realised it was to close to the more refined parts of town. She goes to Cabrini-Green with a colleague to investigate and thinks she has solved the mystery when a gang member using the Candyman myth to scare the residents assaults her. However once he is arrested the real Candyman appears in order to make the people fear him once more.Helen soon finds herself apparently framed for the kidnapping of a child and the murder of her colleague. While she sees the Candyman nobody else does so for a while we don't know if he is truly there or if she has gone insane and is actually committing the crimes herself. We do of course find out but I won't spoil that here.Virginia Madsen is very good as Helen but Tony Todd steals the show as the charismatic Candyman. The creepiness is exaggerated by the haunting music of Philip Glass that plays throughout the film. Definitely a film to see if you want a good scare combined with a good story.",Candyman
11,BA_Harrison,Sweet.,8,22 October 2009,"Six years before slasher 'Urban Legend' used modern popular folklore as the basis for its rather mediocre plot, Candyman employed the same premise to far greater effect. Based on a story by Clive Barker, director Bernard Rose's creepy tale sees graduate students Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) writing their thesis on Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd), aka Candyman, an affluent black artist brutally supposedly murdered by hired thugs after his lover's father, a powerful businessman, discovered that his daughter was pregnant. According to legend, anyone foolish enough to utter Candyman's name five times whilst looking in a mirror will get to meet the man in person, shortly before being gutted by his vicious hook.Silly sceptic Helen attempts to disprove the Candyman myth, but soon realises that she has made a big mistake: Candyman exists because people believe in him, and in order to survive, he must ensure that the stories continue. Helen's suffering will be the stuff of legends for years to come.As one might expect from the mind that brought us the dark delights of Hellraiser, Candyman is an intelligent yet twisted horror tale that successfully manages to disturb on more than on level: not only is the physical violence upsetting, with even kids and animals meeting very grisly demises, but the film also manages to play on fears and paranoia buried deep in the common subconscious: who hasn't looked in a mirror and been afraid of what they might see lurking behind them?; are crazy people really insane, or do they just see what most of us cannot?; and do we allow superstition to prevent ourselves from making rational decisions?Technically, the film is equally as proficient, with fluid camera-work and stunning art direction making the film a joy to behold, a haunting score by Philip Glass that adds immeasurably to the unsettling atmosphere, and convincing central performances from the talented Madsen as poor Helen, and Todd, whose menacing voice alone ensures chills up and down the spine.And to those people who say that the film lacks a decent ending, I reply 'poppycock!'—the finale is great: Helen reminds Candyman of his long lost love, and so he tricks her into rescuing the baby he has stolen, hoping to finally end his existence in the company of a surrogate family. Instead, Candyman perishes alone, with Helen dying after saving the baby's life. The film ends with Helen replacing Candyman as the subject of urban folklore, appearing to kill whenever her name is repeated in a mirror.",Candyman
12,moonspinner55,Swarming scares...,6,24 February 2008,"Disjointed but still intense adaptation of horror-writer Clive Barker's story ""The Forbidden"" becomes scary vehicle for under-used actress Virginia Madsen (a smart, reliable performer). She plays a college student doing a paper on urban legends who inadvertently conjures up the spirit of an ancient killer. Mixes elements of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" with a somewhat more realistic urban scenario; the overall effect is jarring, yet also occasionally effective and extremely creepy. It does goes overboard near the climax--apparently no one involved knew the right way to wrap this story up--but Madsen is riveting and the picture is never less than gripping. Followed by an ill-advised sequel, ""Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh"", in 1995. **1/2 from ****",Candyman
13,paul_haakonsen,Over-hyped early 1990s horror movie...,4,16 September 2021,"I saw the 1992 horror movie ""Candyman"" back some time in the early 1990s, then I haven't seen it again since before now in 2021. Truth be told, I couldn't really remember the movie, just mere fragments and the general concept of the storyline. So, I sat down to watch writer and director Bernard Rose's 1992 movie again.Truth be told, then ""Candyman"" is way too hyped. The movie is not really all that good. Sure, it was watchable, but only mildly entertaining in terms of being a proper horror movie.The storyline is pretty straight forward, and yeah, it does have some nice enough concept ideas to it. But it was just a bit too bland and mundane actually. So the movie wasn't even half as scary or interesting as I remembered it to be from back in the day.The acting performances in the movie were good, and the movie is nicely carried by lead actress Virginia Madsen. And yeah, Tony Todd does make for an iconic horror figure, for sure. But the Candyman character is not all that impressive or scary. The movie also have the likes of Xander Berkeley and Vanessa Williams on the cast list, and even a short appearance by none other than Ted Raimi.Visually then ""Candyman"" is actually good, and there were some nice special effects throughout the course of the movie. But again, for a horror movie then what was delivered and seen on the screen just didn't really make for an outstanding or particularly memorable horror movie. Especially since there were so many other horror movies from the early 1990s that far outshined this one.Watchable, sure, but ""Candyman"" is not really the legendary horror movie it has been hyped up to be.My rating of this 1992 horror movie lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.",Candyman
14,Quinoa1984,Phillip Glass,8,15 April 2016,"Candyman, featuring a career-defining role for Tony Todd (it's the voice AND the clothes and his poise all put together), the repugnant but beautifully chosen Cabrini housing projects before they were torn down (think of this as the version of what you saw in Hoop Dreams but the dark-evil side), is a good movie, and it has certain flourishes (the bee attack, those shots of the Chicago sky-line, Virginia Maden's performance in general) that are wonderful.And yet somehow due to Bernard Rose's tenacity in getting Phillip Glass one of the major scores of all horror films in cinema. The mix of solo piano, accordion, organs, choral chants, high-orchestras, it all comes together and makes something that gets into your bones, far more than even his scores for Koyaanisqatsi and Morris films. How did Glass get involved with this? Maybe the power of Tony Todd and that opening shot (after the credits) of the sea of bees did it for him. Seeing this again I was so floored by his work that I'd put it just behind Psycho and Halloween as far as the champion horror movie music",Candyman
15,BandSAboutMovies,An insane movie,10,25 October 2019,"I was just discussing slasher movies and their lack of blackness with one of my friends last week and we struggled to come up with many movies where there was a black killer. Sure, there's Snoop Dogg's turn in Bones, which is pretty much a remix of J.D.'s Revenge. Then we remembered - Candyman.Bernard Rose has directed some really interesting films, like 1988's dark fantasy of growing up Paperhouse. He was also behind the videos for Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Relax"" and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" before he met with Clive Barker, expressing interest in adapting the story ""The Forbidden.""While the original story is more of an examination of the Birtish class system, Rose moved his story to the inner city of Chicago, where he could better focus on the racial, social and cultural divides of America. Some of its story was inspired by journalist Steve Bogira's articles about the murder of Ruthie Mae McCoy in Chicago's Abbot Homes housing project. In particular, the detail that she was murdered by someone who entered her apartment through the opening behind her medicine cabinet becomes an integral part of this story.
Amazingly, Eddie Murphy was the original choice for the titular role, but he was too expensive for the production. Enter Tony Todd. He told IGN that despite fears of being typecast, ""I've always wanted to find my own personal Phantom of the Opera."" As he was concerned about the threat of being stung by the numerous bees he would contend with, he negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for every sting he suffered during filming. He's a smart man - he ended up earning an extra $23,000.Not to name drop, but I had the honor of working with Todd when he came to Pittsburgh to inaugurate the Pittsburgh Public Theater with a performance of August Wilson's King Hedley II. I'd written a radio commercial promoting it and instead of struggling with a casting agency to discover the right voice, I inquired if Todd would be willing to do the recording session. He was happy to promote the play, as he'd acted in the same play on Broadway. However, the PPT had one condition.I was told, ""No matter what, please do not mention that horror movie he was in.""I replied, ""Do you mean The Crow or the remake of Night of the Living Dead?"" Nobody got the joke.So cut to me standing on the sidewalk of Liberty Avenue, waiting outside Todd's hotel. Talk about nerve wracking. Suddenly, he was ten feet away from me, his six foot five inch frame even more imposing in person.""Do we have time for a salad? I'm dying for a salad.""Not the first thing you'd expect to come out of Candyman's mouth.Literally we were ten feet down the street, on the way to a restaurant, when someone jumped in his way and started yelling ""Candyman! Candyman! Candyman!"" He laughed a jovial chuckle, signed a quick autograph and I said, ""They told me you hated that movie and I shouldn't mention it.""He smiled and said, ""Look, the first one is great. The second one isn't bad. The third one? You gotta put your kids' in college. I'm always happy to talk about a movie that let me live the life I live today.""Of all the moments in my professional career, there is truly nothing quite like closing your eyes and hearing Tony Todd's deep voice intone your words.Thanks for indulging me. Back to Candyman.Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a Chicago graduate student researching urban legends. She learns of the Candyman, a demon that appears whenever you say his name five times into a mirror, at which point he'll stab you with the hook where his right hand once was. This tale is remarkably similar to the story of Mary Black from my rural hometown of Ellwood City, PA.She begins to investigate the murder of Ruthie Jean, a resident of the Cabrini-Green housing project who two cleaning ladies believe was killed by the Candyman. She's not alone - 25 other people have been killed in similar fashion.That night, Helen and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons, who was in Silence of the Lambs and would go on to direct The Caveman's Valentine) do the ritual, saying Candyman's name into a mirror. Nothing happens.As Helen begins her thesis: Candyman is a way to cope with the despair that Chicago's African-Americans feel as they struggle to survive in the projects. A professor shares the story of Candyman's origins, which begin with him as the son of a slave who would soon become free and known for mass-producing shoes. He grew up free and became an artist of some fame before marrying a white woman in 1890; however, her racist father hired a lynch mob that cut off his artistic hand, replaced it with a hook and smeared him with honey. The stings of bees nearly killed him before he was burned alive and his ashes scattered across he fields where the Cabrini-Green now exists.As part of her study of the legend, Helen meets Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa A. Williams, Melrose Place) and a young boy named Jake, who tells her the story of a young boy who was castrated by the Candyman. Helen is attacked by someone when she visits the scene of the crime but her attacker is human. He's arrested based on her testimony and the world thinks Candyman is gone.That night, as Helen is getting into her car, the real Candyman appears. She's made people think his legend isn't true and now innocent blood must be spilled so that he may survive. Helen wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood. The dog has been beheaded and her son is missing, so she attacks Helen, who is arrested by the police.At each turn, Candyman comes closer and closer to ending Helen's life as he snuffs out the existence of everyone around her. After she's committed for a month, a psychologist interviews her to see if she's fit for trial as she's suspected in the death of her best friend Bernadette. She offers to summon Candyman to the unbelieving doctor who is soon dead at the hands of the so-called urban legend. I love this scene, as the formerly disbeliving protagonist of this tale has willingly given in to the unreality that her world has become. As for her husband Trevor, he doesn't care at all - he's taken up with one of his students in her abscence.Helen runs to Cabrini-Green where she discovers murals depicting the lynching of the human being who would become the Candyman. He appears and tells her to surrender to save the life of the child, offering her immortality as he opens his jacket, revealing an open ribcage filled with bees. He believes that Helen is truly his lover Caroline Sullivan, reincarnated and ready to become immortal at his side.Candyman promises to release the child if Helen helps him incite more fear, but he decides that instead, he will set the entire projects on fire. She saves Anthony by shoving the monster into the flames of a bonfire before it takes her life too. The residents of the apartment building all attend her funeral, throwing numerous flowers and finally Candyman's hook into her grave.At the end, Trevor must face both grief and guilt in the mirror, where he says her name five times. As he turns, his wife has appeared, along with Candyman's hook. As we return to the projects, the graffiti of Candyman has been replaced by a woman with her hair on fire. Helen has now become part of the immortal world of folklore.The music for this film comes from minimalist composer Philip Glass, who was upset that the film came off as a low budget slasher. However, he told Variety in 2014, ""It has become a classic, so I still make money from that score, get checks every year.""Madsen is really amazing in this film and used hypnosis and a trigger word to make her even more frightened for her scenes with Todd. However, this process was too much for her so she didn't use it for the entire movie. The two actors also took ballroom dancing classes together to create an element of romance between their characters.There's a new Candyman film coming from Jordan Peele, which will be a spiritual sequel set in the gentrified neighborhood that has replaced the Cabrini-Green projects. Lakeith Stanfield of the movie Sorry to Bother You will star as the now-adult Anthony, a visual artist who begins to study the legend of Candyman. Thankfully, Todd will return, as who else can play this role? The film is currently untitled, but the working name has been Say My Name.",Candyman
16,Coventry,"Who wants candy now, huh? Didn't think so",8,6 October 2005,"A strong contender for the title of best horror film of the 1990's, Bernard Rose's ""Candyman"" is a very faithful (and therefore truly scary) adaptation of Clive Barker's skin crawling short story. This film features a very rare and successful combination of both creepy atmosphere and visual ingeniousness. Whereas most movies (especially during the 90's) can hardly focus on any of these essential horror elements, Bernard Rose masterfully succeeds in stuffing his film with genuine tension as well as shocking gore-images. The plot centers on doctoral student Helen (underrated actress Virginia Madsen in her best role) who becomes obsessed with the urban legend of a hook-handed killer that terrorizes the pauperized ghettos of the nearby Cabrini Green. Needless to say that the Candyman-myth gets a little too realistic for Helen, as everyone she comes into contact with ends up being brutally killed with a hook. The script is intelligent and always several steps ahead of you, the eerie musical guidance is brilliant and the make-up effects are fantastically gruesome. Tony Todd is ideally cast as the bogeyman, with his strong posture and  above all  incredibly frightening voice. The legend behind his character is staggering and it's beautiful to see how director Rose plays with the realism and surrealism of Barker's basic idea. Not many horror films of the 90's decade come with my highest possible recommendation, but this one definitely does. And don't forget, the Candyman CANrip you to pieces!",Candyman

Clive Barker's novel ""The Forgotten"" is the basis for this picture that shows a lot of style under the direction of Bernard Rose. This nightmarish tale is translated for the screen by the author and its director.The two principals, Helen, brilliantly played by the gorgeous Virginia Madsen, and Tony Todd, as the Candyman, enhance the picture. Ms. Madsen plays Helen the student finishing her thesis in urban legends. She makes the mistake of going to the projects to do some research, only to learn much more of what really happened at the scene of the crime. Helen tempts the Candyman. He comes back to haunt her as we discover that this is a story that is being replayed and must have a closure. Tony Todd makes a smashing appearance and runs away with the movie.The special effects are cleverly done. The brilliant costumes by Leonard Pollack add a touch of class to the proceedings. This is a film to watch with someone, as it can cause nightmares for a long, long time.",Candyman
19,Hey_Sweden,"What's blood for, if not for shedding?",8,3 June 2020,"Virginia Madsen is Helen Lyle, a graduate student doing her thesis on urban legends. She gets wind of a mythical character named Candyman (Tony Todd), the son of a slave, who is said to haunt the crime-infested Cabrini-Green housing project. In attempting to explore this myth, she fatefully opens a can of worms, with Candyman materializing and involving Helen in a series of extremely bloody killings.The 1990s are said by some horror fans to have been a lean time for the genre, but some gems still emerged from the decade, such as this adaptation (by writer / director Bernard Rose) of Clive Barkers' ""The Forbidden"". Originally set in Liverpool, its action is shifted to Chicago, and Rose explores the whole idea of faith vs. skepticism. Helens' dismissal of the Candyman story is what seals her doom, as it apparently draws away from the power that he holds over his faithful and those who would keep his legend enduring. It's an intelligent script with a large amount of very literate dialogue for Todd to utter. The film is also an absolute triumph of production design and gloomy atmosphere, and gets points for having adult characters as protagonists and villains instead of stereotypical, vapid teenagers.A word of warning that this is a VERY violent picture: lots of blood is indeed shed by the time of the chilling conclusion. Adding to the macabre imagery is the sight of bees swarming over characters.Todd really made the most of his role here, as it helped cement him as an icon of the genre. It's easy to overlook the fact that he doesn't actually have that much screen time; his first appearance occurs at around the 44 minute mark. But the lovely Madsen is likewise effective as the woman whose curiosity gets the better of her. Co-starring are Xander Berkeley as Helens' slimy husband, Kasi Lemmons as her best friend, and Vanessa Williams & DeJuan Guy as Cabrini-Green residents who give Helen some perspective on life in this neighbourhood. Rusty Schwimmer (Madsens' real-life good friend) and Ted Raimi have small roles.The music score by Philip Glass is incredibly haunting and is the perfect accompaniment to this sad yet intriguing fable, which to date has spawned two sequels and a remake.Eight out of 10.",Candyman

She then discovers a project called Cabrini-Green (an actual housing project in Chicago) has a number of residents who believe in the Candyman and think he's responsible for quite a few murders. She investigates and her life becomes a living hell when she finds out the Candyman (Tony Todd) is all too real.It sounds like just another stupid horror film but it isn't. It's based on a story by Clive Barker (who writes intelligent horror) and is written and directed by Bernard Rose who doesn't dumb down Barker's original story. The plot is complex and involving and downright disturbing when you find out the Candyman's origins. There's no humor or love story jammed in either. It concentrates on Helen and her increasing interest in the Candyman. The acting is superb. Madsen is just incredible in what must have been a difficult role. She's believable every step of the way. Todd became a horror icon because of this movie. He's tall, imposing and downright terrifying in his role. Hell, even his voice was scary! Also Kasi Lemmons is good as Bernadette, a friend of Helen. There is some extreme violence but only when it is needed. The score by Phillips Glass is powerful and helps the movie. It ends with a stupid ""it's not over"" ending but that's a small complaint. Great direction by Rose also. A depressing, bloody horror film but very well-done and intelligent. A 7 all the way.",Candyman

Despite its attempts to infuse the proceedings with elements of folklore, mysticism and even romance, the titular 'monster' is really no different than the stalker/boogeyman figure of traditional slasher films! Besides, while there are a few effective scares (especially the hook coming out of the mirror  the film is capped, then, by a CARRIE [1976]-like final shock) and considerable gore, Tony Todd's Candyman wasn't as scary or as exotic as I had been expecting; even worse, his would-be portentous dialogue is largely incoherent! However, the film has two definite assets in Philip Glass' simple but haunting main theme and the presence  in both senses of the word  of leading lady Virginia Madsen (surely one of the better female roles to emerge for this type of film in recent times). I'll still be checking out the first sequel at least, which I rented along with this one.",Candyman

She was completely believable as someone who never knew whether she was living a story or just imagining it.Tony Todd was the Candyman. He played the part perfectly.

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,True terror,7,26 January 2010,"I haven't read an awful lot by Clive Barker(including the story he wrote that this is based upon), but it isn't exactly a well-kept secret that he is one sick and twisted dude whose imagination produces utterly unforgettable visions of adult horror. He is one of the few people who heighten the genre to what it could and should be, refusing to go for the mediocrity of mainstream. This is not a slasher, although it can appear to be one at points. Candyman is carefully and expertly established and built up, and is thus infinitely more effective than all the monsters and killers that were not graced by a director who understands the importance of climax. The fact that Tony Todd adds volumes of creepiness as well as genuine charisma(!) to the role is also invaluable. This is immensely engaging and downright touching human picture. It is rather scary and unnerving. are the While the acting varies a tad, it is beyond reproach the majority of the places where it really matters. This has by far one of the most compelling performances and delivery by a child *ever*. I kid you not, he could outdo quite a lot of grown-ups who have greater experience than him just by virtue of the age difference. The concept is well-thought out and interesting. This has marvelous editing and the cinematography is nice. The tone is serious throughout, and this makes no excuses for it and does not try to broaden its appeal by adding comic relief. There are a couple of laughs to be had, and they're all well-integrated. This has a ton of sick and disturbing content, plenty of bloody and at times gory violence, infrequent mild to moderate language and brief nudity. I recommend this to any fan of the man who came up with this, and would say it is up there with the first Hellraiser as the best films made on his books. 7/10",Candyman

Much like the Bloody Mary legend, Candyman will appear to disembowel the unfortunate soul who summoned him. Or so it was supposed to work according to the legend repeated in the movie. For some odd reason it didn't quite work that way. And that was my problem.Candyman is a seven-foot, metaphysical black dude with a deep voice and a hook for his right hand. Is there a worse nightmare? While Helen (Virginia Madsen) and her friend, Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons) were pursuing urban legends Helen unwittingly summoned Candyman. Supposedly, she should have been gutted based upon that action but apparently Candyman needed her for other than practicing his sadistic art of blunt butchery. He somewhat explained his reasoning but it wasn't very convincing. Candyman was eerie, it was filthy at times, and also gory but not truly scary. Slashers aren't always scary, a lot of times they go for shock value and Candyman is no exception. Candyman got busy in his self titled movie but his actions were still a little baffling. Maybe that's part of Candyman's schtick: unpredictability.",Candyman
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Really entertaining and quite creepy,9,31 October 2014,"Researching material for her thesis papers, a grad student uncovers the local legend of a hook-handed serial killer who comes through mirrors and unwittingly summons him, forcing her to battle him to save her friends.This is one of the few good psychological horror films out there. One of these methods is that this gets the beginning of the film right, where it set up characters, introduces the villain and then go from there. There's plenty of suspense as the story about the Candyman is slowly unraveled piece-by-piece as one clue asks a question that another one answers, which leads to another question until the full history is perfectly explained. A lot of that is due to his being one of the more gruesome back histories in horror cinema, as the story is very original and induces plenty of chills throughout. We do get plenty of great jumps here, including classic gags as the person leaping out of the darkness to attack someone or the sight of the Candyman's hook-hand bursting forth from a mirror. Granted, there are others, but these two are some favorites that do make you jump. The frequent use of bees in the movie is also a great scare tactic, as this not only manages to tie it in effectively against the back-story but also utilizes a creature that many people are afraid of and the sight of them crawling from open wounds or from people's mouth makes you squirm as you sit and watch which is just utterly effective and enjoyable. Even the special effects used are great, as the final look of the Candyman is very well done and pretty graphic with an incredible aura of menace surrounding him, and the mystery is creative, imaginative, and pretty spooky. Tony Todd is perfectly cast in the role, as his brooding voice and intense presence make him the Candyman personified, making for one of the creepiest villains in horror history. He is one of the few types of slasher villains that loves to hack up his victims and produce as much blood as he can during the process. When he is unleashed and goes in his spree, it ignites a fire in the film with lots of bloodshed at his hook. His victims are hacked up in brutal ways, allowing for some great FX work as the bodies are shown in gruesome ways as there's a large amount of blood let loose in the film, which isn't until the end, but that is a great way to end the film. While all these manage to work for the film, the fact that the deaths probably could've come at a faster pace is really the only complaint here. He manages to get set free quite early and spends a long portion of time merely tormenting her rather than going directly after her which does tend to make this a little longer than it should in getting to the good points, but otherwise this one is quite fun and enjoyable.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",Candyman
27,The_Void,Creepy and effective Clive Barker horror,7,18 April 2006,"Based on the story 'The Forbidden' by Hellraiser writer and director Clive Barker, Candyman is another tale of people delving into places where they shouldn't delve and otherworldly evil. Rather than a demon from hell, the antagonist of this tale is an urban legend going by the name of Candyman. The mythology behind the story is one of the film's major plus points, and director Bernard Rose does a good job of building it. The mythology combined with what can only be described as a fetid atmosphere bode well together, and ensures that this film is both a creepy and absorbing tale of horror. The film follows a pair of University students; Helen Lyle and Bernadette Walsh doing a thesis on urban legends. They decide to research the modern day myth of 'Candyman', a figure who appears complete with a hooked hand to savage whomever stupid enough to say his name five times in front of the mirror. However, one of the duo starts to put a bit too much effort into the work, and ends up coming a cropper when Candyman decides to have his wicked way with her.The parts of the story that stand out the most are the relationship between the protagonist and Candyman, and the idea of a community of people believing in title character. However, this is where the film falls down to me. The scenes between Helen and Candyman put too much focus on the 'evil' dialogue, and the relationship is never really built upon. The urban legend theme is often touched upon, but we only meet a handful of characters that believe in the almighty Candyman, and they aren't in the film for long. The basis of the story follows Helen's bid for sanity, and while this provides an interesting backbone for the film - I really do think it could have been a lot better. The casting is largely good, with Tony Todd putting across an effective portrayal of Candyman, and Virginia Madsen delivering a believable performance as the film's victim. Xander Berkeley, who came to fame recently with a role in the first two series' of 24 rounds off the cast, which is under the direction of Bernard Rose. The only other film I've seen from him is Paperhouse, and Candyman is certainly a lot better than that. Although that isn't exactly difficult. Overall, this is a creepy and interesting film; but I can't say I'm a huge fan of it.",Candyman
28,christopher-underwood,Good idea with great moments but not a particularly rounded or satisfying film.,6,8 July 2019,"There are some impressive moments in this, not least the moving overhead shot of the highway beneath the opening credits and the awesome bee sequence towards the end. I was expecting rather more terrifying bee sequences though and inbetween great moments there is much that is mundane. Virginia Madsen does well in a difficult role but there is little active support around here, although the apparent mediocre acting could simply be down to a poor script. I tend to find that the more fantastical the action, the more chances there are for non-involvement by the audience. You may gasp at the spectacle but it is not personally involving and attention drifts awaiting the next 'big' moment without any real concern for the characters involved. The fine Glass score does not help this because it seems to add a classy, momentous shine to the proceedings they do not deserve and are somehow made less because of it. Good idea with great moments but not a particularly rounded or satisfying film.",Candyman
29,siderite,A 90's projects gothic that is uplifted by strong performances,8,7 September 2021,"Both Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen were great in this film, that's not on debate. However, leaving that aside, the movie is a bit of a mess. It's part criticism on how society treats the underprivileged, part slasher, part supernatural horror, part take on how people are manipulated by myths. One can bring everything about this film under the umbrella of mythology, and then it starts to make sense. Candyman's power is as strong as the belief in his existence, the price of apartments is as high as the belief they are worth something, love is as strong as the belief it is genuine, people are seen as human or not based on the belief that their skin or living quarters or status matters. Yet, this is a stretch.The truth is that Candyman's character doesn't make a lot of sense other than a random ghostly killer that functions based on arbitrary rules. From the moment she summons him, Helen doesn't really have any say or power in what happens until the very end, when she saves the magically surviving baby. All other characters are extras and the story itself is only marginally satirical. The reason why this film is so beloved is mostly down to the strong gothic feel of Cabrini-Green, always filmed in darkness and decay, like ruins of a castle, and the performances of the two main actors. It's a technical masterpiece, rather than a compelling story.Bottom line: still better than most horror movies out there.",Candyman

I gave it a low rating on IMDb and said it had creepy atmosphere. I think at the time I was just too disturbed by the film to recommend it - seriously, I'm not easily scared by movies, but this kept me on the edge and mentally disturbed me more so than most films do.It has some really shocking scenes that work less on a blood and guts level than on a psychological level. Not much is shown - Candyman is portrayed rather non-distinctly in misty flashbacks or hallucinogenic images that are downright eerie.The acting isn't great but it doesn't need to be. It works well for what it is - since when was the acting in ""Halloween"" really anything special? Overall this is a creepy, well-directed, atmospheric, scary film that will haunt you for a long time. Years later I've seen the sequels and admire this one even more.

33,Red-Barracuda,Maybe the classiest slasher film ever conceived,8,17 March 2012,"Candyman may very well be the most intelligent film to emerge from the slasher genre. Like A Nightmare On Elm Street before it, it has a supernatural killer from a netherworld who was killed by a mob of people and now comes back to the real world to enact a terrible revenge. However, where Freddie Krueger was a vile paedophile child killer, the Candyman was a black man killed for forming a sexual relationship with a white girl. So, a significant difference is that this is a slasher villain with a genuinely tragic back-story; he is a killer who is at once terrifying and poetic. This is one of the things that makes this film a somewhat unusual one of its type.It has a great sense of place too. The cold-looking Chicago setting is ideal, with the scenes in the projects especially well used. This aspect allows the movie to have an unexpected social-realist angle. The comparison between the squalor of the poor block with the one inhabited by the rich is done in an effective way. The social commentary isn't delivered in a ham-fisted way; it is just part of the story and seems quite natural. But of course this is a slasher film so how does it fare on that level? Well there are a number of gore-drenched scenes and several effective shock moments. The horror part of the film is certainly handled very well and it does have an effective and quite original killer.It has fine production values too. The haunting aerial photography is beautiful, while the score from Philip Glass is very evocative. Acting is universally good. Virginia Madsen as the principal character is great, while Tony Todd as the Candyman provides just the perfect balance of menace and melancholia. Candyman is a slasher film that offers up something different and, dare I say it, has some class. It's a very well executed horror film that also has other things to say as well. It's one of the strongest horror movies from the 1990's.",Candyman
34,lost-in-limbo,"A spooky, but also well thought out tale!",9,2 September 2005,"Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) doctoral student, and wife of a collage professor, is doing research on urban legends and mythological folklore for her school thesis. Though, there is one legend which gets her attention and leads her to rundown housing block where the residents believe that the murders that took place there were done by the hook-handed serial killer The Candyman (Tony Todd). A mysterious figure that can be summoned by repeating his name five times while looking in the mirror. Which Helen does and now her life turns into horrifying nightmare, which teeters between reality and myth, as she gets closer to the truth about the Candyman.Second time around and this memorable piece hasn't lost any of its effect. It's not only a incredibly brood horror film that manages to create an creeping/ingenious plot with such an unsettling physiological tone, but also providing some generally horrific shocks that creep up on you and aren't for the squeamish. So, it's far from your normal slasher and it just doesn't concentrate on the violence for a change. Not only does the plot build on this mystical legend constructively, but also there's also some solid social commentary on the mindset towards race and sex, which added more to this cleverly layered plot (or should I say tragic love story). What is so great about the screenplay is that you yourself feel apprehensive to what's happening to the protagonist and to where this story is heading by playing on what people believe and how these believes can overcome them. Plus it makes great use of the Chicago's gloomy surroundings. Not only does the film have substance, but also style to boot. The direction by Bernard Rose is quite brilliant, with Rose superbly mixing visuals that gel myth and reality superbly. Particularly the well-crafted encounters between Helen and the Candyman - these sequences were incredibly hair-raising. He creates such a glum and dark atmosphere within these rundown buildings filled with vibrant artwork, the richly layered aura goes hand-to-hand with the moody legend. The slow pacing of the film is perfect; there are no tedious blotches because you are totally wrapped in the story and by the delightful performances. The death toll isn't big, but there are some real gruesome deaths, with A LOT blood. The make-up and special effects are extremely thoughtful and inventive. Phillip Glass' extremely effective score deserves such high praise. Soothing, but also haunting and was incredibly effective towards building towards such an almighty blow. Another bonus was the smooth as silk camera-work; it captured the balanced layout of Chicago with plenty of stunning Ariel shots (great intro). Overall, I was just amazed by this beautifully planned production.What a horror icon! Tony Todd totally nails down such a terrifying and profound performance as the mythical being The Candyman. I believe this horror character totally wipes the floor clean of the other icons of its genre and who created him? No other than from the dark mind of Clive Baker (Hellraiser), who brings this frightening thriller alive, which is basically based on Baker's short story - The Forbidden. He came up with a unique horror character that's downright unnerving, completely authentic and has a lot of depth. But Tony Todd's towering figure and eerie voice has a lot to owe to that and to make one tremble in his presence! Virginia Madsen gives a stellar performance as Helen Lyle, who we really do care for her and feel what she is feeling. Good supporting roles from Xander Berkley as Helen's Husband, Kasi Lemmons as her friend/student who's also working with her their thesis and Vanessa Williams as Anne-Marie McCoy who lives in the rundown estate. The dialogue was packed with depth, but also laced with interesting topics and Todd's lines were pretty much poetic and smooth.The one and only ""small"" negative would be the ending for me. I was somewhat let down by the second ending and I thought maybe it could've done without it. It just felt tact on. Anyhow it didn't stop it from being damn right creepy and it does pack a real unsteadiness.To get in the mood of it, I say it's definitely a film to watch late at night alone.One of the clever horror films (if not the best) of that disappointing decade they call the '90s for horror films. If you're looking for a serious horror (before Scream's imitators made a mockery of the slasher sub-genre), I highly recommend this provocative slasher that doesn't cop out the audience.",Candyman
35,bowmanblue,A disturbing cult classic,7,10 July 2016,"'Candyman' has the 'honour' of being the first '18 certificate' film I ever saw at the cinema (when I was fifteen, incidentally). I was excited about the whole naughtiness about my experience, yet left pretty disappointed, even falling asleep midway through. Now, over twenty years later, I rewatch Candyman through adult's eyes. And I'm glad I did.Yes, it's probably not the sort of film you should watch when you're a fifteen year old who doesn't really appreciate cinema in general and just wants to watch wall-to-wall explosions and monsters sucking people's brains out through straws. I seem to remember appreciating the odd moment of gore in the film, but it wasn't enough for me then and I never thought of it as a 'horror.' However, it is pretty horrific, just in a different way. It's about a woman who's researching urban legends for her university. She hears of one about a hook-handed ghost called 'Candyman' who appears and kills you if you say his name in the mirror five times. And, yes, it does turn out to be a little more than just an urban legend. The more she discovers and the more she starts to believe, the worse things get for her – not just because she's found out that evil psychotic spirits are real, but she's increasingly classed as mad by those around her, leading to a complete collapse in her personal life.The psychological collapse is one aspect of the horror, but, like so many horror films, it's the baddie we all come to see. Tony Todd gives us his best performance ever (one which has cemented his place in horror villain history) as the titular spook and he is indeed creepy. He steals the scene every time and all, despite the lead actress' best efforts, is what people really want to see.It's also worth noting the general bleak atmosphere created in this world by simple shot composition with the camera picking up on the world around the characters in time with Phillip Glass' haunting soundtrack.Basically, if you're a fifteen year old who just wants 'lowest common denominator horror' (which I did at the time and occasionally still do) then there are plenty of films out there to fill that need. This one makes you think a little more and dig a little deeper, plus is damn good to boot. See it when you're in the mood to think and squeal at the same time. That scene with the bees is scarier than all the CGI insects Nicholas Cage has pretended to swallow in his life.",Candyman
36,ericstevenson,Works well as a thriller,8,21 October 2017,"This slasher flick introduces us to a character that didn't quite get popular but still has some relevance. The Candyman is a villain who can be summoned by saying his name five times in a mirror. Oddly enough, he actually isn't summoned quite that much that way. I really do like this actor and especially love his deep voice. This is a film that knows how to create atmosphere. We get some really great music and a very unique approach to the genre. I admit that I'm confused as to why he's called the Candyman. He has nothing to do with candy at all.He attacks with a hook hand and uses bees. Nothing candy related there. At first, it seems like he's just an ordinary person but this was apparently just someone taking on his persona or something. The setup is very nice too. There's a lot of little things to notice in this movie, especially at the very end. I really love the early parts where they're talking about urban legends.

Movie after which the mirror in the dark will be one of the most horrible things that you might encounter. Story is intelligent, which is rarity in this genre, psychologically and sociologically well-founded, and together with fantastic Virginia Madsen in the lead role and excellent direction and music, it builds an atmosphere where explicit scenes are not necessary to maintain horror and tension at a high level. Perhaps the film would be even better without gore. Within the genre, this film is perfection and it's one of the rare films that I remember in detail for decades after watching. I just saw it again after more than twenty years and it thrilled me like the first time.9/10",Candyman

Virginia Madden is such an incredible actress I absolutely her performance! Delighted with how everything occurs some of it is even shocking which I always appreciate.

41,paulclaassen,A Classic!,6,28 April 2020,"""Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. Candyman. Candyman"". No, I did not say this whilst standing in front of a mirror.This is an interesting concept and an antagonist with a good back story. In fact, I found the back story so interesting, I think it will make a wonderful prequel movie. I enjoyed Helen (Virginia Madsen) - a fearless, strong and determined character. There are very few actresses who can still look sensual when covered in blood. Virginia Madsen - with her vintage 60s look - is such an actress. She did the character justice.The acting in general is very good. Despite being a horror movie, 'Candyman' is also an interesting mystery thriller, with added drama in the form of infidelity. Helen faces more than she bargained for as her life completely falls to pieces, resulting in excellent character development - so well portrayed by Madsen. Tony Todd was also well cast as Candyman, with his big physique and deep voice. He lent an eeriness to the film, and really owned the character.The film might not have the ending one hopes for, but maybe more realistic this way, with a good climax. 'Candyman' features an unusually beautiful score for this type of film.",Candyman

Soon they will find themselves on a mysterious path that they would wish not to be there.I liked this movie because it has a mysterious plot, full of interesting scenes and some very good interpretations. The direction which was made by Bernard Rose was nice and he presented pretty good the myth behind Candyman without revealing some very important information, something that created a mystery behind his name and what he can do. The interpretation Virginia Madsen who played as Helen Lyle was good and she made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Todd's who played as The Candyman, Xander Berkeley's who played as Trevor Lyle and Kasi Lemmons' who played as Bernadette Walsh. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Candyman"" is a nice thriller movie and I recommend you to watch it.",Candyman
43,BaronBl00d,Float Like a Butterfly and Sting Like a Bee-Hive,5,15 January 2005,"OK, Candyman has a very intriguing premise behind it. Apparently an urban legend abounds that this killer known as the Candyman will come behind you when you say his name five times and gut you with his hook. A grad student and friend investigate the legend and find some tangible evidence of his existence. From there on, we, as the audience, are treated to some plot twists involving Virginia Madsen(as the grad student)seeing Candyman - perhaps in reality that only she is privy to or in her dreams or in some other psychological state. What we do know is that murders take place and Madsen is involved somehow. My take on the film is a somewhat mixed one. As with much of Clive Barker's work(this film is based on his novel The Forbidden), I am always a step behind understanding what is exactly going on. Some viewers don't seem to mind that and even embrace it as some type of genius or something. I must confess I do not. Barker's story definitely has flair and there are many memorable scenes in the movie - many of which will make you take a good jump. Director Bernard Rose is a good director creating some truly innovative and evocative scenes. The Chicago tenements are treated with a most frightening realism. Tony Todd makes a scary bogeyman as he portrays the Candyman. And Madsen does a nice job(with a needless nude scene thrown in just in case you lose interest). But I just found the plot too far out there for me to really enjoy the film. Bees were filled in a toilet seat in a disgusting filthy restroom outside...why? I had lots more questions along that vein. The ending did not match the first three quarters of the film in terms of continuity or realism. The film has quite a following, and in large part I can see why - but just don't agree. For me Candyman is neither a good film nor a bad one. Just average.",Candyman

47,videorama-759-859391,Hell for Madsen,6,7 January 2018,"Here's an ambitious film who's first half, has so much going for it, but falls into stupidity and predicability in the other. It does have an intriguing serial killer/supernatural thriller theme, and our killer is in full view, but his contraption of death is stupid, bringing back moments of Jame's Wood's severed hand in Videodrome. Madsen is a really good actress, and her performance here is very good, as a budding criminal psychology student whose much older husband, is of course, a lecturer on the subject, and doing a much younger, hotter student. Even the stupid, predictable cliched ending, tries to desperately redeem it's faults. The candyman is a mythical figure in he projects, where all the brothers truly believe in his existence, where campfire stories have been told around the city. Madsen, poking her nose in many places it's not wanted, trespassing on the candyman's territory, the tall black dude (Tony Todd) retaliates, setting Madsen, up for his new murders, where of course, blame and evidence, weighs heavily on her, other than the mythical evil figure, which is basically the movie's second half. It's as if the movie short sheets itself, and suffers badly. This was so a disappointment, where the murders show over exploited and grisly and crime scenes. Though not a badly made film. Sad, as in Madsen's twist too, that is quite effective.",Candyman

He's not mindless like Jason Voorhes, wise-cracking like Freddy Krueger, and he's not silent like Micheal Myers. Candyman(Tony Todd) is creeeepy! Having a hook hand in place of a stump is kind of like a salty old pirate, only kicked-up more. Going through the gullet is really nerving. The way he kills sends shivers down the spine. When discovering the fiend goes further, the victim is blamed. And what's worse Helen's(Virginia Madsen) boyfriend cheats on her while she was being detained. At least she got some redemption and revenge after she rescues the baby from a fire. The Candyman hook can in really handy after her boyfriend says her name three times. You can just say that his own guilt got him killed. A best weapon for cheating lovers. This movie is leave you on the edge of your seat fun.

It was film where the villain taunts its main character as he makes her life hell so his legend can live on.

51,Polaris_DiB,Imperfect but tightly controlled shocker cum social engagement,8,11 February 2010,"DEAR LORD how has nobody forced me to see this earlier? I knew it was a cult classic horror film, but I had no idea it was going to be so good! The story here is a very intriguing and, in my opinion, amazing mix of social abjection. The ""abject"" is defined as that which transcends boundaries, and in this case a very clear boundary is drawn between urban white and black neighborhoods by a freeway, but their interaction is broken through the very boundary between reality and the supernatural. A woman investigating urban legends comes across a local superstitious belief in Candyman, an Emancipation era black man who broke the social rules of the time by falling in love with a white woman, thus honeyed to be stung to death by bees and burned to ash. A century later the Candyman wreaks vengeance upon society by being called five times from a mirror, and that legend is used generally to keep the local kids in urban-area Illinois to respect the undercurrent of racism contained in those communities. Well this woman goes and forces her way into the black neighborhood shortly after breaking the rules and calling Candyman, and since her skepticism and general outreach has people engaging with her and her studies of ""urban legend"", the Candyman finally appears and demands the blood of innocents to continue the power of fear and vengeance--while also forcing the woman to join in his quest for spilled blood. And it only gets more delightful from there.This movie is by no means perfect, but the sheer sincerity of its message and audacity of its style stands it head and shoulders over more dramatic movies of the same theme and horror movies with pretense towards such social engagement. Some of the characters are, indeed, stereotypical, but mostly they're well-written enough to illicit some form of sympathy all around. The Candyman's dialog is absolutely ridiculous, but it's easy to ignore when his relationship to both the world and the woman is so very clear. And this is a Clive Barker idea, which means blood, feces, and insects have to literally saturate the walls, which is both incredibly effective and randomly kitsch. Heck, it's not even really clear how the whole baby being killed but actually being alive thing works, but you know what? I'm not complaining, this movie is pure 100% enjoyable with a clear social statement. That's harder to pull off than it seems, and many directors try and in the very act of trying try to hard, but this movie is very clear the limits of its statements and its storyline, and keeps things structured tight and clean.--PolarisDiB",Candyman
52,dee.reid,"Dare you say his name five times... ""Candyman""",10,9 October 2004,"Undoubtedly one of the more original and frightening horror movies of the early 90s, Bernard Rose's ""Candyman,"" an adaptation of famed author Clive Barker's ""The Forbidden,"" stands well on its own as an effectively creepy film.I was only about six or seven when I first heard the terrifying ""Bloody Mary"" legend, which was similar to the Candyman legend. And I'm sure others have heard stories about alligators in the sewer or the hesitant 911 operator. Indeed, the ""Candyman"" and ""Bloody Mary"" legends do share some common ground, in that if you chant their names before a mirror ""x"" number of times, they'll appear behind you and hack you to pieces.I used to believe in these legends - when I was kid - but as I grew older, I realized that they're just legends and therefore aren't meant to be taken literally. But that's the central dilemma with 1992's ""Candyman"": If you believe in something enough, will that belief make fiction reality?The Candyman (Tony Todd) has claimed responsibility for a series of grisly slayings in a particularly rough Chicago housing project, and Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is anxious to discredit the myths. But when she is falsely accused of several brutal murders, could the Candyman be out for revenge, because she doubted him?I'll admit upfront that I'm not familiar with the works of Clive Barker, who is clearly one of the most talented writers of the last 20 years. Only this film and ""Hellraiser"" have been able to capture my interest, unfortunately. ""Candyman"" is certainly a terrifying experience from start to finish, as you can't really be sure if the hook-handed spectral entity of the title actually exists in the physical world.10/10",Candyman

The storyline for this picture tells the tale of some students doing an essay on urban legends in areas suffering from poverty. Unfortunately for these students they discover some urban legends may be true. This movie is directed by Bernard Rose (Paperhouse) and stars Tony Todd (The Rock), Virginia Madsen (Dune), Ted Raimi (Clear and Present Danger) and Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2). The storyline for this film contains wonderful character development both of the ""hero"" and the ""villain"" leaving the audience to not be able to wait for those two worlds to collide. I absolutely love the Raimi opening sequence to set the tone for the movie. The soundtrack with the piano and organ is outstanding. The Candyman's dialogue and poetry like communication style is magnificent. I felt bad for Madsen's character who seemed to have a bad day every day in this film, though Trevors new girl was a good pick . Also, how can you not love the use of bees ? Absolutely awesome. The kill scenes also have the right elements of gore. The intensity for those scenes are set up so well by the neighborhood randoms the main characters interviews along the way.

55,GiraffeDoor,Has anyone else said it's a miracle or two yet?,7,16 December 2020,"A glance at the trivia tells me this movie is a lot more nuanced than i gave it credit for.But even then I was pleasantly surprised at this lurid urban folk tale, itself about the way lore has a way of living deep within us which i know sounds a bit lame (horror about the idea of scary fiction itself? pass...) but this time they really do it well.The Candyman is a formidable horror villain whose power lies in the very human evil and victimhood that is part of his identity. It is indeed a very worldly terror that fuels this movie as we live through false accusation, gang warfare and that helplessness one feels during the police procedure and it plays off the fantasy elements superbly.Realized with a campy lyricism inheritied from the '80s, a lot of horror classics seem to maintain their fanbase through nostalgia but this was a very vivid find with tons of images you won't forget and also isn't to cowardly to really...go there, you know? No one gets a free pass. Everyone is in danger.The ending very much respects its audience even if it maybe gives them a bit too much credit.Also: I never knew Phillip Glass scored this! (albeit under false pretences).",Candyman
56,Foreverisacastironmess123,Sweets to the sweet,10,31 October 2019,"What a great classic horror picture this is, I'm pretty sure I loved it from the first time I ever watched it. So the story of this follows a grad student named Helen Lyle as she seeks to write a thesis on urban legends at the university of Illinois, focussing on the spooky local legend of Candyman, which is about a hook-handed man who butchers anyone who dares to speak his name in a mirror five times, and as she delves deeper, Helen is caught up in a frightening web of supernatural horror that blurs the line between fantasy and reality, and as she gradually loses everything in her life and spirals into a bloody madness she is tormented by the illusive spectre of Candyman who has chosen her as the object of his obsession and undying love, and she comes to learn the terrible truth of both him and the legacy of fear that keeps him alive... Virginia Madsen was so freaking excellent in her role of the tortured Helen, she really threw herself into it and more than held her own during some pretty scary and harrowing sequences, and in the end her character is as tragic as Candyman himself as she ends up becoming a grisly new chapter of the urban legend she only wanted to know the truth about. I find the scene of the graven image of her as it slowly draws into her eyes as the credits roll to be beautiful, tragic, and chilling, she was once just an innocent regular woman, but after going through hell and ultimately dying and redeeming herself in the eyes of others, who she really was fades into legend as she becomes another lost spirit to be whispered of and fearfully told tales about... That's probably what drew me into the story from the beginning, it's connection to urban legends. Folklore is so fascinating and I loved how Candyman himself took different elements from different urban legends, like Bloody Mary and the Hook Man. I also loved the gritty urban setting, an area of Chicago that was full of crime and poverty, and that setting and the atmosphere of it was so fantastic because it set a tone that felt so grim and so real and that enhanced the film a lot in its own way. It's a cold hard place that's horribly neglected and falling apart and in the midst of this urban desolation Candyman's dark legend came to be. I love the early overhead shot that shows the sprawling university campus from above and how from that angle it has a strange gothic look that's almost like a temple no one can see, the extraordinary emerging from the seemingly ordinary. Also hugely of note is the music score which is so majestic and funereal and gives the film a wealth of added atmosphere as well as a unique feel, never underestimate a film's music! I also bloody well loved Tony Todd as that character, who ever didn't? He's so brilliant and powerful, I still think it's his best role. He conveyed such an ominous lethal nobility combined with such a brutal horror, he's a walking horror for sure, but you can see the faded grandeur of what he was in life... He was a man once who was cruelly murdered at the hands of a racist mob after falling in love with the plantation owner's daughter, and now exists only as revenant that keeps his legend alive in fear and blood. One of the most genuinely chilling scenes is when you hear the ghastly story of a little boy in a bathroom... He's forceful and unnerving just by his ethereal voice which sounds like it's right in your head instead of coming out of his mouth and his mesmerising eyes, he's horror and tragedy combined in such an amazing way, and such a mighty and iconic horror character to this day. Candyman is a frighteningly effective slow burning horror opus that's rich in atmosphere and is gripping and thought provoking on several levels, it's a haunting and satisfying film but not because of any gore, but through the emotion and the resonant themes that are explored. Fantastic, one of the very best horror gems of the 90s and a pitch perfect classic that I will always love.",Candyman
57,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Eerie, haunting horror Classic",9,2 July 2015,"Candyman is still one of the few horror films that scares me in the primal, flight or flight way that puts a chill down my spine. Interesting, considering that on paper the idea is more in the vein of shocker and gory slasher stuff, which is the last thing that scares me, movie wise. Threason this one triumphs over so many: atmosphere. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the most important thing in a horror flick is atmosphere. This one jumps at you with an ambient, dilapidated, forgotten ghetto aura that stays with you. It takes place is Chicago's sketchy Cabrini Green, a run down project and breeding ground for filth, poverty and despair. An urban legend circulates about the Candyman, a tortured slave who returned from the dead with a hook hand to wreak havoc, brought about by saying his name 5 times while looking into a mirror. Virginia Madsen plays a determined woman who investigates this, much to her dismay. Tony Todd is a velvet voiced, imposing, terrifying gentleman as Daniel Robitaille, the ghost of the former slave, and the titular Candyman. He bites into his role with a malevolent grace and all knowing mirth that jumps out of the screen at you, creating a horror legend and archetype that would carry on for two vastly inferior but interesting sequels. Like I said, few horror films can really frighten me, but this one has that magical eerie spark that's so hard to capture, but does the trick, causing you to leave the lights on in bed after watching it.",Candyman
58,drownnnsoda,A contemporary elegiac masterpiece,10,12 July 2006,"Grad student Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and her peer Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons) investigate urban legends as a part of Helen's thesis project; in doing so, they uncover the lore of the ""Candyman"", a slave executed during the 18th-century and who wields a hook for a hand. Helen makes the mistake of invoking him, but it seems her destiny has been leading her to him all along.There are a handful of horror films made post-1990 that have entered the canon of the ""great horror"" films, and ""Candyman"" is certainly one of them. Based on Clive Barker's short story ""The Forbidden,"" this take relocates the story to inner-city Chicago, examining race and social inequities as opposed to the source material's analysis of the English class system; it's a bold move, but a sensible one, and allows for perhaps a more nuanced exploration.While the film is full of grotesque violence and has a handful of frightening scenes, it's really honestly more beautiful than it is horrific-the cinematography is fantastic, and Philip Glass's musical score is absolutely sublime. Tony Todd carries the film as the titular antihero, and evokes profound sadness as much as he does terror. Virginia Madsen plays counterpoint as the inquisitive, headstrong academic who finds herself pulled into his legend through forces beyond her understanding. Xander Berkeley plays supporting as Helen's leering professor husband, and Kasi Lemmons plays her best friend/confidant.The film builds toward a conclusion that is harrowing and simultaneously beautiful, ending on a note that leaves one wondering if they've just witnessed a Greek tragedy or an outright slasher film; the answer is probably somewhere in-between, but the film is an exquisite achievement nonetheless. 10/10.",Candyman
59,lukem-52760,AN ATMOSPHERIC 90'S HORROR MASTERPIECE,10,23 January 2020,"1992's CandyMan is a stone cold Classic of the Horror genre, it's one of the only Horror films that terrified me growing up & i grew up a massive Horror movie buff, there's something about it's powerful Atmosphere of absolute desperation, dread & despair that is constant throughout the movie. CandyMan is based on a Myth or Urban Legend about a Hooked handed Supernatural Killer who would appear & murder you if you looked into a mirror & said his name 5 times!!! You gotta be stupid to do that right lol, but our main lead of this extremely dark Horror is that of ""Helen"" who is intrigued by the Legend & sets out to investigate it's superstition & roots which takes her into the dark ,desperate & dangerous Urban Decay of Chicago's worst Ghetto Cabrini Green.
Virginia Madsen is excellent as Helen, she's a good person that can't help finding all the mythical stories so fascinating & needs to know more!!!
Also her best friend ""Bernadette"" played by Kasi Lemmons is also a great character who helps her on her quest.
Of course the deep voiced & scary as hell ""CandyMan"" is played by the fantastic Tony Todd who is now iconic for his sinister role here.
The music score is beautiful & very sad & unsettling all at the same time, the look & cinematography is really richly textured & also very moody & urban gritty, you can feel the cold graffiti covered hallways of the scary & infamous Cabrini Green housing projects, those scenes in the building are so intense & scary as this place is an urban nightmare world in a building that truly was real & filmed there!!! Chicago is captured beautifully as well as scarily on film, we see some lovely places but mostly the dark urban decay of the city in it's bleak winter setting, it's a powerful & extremely well made Horror film that has it's roots set in the real world problems of poverty & crime in the low income projects of Chicago & basically all over America too.
There's such a gritty realism to everything on screen that when the supernatural Killer strikes & slaughters someone it feels strikingly raw & viscous, the kills are very bloody & gory & a darkness hangs over the whole movie.
CandyMan is definitely a Horror masterpiece from the 90's & it also spawned an equally excellent sequel in 1995 called ""CandyMan: Farewell To The Flesh"" & it's an excellent sequel & a powerful origins story to the mythical CandyMan.
Both Classy well made & beautiful looking Horror films!!!",Candyman

Madsen was good in her role, all the actors were really, but the writing, action sequences, and plot suffers from just being boring and uninteresting. The gore factor is there, which is something I don't care for, but everything from being gutted to seeing a dog's severed head. Where Candyman came from is talked about and explored, so there is some background, which I did like, good to know why he's the villain and what he's after.

But Helen gets more than she bargained for when Candyman turns out to be decidedly real and starts slaying those around her... You wouldn't think there could BE anything scarier than that festering housing project, but Candyman--sort of a black Freddy Krueger, only with a hook hand, and handsomer, suaver and less humorous--certainly turns out to be so. This movie thus becomes a fairly intense experience; genuinely creepy and not a little unpleasant. It is also more than a little gory, and certainly not for the squeamish viewer. The premise of the picture is a fascinating one, although by the conclusion, things get a bit confused; I'm still unclear on three or four plot points. Philip Glass' eerie piano-and-strings score adds greatly to the creepy atmosphere, but perhaps the single best aspect of the film is Virginia Madsen in the lead role. What a terrific actress she is...and easy on the ol' blinkers, too! Not surprisingly, she is an even better actress today, 15 years later; surprisingly, she is more beautiful today than ever. (Check her out in the recent, excellent film ""Sideways"" if you don't believe me.) It is difficult for me to give a blanket recommendation for ""Candyman,"" ugly, violent and downbeat as it is, but for red-blooded horror fans (and I do mean red-blooded), this may just be their cup of (Red Zinger) tea. Oh...and watch out for that shrink scene...",Candyman
64,Jonny_Numb,Barker's distinctive voice is present...but nary a likable character,5,10 July 2007,"I haven't read 'The Forbidden,' the Clive Barker short story on which ""Candyman"" is based, but I can only wonder if that bit of prose contains a magical element that didn't make it into the film. Some hail this as one of the best horror films of the last decade; yet as I watched it, I found myself desperately wanting to like it (as I have liked Barker's uniquely out-there directorial outings), but in the end, could not. Adapter/director Bernard Rose successfully captures the hallucinatory elegance of Barker's text in this tale of a black man murdered for his affair with a white woman at the turn of the 20th century, only to haunt the housing projects of Chicago's Cabrini Green. The notion of personifying an urban legend is pretty clever, yet the Candyman (Tony Todd) comes across as a deep-voiced, hook-handed spouter of nonsensical mumbo jumbo. But the biggest problem lies in Virginia Madsen's character--as the bourgeois wife of an unfaithful college professor (Xander Berkeley), she spends the first hour as an icy, competitive, arrogant, and generally unlikeable human being; by the time she's committed to a mental ward and we actually begin to sympathize with her, the movie is nearly over, and it's simply too little, too late. Regardless of the 'symbolic' juxtaposition of the superstitious, poverty-stricken blacks of the Green against the overly-confident, well-off white population, even horror movies need an anchor we can place our trust in, and no character in ""Candyman"" comes close. That being said, the production design is wonderful, and Rose does build some suspense, even if the payoff is never that scary. Try as the producers might, the Candyman never comes close to being an iconic horror character in the 'Universal Monsters' mold (though many sequences directly/indirectly quote the original ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"").",Candyman
65,aidanratesmovies,An amusing horror flick,9,23 June 2020,"Although not terribly scary, Candyman earns its place as one of the classic creepy films of the 1990's, and proves to be rather interesting throughout. The film is cleverly directed, despite having some obvious predictable elements behind its average horror movie script. Virginia Madsen makes a surprisingly good lead as Helen Lyle, a character who she plays to the absolute best of her abilities, despite the writing flaws. The true star of the show though, besides Madsen, is Tony Todd as the Candyman himself- who may go a bit over the top with his lines- but is truly one thing the movie does rather well. His performance is iconic, and he steals every moment he has on screen, which I found very impressive and very amusing to watch for a horror villain. Some films make the villains rather stupid, but even though there are some flaws when it comes to the Candyman himself, he is a very interesting character to follow. The film does struggle to overcome cliches at times, but hurdles over them nevertheless, and even though the film is not super entertaining, it can be quite amusing to watch at times, and interesting to see develop. In the end, Candyman is a slightly better than average horror flick that I recommend to any horror film buffs who haven't viewed it yet.
My Rating: 8/10",Candyman
66,truemythmedia,Urban Legends,6,17 October 2019,"Most of this story is rather generic when you think about it in terms of telling an urban legend story (Candyman is essentially Bloody Mary), but it's in talking about the fact that the Candyman is an urban legend that the writing elevates this film. There are a few scenes where the Candyman approaches Helen and speaks to her in a dreamlike manor, telling her that if he comes with her and dies, she will live forever in the minds of those who remember her story. I actually really love the themes that this sort of hints at: the idea that the creator of a story, even the subject of a story can be mortal, but the story itself takes on a life of its own and becomes something more, something immortal. Those kinds of themes are addressed a few more times throughout the film, and though those themes might seem out of place in a slasher film, it actually works quite well.",Candyman
67,masonsaul,Great horror,8,31 August 2020,"Candyman is a great horror that's tense, disturbing and relevant. Virginia Madsen gives an incredible lead performance and Tony Todd is perfect and terrifying. Xander Berkley and Kasi Lemmons are both great. Bernard Rose's direction is fantastic, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Philip Glass is excellent. However, it's brought down slightly by too many false jump scares in the first act.",Candyman
68,a_chinn,Visually striking Clive Barker adaptation from director Bernard Rose,8,24 December 2019,"One of the better film adaptations of a Clive Barker story tells the tale of a university doctoral candidate, Virginia Madsen, researching the origin of an urban legend about a killer named The Candyman who if you say his name into a mirror will appear behind you and kill you. What they discover is more than a simple Freddy Krueger style unstoppable killer, but something far more unsettling. Outside of Barker's own adaptations of his own work, writer/director Bernard Rose does the best of any filmmaker in capturing the horror and also the grotesque beauty of Barker's bloody horror. ""Candyman"" has an elegance that's missing from most Barker adaptations, even the good ones like ""Midnight Meat Train,"" and bringing a hypnotic dream-like quality that's a nearly hallucinatory film experience. A haunting Phillip Glass score, which stands among the finest horror film scores of all time, adds to the film's hypnotic nature. An interesting difference between Candyman compared to other slasher icons is that he's a tragic figure and not simply a mindless killing machine, ALA Jason Voorhees or Michael Meyers. He's a frightening killer for sure, with a hook for a hand and crawling in bees, but his origin story makes the audience actually feel bad for him. Other horror films have tired to generate sympathy for their villains, and more often than not it it doesn't work (i.e. Freddy in the failed Elm Street reboot or Pinhead in the terrible sequels Barker had nothing to do with). Another notable difference with Candyman is that he's played by a serious actor, Tony Todd (""Platoon"" ""The Man from Earth""), versus the usual stuntmen who play most horror faceless killers. Todd evokes both pathos and terror in equal amounts. As far as acting, Virginia Madsen gives a solid performance, although is nowhere as memorable as Todd's imposing screen presence. Also of note, character actor Xander Berkeley has a memorable supporting role as Maden's smarmy college professor husband. Overall, ""Candyman"" is the best Clive Barker film adaptation that Barker did not direct himself.",Candyman
69,Reviews_of_the_Dead,One of the Best Horror Films of the 90's,9,15 February 2019,"This film is one that took me awhile to see all the way through. I would catch it in parts on the movie channels. It was most likely in college that I did. I've now seen it a few times with one of the times at the Gateway Film Center for their Horror 101 series as well as with Jaime in prep for the remake/sequel version coming out. The synopsis here is The Candyman (Tony Todd), a murderous soul with a hook for a hand, is accidentally summoned to reality by a skeptic grad student researching the monster's myth.This begins with Helen Lyle (Virigina Madsen) interviewing a student. She is asking about an urban legend killer named the Candyman. We see the story as she claimed it was played out. The boy that comes over is Billy (Ted Raimi). They say Candyman into the mirror 5 times and the girl is murdered. Helen then meets with her friend of Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) who is interviewing a male student who tells a similar story. This is their thesis project on urban legends.Helen then goes to a classroom, where Trevor (Xander Berkeley) is teaching a class on urban legends. He is married to Helen and she is annoyed with him for teaching this lecture. It seems there was a promise not to. During this as well, Helen notices a student who seems interested in Trevor and won't look her in the eye.Later while Helen is working, a janitor comes into the room and overhears the taped interview about Candyman. She relays that her friend knows about this killer and goes to get her. What she relays is much different from what she has gotten from the students. There was a murder in a local project called Cabrini-Green. This causes Helen to search out newspapers about what happened to Ruthie Jean.She tells her plan to Bernie, which is to go to this project and take pictures as well as interview anyone that will talk to them. Bernie is against this, feeling they are exploiting the dead woman. She also doesn't want to go there as it is a rough place. The gangs run it and the police don't tend to respond quickly.Despite her fears, the two women find the apartment and take pictures of the building as they go. Interesting enough, Helen's condo was built like this project building. She knows that if they didn't correct the issue behind the bathroom mirrors in hers, then it should create a passageway here. We see that she is right and goes through. She comes across a mural of a man with an open mouth and a gift of candy.As the two women go to leave, they are confronted by Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams). She lives here and knew the victim. She agrees to talk with the two women. She was one that called the police during the attack. She has a young son and doesn't like where she lives, but has to survive.Helen also goes back to the project and is attacked. She convinces a boy who helps her, Jake (DeJuan Guy), that Candyman isn't real. There is a killer here using this name and striking fear in the residents. There also could be a supernatural entity here that dates back long before Cabrini-Green was built. This is true horror as The Candyman, targets her.As I said in my opening, I've seen this film a few times all the way through, with one of my last viewings at the Gateway Film Center. To be honest, I believe I've caught more of the sequel more as it feels like it was always on one of the movie channels growing up. I do believe I caught at least part of it in college during the summer or FrightFest on AMC in October.What I will say, I do enjoy this movie and it gets better with each watching. This falls into the supernatural slasher category for me, but not necessarily in the traditional sense. This brings a bit of A Nightmare in Elm Street, in that Candyman is like Freddy Kruger, he needs the fear of people to exist. He tells Helen to be his victim and I think that is great. When she ruins the killer in the project, people don't believe in him. He needs her to take that place. What doesn't work for me though is her being what his lover looked like in the past. This could be part of the story from Clive Barker, The Forbidden, or taken from something like Dracula. I don't think it is needed though.Something that works for me as well is this film could almost be viewed that Candyman might not be real. No one ever sees him until they are murdered, so that could be that Helen is doing the killings. We see her slipping into madness and blacking out, two things that could point to her being the killer. The ending might need to be disregarded for this reading, but as a horror film, it comes with the genre. I think the story is great that it can be read as a supernatural killer or a woman with a psychotic break.Next, I'll take this to the social commentary which is the racial issue that this brings up. Now I'll admit, I've never been to Chicago, but this movie doesn't play up it is there. What the film does well with the setting is showing us two different worlds. We have Helen and Bernie. They are graduate students doing research. To show the duality, we get to meet characters like the two women working at the college, Anne-Marie or Jake. The condo that Helen lives in is like Cabrini-Green; just the project is more rundown. Helen and Bernie explain the gentrification that happened as well as the natural barrier as to why Cabrini-Green was built. Showing how different the worlds are, when Ruthie was being killed, the police don't show up until after. When Helen is attacked, the police show up much faster.What I will say after having viewed this a few times, I do feel there is a bit of an issue with the ending. I love the set up we have here. We get to know our characters and we see that they're out to prove themselves. I like Helen interfering and thinking she has helped the projects. We see that isn't the case. I'm even down for Candyman to mess with her. My problem though is the movie feels like it loses its way when she gets back to Cabrini and seeks out Candyman. I don't like how it ends personally and it is lackluster in the defeat of the villain.The acting in this film though is good which I think helps it a lot. Madsen is solid in her role. She is so sure and in control of herself in the beginning. The moment she meets Candyman though, she loses that and we see her slipping into madness. Something that goes with it, she is pushed to try to prove she isn't crazy and the lengths she goes is believable. It isn't that much different from her trying to prove her thesis. Todd doesn't get a lot of screen time until about the middle of the film, but his screen presence is great. He is perfect for this role. Berkeley is such a jerk as Trevor and from the beginning makes you wonder about his commitment to Helen. It is hard to believe he's telling the truth. It also feels like he's not helping her mental state. I also thought that Lemmons, Williams and Guy were solid in their supporting roles as well.Now I have to say that the effects in this film were good. Everything looked to be practical which if you know me, I love. The blood looked good. I thought the hook and Todd's chest looked real. The bees that cover him and Madsen were real, which adds another layer. If I do have something else to add here would be the cinematography. I think we get some great set ups for shots. The editing works well here as well.I also thought the score to the film was great. The score is much more gothic which keeps the project an even creepier feel, matching it almost to the castles of Europe in a way. I love the choir used for the film and there is one recurring tune that is quite haunting. It is one I listen to on a regular basis, especially the theme.Now with that said, I would recommend this film. It is a supernatural slasher film in a sort, but I feel it is much more than that. I feel it could almost be read as a woman who is losing her mind, murdering people yet believing it is a man who is haunting her with visions. The acting of the film is good, which helps to build this feeling. The effects of the film were also well done. The editing and the score also helped for this film to have not only a creepy, but a surreal feel. Candyman is a solid entry into the horror genre as an icon. This is a good film and worth a viewing. One of the best from the 90's for sure.",Candyman
70,Samiam3,Scary and intriguing but somewhat incomplete,6,18 July 2009,"Candyman draws you in with its strange storytelling and a deep ambiance, not to mention a handful nail-biting scary moments. From what I've described, you'd think nothing could go wrong with Candyman, unfortunately something does. A large middle portion of the movie seems to stray a little too far from the central plot line. Things get stagnant when they should be moving. As a result, Candyman is not quite the film it could've been, but it'll offer enough creativity to impress any horror fans who haven't yet seen it.College student Helen Lyle wants to do a project on the urban legend of the Daniel Robitaille (a.k.a. the Candyman). If you look in a mirror and say his name five times, he will appear, tall and sinister with his bloody hook hand and his bee eaten, rib exposed chest. While Helen searches for the candyman, she starts to realize that he is after her as well. The question is why?The first half hour of Candyman is an ideal example of good horror filmaking, but a couple of strange plot twists set the stage for a somewhat plodding middle section in which not a lot happens. The Candyman has perhaps a little too much screen time, and a lot of his lines are repetitious. He feels far more threatening off-screen than he does on-screen, except for the moments where he appears out of nowhere, those are scary. The climax also feels a little weird, What happens to our protagonist is quite dramatic, but doesn't seem to make much sense. At least there are no major clichés. The way Candyman ends, it is obvious they did not have a sequel in mind, but as is too often the case there is not one but two follow ups to this strange and eccentric film. Candyman is good enough to make you consider watching the next film. It succeeds in a number of other places too, the most important of which is scaring the audience, but I think it needs a little more work, just a little.",Candyman
71,Spleen,To say it's better than any horror film since is too poor a compliment,8,14 December 2001,"Horror is an elusive genre.  The very word ""horror"", charitably interpreted, tells us nothing.  What respectable film would admit to being literally horrific - that is, to inspiring horror, to making people recoil at the sheer hideousness of its images?  If we allow that there are GOOD horror films then we must mean something else by ""horror"".  But what?  Look at the films held up to be among the best the so-called genre has produced - ""Nosferatu"" (1922), ""Dracula"" (1931), ""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Birds"" (1963), ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), ""The Exorcist"" (1973), ""Halloween"" (1978), ""The Shining"" (1980) - forgive me for the ones I've missed - and you'll see it's hard to find any two that deserve to be grouped with one another, let alone with the slasher flicks of the 1980s we now regard as typical.  (The exception, of course, is ""Halloween"", which I admit I haven't seen.)At their worst these 1980s slasher flicks are true horror: shallow, misanthropic, misogynist and repulsive.  On the surface ""Candyman"" looks a lot like them.  The exotic (in this case, supernatural) elements have been drained of all romance.  There's the humdrum, everyday world, then there's the ugly and squalid forces of darkness - and that's ALL there is.  The pessimism would be enough to make you run screaming if you took it too seriously.  (And we take it seriously enough so that when people die, we don't really mourn their passing, since there doesn't seem to be any point in doing so.)  There's a killer that STALKS its victims, toying with them like a cat with a mouse.  And there's an awful lot of blood.  These similarities are enough, I think, to make ""Candyman"" the same KIND of thing as ""Friday the 13th"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", etc.But it's the best of that kind.  One reason is that while the forces of darkness toy with the characters, the camera doesn't: we are NOT invited to take pleasure in peeking through the curtains at pretty young women just before they get creatively slaughtered.  The central character is an adult woman whose concerns we can take seriously; when she suffers, it has a shattering effect - or at least it did on me.  This is a film that doesn't ask its heroine to go through anything it isn't prepared to ask its audience to go through as well.  And when one of the central characters dies, it lingers (in scenes that are still burnt into my memory) on the consequences, not on the anticipation.This is all in addition to the fact that ""Candyman"" is simply a classier production than your average horror flick, with better photography and art direction, a convincing central performance (by Virginia Madsen), and a genuinely chilling musical score (by Phillip Glass, who finds his true niche as a film composer).  The ending - by which I mean the arch twist contained in the last few shots - IS schlocky and misogynist, and only half flows from what went before.  It's best thought of as belonging to some other movie.",Candyman
72,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Candyman (1992),8,13 December 2011,"Candyman is one of those films I really should have seen by now. I remember the trailer on the Cinema Club trailer reel from a wide selection of videos I owned in the mid 90's. Anyway, I finally saw it and it was great horror. I forgot you could make powerful slasher movies and keep the teens well away. The movie is all about myths and how they can spread and take control. These days myths spread world wide and at a greater rate, thanks to the internet. Candyman really allows you to feel emotions for these characters. Madsen isn't going crazy, but we can't blame people for thinking she is. Tony Todd has a very dominating screen presence, not to mention a powerful voice. The kills all seem necessary in this film, as each one has an impact on our protagonist and the world she inhabits. Finally, we have Phillip Glass' incredible score, which adds a bizarre and haunting atmosphere to the movie. Great horror at an early 90's pace.",Candyman
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not scary but definitely unsettling,8,12 September 2021,"Horror novelist Clive Barker may not be as ear catching as Stephen King, but he should be considered very much on the same level. Even though his creations would receive critical acclaim years after King's adaptations, they were still well deserved. Despite having a rough start, having his licensed works being completely changed, it was his self-directed film Hellraiser (1987) that got him on people's radars. And while the character of Pinhead was iconic by itself, Barker would help in creating another iconic horror figure in another feature, being this. With assistance from director Bernard Rose, who also spoke with Barker, the pair was able to recreate a short into a full length feature film based on a written work by Barker known as ""The Forbidden"". The difference is, instead of originally taking place in England, the setting was moved to the US, more specifically Chicago.The story for this film revolves around people living in the projects of Cabrini Green. There they are terrorized by a ghostly assailant known as Candyman (Tony Todd). Wanting to understand more so they could add credibility to their thesis is Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons). What they don't realize is just how serious the matter is and how the locals feel about the situation that's been going on. All the while tenants like Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams) have nowhere to go despite the uneasiness of the subject. Adding to that is Helen's husband Trevor (Xander Berkeley) having the usual female students flirting around for silly reasons. For this film, Bernard Rose directed and wrote the screenplay which can be difficult, but it looks like that wasn't an issue for him.What works really well in this horror film is the change up in the usual tropes witnessed in this genre. There are no dumb teenagers looking to fornicate every second. The area in which the story is based on is an actual place in the US. The lead characters are self-reliant and the overall story reflects on the historical context of the setting. That's the big picture. From a more focused perspective, the actors who perform in this picture give quite a show. Virginia Madsen, known at the time from starting in films like Dune (1984) and Highlander II: The Quickening (1991), will really make the viewer sympathize with her character. The same could be said for the characters played by Vanessa Williams and Kasi Lemmons. There's even DeJuan Guy in his first feature film giving a believable display.Adding to that are supporting actors like Xander Berkeley better known as John Conner's step father in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and even appearances from Ted Raimi and Rusty Schwimmer. Last but not least, the film would not be so well known if it wasn't for Tony Todd who brings in so much charisma into his role. His presence as Candyman feels very much just as imposing as Doug Bradley playing Pinhead. It's that memorable. Unfortunately, the small weak points to the movie are predictable outcomes for side characters. That and the on screen violence isn't as abundant as one might think. The gore and creep factor is there, but it's all for the most part aftermath, which isn't exactly the same. Nevertheless, it can get fairly intense.When it came camerawork, it was another added benefit to the experience. Handled by Anthony B. Richmond, the scenes shot are able to give the audience a very clear picture how much Cabrini Green is in dire need of support. From the dilapidated building structures, the practically unusable facilities and dangerous gang members lurking around, how would anyone feel comfortable being there? Finally, the film score composed by Philip Glass is another key component to watching the film. Despite him not really being known for working on horror films, Glass managed to create chilling album. Using mainly organ and chanting choirs, Glass' score haunts unlike other any horror scores. There are no stings either and thankfully, this work did get an album release which should be rightfully done. The main title sequence alone is a great track that isn't even in the album!Even though the film isn't really scary and the side characters are more or less predictable, there's so much more going in the movie's favor that makes it stand out from the typical horror film. The actors in general give great performances, especially Tony Todd. The camerawork captures the environment well and the music is a new listening experience.",Candyman
74,PredragReviews,''Be My Victim'',8,1 April 2016,"Candyman was one of the finest horror films I have ever seen and one of my personal favorites. Writer-director Bernard Rose does an excellent job of adapting a Barker story into a masterpiece film that not only provides chills and scares, but also many issues of racism and vengeance. Everything from the sound to story pacing is tight and extremely effective, and I have to agree with what someone else here said: Philip Glass' score is so subtle and creepy, it's perfect! The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force (the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago, which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman, a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times. She is convinced, as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be, that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence. The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction... However, midway through the film, there is a decisive rupture, and everything in Madsen's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate. The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from. Soon, everything we have come to know about the young woman we've been following, all of the connections she has to her friends, to her husband, to humanity in general seem to be undone. It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens, but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I've seen on film.Candyman is a well written thriller. It's overabundance of gore overshadows the existential elements. All the actors perform their parts with aplomb. Virginia Madsen is more than believable as a woman on the edge of a breakdown, while Tony Todd was born to play the Candyman. His tall and imposing stature combined with a deep and creepy voice can be truly unnerving at times. In a word, if you're a horror fan don't hesitate in getting this cult classic. Candyman really is prime-quality stuff! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Candyman
75,eric262003,Goes Beyond the Standard Slasher Film,9,19 September 2021,"In the late 1800's a son of a slave had found his way out of the doldrums in life after he became a dependable artist as people came from all around to get their portraits done of him. But then he fell in love with Caucasian woman and fathered a child from their relationship. This didn't sit well at all with her father and he sent a mob over to lynch him. They cut off his right hand and was since then replaced with a hook. Then they smeared honeycomb all over him that they stole from an apiary in which he succumbed to his death from the multiple bee stings. Since his death he has haunted the residents of the Cabrini-Green projects in Illinois by anyone who dares to look into the mirror and say his name five times. The question is, does The Candyman truly exist, or is he all just a myth like The Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot?What makes Clive Barker's stories stand out above other horror story writers is that he takes a particular trope that's familar to the horror genre in this case the urban legend and then molds into a different kind of entity. In the case of ""Candyman"", he manipulates the concept of the myth and plays with the viewers mind at the same time deciding if Candyman does exist or is he just a legend.As I expected over the years that many film critics have dismissed the slasher films to be a one-note see all kill all monster movies where the demonic entities have one thing on their minds, murder. But ""Candyman"" doesn't just depend on kill all that comes my way cliche. In fact as the years go by, ""Candyman"" stands out as one of the most underrated movies of the 1990's. In fact many of the scenes that pan out in this movie a deep-rooted, philosophical and provocative. Sure there's the shock value that is found in all slasher films, but the scares and concepts add more to the fear factor being that it's played with meaning as opposed to being random like what you'll find in ""Friday the 13th"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". There's no dark humour or witty banter that comes out of Candyman's dialogue, his motives depend on tragedy drama which is quite original and makes for a more effective villain. His powers come from the myth of his existence and when people stop believing in him, his powers start to fade.The performances play out very effectively from the scary evil ways that Canadyman (Tony Todd) possesses which also rests on the platform of dark tragedy to the effectiveness of a curious albeit skeptical University student like Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) the chemistry between these two has an impact that is pure magical in its substance. Aside from the performances, shock value and the urban legend the derives from the narrative, the score composed by Philip Glass is quite breath-taking that it has the right tension to a film of this magnitude. Sure others have pointed out that the film did not age well due to the styles and clothes were permanently stuck in the 1990's, but I feel that the archaic feel gives a great taste of nostalgia.Though I mentioned that the Candyman lore is not just built to scare the viewers out of their seats, but just like most of the other entities from Clive Barker's stories, the villains have a certain motive as to why they vow revenge on those who provoke him. When Helen dismisses his exsistence to the residents in the Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago, he vows to take those down who threaten his presence especally those who are skeptical of him. Tony Todd was the rightful choice to cast Candyman. From his towering height, to his grotesque figure and the hook for a hand and finally the coast that covers his chest that's saturated with bee hives swarming all around him, he is just a walking, talking eyesore of a spirit. He doesn't show up until the halfway mark of the film, but his build-up to when he finally shows up, will make any viewer unsettled. Through his dialogue and scary presence, you never know what he'll do next. That's what differs himself compared to other slasher film monsters his unpredictable nature stands above the rest.Under the careful detail of Clive Barker's story with new twists that break away from its original intentions, to the stylistic direction from Bernard Rose and finally the more intense dramatic performance by Tony Todd who can still provide scares and deaths and adds more dimension to character that's contrary to the other slasher characters, ""Candyman"" is a classic of its genre.",Candyman

One day she comes across the legend of Candyman, a slave who was stung to death by bees after being attacked by a lynch mob in the 1800's. She goes out to the city projects where the gangsters live, and suddenly realizes the racism involved after she is attacked in the washrooms there; several black guys have been murdered there and the cops do nothing, but she is white and when attacked the cops do everything to help her out. Now she has bigger issues though... Candyman is after her! Candyman is a suspenseful movie from start to finish, with great acting and freaky soundtrack. As teenagers we all hear urban legends: Bloody Mary, the Hook on the Car Door, and if you're a younger teen you may have heard of Slenderman. Candyman has created a horror film spinning together all these urban myths into an entity beyond comprehension. The film also raises awareness of both racism and the dating that goes on between college professors and their students. Helen is shocked to learn that her husband Trevor, the professor, is dating Stacey, a student much younger than him.

79,Analog_Devotee,A great horror flick which has stood the test of time,7,28 April 2021,"Back in October, I was in the hospital due to gallbladder issues. Except, unfortunately, we were in the dark at the time on what the actual issue was, because I was having pains in the middle of my chest instead of my abdomen. I was poked, prodded, scanned, questioned and pressed for 48 hours and I couldn't have been more miserable.In the midst of all this rigmarole, I scanned the channels on the tiny television set mounted on the wall, mostly alternating between sitcom and Star Trek reruns, until I finally landed on that horizontal bird's eye scan which I thought I recognized (there was no way to tell what the hell you were actually watching; no guide or anything). Then ""CANDYMAN"" in white letters fell to the middle of the screen. I hadn't seen this film in a decade, maybe even longer. I turned up the volume, letting that beautiful soundtrack fill my lonely little hospital room and, miraculously, wasn't bothered for the entire runtime of the film.While it may sound ridiculous to say this film put me at ease, that's most certainly what it did. For two hours (don't forget commercials, blegh) I felt like I wasn't even in the hospital. I felt back at home, chilling in my living room to a badass horror flick.",Candyman
80,oneguyrambling,This 2 decade old Candy is still pretty sweet...,7,27 December 2011,"Time seems to have gone past Candyman but I remember when it was released in Australia in early 90s it was pretty far out stuff.A tall skinny black guy with a gruff voice gutting people with his hook hand was shocking back then – now we have the various tortures of Saw and Hostel.A pretty (being generous) blonde woman as the target of the baddie wasn't too prevalent (yeah-yeah Halloween!) – now it seems once you're a woman rated higher than an ""8"" you're practically assigned your own psychopathic serial killer The woman in this case is Sharon Stone-lite (ironically not where weight is concerned) Helen (Virginia Madsen), Tony Todd plays the titular Sugary Psycho that menaces her and her study-buddy Bernadette, among many others.Legend has it that the Candyman was the son of a slave who died badly after being tortured bees and other nastiness were involved after he had the temerity to nail the slave-owner's daughter. To summon the undead Candyman is simple, gaze into a mirror and repeat his name 5 times and he will appear instantly to well gut you like a fish if the movie is right, (why you would want this I'm not sure).The specifics of this seem to change a little depending on circumstances: - In one scene two people split the Candyman duties, splitting the 5 repeats between them he appears anyway. This would lead me to believe that every time you say Candyman to a mirror is a little like Russian roulette – as 4 other people could have said it once each elsewhere.Further to this if you try to be clever and say it 4 times before chickening out depending on the count he could appear at any point in your sequence.In some scenes Candy appears instantaneously, in others he seems to take a raincheck and pops up later. I guess there are either many people calling on him or the man is just busy doing other things Which could mean this is a chore to old Sweetums, and being summoned is like a doorbell; ""AGAIN, I just finished killing two teens in Miami! Won't you guys give me 5 minutes to clean my hook? "" Speculation and wonderment aside the mythology has become folklore in the local area where Helen and Bernadette are writing a paper on *DRUM ROLL Please!* Urban legends.This takes them to Cabrini Green, an urban ghetto area where word has it Candyman resides, after some faked contacts Helen writes off the legend as a fake.Not so fast Helen As people near and dear to Helen start dropping like flies in various bloody dismembered puddles, leaving her on the scene the investigators assume she had something to do with things and question her. Each subsequent step seems to implicate even more, and as she protests her innocence still more Candyman contacts and twists ensure she remains a suspect, and the police and her husband start to wonder if she might just be 110% nuts.There is some good simple music in Candyman which lends a bit of class to proceedings, including an effective piano loop that is instantly familiar when you hear it, some gore that may have been extreme in the 90s but hardly raises an eyebrow today, and it is always interesting to watch a ""period piece"" where almost everyone smokes and telephones still have cords.This year Natalie Portman put in a gonzo performance as the crizzazy Nena in Black Swan and was lauded for it. But really all she did was pretend to see things, scratch non-existent itches, yell a little and let CGI do most of the rest. As Helen Virginia Madsen gets her gear off a few times, fast-tracks a descent into insanity, emerges from several scenes covered in blood and bits of people, loses her hair and at times acts like a grade A looney. I see both Black Swan and Candyman as equally ludicrous yet one is being seen as somewhat visionary while Candyman was written off as just another slasher film.I guarantee in 10 years no-one will be studying Black Swan as a classic of the modern era Candyman is certainly no classic but here I am nigh 20 years later and it is still at least enjoyable.Final Rating – 6 / 10. 20 year old Candy is probably not going to be as tasty as when it was new, but it still has a little flavour and is at least satisfying.",Candyman

It started off like a supernatural slasher flick but it turned into a very original story later on. Bernadette and Helen are studying on their thesis on urban legends and they went over to that huge, derelict, graffiti ridden soviet style apartment complex. The apartments had the same layout as her flat with her husband. They met a woman with her little son there. Helen woke up in a pool of blood in her apartment after a blackout. Her dog head was cut off and her baby was missing. She was arrested but then released. The same happened with her friend Bernadette. She was killed with the hook in her apartment. She was arrested and put to a mental institution. She managed to escape after summoning Candyman. He killed the counselor and Helen escaped thru the window. Then she went over to her house and saw her husband starting a new life with one of his students. She left and went to the candyman apartment again to find the baby. The three ended up in the huge pile of stuff heaped for the bonfire. They set it on fire and Helen managed to save the boy whereas she was severely burnt. The Black community came to her funeral and he dropped the hook down to her coffin. Then her husband summoned her at the bathroom and she came and killed her with the hook. It was really so bizarre that I really enjoyed it although the acting wasn't great and the visual effects weren't excellent. Candyman's backstory made it even more intriguing.",Candyman

85,one9eighty,"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Helen",7,22 August 2017,"A review post 10 years since watching... Wow, I remember getting this on VHS rental from the local shop, I watched it with a friend from school (I was totally underage for the 18 certificate). This reporter woman is looking into urban myths, she comes across the legend of ""Candyman"". She does some journo digging with family of victims and other high society socialites she happens to be in circles with. She learns about him and the more she learns the more obsessed she becomes, she learns how to summon the supernatural killer and starts going more nuts, she happens to be around people being killed off and becomes suspect number 1. The film follows her trying to get ""Candyman"" and the victims past, present and future. This was a psychological horror with mystery and suspense which I was too young to be watching, it had plenty of gore too which my mum wouldn't have been happy with either. Despite all that I loved the film and it had an effect on me throughout life to becoming an adult. If presented with the opportunity I'll randomly jump behind friends and summon Candyman to see if it scares them or just makes then think I'm a dick. Since watching the film I've seen the ""Candyman"" actor in loads of other stuff (Tony Todd, Final Destination, Wishmaster, The Crow, The Rock, and various TV programmes) but I can't recall seeing any of the other bland 90's horror actors in much else. Despite that, in this film the cast do their job perfectly and don't interfere with the film. I remember this being a loud film, the music really complimented the pace and suspense. As a child I'd have given this film an 8 or a 9 because I loved gory horror films, but having rewatched this as an adult with a wider appreciation of film, and when compared to other films it'd have give this a 7. For the time this was a cult classic but it hasn't really stood the test of time and rivalry and not many people will remember it or choose to dig it out of a film library. Feel free to enjoy it, I've watched it lately and it offered a nice bit of nostalgia and fun. Enjoy.",Candyman

Hoping to find the place where the last Candyman killing took place, and to ask local residents what they might know. But they are asking too many questions, and this gets them some unwanted attention...leading to Helen (Virginia Madsen) getting beaten up.The guy who beat her up was pretending to be Candyman, in an attempt to intimidate people. Though, in reality, he is just the leader of one of the local gangs.So Helen becomes skeptical of Candyman's existence- thinking this is the source of the urban legend that the community holds onto so dearlyBut that was her greatest mistake...for now Candyman seeks vengeance...for f*cking with his legacy. He starts to take over Helen's mind- making her do things she would- she could- never fathom doing. And forces her into a position, where she must accept a deal with the devil...or, well, him...in order to save the life of an innocent baby who he has kidnapped.Now, she is wanted for murder, kidnapping, and animal cruelty...and finds herself institutionalized.Is Candyman really responsible for all these crimes...or is it all in her head? Nothing a quick summoning test won't clear up...This film is a pretty cool combination of slasher and psychological thriller, with some decent gore and awesome death scenes. Honestly, I'm really surprised I've never watched it until now. It sets you up for the gore with some cheap scares. But that final scene where Candyman is about to kill Helen is wicked.

87,CitizenCaine,Candyman! Candyman! Candyman! Candyman! ... I'll Stop Here,8,15 January 2004,"Look into a mirror, preferably alone at night, and say ""candy-man"" 5 times and...uh...see what happens. Little known Bernard Rose directed this terrifying horror/suspense/thriller set and filmed in Chicago. The story is adapted from a novel by horror master Clive Barker. Two attractive female graduate students research an urban ""myth"" only to discover it may not be a myth, or is it? That's the premise of this tightly written and directed film, which does for looking into mirrors what Psycho did for taking showers. This is a thinking man's horror film that scares the daylights out of you at times while still leading you to think beyond what's on the screen.It's much more than just a horror film with a creepy man goring people to death. It exploits many of our deepest fears about society and in ourselves, such as: what can happen in a run down public housing complex (Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green projects), and can our fears remove the certainty of what we know to be untrue? Rose expertly weaves in Hitchcockian themes of being wrongly accused, emotional vulnerability, and psychological exploitation, while maintaining interest and building a high level of tension throughout the film. Philip Glass' quasi-religious score consistently provides an eerie companion when the camera takes us into seemingly normal locations, like a public restroom for instance. Truly one of the very best horror films of the 90's that can disturb your thoughts, penetrate your sense of security, and still provide disturbing gore and violence. This film is not for the faint of heart. Virginia Madsen stars as the main character and doesn't strike a false note. Tony Todd is the candy-man, and he doesn't appear to deliver gumdrops.

89,carbuff,Old-fashioned (or at least 1990s) top-grade horror--I'm feeling nostalgic.,10,23 August 2020,"I'm sure I won't be watching the sequels, since they'll be obvious money grabs after this very successful original. A sequel doesn't even follow naturally, although that never stopped Hollywood before.However, the original ""Candyman"" is an excellent example of horror movies from this time period. I saw it so long ago that I couldn't really remember much of it, but I was very pleasantly surprised that is was so much better than my poor memory had me believing. Or maybe this stuff just hits me harder now, given that I was so much younger when I first watched it.The story line is compelling and disturbing, especially when you consider how dated it is. The special effects are easily good enough to carry the film, since it was much more dependent on psychological impact than just outright gore. Admittedly, It also very effectively hit a nostalgia bone in me. It might not be gory enough for some modern audiences, not to mention the plot might move too slowly and seem too naive. Just throwing those thoughts out for those who don't realize that they grew up watching levels of violence that were unthinkable to us aging but young-at-heart adults. Still, I think this flick might even creep quite a few modern kids out. Maybe give some old-time horror a shot.",Candyman
90,The_Movie_Cat,"""All you have left is my desire for you.""",7,24 January 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI have to confess that the initial appeal of Candyman was completely lost on me. Only on second viewing could I begin to fully appreciate what it has to offer.Thematically it's similar to Clive Barker's other great film success, Hellraiser. Not just in the way that dabbling in forbidden practises will raise the undead, but in it's necessary plot contrivances. That the heroine (Helen/Kirsty) can call forth the creature/s which slay on sight, yet are allowed, by a tweaking of the film's own rules, to converse with their tormentors. Just as Pinhead and co. would spend their existence tearing men limb from limb the instant they solved the lamentation configuration box; here the mad slayings of Candyman are put on hold as he finds all manner of reasons, or alternate victims, to let Madsen survive to (almost) the end of the film. However, this is neatly explained by Candyman's desire for her, proving he's a man who knows all about the birds and... er... the bees.Its subtext is what makes the film most rewarding. Not only does it play on accepted urban myth and superstition (even though the particular myth is fabricated, I find very few people WILL dare to say his name five times), but also sociological fears. Or, in the same sense, urban myths again. That is, the myth of the white woman being subjugated by the black man.Of course, this being a horror film, even one well above the intellectual average, it does round up the usual stereotypes. A fellow lecturer, the most pompous and self-important character in the whole film, is English, while the policewoman who orders Madsen to strip for searching is a butch bulldog of a woman who obviously receives sexual gratification from said task.There is also some nice quizzical gothic music throughout, which can get a little over the top and pretentious, but is generally quite beautiful. The notion of Helen's sanity is often called into question, and we see scenes where Candyman cannot be picked up by camera, causing us to believe it may all be in her mind. This also leads to some black humour as various characters double take at the sheer number of mitigating circumstances Helen finds herself under.Yet what initially made me dislike the film is its fundamental lack of scariness. The use of mirrors is always a guaranteed spooker, though the name ""Candyman"" had only previously seen the inside of cinemas when sung about in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The fact that when Candyman does arrive he's dressed like a camp pimp and has a tendency for poetic prose didn't add to the fear factor. I must admit to finding Tony Todd a little scarier this time around as the first time I thought he was putting on a ludicrously deep voice. It turns out that this is Todd's real voice, though it still seems to be siphoned through some form of modulator. His somewhat exaggerated supernatural powers and fleeting appearances led me to conclude that this was a scary movie that forgot the scary, but then of course that's missing the point.Candyman is both victor and victim rolled into one, a phantom of the opera for the nineties. His literary origins are quite impeccable, and when the book of Frankenstein is mentioned towards the start of the movie, this is counterbalanced by an ending that references the 1931 adaptation by Universal. He has a hypnotic hold over women, like a Dracula/De Sade hybrid, and his rapport with Helen means that this could justifiably be seen as a romantic movie. Perhaps not a good idea to take someone out on a date to see it though. Only a predictable and trite coda really detracts from what is a thoughtful, and thought-provoking, modern horror.The same choral themes occur in the pointless sequel, Farewell to the Flesh. However, this merely serves to illustrate how mainstream and tacky the follow-up is. While it's an established rule that sequels are rarely as good as their predecessors, this is  Bride of Frankenstein and Dawn of the Dead possible exceptions  doubly true with horror sequels. Before you can say Freddy 2-6 or Michael Myers 2-7, Candyman re-emerges onto the scene with souped-up gore, dumbed-down dialogue and an irritating DJ who narrates the thing for the hard of thinking. A sort of Annie through the Looking Glass as Kelly Rowan tries to find the one big mirror that can finally destroy the Candyman. Everything is spelt out in this one, including a depiction of his death which is unnecessary and nowhere near as striking as it was when narrated in the first. Of course, the real problem is that Candyman is such a self-contained story that it doesn't NEED a sequel. But Hollywood beckoned with its chequebook and so even if Candyman 3 wasn't intentionally the end of the series, it would have killed it off anyway. Avoid the inferior follow-ups, watch Candyman as a solo work... it's really quite wonderful.",Candyman
91,rzajac,Worth watching if yr not normally a fan of horror,7,29 March 2017,"Frankly, I've never seen a proper horror movie which redeemed the genre in my eyes. I was just thinking about it, and can only conjure up three times I was horrified by a film product: The cartoon short ""The Boy Who Saw the Iceberg"" by Paul Driessen; the scene in Morris's ""The Thin Blue Line"" where an incarcerated, handcuffed David Harris whimsically muses about the moment of murder as a religiously transcendent, timeless moment; and the sturdy narrative depiction of evil acts portrayed in ""Rosemary's Baby"". I also like Robert Rodriguez's forays into grindhouse style horror... but not because it's truly horrific. In fact, it's almost like Roldriguez knows this, even as he's working.But, that said, I found this flick about as close as they come. I like the tethering the pretense of horror to a sturdy, modern materialism, and Candyman fairly pulls that off.There are a few punches pulled. But there really is a depiction of something well nigh harrowing; a woman dedicated to discovery of the truth who discovers that materialism just may be no protection from an horrific reality.",Candyman
92,cchase,Pleasant Screams!,8,4 December 2008,"Anyone who wants to know why today's watered-down horror flicks are so miserable when compared to the classics, need look no further than CANDYMAN. Unlike the lofty literary pretensions of GHOST STORY, which weighed down the task of adapting it for the screen considerably, CANDYMAN goes to the essence of the what's, why's and wherefore's of the mythological boogeymen that inhabit so many of our classic ghost stories and fairy tales. It's about betrayal, revenge, lost love, eternal damnation, why our monsters need us to survive...and why, (whether we'd like to admit it or not) we need them as well.Excellently based on Clive Barker's ""The Forbidden,"" it's the story of a grad student, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) doing her thesis about ""Candyman"", a ghostly, hook-handed death-dealer who haunts the dilapidated dwellings of the Cabrini Green projects in Chicago. Even though she is warned countless times about the dangers of exploring the truth behind the legend, Helen is drawn deeper into the mystery, the mythology and the horrifying truth behind the Candyman's origins...and he becomes equally fascinated by HER!So their 'danse macabre' of death and desire begins, as bodies pile up with Helen as Candyman's unwitting accomplice, unable to explain her part in the carnage as she questions her own sanity and the very nature of myth vs. reality itself. Anyone who's ever told a tale like this with a circle of friends either round a campfire or in a darkened room at a sleepover, will have to resign themselves to at least a month's worth of nightmares at the stunning ending.Tony Todd (THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake) has the role of his career as the tragic and terrifying title character, and Madsen is nothing less than her amazing self as the woman who comes to ""love"" him. Solid support is provided by Kasi Lemmons, Xander Berkeley and Vanessa Williams (no, not the one from ERASER - the one from NEW JACK CITY.) And Brit director Bernard Rose in his genre debut, understands how to bring ""gore with gravitas"" to the screen, underscoring the tone of sadly unrequited love in between disembowelings and dismemberings.There is a follow-up, and it's not as bad as sequels usually are, but never mind that. You'll still be trying to catch up on all the sleep you're gonna lose after seeing the original!",Candyman
93,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,The Power of Myth,8,24 July 2008,"""Candyman"" is an interesting take on the slasher genre. While it has scenes that an audience can expect to see in a slasher film it adds a further, more complex, level to the story by adding the power of lore. The Candyman, you see, is just a legend about a brutally murdered slave whose ghost can supposedly be summoned by chanting his name five times in front of a mirror. There are plenty of stories in the same vein about something awful or strange that happened sometime ago, but if you look in the right corner at the right time of night you'll see the frightening truth. They scare kids (and squeamish adults) but what is interesting that there is so many of them. There doesn't seem to be an end and every now and then a new little urban legend pops up.In respect to the Candyman, if ""believing makes it so"" then whoever thought that line up couldn't have been more right. As the film progresses we see how slowly but surely eager and skeptical graduate student Helen Lyle is pulled from disbelief into the middle of her own worst nightmare. It is like a hellish rendition of the moment when after sharing a scary story late in the evening you realize that you don't want to go into the next room alone. You know it is just a story, but it not only changed your heart rate, it changed what you are doing in the real world. Myths and legends are as old as civilization and somewhere, somehow, probably a long time ago they have taken a hold of us and they are probably not letting go anytime soon.In addition to this interesting premise, the music deserves mention and it is simply one of the best horror themes ever composed. Slow and calm, but eerie and when coupled with the opening shot, it is a great entry into an underrated horror film. --- 8/10BsCDb classification: 13+ --- violence/gore",Candyman
94,rebeljenn,succeeds in the 'creepy' factor but fails as a film,2,18 October 2005,"'Candyman' is no exception to the popular lack of a sufficient plot in the horror film genre. (This is not taken to mean that horror films do not have a good storyline but to mean that many do not because the horror and gore is more of the norm.) What 'Candyman' does succeed at is its ability to 'do' horror well. Typically, horror films are not frightening, even when they want to be. In fact, some of them can be downright amusing. 'Candyman' did have its creepy moments. Although I saw this film in my teens (12 or more years ago now), I remember the scene showing how the Candyman character became Candyman through torture by bees / his slave masters. That is really all that I can remember.I must not have thought the film was terribly frightening because I remember repeating his name in the mirror to impress the friend that I watched the movie with. Of course, nothing happened. Despite the creepy factor succeeding, I can only give this film a '2/10' because it is not what I would consider to be a great film, and it is certainly not the best film in this genre.If you are looking for something to creep you out this Halloween, however, this is your film. (Though, I am not sure if it has aged and how creepy it actually is now.)",Candyman
95,Ben_Cheshire,Candyman is black for a reason.,4,12 May 2004,"(spoilers)It teeters on the brink of trash at the beginning, but an hour in it gets really involving and quite frightening. Well-written and well developed, it has a cracker of a premise that makes us care what happens to Virginia Madsen's character, which is why we must watch to the end. Virginia Madsen is very cute, albeit with big early 90's hair. Good creepy music, though Phillip Glass has clearly gone to the Nightmare on Elm Street school of synthesiser soundtrack-making. There is a very nice Hannibal-esque piano theme i liked in particular.It insists on involving itself in the race war in Chicago, which it tends to over-simplify: bright graffiti, gangs, slum district, starving babies and police not caring about black people but caring about white people. The fact that the original Candyman crime happened in the slum district where Virginia Madsen then spends some key scenes of the film (which i won't spoil) and then combined with this the fact that Candyman is African-American (this on its own would not be significant), combined with all these other factors it seems to signify something).Candyman's grandiose uniform, his resonant voice and presence and the choral/organ music all come together to create an impression of Candyman as a kind of preacher. This is eventually built into his dialogue: at one point he refers to having to leave his congregation. The belief in the Candyman is likened to belief in Dracula and Frankenstein, and urban myths like alligators in the sewers, but here Candyman is also linked with cultist beliefs and religions. ""Do you believe in me?"" Candyman asks Virginia Madsen. ""Come with me, and be immortal"".I'm not quite sure what all this signifies: perhaps Candyman is reaping the retribution of the African-American community who've been wronged by their white suppressors, but it seems awfully like Candyman represents the malicious out of control African Americans that need to be kept in check. This was not their intent, their intent was to have us feel sorry for Candyman, in the tradition of Frankenstein's monster and Jason from Friday the 13th, where the killer has been abused and tortured and made what they are. The problem with this is that being abused by one set of people when you're young does not excuse sadistically gutting a bunch of random other people.This is why a horror movie is not usually a suitable disguise for social commentary, because the requirements of the horror plot interfere with the social commentary.",Candyman

The plot is understandable and the damned love dynamic always pulls stings inside me.Tony Todd's presence is felt and some of the kills were awesome.

I actually enjoyed the ending grief by the husband, Berkley is great as well, I knew a revenge act will take place, but the reflection on the loss itself was much more pleasant to see.After seeing the original, the 2021 disaster feels a little better, but not too much. Also, I was pleasantly surprised they got the same actress to play the child's mother. I was wondering why she looks so young compared to the grown-up child in the 2021 disaster, but now I know why, it's ok.The original has its flaws, it is very 90ties in its core, with some of the cliches of the time sticking out (lots and lots of smoking, questionable nudity, and HAIRCUTS). It has a distinct style, and even very noticeable stunt and string work didn't ruin it for me.The style, the amazing score by Glass, the twisted love story, and the captivating presence of Tony Todd were enough for me to enjoy this. I cannot explain to myself how they were able to waste the Candyman himself so bad in the 2021 film.As a bonus, watching this one almost completely erased the 2021 disastrous follow-up from my memory, thanks.",Candyman

As per usual, say his name in the mirror 5 times and you're dead.The most solid part of the movie was the story itself. I liked how Candyman was an embodiment of rumors and folklores. However, there were parts that were not entirely clear, and could have done better.The performances were decent throughout. Tim Rodd as Candyman was pretty awesome. The dude looked menacing as heck. There's like one side character that had a pretty bad actress.Although the story was interesting, I wasn't on edge at all during the entire thing. There were a lot of jump scares early on, but some of them actually were effective.Overall, good story but not very scary. 6/10.",Candyman

I was quite scared when i watched this movie, but when i watched it a couple of times i got use to the movie, i wasn't that much scared, i even watched it a few times and the last time i watched it on my own, how creepy is that. I think this is the best Candyman movie than the other 2 (Candyman 2: Farewell to the flesh, and Candyman 3: Day of the Dead) the fist Candyman movie was released in 1992, and then in 1995 Candyman 2 was released, and then in 1999 Candyman 3 was released but this one was not in the cinemas.",Candyman

I believe however that when it comes to horror films, the director and score composer have more to do with it than anybody else. Candyman has two extremely talented people behind the scenes in those departments. First we'll talk about Philip Glass' score which is truly haunting and the opening score is enough to set mood for five lesser horror films. Second we'll talk about Bernard Rose. Rose has the eye of a great film-maker, this film is visually terrifying. The cinematography is also fantastic, as well as the editing. I believe that Rose is the true talent behind this film. Rose wrote the screenplay also, but the screenplay isn't too original. Given that, it gave him the outline he needed to direct one of the best horror films of the modern genre.",Candyman

There's a scene in the movie where Helen walks out of a candyman mural, and then it shows the awesome shot, so I'm not talking with a hint of irony when I say that this scene is a cinematic classic. It also never tries to become anything cheesy, which can be said for the sequels, it tells a completely creative storyline, and boy is that main score amazing.

But a couple of my friends told me that it was very good, so finally I sat down and watched the whole thing.It was not good. It's even worse than I thought. It starts out bad and it never gets better. It's the type of movie that hardcore horror fans may enjoy. I'm talking about the type of people who like to see every kind of horror film, be it realistic horror or fantasy stuff that could never happen. But there was absolutely nothing here for me. I'm a casual horror fan if anything. I enjoy good movies regardless of genre, so if it's a horror movie that's well done I'll enjoy it, but if it's badly done then I'm not going to enjoy it just because it's a horror. Do not recommend.",Candyman

Positives include Tony Todd, who is very good in the role of the antagonist, and conveys undeniable gravitas and charisma as an actor. Urban decay sets lend an almost apocalyptic tone of discomforture, and benefit from impressive attention to detail. The story itself is also interesting, particularly with respect to its treatment of race, class, and elitism.The script does have its weaknesses. One of the most significant is the derivative and pretty boring domestic melodrama between the female protagonist and her husband, although it's also true that this relationship is important to the aforementioned thematic content. There is also too much explaining and not enough showing of the backstory, which is too bad because it's an intriguing and unusual story, at least within the horror genre.Nonetheless, this is an above-average horror movie, and a near-classic.",Candyman
109,dfle3,Hypnotic and sensual horror movie,8,19 June 2008,"Quite a few years ago I took a punt and rented this horror movie...didn't have way too many expectations for it, I don't think, and I can't remember exactly why I thought to watch it.It did leave an impression on me, though. Briefly, to what I remember of the plot: it's an urban myth...say the character's name a few times in front of the mirror, and you summon this murderous ghost. The adult animated comedy South Park dealt with a similar premise, and it may have been a homage to this movie (I think the character's name in South Park was ""Biggy"" something or other...based on a real life music rapper who was murdered, I think. Sorry I can't be more helpful!).Anyway, what I DO remember about this movie is the impression it left on me...I found it to be stylish, sensual, lyrical and poetic. Odd adjectives for a horror movie, no? The beginning of the movie didn't grab me and I had wondered if I had gotten the right movie!This is a very visually stunning horror movie which spellbinds you. From memory, there is an odd romantic element to this story...something which is quite unexpected.I did see the sequel to this movie, and there are probably more sequels in stores as well. Found the sequel to be really mediocre...it has none of the enchanting qualities of the original.Watch the first one and forget about the rest. Must get around to rewatching this movie some time...to see if it still casts the same spell that it did first time around.",Candyman
110,AKS-6,Good psychological horror film,6,28 October 2000,"The first time I saw ""Candyman"", three or four years ago, I was horrified. The psychological horror of the film really got to me. However, as with most horror films I never even get the slightest bit uncomfortable the second time I watch it. Don't get me wrong, though, ""Candyman"" is a good film. Much better than the pathetic Clive Barker-film ""Hellraiser"" (that film is really a laugh, a slimy skeleton isn't exactly the definition of 'scary' according to me. So okay, that film has its moments of sheer beauty [at least one scene] but scary nah, don't think so). ""Candyman"" is without a doubt one of the best serious horror films I have ever seen -- I can't really count the ""Scream""-trilogy since those films are as much comedy as horror. Definitely (almost) ""up there"" with films like ""The Shining"" (Kubrick-version) and ""The Exorcist"" -- they are all psychological horror films and those films are the only films that can scare me at least the first time I see them. ""Halloween"", ""Hellraiser"", ""Friday the 13th"" those films only make me laugh. Anyway, ""Candyman"" is a good film. Recommended. (6/10)",Candyman

Crisp aerial photography, neat Philip Glass music, good acting from the heroine, and an interesting set up about urban legends. I enjoyed particularly the scenes at the university with the male lecturers trying to act clever, and the early scenes at the 'projects' with the usual threatening black teenagers, were unsettling enough. Yes, a few too many obvious jump scares, but it goes with the genre I guess. Once the real villain appeared, not sure why, but I didn't find him that interesting, or scary. Just tiresome. I liked how the heroine is framed and everyone thinks she's nuts, but for me, the whole backstory of the Candyman and how she was fated to be 'his' lacked originality. It all gets a bit too cartoonish by the end. Still recommended overall, especially for the main actress and the music.",Candyman

113,lathe-of-heaven,"This one is a tough call... 'HELLRAISER' was awesome; but this one, although very atmospheric, the characters seemed a little lacking... Blu-ray: Good A:7 V:7",6,21 January 2014,"It's not an awful film by any means; and judging by just about every review here, EVERYONE loves it!The soundtrack was quite excellent I thought; and Tony Todd can say ANYTHING and I am enthralled! The guy is a top actor. Most the way through, the mood was pretty good, BUT... I'm not sure what it is about this film that somehow creates a disconnect from the story or is lacking somewhat... I KNOW that in the first 15 minutes or so, the acting is SOOOOOOOOOOOO excruciating, that it caused me some serious psychic pain. GEEZ... The first girl telling the story to her boyfriend (good ol' Ted Raimi) couldn't POSSIBLY have been any more plastic and annoying. And even Ms. Madsen, who I normally really like, somehow just comes across surprisingly superficial in her coy little looks, her CONSTANT holding of a cigarette in that overdone clichéd way, and if she bloody rolled her tongue between her teeth just ONE frigg'n more time, I SWEAR I woulda leapt onto the screen and phuk'n killed her myself! I know, I know... I'm WAY over-reacting, but honestly that kind of 'little' stuff REALLY get's up my @ss. Perhaps, if the director could have cut out all that horribly annoying clichéd behaviour and simply brought out more of a GENUINE performance from most of the actors, I truly believe that that would have gone a long way to making this film more effective. For example, when she was researching the 'legend' etc., did she have an earnest expression on her face showing a GENUINE intrigue and studious interest in what caused these murders and what was behind this mysterious legend...? Uh, NO... She sits there with her omnipresent cigarette and with this stupid, vacuous smile on her face which didn't fit the scene at all. WTF...??! We've all seen many of films (Horror and otherwise) where the supposed heroine is studiously searching for clues or the truth behind something and we see the actresses ACTUALLY portraying that BELIEVABLY. NOT looking like they are bleed'n sitting there looking through a Victoria's Secret catalog and dreamily choosing her next lingerie purchase, for God's sake! THAT is precisely what I mean when I mention a'Disconnect' between the character and story...Sorry... but these kinds of things REALLY burn my @ss, they really do. In my lowly and wretched opinion, they honestly add up and greatly diminish the audience's true, full involvement in not only the story, but the characters who are SUPPOSED to be re-enforcing your belief in what is going on. I think what this ultimately does, is it glosses over the characters (with the strong exception of Tony Todd, of course) and makes them appear very plastic and unbelievable, rather than people who you are genuinely concerned about.It's like the movie just didn't have a strong 'Heart' in it that REALLY swept you up in the story. Like I mention in my summary above, even in the way, WAY far out and Fantastical 'HELLRAISER' I, II, and even III, the PEOPLE were actually BELIEVABLE! You were INVOLVED with them and really CARED about them; they seem more REAL than they do here. Even the lovely Terry Farrell in H3 was IMMENSELY more likable and believable than Virginia Madsen here.BUT... with all that said, and even with the very poor characters (or more accurately, the poor DIRECTION of those characters) still, there was a pretty good retro Horror mood overall and like I mentioned, I really DID like the soundtrack very much. And Tony Todd always ROX!Anyway, I just thought I'd add some things which some people may consider more minor points that detracted from the film, as a contrast to review after review saying just how this was 'the best Horror film' of the year or one of the best of all time. It honestly just did NOT strike ME as fitting in with all the TRUE Classics that many people feel are among the best. And, the only thing I can really come up with as the reason for that, is the inferior direction which did not seem to bring out realistic enough performances which is so vital for us, the audience, to be able to invest ourselves emotionally in the characters.So hopefully, if you are not quite as demanding as I am with the characterizations, and you can just sit back and enjoy the creepy atmosphere and Tony Todd's excellent performance, you might actually have a perfectly fine time watching this movie...",Candyman

Tony Todd was an excellent choice, as he is both handsome and charming and his voice is quite hypnotic and trance inducing. He has the lure of a beautiful vampire. And the graffiti used was just like I imagined as I read the book and had nightmares afterwards. Cabrini Green was a scary place for REAL and a fitting background for this Haunting Seductive, Tortured (Man Made) Monster to stalk his victims. His story is quite heart-breaking. And Sadly as I write this review in 2021, It seems ALOT of Americans have LEARNED NOTHING from it's violent, hateful abuse of black people. What a SHame, :(

So now, I must shed innocent blood.""",9,27 October 2008,"Candyman is not what I would call a basic slasher. Basic slashers have some OK music, usually poor acting, no character development, and not much background. This is not the case at all here.Candyman is a simple legend, taken a step farther and showed on film. Similar to the ""Bloody Mary"" legends. You look in the mirror, say his name 5 times then turn the light off and back on and he will appear. Only here, the legend is true. And it goes far beyond that. Candyman himself has a history behind his presence.The acting here was excellent, although I must say, Tony Todd stole the show as Candyman, a son-of-a-slave who was tortured to death years before and now roams as a supernatural presence within the legends and fears of local residents. Virginia Madsen was perfect as Helen Lyle, a student who investigates the stories of Candyman. There are also great performances by Xander Berkeley, Kasi Lemmons, Vanessa Williams, DeJuan Guy, and Stanley DeSantis.The music score by Philip Glass was honestly the best I have heard in a horror movie. Everything was so well orchestrated. The score itself gave me goosebumps at times.The effects were really good as well.

118,TwistedContent,A Horror Gem of the 90's,7,16 April 2020,"The 90's doesn't have all that many horror gems in its crown, but one of them most definitely is ""Candyman"". In an early anticipation of the new re-imagining/spiritual sequel, I decided to do another re-watch of the first part, this time fully prepared to also give a try to its two sequels, no matter what cheese or injustice hides there, for I at least I know Tony Todd's there.""Candyman"" often gets compared with other horror movies of 80's and 90's and their horror icons, like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and such. I'd like to think that ""Candyman"" is a horror movie that, while it utilizes some of the similar story and style tropes, the gore and the effects these films are famous for, is a lot more serious one at its heart. I believe that, compared to most of its horror relatives, ""Candyman"" possesses very little camp, silliness and comedy, which is why it manages to be such a spooky tale. That, and also having an actual story. I haven't seen its sequels yet, of course. I long to read Clive Barker's ""The Forbidden"" on which ""Candyman"" is based on, but I haven't been able to get my hands on that particular story just yet. Besides the intimidating and undoubtedly iconic Candyman, put on like a glove on ever charming Tony Todd, the movie owes a lot also to its protagonist Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen). Virgina gives a solid lead performance as a student in search of the truth behind the myth of Candyman, following an intriguing and arguably compelling story that puts almost the entirety of the slasher movies to shame. And there's enough social commentary thoughtfully sprinkled over it. ""Candyman"" keeps the genre's trademark gore though, the great, appealing kind of practical FX galore, partially successfully not doing it just for its sake. However, the sum of all these amazing things doesn't reach the heights it maybe could. I feel like a decent amount of potential also fizzled out, I'm just not sure which department is to blame... Perhaps it was the somewhat anti-climatic ending, but that can't be entirely it. Maybe Bernard Rose lacked the full extent of style that could've been put into this, maybe he tried too much at overconvoluting the story as it went on, maybe there is indeed some amount of inescapable 90's cheese that's obscuring the full and dreadful picture. I don't know, You tell me.It's a cultured, elegant horror movie that might leave You wanting more, but what You get is more than worth it. I hope to god that the sequels have at least crumbs of the goodies encountered here. My rating: 7/10",Candyman
119,Gafke,Underrated Classic,9,20 May 2005,"Grad students Helen and Bernie are gathering information for their masters thesis concerning urban legends when Helen runs across the tale of Candyman, a demon who can be conjured by saying his name five times in front of a mirror. Further research leads Helen to Cabrini Green, a frightening ghetto project where everyone not only knows about Candyman but believe in him, and fear him. Helen does not believe in the legend of Candyman, until Candyman comes looking for her. When Bernie is brutally murdered and a baby goes missing from the projects, Helen is arrested, having been found at the scene of both crimes, covered in blood and wielding a weapon. No one believes her claims, that it was Candyman who committed the crimes. But Candyman offers her a bargain: her life in exchange for the baby's, who is still alive. Cruelly abandoned by her cheating jerk of a husband and pursued by the police, Helen returns to the projects for a final showdown with Candyman.Based on Clive Barker's short story ""The Forbidden,"" Candyman is a combination of the Bloody Mary legend, the Guy Fawkes celebration and The Phantom of the Opera. Virginia Madsen as Helen is beautiful and tragic and also damn scary when she wants to be. Tony Todd as Candyman is both horrific and tragic, evoking true, dark, Gothic horror whenever he appears on the screen. This is a stunningly original film, heavy with dread and never once going in for cheap scares. The acting is flawless, the musical score is creepy as hell, filled with ghostly organ music which sets just the right tone of sadness and fear. The setting of Cabrini Green is frighteningly convincing - it's a scary enough place without Candyman, filled with hopelessness and the constant threat of death. The violence is brutal and bloody, so be warned.This is not your typical teenage slasher film. Anyone with an appreciation for urban myths and legends, and for Clive Barker's excellent morbid imagination should not miss this film. It is a genuinely dark, moving tale of love, blood and horror, boasting realistic, three-dimensional characters instead of the usual one dimensional meat puppets for the horror grinder.

The Candyman is an urban legend; a man with a hook on a bloody stump where his hand should be, who only shows up when you repeat his name in the mirror five times. Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a student who is conducting a thesis on urban legends, focuses specifically on this one and finds out it is so much more than just a myth. Madsen is absolutely brilliant as Helen; her and Kasi Lemmons playing her friend and coworker Bernadette Walsh, are a good on screen duo and you really feel for them from the start. Helen's personal problems are also explored in her troubled marriage which is effectively done with a certain final scene where she gets to make her voice heard. The only reservation I have is that I'd heard how creepy this film was and although I found it really entertaining and had well filmed spooky sequences, I was never truly creeped out by it. The Candyman himself was shown a bit too much and therefore the scary mystery surrounding him didn't last long.

123,jayjaycee,"Sweet in the beginning, bitter in the end",6,13 October 2020,"""Candyman"" is a 1992 horror film directed by Bernard Rose starring Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd.
⚪
All in all, this adaptation of Clive Barker's short story might be(e) fascinating in the beginning and grabbed me, as it explores the lore of urban legends closely and with a genius kind of indirect intensity, but after that, the second half becomes a convoluted, tonally confused mess that doesn't even match the atmosphere the first half has built up, and neither great gore effects, the implemented social commentary on the treatment of the black community, nor the basically chilling mythical creature played by a charismatic Tony Todd sting enough no make up for it.
⚪
Even if I haven't seen it yet, it is undeniable that Clive Barker has written horror movie history with his infernal opus ""Hellraiser"", and he has become an icon for the fans thenceforth. The expectations towards the adaptation of his short story ""The Forbidden"" that deals with the myth of urban legends were accordingly high. I have heard from multiple people that they were utterly disappointed by this film and think that is has not aged well at all, others however still stated that it was a genuinely chilling horror classic that shouldn't be missed out. What side I am on? Well, at first I was on the side of those that think it is still a great flick, but the more the film moved on, the more I drifted towards the ""What is this film?"" faction. What I was frustrated about most is the simple fact that the film is basically divided into two tonally different halves that follow their own direction that, frankly, don't fit each other in the slightest. The first half, the one I favour, deals with protagonist Helen Lyle and how she researches the urban legend of ""Candyman"", a phantom killer with a hook for a hand. The way it is narrated is what makes it so moody in the first place, because like urban legends are principally told, Helen learns about the legend and how it was created via various recounts of people who tell her gradually more details about the infamous stories, and I think the approach to build up tension by only indirectly giving away details about the wraith is brilliant, because it encourages the viewers to connect the dots for themselves. To a certain degree, I even thought that the film would go into a totally non-graphic direction and would reveal that the ghost is nothing but a device to oppress and scare the people in the neighbourhood or simply and imposter. I knew that I let myself in on a horror/slasher film, but letting the film have the twist that it is nothing but a myth would have made it unexpectedly unpredictable. Well, almost exactly after the great first half, the suspension curve all suddenly drops rapidly and went into a direction I still cannot comprehend completely. The almost documentary approach was dropped entirely and made way for what I can best describe as a chaotic slasher that tries to be more than this but utterly fails to achieve this goal. With reaching this specific turning point, it showed its undeniably gruesome gore effects, but at the same time, forfeited its scariness. Even if the general appearance of Tony Todd as the titular entity is impressive and basically eerie, I think they totally wasted his character. He only appeared in the most stupid ways and when he was in the scene, it was anything but scary. It rather focussed on Helen Lyle, irrefutably decently portrayed by Madsen, and how she had to deal with what Candyman has caused. He only became a means to an end and didn't do any justice to his reputation. Of course, the dumb twist that she is the reincarnation of his beloved kept him from killing her right after she conjured him up, but if he is aware that she is his paramour, why does he play all those unnecessary games with her that do not only made the film extremely lengthy but also achieved the total opposite of what he wanted? Even if it might make sense in some twisted way, the film doesn't do much about humouring the audience. Admittedly, I felt how I was becoming gradually sleepier and a horror film shouldn't cause that in me, it should achieve the total opposite! And to be honest, there was zero chemistry between Todd and Madsen that made me assume that he loves her. Oh, and then there is this utterly nonsensical and ridiculous ending in the bonfire. The seemingly invincible entity that has no obvious weakness dies in the fire. I know that might be his tender spot considering that was the way he ultimately died by when he was still human, but it was idiotic of him to expose himself to this threat if he is aware of that. If there is one good aspect I want to conclusively point out, it has to be the social criticism on the treatment of the black community that is included on many occasions. In the end, though, this film is nothing but a convoluted mess that wanted to be many different things at the same time and sadly ended up being garbage. The beginning was nothing short of promising and gave me the feeling that I was in for something great, something that would not simply follow the dull pattern every single slasher follows, but then it ended up exactly like that, only more confusing. It thinks that it is more than an average horror flick, and that's one of its major disadvantages. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the urban legend. It might please many people out there, but it is a no from me.",Candyman
124,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Good one,6,18 June 2008,"Based on a story by Clive Barker and skillfully written and directed by Bernard Rose, Candyman rises above most horror films by eerily suggesting that some urban legends--in this case a particularly frightening one--have a spooky basis in reality. The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, and Candyman serves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.",Candyman
125,Rendanlovell,Good but flawed,7,6 July 2020,"This movie has a lot going for it. I don't think there's any doubt this is a B grade horror flick though. It's campy at times, it's jump scary, there's some bad performances, and the logic of it all is a little muddled. For the most part though, I like it. What this does well almost solely has to do with the actual Candyman. Man he's a cool slasher villain. Plus, Tony Todd is fantastic in the role. Without him and some creative/gruesome visuals this probably wouldn't work in the least. I think that specifically has to do with the structure. I liked the angle of making her seem crazy and the slight commentary on classicism. The problem is, I didn't understand why anything was happening. The whats are mostly there, the whys and hows aren't. What is Candyman? A vague serial killer in the projects. Why is candyman killing people? Uhhh because? How do you summon Candyman? You say name in the mirror 5 times, like bloody mary. So why does he kill some people but not other people? To uhhhhh grow his own legend? There's so many whys that arent answered here. Why can't he be seen by certain people? Why is the main character the ""chosen one""? Why does he appear in the mirror for some and not others? How can he do all the wild things he can do? How do you stop him? There's nothing particularly well developed or interesting enough to get you involved because there are so many unanswered questions.",Candyman

127,Jacques98,"It's just, well, what's the point . . . ?",1,8 January 2009,"Believe me, I know it's hard to look past nostalgia. But sometimes we all have to grow up and accept that not everything we loved as a kid was actually worthy of our love. For example, let's say you grew up with a certain stuffed animal, and then you turn 13 and you know it's time to detach yourself from it, but you can't. I know from experience that's how a lot of horror fans are with old slasher films. They watched Candyman when they were 5-years-old, and to this day their biased minds find it greater than anything any new horror film could possibly conceive. They overlook the fact that by today's standards, Candyman is pure cheese. I'm not writing this review for those people. There is nothing whatsoever I can say here that would even slightly change your opinion. I'm writing this highly negative review for the open-minded horror fans out there, who have yet to see this so-called ""classic"".First and foremost, as I said, Candyman is pure, unabashed cheese horror. The first time you see the actual Candyman himself, you'll probably laugh out loud and roll around on the floor like I did. Putting a man in an over-sized fur coat with a cheap plastic hook sticking out one end isn't exactly terrifying stuff, I'm sorry to say. Coming from a horror fan who has actually matured with the times, this is about as scary to me as a walrus with a toy chainsaw. Put simply, the only reason this film is so bad is because it's so cheesy, yet it takes itself as seriously as if it's dealing with something that isn't straight out of a children's cartoon. Don't get me wrong, I very much appreciate the serious tone, but it's downright stupid in this context. It's a film about killer medicine cabinets, folks, not the real-life Holocaust or something.The story is about as generic and uncreative as a horror movie can get. It's a play on the old Bloody Marry myth, and the plot direction takes the same path that has been rehashed countless times in films just like it before. Woman reporteralready a horror cliché and I haven't even gotten through three words of the synopsisis investigating a murder, she discovers a myth, she researches it, the myth comes to haunt her. Oh man, how original. Do not tell me Candyman started these clichés, because it didn't. This exact plot has been used in everything from 60s horror films to episodes of 80s cartoons. There is nothing creative here. The ending is a rip-off of an old Twilight Zone episode. The movie is so generic and unoriginal, I have nothing more to say about it. Other than it's also boring to the point of nausea.I was never a Clive Baker fan for this exact reason. He's so obsessed with over-the-top, cheesy villains and cliché situations, I find almost everything he's written nearly unreadable. I know this will anger his fans, but, sorry, if there is anyone who I blame for the cheese-horror outbreak, it's him. And Candyman is the single most typical work he's ever done.Is there a single positive thing I can say here? No. I can at least cut some cheese-horror films slack for at least having some creativity (Sleepaway Camp for example), but I can't even do that here. In other words, Candyman is a bland, generic slasher with a laughable villain and unoriginal premise. And I've written this exact review so many times I might as well just save it, change the movie title, and repost it for every 80s and 90s slasher film out there, because no matter how much faith I have there may be at least one slasher that isn't bad, they almost all are. And what's even sadder is that they're almost all acclaimed. Am I really the only one who looks past nostalgia anymore?0/10",Candyman

Skeptic Helen takes an interest in the myth when A woman is murdered and people claim that was the candyman and finds out numerous similar murders have occurred in the Chicago Cabrini Green Projects. The film is a slow paced buildup to it payoff don't expect a huge body count for this it not that kind of film. It's a build around the presence of Candyman and the myth. It really put the urban in urban legend most films. Involving ghost nowadays always take place in quiet suburban neighborhood, having the decision to take place in the projects add to the movie's tone just The look of this decrepit and neglect complex makes it more gritty and real. The music is eerie and creepy the chorus of voices over the shots of the city are great. Along with some very graphic moments that build up the film with it psychological tone. The only fault it has is the characters Helen while not the most interesting protagonist in a horror film she's somebody you can you can get behind given what she goes through as everything she slowly loses. Tony Todd as Candyman is the star of the movie his He's like a mix between Freddy Krueger and the phantom of the opera where it's people believing that keeps him alive.his imposing stature and bombastic voice leaves a lasting impression still one of the most iconic villains of horror. Outside of the two of them none of the rest of cast really stand out all that much. With it chilling music and urban tone Candyman is one of the genre defining films of all time.

And thanks to Tony Todd's spine-chilling role as the classic horror character, you'll remember the excitement you received as the story continued it's gripping motion.Candyman is definitely a freaky slasher you'd mention to new teen fans of horror films. It's not so much scary, but it contains its quite frightening moments and never shies away from bloody killings. This movie is also a fun urban-legend horror film with a well-crafted myth that's both average and ingenious at the same time.Unfortunately, the film is quite overrated and isn't worth all the hype due to the lack of speeding momentum. Candyman begins thoroughly clearly with a clever idea before sprinting down to the slow and extended energy that we weren't expecting. It's around the last 35 minutes in which the story begins to increase its eagerness with twists and unsettling imagery. It's a remarkable horror classic but is no where near worth all the fuss.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Candyman
130,AndreiPavlov,An epic battle of a lonely woman against evil,8,8 September 2009,"I'll start off with a flaw, which just gets into my eyes like a mismatched puzzle bit. The ending. What a cheap ending it is! It is so out of place here. Why should the director yell his throat out with this trashy ""in your face"" post-climax? It is as bad as the ending of the original ""Elm Street"". Therefore I watch this movie only till the moment when the ex-husband pronounces ""Helen"" in the dark room. Right after that I skip to the rolling titles. And this is how the film should be watched. The husband left alone with that young careless student finds himself in hell already. Misery is his only friend from now and on. There is absolutely no need in killing him off. And besides, Helen should not have turned into a monster: after all she defeated Candyman and saved a child. It's really painful to see how a brilliant film gets spoilt at the last minute. I feel like kicking the director's butt for this.So, if I watch the movie my way (skipping the trashy ""shock"" ending) - it's a masterpiece with a definite 10 out of 10 from me. But if I let it all go the way it's done by the director - it's only a 5 out of 10.While I have this film on DVD and can easily skip one little scene (no big trouble - I just have to push ""next chapter"" button on my DU at the right moment), I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10. An almost brilliant film. Thank you for attention.",Candyman
131,zmaturin,Disappointing.,1,3 May 2000,"With his big fur coat, giant hook hand, and bee-stung body, Candyman is a very cool character, played by Tony Todd, a very cool actor. Unfortunately, he's only in this movie for about twelve minutes. The rest of the time is spent with an uninteresting grad student who is doing research on urban legends (horror movies have taught me that there's always a class on urban legends at every college). She unearths the tale of Candyman, which apparently ticks the guy off, because he lives on through word of mouth, and if she demystifies him he'll die- I think. The movie's kind of confusing. At one point the uninteresting grad student talks to an older colleague who also wrote a paper on Candyman, but Candyman seemingly has no interest in killing him- oh, wait, because the uninteresting grad student is a reincarnation of his past love or something. Again, the movie's kind of confusing. Not very scary, either- although the part where Candyman slices off a young boy's genitalia and throws them in a toilet goes beyond any John Waters movie in the ugly bad taste department.This movie has a lot of good ideas, and the art direction is good, but the slow pacing and dull characters really hurt it.

I really wanted to like this movie, its not badly directed or acted its just badly written, it could be better if they would have done some rewriting, they could have changed some dialog and make more sense out of some scenes, have a better lead, or maybe they could have established some of the rules for this Candyman character, why does he kill people specifically? why does he die at the end if hes a ghost? can he be hurt in real life? the whole thing is rather inconsistent, that and the bad dialog keeps me from liking this, it needs to be somewhat grounded, otherwise it feels like you are making stuff up as you go along.It has some aspects that I found interesting, but the bad overcomes the good.",Candyman

Virginia Madsen is the plucky journalist eager to get to the bottom of the story. The set pieces are gripping, and Tony Todd's performance is bone chilling.

We get some great performances by virtually everyone, especially Virginia Madsen, and Tony Todd's iconic Candyman doesn't make an appearance until 45min in. And what a great introduction it is. The movie was never truly scary to me, only very creepy and disturbing in parts. Loosely based on a Clive Barker story, who's one of my favorite authors of all time, this should be expected. As were the sexual and romantic undertones, however subtle until the latter half.

Madsen bears up under the camera's scrutiny quite well, and does a convincing job with her role. The title character's monotone recitations of the silly lines he's given, which perfectly matches the tediously droning score (by Philip Glass, of all people), makes you almost glad he was stung to death by bees in his former life.  There were a few jump-out-at-you moments that were more startling than scary.  You can see the surprise ending coming, but it's still pretty cool.

140,extravaluejotter,How an Urban Legend ought to be...,7,14 October 2006,"""Candyman"" has its origin in Clive Barker's ""Books of Blood"", a collection of short horror stories that showcase Barker's talent for the bizarre, poignant and unsettling. The original story is set on a Liverpool council estate but the film moves it to Chicago(?).Normally, I despise American adaptations of foreign films and books. Taking a story away from its original cultural context can rip the guts out of it, and Americans are the most insensitive surgeons in this respect. However, ""Candyman"" proves me wrong, apart from the rather ridiculous way in which the scary bloke with the bees is summoned. Perhaps this is because Bernard Rose, the director and writer is English? Despite transplanting the action to an American city (and dreaming up the lame ""Say his name 5 times"" schtick) Rose does a good job of creating a creepy atmosphere and sustaining suspense.There's very little in this film that wasn't in the original short story and there's very little ""Standard Horror"" blood-and-entrails excess too. Tony Todd's Candyman exudes a quiet and purposeful sense of menace without the actor having to enact innumerable scenes of ""Stalk and Slash"", which is the major strength of the film. Too many horror films take a predictable route to gory voyeurism. ""Candyman"" stands out because it takes us through the dark woods, rather than down the straight track to the slaughterhouse.Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkely do well in their roles and they are backed up by a fine cast. The only downside to this brooding horror flick is that the door was left open for a sequel.

142,refinedsugar,Mixed feelings,6,8 March 2001,"Candyman is a gem of a horror movie ... in comparison to the lackluster entries into the genre of late. Which says much about the sorry state of horror. Unfortunately, by it's own merits, it isn't everything and more. The one thing that cannot be refuted is it's great word of mouth. Upon it's initial release, I heard such great things about it and even now many years down the road, it's kept in high regard by many. So admitting my disappointment finally having seen Candyman ... is bittersweet.I see why people rally behind it. The story is certainly mature, which is refreshing. It flows with a real life darkness and a gory atmosphere along with stronger than average leads in Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen. There just happens to be a significant downside in my book. It isn't overly scary - whenever mature or not - whenever it's a traditional horror film or not - and the story is functional at best. An urban legend based out of a primary geographical location and carried on by a selective demography of people. Colleges always teach this stuff? in movies? in real life? Hmm.I can't deny the name Clive Barker and the association that brings had a part in setting my expectations high and hype left unchecked can derail a movie before you even see it. Maybe this is one of those times, but being blunt, Candyman is overrated. Yes, the principle leads are good, particularly, I speak of Tony Todd as the principle character. He's done with a simple sort of flair, but obviously has tapped into something. That cannot be dismissed. He's ripe for exploration and exploitation (see: sequels of diminishing returns). However the movie this character is housed in isn't groundbreaking.We're not all going to agree on this, but Candyman is still better than the majority of garbage being sold under the horror banner these days. It doesn't bring that much needed spark to a genre that's seen it's share of dog days, but it's decent in it's own right. Only not to the extent some people make it out to be.",Candyman

Candyman goes from bad, to worse in a descending spiral into cinematographic badness... The whole movie, from the silly urban legend to the filming of it in a housing project is a nightmare, and I mean a nightmare not from a horror movie perspective... The musical score is annoying, to say the least. Phillip Glass is as minimalists as he is repetitive. The interracial love story adds little to the film, the ""twist"" ending was as predictable as cold weather in the winter. Acting is so-so. So why do so people rave about it? I do not have the foggiest idea... Maybe people are hypoglycemic, who knows?Maybe it is because it tried to a ""different"", ""innovative"" horror movie. But it ended up being pretty boring and lame. Not even the Candyman was scary; he looks like the stereotypical pimp from ""Starsky and Hutch""!Instead of watching this heap of fermented, rotten candy I recommend ""The Mothman Profecies"", which is a movie that deals with an eerie urban legends in a much more entertaining way.",Candyman

As played by Tony Todd, attractive and seductive in the role, only Madsen's character interests him. Then there are the typical bogus elements of his suddenly becoming oddly vulnerable at the end - taking a nap, even - despite some serious supernatural abilities. This actually galled me more than anything, Madsen's getting the upper hand on him physically when dude could pretty much appear, disappear, fly, and anything else you care to name. Madsen, to her credit, actually invests something like authentic, explicable reaction in this slush. Still. Pass on this one.",Candyman
155,Snake-666,Dark and atmospheric modern horror masterpiece,8,6 June 2003,"This dark and unnerving horror outing based on a story by Clive Barker and directed by Bernard Rose has quite rightly earned a reputation as one of the best horror films of the Nineties.The story follows Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), a researcher for a University as she works on her latest thesis regarding modern urban legends. After hearing stories about the myth of the Candyman (Tony Todd) she and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) decide to investigate the myth further. According to the legend if you stare into a mirror and recite the word `candyman' five times then you will call him and he will come for you so obviously that is what Helen decides to do, but it didn't work.or did it?Candyman' has to be credited as at least one of the top five horror films of the 1990's due to its interesting and unnerving subject matter. The story takes the ideas of harmless urban legends (much similar to the Bloody Mary' legend) and gives them an evil and physical form. While some people have slated Candyman' for ignoring its own rules I don't think it did. Candyman' is not a straight forward horror film; there is an intricate plot which requires thought to be fully understood. The Candyman is expected to act one way but chooses to do otherwise, he plays games and confuses people with riddles, why does he do this? Those are the type of things that people make complaints about when talking about this film, he should do one thing but does another, however the reasoning for this is explained in the film if people look for the answer. Candyman' itself is a rather interesting and complex puzzle that needs thought to figure out.Bernard Rose does a great job of creating an unnerving and dark atmosphere which is complimented perfectly by the haunting music. The film has an almost religious feel to it without actually being a religious-based movie and an abundant sense of dread is created through some inventive and impressive direction. Virginia Madsen's performance should be acknowledged as well as she plays her role very well, even generating feelings of sympathy for her character.The only thing I'd say that this film lacks is character development. While Madsen's character is developed well the other characters in the film, including the Candyman himself, remain rather under-developed. While I will agree that leaving a certain air of mystique to the Candyman is a good idea and enhances the whole experience I feel that Bernadette and Trevor Lyle (Xander Berkley) become almost unrelated characters. The relationships between Helen and these two characters aren't explored enough and this I feel negatively effected a couple of scenes where these were pivotal characters.However, even taking that into consideration Candyman' is definitely worth watching for horror fans and even just casual movie fans. This is a quite ingenious and thought-provoking movie that doesn't rely on gore and cheap effects but rather its self-generated dark atmosphere to provide tension and shocks. My rating for Candyman'  8/10",Candyman
156,RomanJamesHoffman,The sleep of reason creates monsters,9,6 April 2014,"""Candyman"" is, quite simply, a remarkable film. More than that, it is a remarkable horror filmwhich is no small feat considering the cynical ""seen-it-all-before-and-know-when-the-scares-are-coming"" attitudes most cinema- goers show towards horror movies. And yet, ""Candyman"" not only has a power to chill, but the power to chill beyond the first viewing. So, what's to account for this? Well, special mention at the outset needs to go to Phillip Glass's eerie and fragile score which carries the melancholy at the heart of the story more than any amount of exposition. Next up is the fact that the movie is an adaptation of the Clive Barker short story ""The Forbidden"", a man whom Stephen King called ""the future of horror"" and a writer as cerebral as he is visceral; something which this adaptation does more than adequate justice to in both capturing the essence of Barker's short story, as well as expanding on it. In particular the figure of the Candyman, a mythical figure who is said to appear in the mirror if you say his name five times to garrote the invoker with his hook-for-a-hand and who sustains himself through the fear urban myths of him generate, is taken from the story (as is much of the Candyman's actual dialogue). However, in the short story the protagonist Helen (played in the film by Virginia Madsen) is writing a paper on graffiti and stumbles into the world of urban myths, whereas in the movie Helen and her cohort Bernadette are post-graduate students at the Universtiy of Illinois explicitly writing about the persistence of urban myths from a debunking perspective. However, Helen's fierce skepticism is not content to just documentshe willfully tests the superstition demonstrated by most, even her supposedly intellectual, rational co-researcher and for this eventually gets physically assaulted by a psychotic hood in Cabrini Green, the predominantly black housing project where Candyman is said to haunt. Following this attack, Helen sees the Candyman himself and all manner of gruesome and bloody murders are committed in a way which suggests either the manifestation of a myth or the delusional acts of Helen herself. As such, the movie plays on the audience's fear that those stories we laugh about others believing may have more than a grain of truth to them. What's more, the movie elaborates on the element at social class hinted at in Barker's short story and expands it to encompass race by making Candyman black, and his tragic back story the result of racism. In doing so it adds a poignant and vivid dimension to the story as well as also feeding on all sorts of neuroses white-middle class people (like Helen) have to repress in order to enjoy their privileged lives.Film critic Roger Ebert praised the movie's intelligence but despaired of what he called the movie's ""extraneous violence"", even speculating that at the script stage the story was more refined and the gore was the result of Hollywood execs. Well, personally I don't think it's all that gory and the violence is far from ""extraneous"" considering both the racial lynchings which occurred in living memory and which shadow the film in the guise of the Candyman's back story, as well as the simple fact that even though ""The Forbidden"" isn't Barker's goriest story by a long stretch it still has eyes being pulled out, genitals cut off, and dead babies rolling across the floor. So much for Ebert's opinion. As it stands, being as society is still rife with racial differences and superficial rationalism predominates our worldview, the film, now over twenty years old, retains all of the qualities that made it powerful when it was released and remains a high-watermark in modern urban horror and Gothic high-romance.",Candyman
157,Benslie,Not for me but can see why it's a cult classic,8,28 August 2021,"For older horror movies there's one common problem that I've noticed and that's the pacing in the movies usually isn't that great but I got to say that with this movie it didn't really have that issue. I honestly really liked the slow pacing in the beginning that speeds up once Candyman, played by Tony Todd, shows up towards the end of the movie. The slower pacing gives the movie time for us to get to know our characters and learn the full story with the Candyman urban legend. I also enjoyed that due to the slower pacing we got to fully see Helen slowly start to change. When we first meet her, she's this undergrad student who will do anything in order to get information on Candyman and very slowly as the movie goes on you see her starting to lose her mind over this to the point where she just gives in to him. I do have to say this was beautifully acted out by Virginia Madsen who was a real stand-out for me in this movie. Another stand out for me was Tony Todd who plays the title character. You don't see him till the movie is almost over but once you hear his voice you can automatically tell how menacing he is and steals the show. The gothic score done by Phillip Glass was eerie and helped put the audience in an uneasy state. I did enjoy how this movie handled the racism element in this movie. Candyman never explicitly made it about racism only hinting at it throughout the movie with Candyman's backstory and with the bad neighbourhood. Overall, Candyman 1992 is a good movie that is very important and I can see why people enjoy this movie.",Candyman

159,Wilbur-10,Looks good - starts OK but steadily declines to a poor conclusion by which time most viewers will have long past caring.,5,26 September 2001,"***Possible Plot Spoilers***Scripted from Clive Barker's story 'The Forbidden', with the setting moved from Liverpool to Chicago, 'Candyman' is helmed by ex-music video director Bernard Rose. As is the norm with recent horror releases, the film hardly seems deserving of a cinema release, offering little more than your average video fodder.The story involves a female researcher Helen Lyle (Madsen), and her investigations into the myth of the Candyman, a supernatural killer who appears when his name is spoken 5 times into a mirror. Information leads to a run-down block of flats where murders have been attributed to the Candyman. Helen soon becomes entangled with the mythical elements, implicating herself with the deaths.I really don't know what has happened to the horror genre in the last 20 years. I'm a massive horror fan, but films like 'Candyman' cannot hold a candle up to the Universal films of the 30's & 40's, Val Lewton's films for RKO, the Vincent Price period dramas of the 60's, or the multitude of Hammer films from the late 50's onwards. Some of these films may have been cheaply made or badly acted, but they never treated the viewer with ignorance. They always had a good storyline and were directed, if not with skill, always with passion. Maybe, since the likes of 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th', the contemporary horror fan is more than satisfied with the likes of 'Candyman'. I beg them to watch eg. 'The Black Room (1935), 'Bride of Frankenstein' (1935), 'Don't Look Now' (1973), 'Eyes Without a Face' (1959), 'Frankenstein' (1931), 'Freaks' (1932), 'The Haunting' (1963), 'Mad Love' (1935), 'Revenge of Frankenstein' (1958), to name but some of the horror classics which have more than stood the test of time.In 'Candyman', the expectations which the unfolding of the story present, are so quickly dispensed with to make room for the usual scenes of slasher violence, that it seems pointless that they were bothered with at all. Don't get me wrong, as a horror fan I am not averse to any scenes of gory violence - I just object when they are randomly put in as set-pieces to keep the 4th rate script and narrative moving along.'Candyman' has a glossy exterior, but delivers neither depth or excitement and becomes little more than a 90-minute TV movie. Watch 'Cagney & Lacey' and save yourself the video rental fee.",Candyman

Not all of the actings were at the top but still any of them was a vibe killer for me.I found the story very original, am saying this knowing it was based on a short story, never felt like it was a copycat or something. The pacing is decent and the coloring is also well made.

The movie never drags and even though the climax may not be to everyone's taste,it is definitely worth watching. There is quite a bit of blood and gore so it may not be for the very squeamish.I suppose it does take a while to get going and you do have to wait a bit for the Candyman to appear,but I found it worth the wait and a fine example of a pretty bleak but effective chiller.",Candyman

165,jackbanister16,This movie takes an interesting route.,7,4 November 2014,"Wow. What a creepy movie. Never judge a book by its cover because I had this movie pegged as a slasher flick and was totally wrong.While it does have elements of a slasher movie, ""Candyman"" works on an entirely different spectrum, the psyche. If you had to find a somewhat similar villain to the Candyman, you would be safe comparing him to Freddy Krueger; Both operate on a thin line between the physical and the ethereal realms. The Candyman isn't merely there to say boo and scare you, he haunts you, he ruins your life, and he causes you to go insane! Helen, the woman we follow throughout the film pulls a classic horror movie faux pas and continues to stick her beak into some seriously spooky stuff. She ventures into the hood, breaks into the Candyman's slaughter house, and worst of all...says Candyman five times...Instead of killing her on the spot, the Candyman takes a particular liking to her (he imagines her as a past girlfriend), in an odd case of love he starts to kill everyone she cares about and because he is a phantom, an urban legend, Helen is blamed for the murders. Long story short, it doesn't take Helen that long to go insane and be institutionalized... I won't spoil the ending, but it's pretty spooky. Tony Todd is INCREDIBLY creepy as Candyman. His deep voice and menacing grin will haunt you the night you watch the movie, if not longer. He doesn't appear too often, but when he does, he leaves a lasting impression. The setting in this film is superb. The urban setting provides a stark contrast from the ivy league college where the movie starts. Almost more haunting than the Candyman are the graffiti laden and abandoned projects he inhabits. Excellent cinematography help bring out the best of the setting. Definitely an artistic achievement!The reason I couldn't rate this movie higher is because it suffers from 90's cheesiness. Some scenes that seemed gruesome or disturbing at the time just look over-done, laughably bad, or just seem irrelevant with all the different stuff that's been done over the years. This movie would be a GREAT candidate in my opinion for a remake, and I would pay full admission price to see it. Loved the original, but I think it would GREATLY benefit from a ""makeover,"" so to speak... So I dare you...after you watch the movie, look in the mirror and say, ""Candyman"" 5 times!",Candyman

There aren't to many serious urban horrors. It's got a decent enough premise. It's slow in carrying it out though. Virgina Madsen is a good quality actress. She really makes you feel for her with all of the insanity that's going on.Everybody knows that Candyman is Tony Todd's most recognizable role. Tony is creepy, but this movie works by the idea that less is more. The less you see Candyman the more scary he will be. Granted they didn't have to go with a ""Jason"" style exposure for him. It would have been nice to see more of him.Everything feels as if it reveals and finishes everything too fast. We don't get a clue as to what's really going on until the movie is almost over.

169,mauriciofernandogerhardt,The story:,7,9 July 2019,"A blond woman, who has a husband, is writing her thesis on an urban legend ""the candyman"".
Originally he was a black man who was hired to do a portrait of a rich man's daughter. The black man and the daughter fell in love and she got pregnant. The rich man decided to tell his man to cut his hand off and break honeycombs on him, so that bees would sting him to death.
Later, the urban myth continued.
The last time it was heard of, was in a building for public housing. There, supposedly the candyman came through the wall and killed a woman.
The blond woman, and her girl friend goes to the building to do research. She finds out that there's a natural passage between the apartments through the bathroom mirror, because of a recess in the wall. She goes through it to take pictures. There's graffiti on the walls about the candyman.
A woman resident comes to find out what this white woman is doing in their building. The 2 outsiders join the resident at her apartment. The resident has a dog and a baby, and tells the others that she had heard the woman who died screaming. She called the cops, but they didn't come.
There's a story about a second murder, with the candyman taking the life of a child and putting his head on a bathroom toilet nearby.
The blond woman comes another day alone, to get some more answers and take more pictures. A boy shows her to the toilet where the boy's head had been. There's more graffiti on the walls about the candyman, and the toilet has a lot of bees in it. When she's about to leave the place, a gang shows up, and one of them, who has entitled himself candyman, threatens her and hits her over the head with a hook.
Time is skipped and we see her at the police station identifying the gang member. He gets arrested.
The blond's friend tells her that since she was in the news, people are interested in publishing her story.
Skip to the blond is going to her car, when she hears the Candyman, not the gang member, but the myth. He wants her to want to be his victim. After some talk she becomes unconscious.
She wakes up lying in a pool of blood in the bathroom of the apartment of the female resident of the public housing. She hears screams, she opens the bathroom, she finds a dog with his head decapitated, and a cleaver to it's side. She gets the cleaver, and goes to the next room, where she can still hear screams. She finds the resident asking ""where is he?"", wondering where is her baby. The resident believes the blond to have taken or killed her baby and attacks her, hitting the blond's head to the ground. The blond defend herself by knicking the resident's arm, which bleeds. The cops get to the apartment at that time and arrest the blond.
In jail she calls her husband and lawyer to get her out. She hasn't been charged yet, because the police wants to find the baby's body to charge her for murder.
At her home, she has visions again of the candyman. Her friend has come to visit her. Someone kills the friend, the husband comes later, the blond woman has blood on her, a knife, and a cut on her neck.
She's taken to a psychiatric facility. She's tied to a bed. She wants to be freed to be able to defend herself against the candyman, who has come for her again.
After a month of being under drugs, she gets to see the psychiatrist, who asks her if she has seen the candyman with her on the first day she was there. He shows her a video, where there's no candyman, contrary to what she had seen before. She doesn't understand! She can prove the candyman is real by calling him. She looks at a mirror and calls him 5 times, he kills the psychiatrist and frees her, and crashes open a window. An alarm sounds. The blond escapes through the window, goes to another room, attacks a nurse, gets her clothes and keys and escapes the place.
She goes to her home, to find her husband with one of his students. She says he was all she had left. They are afraid of her. She says she's not a murderer and leaves.
She goes to the public housing building and finds candyman, she accepts to be taken by him, and become a myth as well, as long as he gives the baby back.
He opens up his chest and mouth to show a swarm of bees and kisses her to transform her.
She wakes up alone and hears the cries of the baby in a pile of junk close by.
She takes a hook with her and starts opening a way into the pile. As she gets in, the boy that had helped her before sees the hook going inside and thinks its the candyman. He gathers his friend to torch the pile of junk. As the blond finds the baby, and the pile starts to burn, the candyman appears telling her he knew she'd get in there. She says he has lied to him, by putting the baby in harm's way. She shoves a burning piece of wood inside him, which starts to burn him.
She protects the baby as she slithers out of the pile and gets burned. She's able to get out and deliver the baby safely to his mother. The people that gathered around the pile put out her fire, but the burns have killed her. Apparently the candyman is dead.
On her burial there's initially only her husband, the student, and another coworker. Then, a hundred people from the public housing come to pay respects to her. The boy who had helped her before, but also killed her by setting the place on fire, throw a hook inside her grave, next to her coffin.
Skip to the husband and the student in the apartment that belonged to the husband and the blond. The husband is remembering how his life used to be with the blond, and is crying out her name, in front of a mirror, 5 times. She shows up with a burnt face, and kills him. When the student comes open the bathroom door, she's holding a knife.
There's a graffiti of her in the public housing building as if she was a saint.
The end.
The interpretations:
1) There's a candyman:
Believe what's showed on the screen:
He wanted his previous life: Him together with his lover (which he believed the blond to be) and a baby.
He's not living anymore, but a myth that lives on people's dreams, on hushed words, and words on the walls. He can be eternal, and show up whenever people start to doubt him, because he only exists because people believe he exists. He wants the blond to be a myth as well, and people to tell both of their deaths over and over.
He can choose to appear to only the people he chooses. Possibly he can hypnotise people. He had to appear to blondie because she was dismistifying him, which would destroy him.
He has been killed, and in his place, there's a new myth, of the burned blond who saves children and kills cheating men.
2) There's no candyman:
Don't believe when he's shown on the screen:
From researching so much about the candyman, plus seeing graffiti about the candyman, plus getting lots of flashes in her eyes from her photography machines, plus meeting a person who calls himself the candyman, plus finding a toilet full of bees, plus possible black mold from an abandoned apartment, plus getting hit on the head, could've made her unconscious make her believe she was seeing candyman.
When she wakes up on the apartment of the resident, it was she who killed the dog and got the baby before and hid it somewhere else.
When the friend shows up, it is she who kills her, and then cuts herself.
When the psychiatrist gets killed, it is she who got herself loose from the straps (possibly by convincing the psychiatrist that she needed to be loosen to summon the candyman, and he believed he could take her), then killed him, then broke the window, and escaped.
When she went to the public housing building, she rescued the baby from where she had hid him before.
When the husband gets killed, it would've been because the student got crazy too and killed him, which is pretty unlikely.
So it probably means that the writer couldn't come up with a scene with two interpretations for the end, or that he could but the test audience didn't like it, or that the writer preferred to end it this way either because he liked it because there's a final jump scare, or because he wanted to have an opening to make another movie.
As a thinking viewer, I'd prefer a movie without that scene, so it could have 2 perfect interpretations.",Candyman

Without these things, I am nothing.""Clive Barker films have always had interesting 'villains' cause in a sense they are not truly villains as the protagonists tend to provoke them into their work. Of course, everyone remembers Pinhead from the ""Hellraiser"" series as being one of the ultimate baddies. But I would like to argue that Candyman could easily come up in that list too. Built upon a similar concept as Freddy Krueger, Candyman only lives on through the fear and whispers of his existence so when Madsen's character threatens that he takes action to conserve and punish those whom threaten him. It takes the urban legend concept and turns it on its head. Not to mention with Tony Todd's bad-ass vocal delivery, bloody hook hand, and monstrous fur coat that hides a hive of bees in his chest, the design of Candyman is quite frankly - HORRIFYING. So by the time he does show up in the film (about half way through or so) his legend is built up that you're not sure what he's going to do - and uncertainty is horrifying too. Throw on that Todd's awesome and subtle acting (is he pained to do what he does? why is she always been the one?) one isn't sure his motives, despite what he says, but we know they are there. And that's brilliant. if you appreciate horror, then you will like this. Viginia Madsen turns in a great performance and Tony Todd is beyond menacing in the role of Candyman.I recommend watching this with a few friends because it is a crowd pleaser.Good direction, great acting, and scenery so real you can almost taste it -""Sweets for the Sweet"" This dark and unnerving horror outing based on a story by Clive Barker and directed by Bernard Rose has quite rightly earned a reputation as one of the best horror films of the Nineties.

172,Kristamw,"Dark, Very Dark",8,19 October 2019,"Writing Quality: Very mysterious and serious. This is a well-written script with a dark psychological edge. Characters are fascinating, especially ""Candyman"", a dark menacing presence that unsettles your stomach.
Scare Factor: Most of the film focuses on grad student Helen and her partner Bernadette on their mission to uncover the truth behind the legend of Candyman to complete their thesis. But there are a few sudden jump scares that rip your heart out of its nice resting place.
Content (sex, language & violence): No sex, but we see Helen's breast (a non-sexual side shot) and a girl's nipples through her shirt. A few curse words uttered, but hardly noticeable. Violence is swift and at times gory, though the gore is shown in the aftermath and the actual kills are heard rather than seen, but still quite violent in nature and terrifying.

173,Stephen-12,A cut above the rest,7,3 June 1999,"Candyman won't go down as the greatest film ever, or even the greatest horror film ever. But in its genre, it's one of the superior films of its kind to have appeared recently.Where the film scores is in its juxtaposition and contrast of two kinds of fear: fear of death by supernatural forces, and fear of death at the hands of other humans. The urban decay into which Helen wanders is as chilling and disturbing as the Candyman's own appearances. Like 'Seven', the film uses its urban setting not just as an unpleasant backdrop, but as an integral part of the film's fabric, strengthening its impact and relevance.Virginia Madsen gives a fine performance (under the circumstances - no Oscars here). She looks older than her 29 years, which again helps the film to stand out since it's not about teenagers in peril but about mature characters about whom we might actually care. The supporting cast aren't bad, either, though this is really Madsen's show. She looks nothing like her brother, does she?Intelligently scripted, and carefully crafted (others have drawn attention to Philip Glass's excellent score - another splendid move by the film makers), this is vastly superior to the Elm Street series. Only the ending disappoints. Otherwise, good work.",Candyman

Virginia was very sexy as the young unsuspecting student who investigates the murders of people of a murdered black slave who has a hook for a hand who lures his victims with candy but its really wrapped-up razors and then splits them wide open with his hook.I have said Candyman 5 times in the mirror and nothing happened! But it is a great film and the music is spooky but awesome and the setting is rather Silence of the Lambs like, remember Jodie in the garage well it Virginia in the wall of a ghetto building.

175,dreamingskychild,So this is what early 90s horror is like? Awesome!,8,9 July 2020,"I'm having a horror movie spree at the moment. I haven't really seen any old horror films! So I thought I'd begin with the 90s, starting with Candyman. Can I just, wow! I loved a lot about the film. The storyline of it was very interesting and reeled me in, I was surprised a couple times by the direction it took, something I always like. I loved the suspense, the jumps (well there were a couple for me haha), and the atmosphere of creepy and intrigue that was created throughout the film. I loved so much the awesome artwork created for the Candyman story! I was pleasantly surprised to see that Philip Glass composed the soundtrack as well. The special effects and gore in this film, I'm not in a position to say if it was good quality for it's time, but I thought it was reasonably done. The special effects were eerie and fun, and the gore made me really uncomfortable. As for the acting, I enjoyed it and thought it was good. Especially by the two leads, particularly the protagonist. There are some cheesy acting bits in a couple of scenes, but as a whole this movie, the acting and story had me at the edge of my seat. All and all, I approve of this film and am glad I watched it. To those of you who like the horror genre, it's worth a night of popcorn! Just a caution to those who are uncomfortable with blood, and graphic content.",Candyman
176,ivony,The Candyman definitely can...,8,9 September 2003,"Being a horror movie buff, I have no idea how this little gem escaped me the first time around. I'd heard a lot about it, read about it, etc but wrote it off as ""probably stupid"" like most of the other horror movies I had so wanted to see.  So, it wasn't until many years after the movie's release that I finally saw it.  And boy am I glad I did!Surprisingly, the acting is fabulous...especially for a horror movie.  Each character portrayed fantastically so as to add to the movie, rather than detract.  No one really went over the top or became TOO dramatic.  Overall, each character was portrayed realistically.  As for the plot: absolutely wonderful premise playing on the Bloody Mary urban legend. Surprisingly, the movie delivers on aspects of believabilty. Of course we don't *really* expect Candyman to pop out of a mirror, but how many of us have started the ""Bloody Mary"" chant only to stop at the very last one, not daring to continue?  Our fears lie behind what COULD happen and the possibility that maybe..just maybe it's all real.  Candyman plays on that fear and takes us even further over the edge.The movie rids itself of the typical cliches  (white, undefeatable stalker chasing half naked twits) and allows itself to be an entirely enjoyable, CEREBRAL horror movie.  At first we wonder if the Candyman is perhaps just a person pretending to be him, then we start to question Helen's own sanity...wondering perhaps if SHE isn't the ""real Candyman"".  Eventually, the movie leads us to an ending that answers our questions but doesn't shove those answers down our throat.  Candyman also does what very few horror movies are capable of:  it succeeded in having a strong ending rather than fizzling out during the last 10-15 minutes.The setting and atmosphere are top notch.  Using Chicago and Cabrini Green as its stage was perfect...bringing into play racial issues without going over the top or getting ""in your face"" to the point of losing its focus. The music in Candyman adds a mysterious mood that matches the dark, dismal atmosphere of the lone apartments in Cabrini Green.All in all on my horror movie scale, I give Candyman a 10.  To me, it was purely artistic and absolutely enjoyable.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone even slightly interested in horror movies.",Candyman
177,vosnescis,pretty awful,1,19 March 2020,"I got tricked by the reviews into thinking this would be good.Instead its just got a poetically vague and unintelligible villain, tedious scenes, a few camera jump scares, a clear intention to sell breast shots a few times, a cheesiness to everything (especially the ending), and a detached-from-reality monologue 90'sness to it all.",Candyman

In particular, the racial implications and subtext resonate, lending depth to what could have been just another boogeyman gorefest.  And I like how the filmmakers took pains *not* to explain every last detail, and to tell the story visually.I caught it on broadcast TV, and I can't imagine that the graphic depictions edited out would make the movie any better- just grosser.Poor Kasi Lemmons, at least she graduated from Trusted Black Friend to a chair behind the camera.",Candyman

This is a great film, it is everything that Nightmare on Elm Street could have been if it hadn't been so tongue in cheek.  The plot is simple yet effective.  You never quite see things coming until they're right on top of you, and by then it's too late.  Tony Todd is truly menacing as Candyman.  My only criticism is that Virginia Madsen is too bold and brave as Helen Lyle, the Heroine of the piece, but that was probably necessary to carry the plot.  Highly recommended, I'm going out to buy the DVD today.",Candyman

182,very_doubtful,"Can you say ""UNDERRATED""?",9,15 April 2000,"This is definitely one of the scariest movies ever and also belongs to my top ten horror films! However, not everybody seems to like this movie as much as I do.Candyman is almost flawless. Among all the horror movie villains Candyman is one of the most frightening and fascinating. Tony Todd does a terrific job. There is no point in the film where Candyman gets ridiculous. Luckily there were no scream-until-even-the-killer-himself-is-deaf teens. Instead we get Virginia Madsen who adds a psychological component to her role.The plot is very solid too. The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before. Although the story of Candyman is somewhat surreal there is a solid motive for what he is doing. That's a point that many other films of the genre lack.Another element that adds to the very moody atmosphere is the directing. There are some amazingly exciting shots, especially the aerial views of Chicago which are unique. The mood makes the film somehow disturbing and fascinating at the same time and that's why there isn't any other film like this one. There are some pretty gory scenes but the brutality here is never used to entertain. The soundtrack which is one of the best in horror films also helps to create the atmosphere mentioned above.Candyman gets a lot of bad reviews although it is one of the best in the genre. Give it a try!My rating: 9/10",Candyman
183,RElKO,The most imaginative horror character of the 90s.,9,25 July 2000,"What we have here, as far as i'm concerned, is the best slasher movie ever made. Not just because it's genuinely scary, it's also intelligent (unlike 80% of all the slasher movies), it's extremely well acted, and it's serious which is always a plus in my book. I just don't ever get scared by movies that don't take themselves or their characters seriously. People making jokes or wise-cracking while they're being stalked by an unseen terror has always been a mood-killer for me. But besides that, the movie has got great production values. There has obviously been paid a lot of attention to the look and feel of the movie. The haunting, beautiful score by Philip Glass adds to the mood of the film. The photography has a realistic feel to it. It doesn't look glossy and smooth like most movies. The fact that the main character is framed by the killer is also pretty original for this type of movie. And the gore in this movie is really violent, and looks horrible, as it should. It should never be fun to watch people get butchered because it takes away any realism there may be. It's NOT fun to actually see people having their backs split open with a hook. What may be the best thing is that there is a certain tragedy about the Candyman character. This is not a mute mask wearing loser who was wronged and wants revenge, but you can't relate to. This is a character who was tortured and brutally murdered for doing nothing but love a woman. This character is not making jokes or being funny, and is therefor all the more realistic and even tragic. It's the combination of all it's qualities that make this one of the best thrillers / horrormovies of the 90s period!(Too bad some producers couldn't help themselves and had to ruin a great new horror icon in the sequels).",Candyman
184,Skeptic459,One of my favourite horror films! Spoilers!,9,21 January 2004,"I love the horror genre! I grew up loving films that scared the hell out of me! Candyman is excellent because it is a film that I genuinely found very twisted and disturbing when I saw it at the tender age of 15.
 Check this out, 'It is a blessed condition believe me. To be whispered about in street corners...to live in other peoples dreams...but not to have to be...do you understand?'  How cool is that quote! I am going to throw in a few quotes in this review because the writing of this film is really, really cool! The Candyman is not an inarticulate Jason or Michael Myers. He has the vocabulary of a homicidal drama professor who likes Richard Burton. Candyman is the thinking person's horror film. It explores the notion of the urban myth. The Candyman exists because people tell the stories about him. They spread the myth making him flesh. Unfortunately for researcher Helen Lyle, she doesn't know any of this. She investigates the urban myth of the Candyman, seeking to debunk it and her fate becomes sealed. Hey! Writing a paper isn't worth being burned alive! The film rests on the central idea that fiction can suddenly become real life if enough people believe in the myth. Boogey men can therefore be created if enough people believe in monsters. This theme is familiar to the director Bernard Rose. I recommend another one of his films called 'Paperhouse.' This is about the imagination of a little girl that starts to manifest in reality. It is also quite good although not as scary. The original story of how the Candyman was made is horrific and just deepens the mystery. This is not a film like the Friday the 13th series. This is far more cerebral and relies much more on its concepts.  The Candyman is the whisper in the classroom that will exist forever.  When Helen sets out to debunk the Candyman, this is essentially like trying to murder him. 'Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation. Without them,  I am nothing.' Debunking the Candyman will destroy his immortality. The only way the Candyman can exist is through the shedding of innocent blood so that the stories of him can continue to proliferate. So when Helen decides that the Candyman is actually a local drug dealer hiding behind the Candyman identity. She feels that she has solved the mystery of the mysterious murders that the Candyman has committed.  What Helen does not know is that the Candyman is a kind of a physical manifestation of the Jungian collective unconscious. The Candyman takes his revenge, he feels obliged to come, after all she has caused much doubt about his actual existence. The Candyman tears away Helen's day to day reality. Driving her into what other people think is her own insanity. Now she knows the truth of the Candyman...  The conversations between Helen and the Candyman are haunting. What is also interesting is that sadism and masochism are major features in Clive Barker's work. 'The pain I assure you, will be exquisite.' S&M tendencies! This is one dark and twisted piece of celluloid! The acting is also really good from both actors. The final scene is horrific as Helen tries to rescue a baby in a blazing woodpile and is burnt alive! Helen herself then becomes part of the  legend and therefore comes back as another physical manifestation of legend. However, remember this is not Helen's ghost but a construction of Helen through the beliefs of those who believe this mysterious urban legend. Candyman says it best... 'Your death will be a tale to frighten children...to make lovers cling closer in their rapture. Come with me and be immortal...' Genius.
 This film also has a great soundtrack, a very haunting score.
  Candyman is a very interesting film that originates from the absolutely twisted mind of Clive Barker. This is brilliant, well written horror. 9 out of 10.   By the way avoid the sequels. I saw number 2 and it just ruins the whole thing. Think of this as the one and only.",Candyman
185,chaplins_charlie,Great horror movie!!,9,20 July 2003,"I first saw this movie at a slumber party and by the time the movie was over, none of us fell asleep.  We were so freaked out!!   This is one of the greatest horror movies out there!!  It all begins with Helen(Brilliantly acted by pretty faced, Virgina Madsen)who is a college student and decides to study about urban legends for her thesis.  She becomes interested in the legend of Candyman, the son of a slave who was executed for falling in love with and inpregnanting a young white girl.  Rumor had it that if you said his name in the mirror 5 times, he will show up behind you, breathing down your neck.  Of course Helen knows it isn't true and doesn't take it at all seriously.  She says Canyman's name in the mirror and although he doesn't show up, Helen soon regrets not believing in him.  All of a sudden people and animals are being slaughtered and Helen is left with nothing but the blood in her hands.  But she didn't do it!!  Then who did??Candyman was wonderfully played by handsome and deep voiced, Tony Todd(Yes, his voice will surely creep you out).  The movie starts off as normal but will have you completely freaked out by the time it's half way done.  Watch it and you'll see what I mean!! I give it 8 1/2 stars out of 10!!",Candyman
186,leoperu,Bees out of hive,6,9 December 2012,"An above-average romantic horror movie with implausible, inconsistent storyline,atmospheric,but unnecessarily gory, adorned with fine photography of city textures (Anthony Richmond was the man behind the camera in three of the four best movies by Nicolas Roeg - but Rose isn't Roeg, so we cannot expect any visionary qualities here), music of Philip Glass, and charms of Virginia Madsen (it seems to me that whoever did admire her in the movie should avoid bonus interviews where an artificial puppet takes the place of our gorgeous go-getter turned victim). The makers let us know that Chicago instead of Liverpool was the right choice ; I wouldn't be so sure of that. And the bees.... well, they are simply out of the hive here.",Candyman
187,lucifer,Wow,10,20 October 1998,"This is, without a doubt, one of the most frightening films in history. The story is interesting, the acting good, the atmosphere electric. All in all, this adds up to one of the best horror films ever. Oh, and Virginia Madsen gets a bathtub scene.",Candyman
188,klesker,The Candyman can,10,6 June 2008,"I love my horror, but what I love most about it is the feeling of being scared. Yes, Im one of these people that will walk into the supposedly haunted house alone whilst bricking myself, the kind of guy that will hang out the side of the roller-coaster in order to raise the scar factor just that little bit higher. I love horror because I love to be scared. Now, the funny thing is I very rarely find horror movies scary. But there is that one film floating around waiting to scare the bejeezus out of us. To date, there have only ever been two movies that have managed to do what they're supposed to and they are The Shining and The Exorcist. The Japanese film Audition came pretty close but it just failed to make the leap from being simply disturbing to being balls to the walls terrifying.Well congratulations Candyman, for you have succeeded where many others have failed and made me feel the most uncomfortable watching a movie since, well, the first time I saw The Exorcist and The Shining. Sure, you could say this is a slasher movie at heart, I mean, there's plenty of hacking and slashing and the main antagonist has a hook for a hand but in shifting the Gothic tale of pain and suffering from the haunted castle to the urban squalor of the projects in Chicago, the film creates a palpable sense of dread from the get go, personifying what makes urban legends so damn scary in the first place: they take place in a neighbourhood just like your own. How many times have our friends claimed to have known someone who has been harassed by phone calls whilst babysitting only to have the caller be in the house with you (The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs)? I remember hearing these tales all through my college days and never really believing any of them because, well, they were stupid. But that didn't stop them being less creepy. And as the urban legend of the Candyman begins to manifest itself in the real world, you really begin to feel the characters dread.The Candyman himself deserves to be in the horror hall of fame with the likes of Hannibal Lector and Freddy Kruger. Not showing up until well passed the half way point, his entrance is one of the most unnerving things I've ever had to sit through. Tony Todd really portrays this guy with a great sense of menace, his movements conveying a slight air of pretension but, at the same time, being really imposing. Probably helps the Todd is 9 feet tall and 7 feet wide (wellthat's a lie, but he's pretty big). But it's not his stance that makes him so effective. This is a performance that's entirely vocal. In a stroke of genius, the film makers have amplified his voice, making it dominate the soundtrack every time he speaks. It becomes instantly distressing and I found both my brother and I shifting uncomfortably in our seats, looking at each other with big frowns of unease.Despite the high levels of blood and gore, the death scenes actually turn out to be pretty terrifying themselves, with one in particular taking place off screen, leaving the viewer with a barrage of horrific screams and gut wrenching sound effects that made it seem all the more worse, causing my brother and I, again, to shift nervously in our seats. The main plus points in the effectiveness of Candyman's killing spree ist hat his victims aren't horror archetypes: these are innocent people. And the fact that the film is played so straight faced makes it somehow worse.Now let me address you quickly about something that bothers me about horror movies. Now if you think about it, the idea of a psychopathic killer running around murdering people is nasty. Sure the horror genre has taken a more tongue-in-cheek way of doing this as of late to, to the point where it eventually becomes fun to see who will die next and how. Now that's OK in a Final Destination kind of way but for me, the idea of someone in a mask stalking teenagers isn't really fun at all, it's really nasty. I mean c'mon, how are you gonna react when you have some sharp instrument thrust into your gullet? You're not gonna have the big breasted blond clasping her hands on her face and scream Hammer Horror style as if she's just had a spider crawl up her leg rather than been stabbed, in reality, it's gonna really bloody hurt. Now being that this film is totally straight face and deadly serious, that is EXACTLY how these victims react. I wont go into the gory details needless to say, it's disturbing. This is just a very effective horror movie. It managed to scare the hell out of me and that's bloody unprecedented. It was so tense in places that if anyone had walked in at that precise moment they would've been blasted through the roof on a stream of my own terrified p*ss. OK, that's an over exaggeration but to say it's pant-wettingly scary ain't far off. Obviously my gushing review will quite possibly hype it up to the stage that anyone curious enough to see it after this will wonder ""Luke, you charismatic stallion, what were you getting so worked up about?"" but you know what? Get lost you cynical nit pickers, it's a horror movie that does exactly what it says on the tin and with gusto too. Anyone who doesn't find this scary or at least disturbing on some level is lying to save faceI feel very passionate about this.5/5",Candyman

190,jrkdany,Did not meet expectations,3,8 August 2021,Been postponing watching this movie and finally made through it. My expectations were high but this movie disappointed in all aspects except for Virginia Madsen. The movie is like a horror drama which doesn't go well. The sets were artificial and the Candyman was not scary. Did they expect us to sympathize with Candyman or despise him? At some point it looked like a dracula romance movie. Virginia Madsen looks beautiful though.,Candyman
191,rhaynes1974,The Best Horror Film of 1992,10,6 July 2013,"Candyman is undoubtedly the best horror film of 1992. Released with very little fanfare the film became a surprise hit and I remember why.Having been one of those lucky individuals to see the film five, yes five times on its initial theatrical run, I think it's safe to say that I'm a fan.The ability that director Bernard Rose has to create a palpable sense of dread is evident in every frame of this film. This is what true horror is all about. Candyman is extremely suspenseful and intensely creepy, in fact just writing about it I can already feel the hairs on my arms standing up again. It's that affecting!Virginia Madsen is superbly cast as Helen, a flawed but likable heroine the audience cares deeply about. Her journey into madness is one that we empathize with every brutal step of the way. You don't want bad things to happen to her because you've fallen in love with her. How Madsen wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is still beyond me.Tony Todd is also an antihero with a personality and a rich one at that. The film is violent but the gore never becomes comedic. It sets the perfect tone of brutality.Candyman cannot come more highly recommended. It's a truly terrifying psychological art-house horror with standout performances and a deeply haunting score by Philip Glass. Horror films DO NOT get any better than this. Prepared to be scared.A terrific 10!",Candyman
192,forlornnesssickness,Candyman : Some urban legend is too (un)real,9,14 June 2014,"""Candyman""(1992) is something we do not come across often. It is not only a scary movie but also an evocative horror movie with the intriguing idea about urban legends. We all know the urban legends have the roots in our collective fear of living anonymously in the cities, and the movie puts an interesting spin on it. What if some urban legend is real? And what if it's possible that it is real because it is believed to exist, rather than the other way around? What if it gets the power from the collective belief? If such a thing is possible, then what can be said of the religious or supernatural entities people believe in? Can the same thing be said of them? The movie deals with its idea in a clever way, and it leaves us something to think after we are reasonably scared by the things happening on the screen.It is always welcoming to have the characters who are reasonable in the horror movies, and Helen(Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette(Kasi Lemmons) are well-qualified for that. They are the graduates researching for their doctorial thesis at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Their research subject is the urban legend, and the one that particularly interests them is about Candyman, who people say will come to whoever dares to summon him by saying his names five times while looking at the mirror and will leave the bloody carnage behind him.Like any other academic researchers, Helen and Bernadette don't seriously believe what they hear from the interviews. But they become interested when they coincidentally come to know that Candyman is believed to exist by the people living in the Cabrini-Green Housing complex in Near North Side area of Chicago; they believe Candyman is living in one of those empty tenement. Helen thinks there are the materials worthy of their thesis, and she decides to delve deeper in this subject, despite Bernadette's concern.Her concern is well-justified. Now it is fading into the history by the on-going gentrification process, but Cabrini-Green has been one of the criminally notorious housing complex in USA. Through the movie, made in 1992, we get some glimpses of the environment far, far worse than now. The gang members hang around the front entrance of those coercively looking buildings, and there are dark, dirty, deserted places you do not want to go inside in the buildings. And we see our characters bravely go into these places with the intellectual interest and purpose.The director/writer Bernard Rose, who would make ""Immortal Beloved"" after this movie, focuses on the atmosphere at the first half. He knows how to visually mount the unease on the screen. Frequent overhead shots have a subtle menacing tone with Phillip Glass' effectively spooky score. The despair and terror are palpably felt in the corners in Cabrini-Green scenes, and, like Helen, we can see the real world is as horrible as the Candyman legend. This is the dangerous world in which terrible incidents happen and are neglected by the people outside including the police. People living there everyday may just choose to believe the boogeyman whom no one can stop is responsible for all these happenings.But is it just an urban legend born out of the despair of the lower class? Helen seems to think so, but, unfortunately for her, the movie is based on the short story ""The Forbidden"" written by the executive producer Clive Barker, who was called ""The Future of Horror"" by Stephen King. Like his famous first movie ""Hellraiser""(1987), Clive Barker's horror stories are gruesome and brooding tales of flesh and blood with the supernatural elements, and ""Candyman"" is no exception. As you probably guessed it already, it turns out that Candyman is real, and the truth behind him is a lot more intriguing while quite horrifying in itself. It seems that Helen's study makes Candyman piqued more than casually calling his names five times in the mirror.Helen eventually finds herself in a big serious trouble with the police while the shocking incidents happen around her. She knows what's going on but she cannot say about it because nobody can believe her story. To make the matters worse, she is framed for the incidents and nobody believes her innocence – least of all her untrustworthy husband who never quite says he trusts her words. Following her ordeal, we see frightening things more than before. There is some blood to be shed, and Rose skillfully handles the violent moments while never losing the tension and dread piled upon from the start.And he had the talented cast. Inexplicably, Virginia Madsen had never gotten the chance to fully utilize her talent till her Oscar-nominated performance ""Sideways""(2004), and ""Candyman"" was one of few bright spots in her career before ""Sideways""; she is good as a frightened but brave woman who tries to solve her impossible problem. Kasi Lemmons, who would direct ""Eve's Bayou"" and ""Talk to Me"", also makes a good impression as Helen's best friend and co-writer. Tony Todd is seductively menacing as a dreadful entity with his hulking presence and deep voice(he would reprise his role in the following worthless Candyman sequels).Even 18 years after it came out, ""Candyman"" still holds well as an effectively creepy movie. After the success of ""Hellraiser"", several Clive Barker's works have been translated into the movies for years, but this movie still occupies the top position among others. I think it is a lot better than ""Hellraiser"", which just drones on the blood and other freakish things with some interesting ideas nearly untouched. ""Candyman"" has the interesting idea to explore, proceeds with it, and never loses the grip on the idea even when it goes bloody. In the end, even the expected horror movie cliché serves for its idea and provokes another thought in our head while the end credit rolls. Preposterous, yeah, but somehow it's logical in its philosophy.",Candyman

197,meganmarie-19902,More Than Just A Horror... Its a Piece Of History,10,4 December 2018,"Loosely based on Clive Barker's novel The Forgiven, Candyman takes us somewhere we haven't been with horror for a long time. Not only do we have the gore, thrills and gothic atmosphere that sets the scene, but we are also dealing with socio-political issues and a dark period in American history.
Set in Chicago, Helen is a graduate student doing a research paper on Urban Legends, when she comes across the local myth of the Candyman, who is summoned when you say his name five times in the mirror before being brutally killed. This legend looms largely on the Cabrini Green projects, a predominantly African American neighborhood battling a multitude of social issues. A white middle-class female is then confronted by the dark nature of impoverishment and gang crime ruling the area, but that will not stop her putting an end to the myth killing the locals. The candyman is the son of a slave, an artist who was the victim of a terrible injustice purely for being in love. Unlike other slasher films, this killer is not psychotic or wishes to get his sadistic kicks from murder, but he is an artist and sees death as a way to express himself from the other side.
The multiple elements in this film make it more than just a horror and it can literally be appreciated by any movie fan",Candyman
198,AlukardsCastle,The Rare Horror Movie That Gets Scarier With Repeated Viewing,10,18 August 2015,"I first saw this movie as a young boy in the late 90s. I didn't pay attention to the deep meaning and pure genius of it. In my child mind all I knew was that Candyman was the big bad Boogeyman and he'll kill you if you say his name in the mirror enough times. I didn't pay attention to the story within at all. So as I grew up I began to develop a special fondness for Horror movies. In particular, Good Horror movies. It is still my favorite genre. So of course I stumbled across the name Clive Barker. His original Hellraiser movie, which was based on his own novel was for a time my favorite of his. The franchise of sequels that followed were either hit or mega miss. But I then began looking for any Clive Barker related movies. His other two directed movie ""Nightbreed"" and ""Lord Of Illusions"" were good but still paled in comparison to the icon of Hellraiser. ""Midnight Meat Train"" was good but again it couldn't hold a candle to the big H. Then came Candyman. I remembered my childhood thoughts of the film and just kinda skipped on it thinking it was just too gimicky. But for some reason I couldn't resist the urge to rediscover the movie knowing I hadn't seen it since I was a naive kid. So I read reviews everywhere online for the movie. Nearly everyone was praising it. Some calling it the best horror movie of the 90s. The itch needed to be scratched so I went out and purchased the Candyman DVD. It was a good horror movie night that night.The movie is set in the 90s but feels so timeless. Well except for the lack of cell phones everywhere. Needless to say the situations in the film are so disturbing and surreal yet very realistic believe it or not. The setting for some parts of the movie in Cabrini Green, which was one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the US back in the day, was so eerie. Unlike many horror throwaways the characters are likable and seeing them die is tragic and disturbing. Virginia Madsen is a beautiful and lovable woman. Her portrayal of the main character was so helpless. This also is one of the few horror movies where the characters don't make constant stupid decisions throughout just for the sake of keeping the horror going. You know what I mean, like when a character hears a strange noise and walks through a house calling out to the possible death threat and sometimes with no lights on. Those stupid decisions are non-existent here. This movie takes place in realistic scenarios. Sure you might be thinking 'how could a ghost coming out of a mirror to kill you be realistic?'. Well here's a fun part. Though some may disagree, I think the Candyman never really entered the physical realm in the movie. (Spoiler) From the moment the Candyman makes his first on screen appearance on is when the main character has entered her psychological doom. No one but Helen (Madsen) really sees the Candyman throughout the film. It's a scary possibility to think of the movie that way. (End Spoiler/theory) Speaking of Candyman himself, Tony Todd gives an iconic portrayal of one of the all time horror villains. His voice sounds like evil incarnate. It fills the room even if you watch the movie at a low volume. Some of his scenes are so trippy that even the viewer wonders if what they saw really happened. It's very dreamlike and of course very nightmarishly surreal. The musical score is one of the greatest of any genre. I'd even say the main theme is better than that of horror mainstays like Halloween and The Exorcist. The first half of the movie does a great job of building up tension without ever getting boring. The second half is just relentless in it's terror. Don't think this is a mindless madman gone wild horror movie. This is a movie that will haunt you if you really pay attention and preferably watch it loud in the dark and maybe with a group.So this is not only my favorite Clive Barker related movie, but probably my new favorite Horror movie. The night I bought the DVD as an adult I had hallucinations of Candyman as I tried to sleep. That NEVER happens to me. It was disturbing. But did it stop me from watching it again? No. This movie has such great replay value and it seriously gets scarier and more haunting with each viewing even though you know what's going to happen.",Candyman

It manages to be consistently creepy and at times downright terrifying without resorting to cheap gore or jump scares. What really makes this film stand out is the unique premise of an actual urban legend needing people to believe and fear it to exist. Thank goodness someone like Clive Barker is around to throw interesting original ideas into genre films like this gem. Don't feel any need to check out the inferior sequels, just stick with the original for some scares, ideas, and some early work from Virginia Madsen. Filled with fright, hallucinatory images, a plot that will keep you riveted and some fine atmosphere, Candyman in one highly underrated horror film.",Candyman
204,Steevh,Adult horror strikes back,9,18 May 1999,"Deeply disturbing, intelligently made and without a screaming teen in sight, 'Candyman' is one of the stand-out horror movies of the decade.To just list all the elements that make this one of the classiest genre efforts of recent years would probably take up most of the thousand words I am allowed here. Suffice to say, it has a genuinely uncomfortable premise, uncompromising execution and a bone jarringly lonely score by Philip Glass. Tony Todd is exceptional as the hollow-voiced titular creature; a lost soul brought to life by the whispers of myth. At once heartbreaking and terrifying this could be the definitive latter day horror movie monster- if it wasn't just that little bit too close to Hellraiser's Pinhead. But, when you have a winning combination of elegance and disgust in a verbose, cultured villain, why alter it too much?Virginia Madsen convinces totally as Helen; and you can almost see all the cast acting their little socks off so as not to let the side down. So good, in fact, that I'm struggling to find one bad thing to say about it.I read here, that in the eyes of one viewer, it ""dwells on the nastier things in life"" and wasn't a ""nice film"". I can think of no greater compliment for a truly adult horror movie. No dear, you won't find happy teens in pastel t-shirts having slumber parties and discussing trendy scary movies, while some rap star tries to sell records on the soundtrack. This is a grown up film for grown up people. There is a reason horror films are for adults, and that reason is 'Candyman'.",Candyman
205,Dwayans,Awesome!,7,18 June 2003,"This movie is awesome! Reasons why: 1) Its scary. This film is probably the scariest film of the 90s and inthe top 10 of scary films that I have ever seen.  This had me wearyfor a couple years about saying Candyman in the mirror 4 or 5times.  I just couldnt say it even with my dad being there. I was a bityoung then, but still that stuff just gets you on many levels as botha scary film and on the legend/folklore angle. 2) The acting was actually not bad. It wasnt the best it could be, butit still worked out and you cared for the main character and herfriend.  3) The story was compelling. I really like the whole story that wasexplained behind the urban legend. It explained it in a way thatwasnt cheesey or hokey.  The story and plotting was well executed.4) The villain was perfect. He was perfectly cast and played byTony Todd. Unfortunately he can't get many different roles today. He was the best part of Candyman (and Final Destination).The only thing that would be a negative would be the gore factorwas a bit too high. Overall I give it *** out of ****.",Candyman
206,slasherstudios,First Great Horror Movie of the 90's,8,7 December 2011,"Helen Lyle is a graduate student conducting research for her thesis on urban legends. While interviewing freshmen about their superstitions, she hears about a local legend known as Candyman. The legend contains many thematic elements similar to the most well known urban legends, including endangered babysitters, spirits who appear in mirrors when fatally summoned, and maniac killers with unnatural deformities. The legend states that while Candyman was the son of a slave, he nevertheless became a well known artist. Yet, after falling in love with a white woman who becomes pregnant, Candyman is chased through the plantation and when caught, has his drawing hand cut off and replaced with a hook. He is then smeared with honey (prompting the locals to chant 'Candyman' a total of 5 times- hence the 'say his name 5 times into the mirror'), stolen from a nearby apiary, and the bees sting him to death. The legend also claims that Candyman is summoned by anyone who looks into a mirror and chants his name five times (similar to the Bloody Mary folkloric tale). Summoning him often costs the individual their own life. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette jokingly call Candyman's name into the mirror in Helen's bathroom but nothing happens.While conducting her research, Helen enters the notorious gang-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project, the site of a recent unsolved murder. There she meets Anne-Marie McCoy, one of the residents, as well as a young boy named Jake, who tells her a disturbing story of a child who was horribly mutilated in a public restroom near the projects, supposedly by Candyman. While exploring the run-down restroom, Helen is attacked by a gang member carrying a hook who has taken the Candyman moniker as his own to enhance his own street credibility by associating himself with the legend. Helen survives the assault and is able to later identify her attacker to the police.Helen later returns to school but hears a voice calling her name as she walks through a parking garage. Another man she encounters states he is the Candyman of the urban legend and because of Helen's disbelief in him, he must now prove to her that he is real. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose Rottweiler has been decapitated and whose baby is also missing, attacks Helen and she is forced to defend herself from Anne-Marie using a meat cleaver. The police then enter the apartment and arrest Helen. Is Helen going crazy or will Candyman come for her next?Three words adequately describe ""Candyman"": Scary. As. Hell. I was twelve years old when I saw the movie for the first time and it hasn't left my mind since. From the haunting Phillip Glass score to the uncompromising promises by both Tony Todd as Candyman and Virginia Madsen (who has never looked better) as Helen, everything about this movie is sensationally scary. Madsen, in particular, seems to relish playing against time and causes the audience to be sympathetic with her character when a lesser actress would have just come across as annoying. A cheap ""Carrie"" rip-off of an ending is the only false beat in this superb thriller from one of the masters of the horror genre, Clive Barker.",Candyman
207,Artist_TRS,Dour and Grisly but Absent of Fun; Maybe too Much?,8,25 July 2021,"1992's ""Candyman"" is an effectual psychologically unnerving experience and haunts one's thoughts long after the end credits. The movie's overtly grisly and despairing narrative escalates throughout its runtime to a tensely culminated boiling point and it unconventionally topples any sense of an entitled expectation for a positive denouement. It's dour and unmerciful to what the audience becomes hopeful for of an ending.The only detriment of the movie's experience is if there's someone entering ""Candyman"" who prefers a horror movie that has interspersed elements of fun and humour contrasting the grisly content throughout its plot, similar to those the slasher genre became worn by as the '80's closed, this isn't the movie for them. From the reasons aforementioned, ""Candyman"" isn't fun. Good movie, but not fun.",Candyman
208,Trashbagslim,"Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Ca....",7,5 December 2020,"It's not what you'd expect from an 90s horror film. And it's much more than that. It's a detective mystery / psychological thriller that also deals with racism, poverty and betrayal in an interesting way.Movie starts pretty slow and has some hokey and ""not-so-great acting"" moments, but is suspenseful and intriguing right from the start.
The suspense and the horrific scenes feel really artistic. They always have purpose and a meaning to them. The only downsides are the constant jump scares that break the immersion and paste of the film.Virginia Madsen is terrific as Helen and narration by Tony Todd gives this movie a creepy, but also beautiful and chilling tone. The score is amazing and never feels out-of-place.
Giving the killer a rich and interesting back story really puts weight to his actions.

Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a Chicago Graduate researching Urban legends, who slowly begins to understand that each and every story DOES have some element of truth to it; the power of these legends is what makes the legend grow... With Brilliant, taut direction, and a wonderful score that honestly gives me goosebumps,the subtle, creepy tone of the movie will have you on tenterhooks. its a full 44 Min's before we properly see Candyman, 44 Min's (and one death off camera)of pent spine chilling tension. you could take half the blood out of this film, and it would still work. in short, a masterpiece of how to make a horror movie.

Sorry, but a power to control bees to have them attack you at his will would scare me much more then this crap.On the other hand. I Don't think the script is bad and it's not bad acted either.

212,elijahbutler-40119,An underrated horror classic!,9,18 February 2018,"When you think of slasher movies, the first things that pop into your head are movies like Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and from there there have been many other slasher films. Candyman is a very well written as well as well directed horror film that doesn't really deserve to be SO underrated in the horror genre! Candyman is an interesting slasher himself as well and the reason why he exists is because people believe in him which makes this film lead to a very strong story with solid acting and engaging characters. Virginia Madsen as Helen Lyle was very good in this film. Her character was very engaged with the myth of the Candyman and she was a very likable character who wanted to know more about the legend of Candyman. Tony Todd takes this entire film as Candyman! He did a FANTASTIC job in this film and there were moments where I actually found his character very creepy and disturbing. The back story of Candyman is also very well written and I'm gonna talk about it without spoiling anything, but his back story really hooks you and actually almost makes you feel bad for this man. Now Candyman is not one of the greatest slashers of all time, but it's a horror film that does NOT deserve to be criminally underrated in the genre of horror! The acting in this film is mostly solid, the characters are good and the story is very clever and if you are a fan of horror movies and you want to check out some very underrated horror movies, Candyman is the movie for you! Candyman is a very well written and directed horror movie that deserves to be treated as a classic and should be seen by almost EVERY fan of horror! I'm gonna give Candyman an 8/10.",Candyman

I saw this movie when I was about 9 and couldn't really sit through to the end because it scared me so. The character of the Candyman was so scary, not just because he killed people (though that had a lot to do with it), but because the person he was chasing was not believed (and actually framed for his murders). Believe me, if someone was popping up killing people unexpectedly like Candyman did, I would not stick around to see what was going on. I still won't go up to a mirror and test the Candyman theory out. Definitely one of the best slasher films of the 90s. Rent or buy it.",Candyman
215,nilshenry,A Beautiful Horror Movie with Great Music,8,27 January 2007,"Grad students Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette Walsh work on a joint thesis concerning urban legends, and with a special emphasis on the legend of Candyman, a slave who in the end of the 1800s was executed for being in love with a white woman. According to the legend, if you stand in front of a mirror and say out his name five times, he will appear behind you and kill you. When Helen decides to go deeper into the stories behind Candyman, murders start occurring around her.The story can best be described as a psychological thriller. Throughout most of the movie, you wonder if all the things that are happening are actually just going on in Helen's mind. But the build-up and setting are more of a fantasy/drama/tragedy style than thriller style. It is really dark, but the music adds a mystical kind of beauty to it. In that sense, I also really enjoyed the ending.The music is an important part of this movie. The composer is Philip Glass, who has won a number of awards for his music, and who wrote the music to Kundun and The Hours, among other things. The music in Candyman is a beautiful piece of classical-style work which makes this movie more fantasy-style than horror.I can't say much more concrete about Candyman without giving anything away, but I recommend this to anyone who is slightly interested in horror-movies. The reason I gave it an 8 instead of a 10 is that I don't believe it appeals to people who neither enjoy fantasy nor horror. People who only enjoy Gandhi and The Mission won't like Candyman at all, for instance. But people who are slightly interested in fantasy or horror will enjoy this one.",Candyman

I was figuring more teenagers being killed by another masked man. Candyman goes WAY beyond this formula and enters into the realm of horror masterpieces. A criminally underrated film.The film is about a college student's attempts to uncover the legend of a serial killer who has killed many people in her town. Throughout the film her life slowly unravels, in a very Hitchcockian way, as the mystery unfolds. Not to give anything away, but the movie spirals down to one of the greatest endings in horror movie history.Themes of superstition, racism and sanity are constantly going being shown through the film. I repeat this is NOT a cut and paste slasher film. Actually it reminds me more of the supernatural films of the 70's (Rosemary's Baby, Carrie, The Excorcist) and Hitchcock films.

220,quietgrave,"Great movie, disappointing finale",8,9 May 2019,"I'll start with what I liked. Art direction and Camerawork is utterly phenomenal, the main two characters: Candyman and Helen are perfectly cast and- for the most part, deliver their lines wonderfully. A few times I was a bit annoyed at how Helen was displaying her fear and was acting a little irrationally, but I counted it towards Candyman's kind of quasi-freddy-kruger powers messing with her mind, and I believe that was the original intention the Director was trying to get across, so it didn't hurt the film. While slow, the first half of the movie may be a chore to sit through, it's still shot very beautifully with sweeping, Ridley-Scott type shots of the city and very ominous, slow POV shots of Helen walking through slummy apartments, but once the killings begin, the pacing picks up and it very much engages you. The killer was in the movie for an appropriate amount of time, not overly used and you could very clearly tell through about an hour in what his motives are and why he's doing what he's doing. I think it was a smart decision to leave the explanation of his background non-verbal, it allowed the audience to infer what had made Candyman into what he was and why he's doing what he's doing without spoon-feeding it tot he audience, it left room for interpretation and conjecture, something I feel is important to a movie.Unfortunately the casting for some of the minor characters is incredibly bad, almost every character outside of Jake, the child and the co-worker of Helens (I forget her name) the acting was so overly dramatic and seemed much more like a stage play than anything else, especially the mistress of Helens husband, she was really bad in particular. The audio tracks also kind of cut in and out really suddenly when they dub over anyone talking, you can hear the pop of them cutting the tracks in, it's really jarring... The ending kind of leaves you disappointed, as throughout the entire movie the atmosphere is very artistic and surreal, but they end up turning it into just another slasher movie, it's very unlike the rest of the film and kind of ruins Helen's character. She's built up to seem like she's going to concede and become the Candyman's victim like he keeps asking her to, and I feel like it would have been much more poetic if she had died willingly with him in the bonfire at the end, and the movie cut out there instead of like ten minutes later after all the silly slasher tropes they shove into the finale.Still a good movie, would've been a great movie if not for the finale.",Candyman

The whole concept of something gaining power through belief is well-explored, and the frights are not too predictable, so on several levels the movie works well. The tension is palpable at times, and on a base human level we relate to this movie because we've all heard stories like it - the boogieman and other urban myths etc. Well directed (obviously by a Brit - it's subtle with good acting!) and well shot.

I watched Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Chucky, Leatherface. Out of all of these boogeyman I was so scared of Michael Myers, I've only seen the original 1978 film many times at the time since I had it on VHS.One night my dad came home from work with a few VHS movies and one of the was Candyman, I was curious about it, I thought it was something like fantasy and funny and I begged my dad to play the movie and *SIGH* this coming. I thought Halloween did to me but Candyman?? Thats was a different ballgame. This movie scared the living daylights out of me. Candyman was something else but for some reason I kept re-watching movie again and again and the more I re-watched it, the more scared and frightened I became. I tortured myself doing that LOL. Being that I had the VHS, I didnt like being home. This movie motivated me to go to school, I used it as a therapy to get it off my head, be with my classmates and talk with them. Heh watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or cartoon network made me feel better.Candyman is a good horror film, its scary, gritty, violent, shocking and gross.

The Ending is great, I can't say how I love this movie, so if you want a good scare go rent it, you will not be disappointed, and if you don't like this, then you can abandon this genre cause you won't find something scarier. I also recommend the first sequel Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) and Hellraiser (1987). Candyman 3 sucks.",Candyman

No promises, though.Anyway, I had two reasons for wanting to watch this film. Those were: a) the fact that it's reputed to be a superior horror film, and b) I'm a sucker for anything scored by Philip Glass. This film didn't disappoint on either front-- in fact, I would say it excelled. The score composed by Glass heightened every already suspenseful moment and Tony Todd shone as the Candyman, charismatic enough to enjoy, but still terrifying enough to satisfy the duties of an urban legend ghost-killer.Off to watch Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh now!",Candyman
231,spartancurtis,The horror franchise of Hollywood gets to survive for a little bit longer,9,8 July 2011,"Okay now i will explain my summary a little bit later but now let's talk about candyman. Okay overall a great horror flick jeez the only movie that scared me like that was evil dead and lordy in the 80's thats when good horror flicks like chainsaw massacre and of course the all mighty evil dead. But after these were made , well let's just say that horror my friends is dying and it peaked with this movie but since it is so legendary and that famous line from tony todd or who crisen the evil candyman "" be my next victim"" . The movie had a mixture of tragedy , love , and horror or we all call it "" tragic horror"" . Yea of course people always die in horror films but who expected helen or virgina madsen to die at the end like that and after losing her lover like that and everything falling apart. People Shakespeare i think would cry to this or prasie it at least. But lets be honest there probably won't be anymore horror films as good as this. Now im not leaving out the crazies it was okay and certainly one of the better horror films of the 21st centuray the rest are nothing but pure jokes. Saw and all the other movies after it really did not scare me at all and the ring and grudge were jokes. One day i hope they make a decent horror film in fact i want to see one win an Oscar",Candyman

237,seaneralex992,A great horror cult classic,7,18 May 2020,"Candyman is a good, but not great, 90's cult horror movie. I really like the movie, but I don't love it. I find the premise a little tired, but the villain himself is very imposing, and that's due to great build up of him, hearing stories, seeing gruesome results of his kills, but never seeing the murder. Tony Todd is great in the role, and I love the music! The Candyman theme is one of my favorite horror themes right up there with Phantasm and the Exorcist. I think the idea that this guy can cause you to do horrible things and you not even realize it is very Clive Barker. Clive Barkers book ""The Forbidden"", is a book I haven't read, but having seen Hellraiser, I can notice similarities in his horror. Some kind of supernatural entity that cannot be defeated, only hope to avoid altogether. I really enjoy the movie all the way up until the ending. The ending to me feels like it was reshot, I thought the movie was originally going to end with Helen Burning with the baby, but maybe the studio thought the ending was to dark and forced the director to die reshoots, I'm not sure if that's true, but that's just how it felt to me. I do however really like the ending where Helen takes over from Candyman to become the new icon of Cabrini Green. It makes me curious for what the new Jordan Peele produced sequel will be about, since that movie is pulling a Halloween and ignoring Candyman 2. I was looking forward to it, but now due to the Covid pandemic, it's been delayed🙄 Overall I really enjoyed Candyman. I thought it was effective and horrific at times, thanks to some effective build up and keeping the gore off screen.",Candyman
238,sikeone55-1,Great horror from flick,8,10 February 2021,"Candyman is one of my favorite horrors from the 90""s based of the book by Clive Barker. Story revolves about urban myth that circles in the poor neighbourhood of Chicago.
Our main character is campus teacher who is doing research about urban legends and she stumbles on story about Candyman, a mythical figure who comes to life if you say his name 5 times.
Not believing in some old spook story she summons the Candyman who brings her into his world and that is where the whole horror begins for her and people around her.
First of all the story is great with spooky atmosphere thought the movie accompanied by a great soundtrack. Cast is also excellent especially Virgina Madsen but whole movie steels Tony Todd as Candyman.
From today's perspective critics tend to say that movie is full of racial stereotypes but i couldn't agree with them because this movie is much more then that.
So if you are looking for a great horror movie with good story and good villain then give this movie a chance and you wont be disappointed.",Candyman
239,tonyband,Candyman is pure poetry,10,1 February 2016,"Candyman is pure poetry. It is an atmospheric art film, with hooks rending flesh and pools of blood. Everything is several steps above the normal level of a Slasher (except humor, which is completely lacking—this work takes itself very seriously), particularly the acting. Madsen creates a completely believable heroine, a bit naive and weak at the beginning, trapped but stronger at the end. Todd is a standout, with his deep, fluid voice and commanding, somewhat lost expressions. When he extols the virtues of painful death, it is almost believable. The complex screenplay, based on a Clive Barker story, left me with plenty to think about and more to feel, particularly about race relations in modern culture. If you're not interested in thinking, Candyman will still entertain with plenty of gore and scares. It did frighten me, but I'm not entirely comfortable reciting ""Candyman,"" five times.",Candyman

242,blackbrown,An unconventional review,7,24 December 2008,"A bit off topic, but this was in answer to a message board post.I grew up in Chicago (and, consequently, just turned on Candyman for the first time in years - I ate this stuff up as a kid, and let's face it, still do. At the store I kind of settled on this tonight, but when it came time to hit play I got excited to review it). The area where Cabrini Green is was a scary enough area as it is without the bogey-man hanging around. I lived about a mile or more from there in the early millennium and a large amount of those projects were being torn down by then. I would drive through that neighborhood daily because it was quick with little traffic (go figure!), but even 2 or 3 years prior to that time I wouldn't have even driven through there (and I don't scare easily). Today, I think there are 2 buildings left, though not sure. I would make a bet that it is one of the most changed neighborhoods in the country right now. There is still a ton of squalor, though now off the main tracks (North, Elston, Divi...like many hoods here) but now it's like an older extension of Wicker Park (a hipster hood) with a ton of shopping, etc. Still a tough spot though so keep an eye out west of Halsted!So, on topic, Cabrin Green itself was/is far scarier than anything else in the actual movie, but there's some great scares throughout, Fun Movie!",Candyman
243,benjaminspetrofsky,"Creepy, Elegant, Intelligent, and Dare I say... POSSIBLY Better Than ""Halloween?""",8,1 February 2014,"It's very hard to beat ""Halloween"" in the slasher genre, but ""Candyman"" is one such film that has met, and quite possibly, is even went past the standards.""Candyman"" is a story about a researcher named Helen who is doing a thesis on urban legends, and chooses to pursue the debunking of the ""Candyman,"" a near God-like figure to the residents of the slums, Cabrini Green in particular. Candyman was an African American from a rich family who fell in love with a white woman, and got her pregnant. This outraged white members of the town and killed him with bees, and cut off his hand, and jamming a hook into the stump. Now he haunts Cabrini Green, appearing whenever you say his name five times while looking in the mirror. Trying to prove Candyman doesn't exist, Helen gets more than she bargained for when she slowly realizes the myth is true, and starts to realize this murderous figure even loves her.The high point of this film is definitely in the chilling, haunting score by Phillip Glass, a spooky choir with a powerful tone that overwhelms you, and is especially fitting with the essence of Cabrini Green, and the slums in general.The acting is possibly one of the biggest points of this film too. This is especially rare in the slasher genre, since most of these kinds of films are made by new filmmakers, so it's common that you won't find a lot of talent. But here, the actors are convincing and not overplayed like screaming teenagers in other stereotypical slasher flicks.The direction is probably on par with the acting in this film, the way everything comes together is perfect. The music, the story, the visuals, the actors, everything fits perfectly here and the director did a very good job in making sure it all fit. This is definitely a ""must see"" for any fan of intelligent horror (as rare as it can be nowadays.) and will definitely please both the gore hounds and the art house fans alike.",Candyman
244,Liljan-2,Scary and sad,9,8 November 2001,"As far as horror movies are concerned, ""Candyman"" is one of my favorites. Despite the gore, there seems to be an atmosphere of sorrow and melancholy about the movie that you don't usually find in this genre - possibly enhanced by the sad and sombre soundtrack by Philip Glass. Personally, I find it easy to end up feeling sorry for the characters in the story,particularly Helen, her husband, Candyman himself and the miserable inhabitants of Cabrini Green. Great story, exquisit acting by everyone involved. Nine out of ten in my opinion.",Candyman

247,trryancy,"Intriguing concept, but just not that scary",5,14 April 2005,"The clip showed on the Bravo TV ""Scariest Movie Moments"" special grabbed me with the promise of surreal atmosphere and charismatic villains, and something about actor Tony Todd was positively magnetic. On all of those accounts, the film did not disappoint. Unfortunately, though, it rated pretty low on the chill factor. While not an unworthy film in and of itself, as a horror film, well, what's the point if it doesn't in the very least inspire you to double-check if you locked your doors before you can to bed?The plot centers around a Chicago grad student investigating a local urban legend about a supernatural serial killer, summoned through a mirror Bloody Mary style, who is reported to be stalking the projects. The graduate student, Helen, is as cynical as anyone would be, until the myth turns out to be real, and the Candyman (Tony Todd, marvelous) begins unraveling Helen's life and eliminating her loved ones as a very peculiar way of going about seducing her. And as far as dead serial killers go, the Candyman, with powers of hypnotism and a startling, yet not altogether unpleasant, appearance, is surprisingly effective, mingling psychological terrorism and emotional manipulation with tenderness and naked vulnerability.Tony Todd, standing 6'5"", with the resonant voice of James Earl Jones and the dignified elegance of Sidney Poitier, lends a poetic beauty and even a deep sense of sympathy to his character, who in his own way is a victim too. The Candyman already knows the pain that he is inflicting upon others, and thus seems just as empathetic as he is vicious. However, this might actually work against his character; instead of dreading his appearance, as Helen does, I actually looked forward to his screen time, and his sad eyes make his character very convincing. (In a way, Todd's physicality has already done half of the work for him.) Instead of relating with Helen's terror, confusion, and growing desperation, I identified with the Candyman's loneliness and hopelessly romantic, brokenhearted spirit. Really, I just felt too sorry for him to be afraid of him.For her part, Virginia Madsen is adept in a somewhat underdeveloped character. She is eminently watchable, and her beautiful, limpid eyes draw you in, even if the plot doesn't. Not that it is a bad plot- it seems that there is potential here that wasn't fully realized, though I'm not quite sure what it is. Perhaps it just failed to tap into my personal fears- some people have told me that they find this film positively terrifying. I believe I would have enjoyed this film more if it had been more the Candyman's story rather than Helen's, if we were allowed to get to know the Candyman as well as we are allowed to get to know Freddie in the first 'Nightmare on Elm Street' film. As we know, the victims and even the heroes of a horror franchise are ultimately disposable; it's the villains that we come back for (as wonderful as Jodie Foster was in 'Silence of the Lambs', it was really Hannibal who ultimately engaged the viewers, not Clarice). Yet there is something to be said that although I considered this a mediocre film, I still plan on watching the sequel, because I was nevertheless left wanting to know more.",Candyman
248,Krustofski,"Gruesome, Gory, Bloody, Unforgiving, And Genius",9,9 June 2005,"Candyman is a myth-to-movie adaption of that old tale we're all familiar with. For some of us, it's Bloody Mary, and for some of us, it's Jack The Ripper. No matter who the Aloysius, the story is the same: ""Say their name five times, and they'll pop up behind you and gut you with a hook!"" Oh what joyous times have I had with friends with the myth. For my town, it was Rose Mary. It was a sad bit of history taking place at an abandoned church which was located about fifty yards or so from my Virgian home. They said that she was killed and then raped there, and that seeing how she died a virgin and was sent to hell not one, that Satan spat her back up to Earth to the place where she died. Kids would make up reports of people who went to the church where found miles away, gutted, with a trail of blood that lead all the way back to the church. ""If you say her name in the mirror five times, she'll tear out you're heart and drag it all the way to the church, so no matter where you died, there'll be a trail of blood leading to where she died."" Good times, good times. Several years (and several moves I may add) later, Candyman was released. I was excited, but unfortunately never had the chance to see in it theaters. Well to all wondering, yes, there's a point to my long-winded history lesson, because years later, I was browsing through the TV tube, when to my miraculous delight, I saw Candyman, just about to start. I turned off the lights and closed all my drops, and the only light in the room was the beautifully illuminating glow of my TV screen. The screen faded from the pre-show to black, and then the marvelous orchestral score began, and in big, narrow letters the title appeared. The movie starts off simple, a high school girl invites a boy to come over one night while she baby sits her little sibling, just to have a little rocking, when the two teenagers lead up to the bathroom. The high school girl dares her hump-buddy to say the name of her town's deadly soul, Candyman, in the mirror five times. Grinning, the horny-hungry teen says the name. ""Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman...."" Failing the challenge of the girl, he's sent downstairs to wait for her 'present'. The girl, for some unknown reason, turns to the mirror, and substituting for her 'friend's final saying, repeats the name for the fifth time. There is silence. The girl turns off the light to the bathroom, and blood splatters the camera. Wow, what wild ride I had that night. Decapatations, guttings, and dozens of cheap thrills lie before more. I embraced every minute of it, and when it was over, I walked into the bathroom, and said the name four times. ""Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."" Then I looked in the mirror. I opened my mouth. And I waited. I still haven't said the name for the final time. Perhaps I'll invite someone over, a 'friend', and perhaps I'll just have to dare my friend.",Candyman
249,fiat0903,"Good start, goes bad",3,5 January 2008,"The first half of this film is about average for a mystery-thriller. Madsen plays a woman researching the urban myth of a hook-handed murderer. This is for a Ph.D. thesis. So our heroine is well above average in intelligence. She finds evidence that the myth may have basis in fact. She investigates, going to the scene of two murders. She is attacked by thugs, sustaining serious eye injury. Magically, a few days later she she is healed. (That is forgivable.) Not long after, she acts as if nothing had happened to her. She takes no care for her safety. She enters a parking garage. (Why do somany bad films have parking garage scenes?). She hears her name called from a great distance away. Normal people would hurry to get into their car and escape. Not our girl. She freezes, dropping her keys. Aw, c'mon. We are expected to believe that this woman is, in one scene, brilliant.

Virginia Madsen pushes the idea of a survivor girl to new heights. She's authentic. Which is something protagonists from horror movies always have a time struggling with.

254,lizimal,One of the best Clive Barker adaptations for screen,10,30 March 2004,"Candyman is an elegant little gem of a horror film, combining the best elements of the Clive Barker story it's drawn from with the imaginings of the director/writer of the film.Starring Virginia Madsen, who is at her absolute best in this film, which is reason enough to see it in my opinion, Candyman tells a wonderfully dark tale of love, death and revenge.  This is brilliantly set against mirrored worlds in Chicago, Virginia Madsen's character's posh upscale condo and its twin, the project Cabrini Green.  There is much going on within this film, beyond just the surface tale of horror, as there is in any good horror film. It's a morality play, a story about how we deal, or rather don't deal, with race relations, and a really beautifully twisted love story as well, as all of Barker's works are.If you've never had a chance to see this wonderful film, please give it a chance.  Tony Todd's voice will tingle your spine, there's enough gore for slasher film addicts to keep interested, but don't let that blind you to the smart, elegantly crafted story underneath.

256,daniel_maurer,(Still) A great way to waste 94 minutes,4,13 January 2006,"I found this film to be one of the worst films that I have sat through in a long, long while. I felt very much like ""Alex"" in A Clockwork Orange, straight jacketed, eyes peeled open, forced to watch the more nauseating end of cinema. Even a low budget effort such as Carnival of Souls is far more watchable than this travesty of celluloid schlock. I found most of the acting to be of an acceptable standard with my main gripe being the shallow premise, the ill thought story line, tawdry script and off the shelf stock clichés. This is one stinker of a movie. Sometimes a film is so bad it is good in some odd way or another but this isn't one of them. After 20 minutes I knew without a doubt that this film was never going to redeem itself but still I watched it to the bitter end. I must remember to get my head examined.Update: After digesting this film for a few days I have decided that I was perhaps a bit too hard on this film in my initial review, particularly by awarding it one star. I also withdraw the phrase ""travesty of celluloid schlock"" instead substituting words such as disappointing, unfulfilling and a letdown. The cinematography was handled very well, sets were well staged and most of the acting was of a reasonable standard. However, I still feel that it was an unimaginative script and story line riddled with clichés and, most important of all, NOT Scary!",Candyman
257,Sti3,Atmospheric urban horror masterpiece,10,3 November 1998,"Being from Chicago, I may be a bit biased, but Candyman is one of the most original horror films ever.

The idea that the worst stories we have heard are actually based in reality makes you think twice about how you address the stories you hear. I cannot say Candyman in front of the mirror, I just don't trust the world anymore after sitting through Candyman. It is my favorite horror movie, it is also the scariest horror film I have ever seen.

262,tht,"ok, a little anticlimactic, so what?",8,3 September 1999,"Candyman is one of my all time favorite horror movies.  It is genuinely scary, and it makes one have second thoughts when standing in front of a mirror.What I particularly enjoyed about the movie is the multidimensional development of the plot at the sociological, psychological, and parapsychological level.  The first scene of the movie presents in a nutshell the experience that the viewer is going to have, an experience so common (regarding urban legends) yet so distant.The acting (esp. by Virginia Madsen) is superb.  The setting could not be more perfect.  The shaggy, derelict apartment buildings at Cabrini Green create the proper ambience for what is to follow.Certainly the gory scenes are not very attractive, and in a way such explicit portrayal does not seem necessary, since the psychological suspense is the driving force of the movie.  Also the ending is rather anticlimactic and overdrawn.  Disappointing sequel....Fun to watch with people who scare easily!",Candyman
263,uva,"Loved this ""fable""!",9,24 August 2002,"Atmosphere 8 - The first half is filled with mystery (am I watching crime drama or horror? are the murders truly caused by supernatural forces?), so it's a pleasure and a scare to watch Helen investigate.
Story 9 - ""Never say Candyman 5 times in front of the mirror"". Helen (Virginia Madsen) for her thesis is determined to discover the truth behind this legend, that regularly kills the unwary reciter, and drives straight to the ghetto, as it's supposed to be home of Candyman. Solid background makes the story convincing.Ending 10 - Fabulous!OVERALL 9 (mean score) - Very enjoyable movie, with a strong lead performance from beautiful Virginia Madsen. The creepy music-box soundtrack and Tony Todd's low and spooky (but then, it's the Italian dubber's voice I'm talking about!) voice help mount the tension. Making follow-up episodes 2 and 3 was a mistake, though, as this movie is already complete. Also for me, it will always be Helen!",Candyman
264,creepshow,"Disturbing, Eeire, Unnecessary",1,5 December 1999,"I know a great deal of horror fans consider this movie to be one of the bests, but on the scale in which The Exorcist, The Haunting, and Psycho are measured, Candyman doesn't even make a mark. The sets are amazing, but the plot is far-reaching, the acting is forced, the gorey scenes go overboard, and the overuse of characters sink this film before it even has a chance. I try not to hate individual films because of the art form's young and tender age, but it's pretty hard not to hate this one. I hated the plot, the gorey sequences, the flashbacks, and the characters. Not to mention that the ground in which this movie walks on is tainted with the run-of-the-mill ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" slasher garbage. I profess to my friends, who agree with me, that this was one of the most unnecessary movies ever made. If you are looking for something scary, this terrible movie will scare you, and suck away two hours of your life as well.",Candyman

266,alp44,Right up there with Rosemary's Baby...,9,29 August 2021,"Urban horror done right. A disturbing, creepy tale scored perfectly by Philip Glass and executed and performed beautifully by Virginia Madsen and cast. Madsen (whom Hitchcock would have loved) brings intelligence and class to her role as a student researching her thesis. Rewatched this gem in 2021 and it hasn't lost any of its punch 29 years later. A strong back story make the villain a three dimensional, sympathetic character. One of my faves.",Candyman
267,NerdIncorporated,Excellent and underappreciated,10,16 August 2019,"What sets Candyman apart from most other slashers is its brilliant slow pacing. This movie takes its time to build up the story and characters. It is also mostly psychological as you wonder what's real or not.As well as that this movie contains some incredible themes of urban legends, saying how even after death murderers live on through people's memories. Often told as camp fire stories or Halloween tales. Jack the Ripper is one such example.Unlike most horror movie monsters Candyman is a tragic character. While you don't sympathise with him you learn of his backstory and you feel sorry for him. He wants to live on as an urban legend because that's all he has left at this point. He was robbed of the love of his life and brutally murdered. An innocent man killed for no reason.With some brilliant practical and makeup effects this is one horror film that'll live on through the memories of those who watched it.

This movie has got to be one of my all time favorites. This movie has got one of the most clever plots and they don't get a good plot then just let the movie bomb the movie is just as great. Not once does the acting get to over dramatic it stays just great.SCARES:This movie is filled with suspense a nd scares the whole way through. Some of the more scary scenes are the ones like when Virginia Madsens friend is brutally hooked to death and Virginia grabs a knife and ends up getting framed for the murder.I loved this movie and you will to if your a true horror fan!!!!

The premise, the performances, the score, the characters; everything about this movie is arguably perfect. In the minority of horror movies that doesn't spoonfeed the plot to you through excessive and cliched dialogue, instead giving you an intelligent premise and genuine characters & environments. In addition, fascinating behind the scenes stories only serve to heighten your interest in the film.",Candyman
270,holatuthola,In the same ranks as Friday the 13th and Halloween,8,18 July 2002,"I just saw Candyman for the second time (since 1995 or so) and can now positively say it ends in my personal top-10 of scary movies. That is thanks to its approach of the Supreme Horror character gradually, but determinedly driving his destined Victim to where he wants her. And it's thanks to the rather uncommon type of (beautiful) background music, which perhaps makes it somewhat more of a psychological horror film than a slasher. The end is slightly predictable, but that doesn't hurt too much because at the same time it's cynical enough to be funny. Whether it survives the ages remains to be seen (Friday and Halloween didn't) but it's a nicely uncomfortable horror movie.",Candyman
271,rjal,decent horror movie with a message,7,6 May 2006,"Not a classic though a decent horror movie with a message!The latter in particular to racial issues though without becoming judgemental. It made me jump on quite a few occasions. The plot prompts you to make several assumptions on what's behind it all (I won't say too much here, not to spoil the movie), though several twists make sure you will never quite guess how it's going to end. The 'finale' is unexpected as well, though in retrospect,a bit of a cliché as indeed it starts where it all begun, which has been used in quite a number of horror movies (in particular the typical 80's television ones). A sequel could have resulted, though I believe that has not happened (yet).",Candyman

I like movies that have some fun to them. This film was actually A Nightmare on Elm Street with all the fun removed, and torture replacing it. No, this is not some ""cerebral/adult horror film that makes you think"", it's just a Freddy Krueger ripoff for the 1990's generation. If your idea of a good horror movie is lots of pain, blood and gore, then Candyman is for you. As for me, I'll stick to Freddy, Jason and Michael.",Candyman

275,naive,It ranks up there with the best,10,20 January 1999,"I am a horror buff, and i have to say that Candyman is a masterpiece of modern horror. Candyman should be compulsory viewing for anyone making a horror/thriller movie as an educational tool. It has the best soundtrack that i've ever heard in its genre, and, where there is elements of horror, it is not exploitative. The whole movie is created with an eye for sensitivity, while at the same time shocking the hell out of you. Liam, you don't know what you are talking about. Texas Chainsaw Massacare is a sick perversion, not horror. Candyman is a classic and will be popular for years to come. The ending is exquisite, and is a fitting end to a brilliant movie.",Candyman
276,BigShemp,The Best Horror Film of the '90's.,10,28 August 1999,"Managing to be both frightening and classy, this is a nerve-wracking experience.  Masterfully written and directed by Bernard Rose, the film creates its own fascinating mythology, which, given the fact that it was based on a Clive Barker story, isn't much of a surprise. Much better than the resultant sequels, this is one not to be missed.",Candyman
277,brett-29,Truly scary and stylish movie,9,31 May 1999,"This is a great horror film.

278,rekca,This movie scared the daylights out of me....,7,15 August 2003,"I've a horror movie buff. So sue me. As long as it is something that I cannot foresee happening in real life, I'll cheer on the gore. Freddy Krueger is not going to kill me in my dreams. If my car breaks down, I will not end up at Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses. Michael Myers is the name of a brilliant Canadian actor. And, the Candyman is not going to appear in my mirror (I hope).I took a poll among my friends and we all unanimously agreed that this movie was the scariest we have ever seen. The Candyman and the last episode of Twin Peaks make one never want to look straight into a mirror again!
Tony Todd, who plays the Candyman, does a great job of being one of the creepiest of the horror movie genre villains, that deep voice of his sends chills down your back. Only Clive Barker (and, okay maybe Stephen King) could dream something like this up.So, don't watch it expecting something spectacular, it's not an Oscar-winning movie, it's just made for cheap thrills, as are a lot of horror movies. Be sure to watch it in the dark, but don't watch it alone....",Candyman

281,johnpetersen,Near-perfect but often misunderstood horror.,10,17 May 2003,"Candyman is one of my all-time favorite horror movies, and it seems to me that it is often underappreciated and misunderstood.  It is a rarity in its genre, for it goes deeper than the standard formula horror movie, presenting a story under a story.  While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.  After the first time, pay careful attention to the dialogue and the interactions between Helen and the Candyman.  The Candyman is not what he first appears to be.<SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON...STOP HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!>The biggest complaints I usually hear about this movie are of plot holes. People often ask, ""Why does the Candyman haunt the black population instead of the descendents of those who killed him?"" or, ""Why does the hook make Helen come back when it is not what made Candyman come back?"" or other similar questions.  These are valid questions about the ghost story concerning Daniel Robetei, but they entirely miss the point of the movie. That point is that the incarnation we see of Candyman in the movie is NOT the ghost of Daniel Robetei.  Forget what the pointless sequels lead you to believe, for in the first movie, as well as the original story ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker, the Candyman is an incarnation of the faith of those who tell stories about him.  There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself. It seems to me that almost everyone misses this point, but it is there, clear as day, if you listen closely to the dialogue.  Of course, reading the original story helps shed a little light on this as well, and it can be found in Clive Barker's ""In the Flesh,"" a collection of short stories. So, Candyman haunts the black population because they are the ones who tell the stories and believe in him.  He is constantly asking Helen to ""be his witness"" in order to strengthen their belief, and his offer to her to live forever is literal.  If she does become his witness, she will become a part of the story, and a part of the creative force that allows Candyman to exist.  In the end, Helen returns because the population of Cabrini Green makes her a part of the story.I hope this sheds a little light on the story for those of you stuck on the plot holes.  This really is a fantastic, original story that is much more complex than that of any other horror movie I have seen.  Not to mention that the performances are fantastic.  Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen have a fantastic chemistry that is very convincing.  The only gripe I have about this movie is the p***-poor actress they picked for Helen's husband's girlfriend. So, watch it first for the shocks, but watch it again for the deeper story buried within.Definately a perfect 10/10.",Candyman

Perhaps so, but don't let it fool you. For me this film is hauntingly beautiful. It is poetic, sad and painful. It is not ordinary horror film with stupid teens running stupidly. There is no heroic characters saving the day. There is no stupid jokes, actually there is no humor at all. No, this is not funny film. This film is scary in a way I cannot explain. And the brilliant music makes the story and its characters penetrate to your heart.There is no unnecessary gore scenes. Those few disturbing scenes must be there to make things more ugly, more desperate. But they are not there for shock value (as someone mentioned) as such. This film must be seen if you want emotion and intellect inside horror.",Candyman

The film is based on the short story 'The Forbidden' by Clive Barker, who also wrote and directed Hellraiser. The film which remains true to the original story adds great depth to the characters and improves upon the tale in almost every way. If you are a fan of Clive Barker's writing this is a real treat. If not, the film still holds up well in the vein of 'The Silence of the Lambs'. I don't believe in any way that this is a straight up slasher film. It is far to stylistically involved to be thrown into that idiotic category. So if your a fan of thrillers go rent or buy immediately.
