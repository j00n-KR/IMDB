0,Leofwine_draca,Not recommended,3,4 September 2021,"Another revamp of the classic fairy tale, this time given a modern multi-ethnic HAMILTON type vibe. Pure fantasy throughout with a medieval backdrop with modernist elements at times. The whole thing is about the superficiality of appearance with the emphasis on fancy clothing and casting attractive performers in the lead roles, but of course on the other side of that you get extremely shallow characters and stilted acting. Cinderella has been given a feminist spin in that she's now a successful fashion designer in her own right, but they also prolong feminine stereotypes by doing that. How about making her a master builder? James Corden continues to be the kiss of death for everything he appears in, and the only interesting songs are covers. Not a recommended film.",Cinderella
1,Sleepin_Dragon,No amount of glitter will help here sadly.,2,16 October 2021,"It tries so hard to be politically correct and equal, that it forgets the meaning of the story.Some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life, at times I thought I was watching a spoof, this really does need to be seen to be believed.The people behind this movie wanted to make some sort of statement, that is obvious, but to literally tear up the sweet story of Cinderella, that's just not on, couldn't you have called it something else? What next? I shudder to think.I wanted to like it, but come on this was just cringe worthy.A disaster, 2/10.",Cinderella
2,CinemaSerf,There is far more than one pumpkin in this film.,5,16 September 2021,"I tried, I really did! I hoped that the fairly decent, experienced, ensemble cast coupled with state of the art visual effects and a collection of modern-day pop lyrics would breathe new life into this timeless story. Well, sadly, that was all just a triumph for optimism over, well, just about anything... It's terrible. Good looking, well produced, but terrible. Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it's nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I'd not be so harsh - but I'm not and this is poor, really poor...",Cinderella
3,ferguson-6,only Porter brings the magic,4,3 September 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. In keeping with the times, writer-director Kay Cannon (the screenwriter for three PITCH PERFECT movies) has turned the classic and ancient Cinderella tale into an agenda movie, albeit one adorned with new and lively adaptations of popular songs. The earliest versions of the folk tale date back 2000 years, while the most widely-accepted fairy tale version was penned by 17th century French writer Charles Perrault, who also wrote ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". Since then, there have been countless renditions around the globe in various forms: literary, stage, musical theatre, TV, and animated and live action film. As far as I can tell, this is the first feminist take.Opening with the town folks performing Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"", we are then introduced to Ella (pop singer Camila Cabello in her first movie), who lives in the basement of her stepmother's (Idina Menzel) home. Yes, Ella has two stepsisters, although neither are particularly wicked. In fact, Anastasia (Maddie Baillio) appears almost disinterested, while Drizella (Charlotte Spencer) is at times, downright hilarious (in a Leslie Mann kind of way). Even the stepmother has moments of respectability and decency with Ella.Ella's only friends are the three mice who also live in the basement. It's here where she hones her talent as a dress designer and dreams of having her own business (""how hard can it be?""). For her, she sees fashion design as not just her way out of the basement, but more importantly, as her road to independence. She doesn't need a man or anyone else, and is skilled in daily affirmations. Hers is less of a 'dream' and more of a goal, despite the challenges of her situation.Of course this is still a Cinderella story, and Nicholas Galitzine plays Prince Robert, an unfocused young man who lacks the drive to be king and fulfill the ultimate wish of his father, King Rowan (Pierce Brosnan). On the other hand, Robert's sister, Princess Gwen (Tallulah Greive) is both driven and filled with ideas on ways to improve the kingdom. Her father readily dismisses her from matters of importance (men things), while Queen Beatrice (Minnie Driver) initially tries to maintain peace in the family. Knowing that this is a musical, and seeing Pierce Brosnan's name in the credits, might generate nightmarish flashbacks for those who experienced his singing in MAMMA MIA! (2008). While he does tease/threaten us with singing, most of his musical bits are quite tongue-in-cheek.Bringing a jolt of energy to the story at a time when it's desperately needed is Billy Porter as Ella's non-binary Fabulous Godmother, known as Fab G. Porter's costume and overall flamboyance are a hoot to watch, and oh by the way, he's quite a singer as well. And yes, the three mice turn into coachmen played by James Corden, James Acaster, and Romesh Ranganathan. They do serve up some comic relief, but likely not as much as they or the filmmaker hopes. Surprisingly, the set design and costume design are fairly drab - the two exceptions being Porter and the ball.In addition to the opening ""Rhythm Nation"" song, you'll hear a version of Salt-N-Pepa's ""What a Man"", as well as other familiar tunes. The music and the shift in Ella's approach are the contemporary touches, as the girl-power theme stresses there's no need for a man ... even a Prince. The twist on the Cinderella tale varies from previous versions, the most popular being Kenneth Branagh's 2015 film with Lily James and Cate Blanchett, the 1997 film with Whitney Houston as the Fairy Godmother, and of course, Walt Disney's 1950 animated classic. Ms. Cannon's version is still a love story; it's just love of one's self and career, rather than the love of another person. A tale perfectly suited to the times.In select theaters and on Amazon Prime beginning September 3, 2021.",Cinderella
4,John6Daniels,5th time reviewing this Awesome movie.,1,9 November 2021,🤥.This movie was trash. It features a BANJOE. I'm not sure why. The acting was horrid.Effects and light alone can't save a hash movie like this. Producers should have fed the movie to a dog.The original author must be vex to the max for this has hashella. .,Cinderella
5,Thanos_Alfie,Boring...,3,21 September 2021,"""Cinderella"" is a Comedy - Family movie in which we watch the classic story of Cinderella but in a modern musical way. Cinderella has her own big dreams that she wants to succeed but her godmother has different plans for her.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed by it. The plot was mostly the same as in all the previous ""Cinderella"" movies that exist while the direction which was made by Kay Cannon failed to create something different or even new except the modern songs that already existed. The interpretations of Camila Cabello who played as Cinderella, Nicholas Galitzine who played as Prince Robert, Pierce Brosnan who played as King Rowan and Minnie Driver who played as Queen Beatrice were below average and did not succeed on making the difference and save this movie. All in all, I have to say that ""Cinderella"" is a below average comedy musical and I do not recommend anyone to watch it because I do not want you to waste your time as I did.",Cinderella
6,Tweetienator,One of the Worst Cinderellas - Easy,3,9 September 2021,"I rated Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (starring Lily James, 2015) a 6 - it is entertaining and solid, but this new Cinderella makes Branagh's version look like a masterpiece. I don't talk about casting choices or changes to characters and the like but the execution of the whole affair - the tone is all wrong, the humor feels forced and generic, the whole thing feels like something made up in one day and than filmed in one or two days + post production by the special effects guys. But one thing they got right: the producers achieved to put almost every imaginable modern cliche in this movie. And last but not least, the songs are, well, lets be tender, mucho improvable. Why Pierce Brosnan got involved into this mess (the Mamma Mia movies are Oscar material compared), I don't understand. One of the worst Cinderellas I ever witnessed.Last note: sometimes I suspect, the producers believe their own fake reviews ;)",Cinderella
7,digitalbeachbum,"Cute, but not Cinderella",1,4 September 2021,"I was really looking forward to this, but what a disappointmentSo, if you are going to do Cinderella you have to stick with the basic game plan. You have a girl who is abused after father dies and the step mother takes over, and the two step sisters are mean also.The ball comes along and Cinderella gets to go because the fairy godmother uses magic to send her in a beautiful gown and in a pumpkin carriage. There is the glass slippers, and the wedding at the end.You can change stuff to a certain extent but when you cross over those boundaries then it stops being Cinderella. This movie takes too many liberties and too much creative license with the story. For example:Cinderella has a step mother that isn't cruel, she's just missed out on her dream as a pianist and it's all because of a male world. (bs)Cinderella doesn't want to marry the prince. Instead she want's to make dresses, and has an opportunity to travel the world with a Queen from another country. (bs)The mice who are turned in to footmen joke about having to take a pee out of their ""front tail"". (totally not needed)There is no pumpkin, just a crate which turns in to a carriage and two horses. (meh)The fairy godmother isn't a godmother. (this is ok, but don't call him a fairy godmother).The prince doesn't want to be king and wants to travel the world with Cinderella, not married, but as love interests. (meh)Instead the Princess wants to be King, is corrected by the mother that she would be Queen. (meh)There are other changes which I did not like, but most of all I thought the movie missed the mark. It was sort of like 'Ella Enchanted and they even had the same Queen songs. It had a good cast, but I blame the director and the writer (all the same persons) for the mistakes.This is not Cinderella. Don't call it as such.",Cinderella
8,RosanaBotafogo,"Very extremely musical, it even looks like Disney movies...",8,10 October 2021,"Very extremely musical, it even looks like Disney movies, full of boring jokes, characters with even less grace, what a disenchanted prince, Cabello is rebellious and alone, only worth the paradigm shifts and seals, I loved the Fado Godmother and the coachman mice, from rest simple...",Cinderella
9,lisafordeay,Has its plus and minus an OK movie.,5,4 September 2021,"Cinderella 2021 is another remake of the classic fairytale. This time its Camila Cabello who gets to put on the glass slippers. Also starring with Camila Cabello is Minnie Driver, Idina Menzel,Billy Porter, Nicolas Galtinze,and Pierce Brosnan. Ella (Cabello) dreams of being a fashion designer and selling her designs to the public. However her stepmother Vivian(Indina Menzel) wants her to marry a suitor named Thomas(who I swore was Keith Lemon)to Ella's dismay. Things turn around though as Ella meets Prince Robert (Nicolas) at the marketplace who becomes smitten with Ella.Will Ella's dreams come true and will she win the heart of the prince. Overall I found this film to be pointless. Here are my pros and cons.Pros
Camila was funny in this film and I hope she stars in more films in the future.Billy Porter(who is only in it for barely 10 mins) stoked the entire film for me. I even loved the song Shining Star.Nicolas and Camila had great chemistry
The whole not marrying the prince in the end took me by surprise.Cons
Jukebox songs didn't fit the film at all as it was pointless(oh yeah did i forget to mention this resembles Ella Enchanted).Crier raps
Pierce Brosnan can't sing
Stepsisters way too nice.Princess Gwen(Robert's sister) was pointless.However there is a few tweaks like Cinderella not marrying Robert yet and Robert's sister becomes the next ruler as well as Idina Menzel getting a solo song called Dream Girl and the fairy godmother is a man instead of a woman.Stick to the 2015 one instead.",Cinderella
10,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Cinderella,6,6 September 2021,"6/10 - I'm a huge Kay Cannon fan, so I was excited for this much-needed update on the classic fairy tale (that has never really been well-liked by me), but the finished product felt very half-baked and incomplete despite a talented cast and crew.",Cinderella

14,questl-18592,Ella Disenchanted,2,11 September 2021,"I feel bad for the children of this generation if this is the Cinderella they have to grow up with. Once upon a time, Disney nailed this with a wonderfully animated masterpiece full of whimsy and magic. Now we get this mashed up, sloppy mess to slog through. The songs all feel forced and out of place, like the person in charge of song selection just picked out a bunch of songs they liked and then threw them all over the timeline of this film whether they make any sense or not. We get like three rise up/empowerment songs in the first 20 minutes, a love song about 30 seconds after Cinder and the Prince meet and a few too many reprises.But hey, it's a musical, so the music has to at least be good ri- NOPE! 99% of the songs feel so off because it's painfully obvious they weren't sung anywhere near the moment but rather were recorded in a studio and then later layered on top of all the lip synchs. I get that doing songs during shoots could be tough but they could've at least tried a little to make it sound better and more accurate. Got Cinderella running and jumping all over the place while singing and her tone never changes in the slightest and you can feel that.The characters are classics, pre-written for the movie with years of history and background to pull from. They still mess it up. Motivations are sloppy and muddled. Character growth happens in fits and spurts rather than feeling like there's any sort of progression. The prince goes from a perma-bachelor bro to in love with Cinder in no time at all for something completely stupid (that would've gotten her imprisoned as well). Cinderella rarely feels like the downtrodden, put upon sister we all know her to be. Instead she's got a couple of mildly annoying step-sisters but don't worry! Rather than dealing with them she'll spend her time in this surprisingly large and fairly stylish basement/dress making area. There's only one or two times she really seems all that put upon and they feel so shocking that, once again, it draws me out of the film.The only redeeming factors, to me, were the mice, Idina Menzel and the fairy ""godmother."" The mice added a nice little splash of comedy but were hit and miss at times. Idina Menzel brought he spectacular pipes to show and she belts out some stunning notes throughout this that really showed off the difference between pop star and stage star. Then we have Billie Porter as the Fabulous Godmother. While I don't love the character, I really appreciate how Porter was just going for it. It was clear he was having fun in the role and that's what this really needed.Cinderella is a mess. It's tone deaf, confused about it's message, poorly written, poorly paced and as much as I can appreciate anachronisms in film when done right, these are not. The random influx of modern terminology and jokes feels so out of place in this setting and when coupled with the clash of empowering and degrading women it just doesn't work. Even the big finale was telegraphed to the point that as soon as we meet a certain character I looked at the friend I was watching it with and we both immediately called the ending of this. This is not worth watching the actual movie for. If anything, wait a little bit until the scenes are all available on youtube and just look up Menzel and Porter's moments. The rest of this is just a waste of a classic property.",Cinderella

16,rannynm,A Feel-Good Modern Musical Take On The Evergreen Tale Of Cinderella,10,3 September 2021,"A modern, musical take on the evergreen fairy tale, Cinderella's impeccable sets and wardrobe, as well as its talented cast make this production a one-of-a-kind watch.Cinderella follows the story of Ella (Camilla Cabello), a poor orphan who lives with her abusive, restrictive stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel) and her mean, obnoxious and spoiled stepsisters (Maddie Baillio, Charlotte Spencer). She loves to design dresses and even has her own workplace in her basement, where a crew of merry mice (James Corden, Romesh Ranganathan, James Acaster) watch over her. It is her dream is to open up a dress shop in the town marketplace; however, in her kingdom, women cannot run businesses. When Prince Robert (Nicholas Galitzine), the unassuming heir apparent, lays eyes on Ella, he falls head over heels in love with her, as does she for him. However, as Cinderella and Prince Robert find themselves and their paths in life, a series of decisions they must take puts their love story in jeopardy. There are lots of subplots and side stories in the film, but that's the main plotline.Cinderella maintains a steady and engaging pace with just enough action, comedy, romance and drama throughout the nearly two-hour duration. As it's told through a combination of songs and dialogue, it's only logical that the cast is comprised of a mixture of singers, actors, and comedians. Camila Cabello, Billy Porter and Idina Menzel ""slay"" in the film, as Porter's character (Ella's fairy godparent) would say. Their delivery is clear and, in the case of Cabello and Menzel, though a lot of the film's soundtrack is comprised of remakes (like Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation); it's refreshing to hear their take on the songs. Pierce Brosnan plays the stately, confident, yet flawed and patriarchal King Rowan and Minnie Driver acts as his strong, regal Queen Beatrice. I love the portrayal of strong women in the film. Beatrice, Ella and even Vivian have one thing in common - they are restricted by their society. Vivian had to give up on her passion; Beatrice must sit silently next to her husband for life; and Ella is at risk of losing her dreams. It's certainly unique to see this struggle in a fairy tale film. Shot at Pinewood Studios in the UK, the film's sets are impeccable, and I truly felt I was in a medieval kingdom with the characters.Cinderella promotes advocating for yourself, pushing against restrictive gender roles, following your dreams, choosing your own destiny and so many more positive messages! There are only one or two uses of mild profanity in this film.I give Cinderella 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",Cinderella
17,nancyldraper,Bad with moments of greatness,6,11 September 2021,"Totally ridiculous, anachronistic, horribly written musical... but the musical talent is spectacular. I wasn't crazy about all the song choices, but the choral harmonies and dance numbers get you out of your seat. And there are two musical moments that make it worth watching the movie, the PERFECT duet at the ball and the look on Camila Cabello's face when Idina Menzel assumes the high melody note in their mini-duet (1:44:18). (It was a pure recognition of the incomparable talent that is Idina Menzel!) The final musical number is pure joy! Those musical moments are straight up 9 (superb) but, alas, I give this movie a 6 (fair) out 10. {Fantasy Musical}",Cinderella
18,lambiepie-2,Tried A DIfferent Avenue and Failed,3,7 September 2021,"I was excited to look at a different take on an old story. This one wasn't as different as I thought it could be as it was jumbled. I enjoyed a few minutes here and there (with Billy Porter and the mice - James Acaster, James Corden, and Romesh Ranganathan) all be it -what - 5 minutes of the film? Yikes.I was just looking at Cinderella the lead character as she was. She's treated like crap, got ashes on her face, we know the child is abused no matter how they tell the story. Having a dress store when the idea is to KEEP her away from people - okay, nice touch but it just didn't work as it should have. Placing that aside, this Cinderella did not move me to make me feel for her to 'rise above' it at all.There's so much here gone South - this 'Ella' was quite annoying, the Prince was a yawn - I wanted to propel him from the kingdom my self - I hated Ella's ball dress, etc., etc. And there's no way in Hades I saw Idina Menzel as the wicked Stepmom. Cate Blanchett set that bar kinda high in a modern remake of Cinderella a few years ago and -- to me she woulda made a better Queen in this with a better script and musical numbers. And let me not get on the ""musical numbers"" - hack-hack-cough! The ""nod"" to the Hamilton-esque ball announcer COULD have been a great addition with the right script and..the musicians REALLY PLAYED THE INSTRUMENTS that were represented in the song. Sorry, that I noticed and it stuck out to me like a sore thumb.It's not the WORST adaptation of Cinderella, but it just didn't grab you as it was hyped up to do and the differences were just not that engaging enough.",Cinderella
19,juanmuscle,I watched this free on amazon as..,10,3 September 2021,"Part of their thing, monthly thing! And I thought (well I clicked on it cause it was real big! Lol) but I was hesitant cause it looked weird and it was some sort of musical or something and musicals to me are weird! But then I went for and I realized after getting used to the weirdness of breaking into song at random times I ended up loving it and not just loving it , but really loving it! I loved every second of it, the characters were vibrant and it was teeming with life and the lady who created all this really fashioned some fine back and forth banter and the music and the magic and the fun and clever everything plus the themes were wholly universal and incredible and I loved every second of it! And I don't even like contemporary music that much I love Iron Maiden but oh well, I still ended up loving this more! The lady who wrote all this and she directed it, looks like they gave her complete freedom and she went for it just plastered her canvas with all sorts of fun stuff everywhere! I was sure a delight to watch this, I was surprised afterward to even see one dismal review , cuase I think she should win best something of the year , do they have a musical category cause this most def deserves some nice reward! And it was PG , so the whole thing just made me feel so cute and sweet and one with the world!",Cinderella
20,brookenichole-98054,Cute,6,5 September 2021,"Cinderella is actually not that bad. There are quite a few enjoyable moments that kept me watching. A lot of the performances were terrific and made me smile. I thought Camila did a wonderful job, seeing as this is her first time acting. I enjoyed the romance between the Prince and Ella.I didn't enjoy some of the songs because they felt so out of place. And the Shining Star scene went on for far too long. The mice were kind of annoying and useless. Even the whole feminism part was kind of annoying, too. I wish the stepmother had been more evil since that's what she is. Also, this sort of felt like a rip off of Ella Enchanted.But overall, it was a fun movie!",Cinderella
21,Snootz,Socio-political nonsense,3,5 September 2021,"Because of the talent of the actors I really wanted to like this. However, the closer this got to the end, the more it became evident this movie teaches children modernist, feminist, socio-political me-ism and downgrades marriage as a valid institution. ""Why put a label on it?"" I'll tell you why: because love warrants a firm foundation, not a sloppy ""until I get tired of you"" attitude.I understand they were trying to update the fairy-tale story of Cinderella... but they took that concept too far. I have no problem with the Hispanic Cinderella; the main actress could not have been cuter. The supporting actors were enjoyable in their parts. Until they hit the last half hour or so, I found it enjoyable. Then it just turned stupid.Flash to the writers and directors: You can get married and still accomplish your life's goals. If someone is going to be selfish and pursue their dreams in exclusion to everything else, let them do so alone. Love isn't about selfishness and self-fulfillment; it's about forming a partnership. There's your socio-political statement, but with some common-sense added to it.Currently this movie has a rating of 4, and deserves it. It sends the wrong message to children, twists the original story to the point of being unrecognizable (a WOODEN CRATE instead of a pumpkin? Are they serious? What blockhead came up with that concept? Surely they could have come up with something funnier and more interesting).I did enjoy a lot of the music, but the movie had some of the worst choreography we've seen in some time. If the ""morals"" of this story is what the modern world is about... maybe humanity is due for a major wake-up call. I would not take a child of any age to see this movie. These aren't the kind of morality and ethics I'd wish to teach children... and it's not the director's privilege to try to mold children's minds. One does get tired of having someone's personal agendas shoved down our throats through ""children's movies"".",Cinderella

Of course, for the third time, it's still the same themes that are taken at surface level and shove straight at the face of the audiences. There were barely any character developments, and each character fit into the typical categories.Okay the good thing is that this movie was a musical, which played to the advantage of Camila Cabello, because she didn't have to act a lot. She was honestly cringe couple of times, and not really funny. This was partly her fault tho. It's also the script with the lame jokes. Camila making the babbling baby meme was legit off-putting.Oh and she's not the only cringe one. I had to bring up one scene near the end between the king and queen characters. Oh dear lord I wanted to rinse my eyes and ears after witnessing the weirdest scene in the movie.Well I actually did enjoy many of the songs. The songs were mostly popular ones that audiences would recognize. I like those songs so I had a fun time singing along.

Amazon prime ""Sinderella""?My Rating 3/10Last week I watched the ""A Cinderella Story."" the 2004 modern teen update version of this overdone Classic starring Hilary Duff and Jennifer Coolidge as Fiona The Stepmom from hell .Compared to this 2021 ""Woke"" borefest produced by James Cordon ""A Cinderella Story."" was original , funny and very entertaining.What was James Cordon thinking of ?There have been so many brilliant adaptations of Cinderella especially the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical version and also non musical versions but this one is just a juke box adaptation featuring a string of songs from other sources.Songs that are covered in this film includes Perfect by Ed Sheeran,Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson,Its Gotta Be by D'serre,Shining Star by Earth Wind And Fire and Lets Get Loud by Jennifer Lopez.What will be next a wrap Latino version of ""My Fair Lady "" ? Which just happens to be a Cinderella Story also along with ""Pretty Woman"" the Julia Robert's 1990 hit.I loved the 2015 Lily James , Cate Blanchett , Richard Madden version of Cinderella it retained and added to the magic tale Cate Blanchett was especially brilliant as Stepmother.The version should be called ""Sinderella.""
I loathed just about every moment of it the only reason I gave it a 3 Rating is for the 3 people I liked in it Billy Porter as The Fabulous Godmother, Minnie Driver as Queen Beatrice and as much as I hate to say it Idina Menzel is good as a much more benign Stepmother . (I'm not an Idina fan)
The rest of the cast forget it Cinderella Camilla Cabbello in her first movie looks pretty not quite a Disney Princess and sings like a chipmunk I'm sure her voice was speeded up.The Prince Nicholas Galitzine lacks any romantic appeal in my opinion and is ax annoying as his father King Rowan.For me the most pitiful member of the cast is Pierce Brosnan as King Rowan , he's truly awful! It's probably not his fault as the script by Kay Cannon who also Directed this overblown , overdone confection is not even worthy of a High School Production.I'm glad that James Cordon has plenty of cash to spend and that he likes musicals but perhaps he should stick to Carpool Karaoke.This movie probably could have funded 3 or 4 Indie movies it's a wasteful shame of money and some talent.I read that one cast member Comedian Romesh Ranganathan, not exactly renowned for singing abilities (by his own admission), has said of his casting that clearly the studio must have needed to ""fill a quota"". He also estimates that for him to complete his singing part took at least 60 takes.I only hope that Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber's new stage musical production that's just opened on The West End is a better effort than this disappointing effort at least it looks original from the clips I've seen.",Cinderella

I would've just gotten someone a little more well known for the step mother (like Kathryn Hahn, or someone like that). Brosnan was a nice pick, especially (I couldn't think of anyone better). The princess (Tallulah Grieve) was a really good pick, also (she's *really* pretty, but fits the role very well and is a good addition to the movie and plot, not to give anything away). Maddie Baillio (I think that's her name) also really shines in her role (give this girl more work), but the whole cast did great.They should've had more songs like the Niko and Vinz song (refreshing stuff - like ""Sweetest Girl"" by Wyclef Jean), and some parts seemed a little cheap, which is my only reason for not giving it a 10. I just couldn't relate to most of the other songs, even if they were done well and sounded good.This is a great movie. Don't listen to reviews -- see it for yourself. I totally believe there is just a bunch of people online who like to bash everything, and these reviews are almost evidence.I liked the ending a lot.",Cinderella
28,trinaboice,Very flawed but fun,5,6 September 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Based on the movie poster, I was prepared to not like this new rendition of the legendary story because Cinderella looked way too cocky to be Cinderella, but as soon as the music started, I was intrigued. My favorite version of the Cinderella story is Cinderella (2015) (Theatrical) with Lily James. She was sooo lovely and perfect in it, giving the film heart, class, and true Disney magic. This iteration of the story, however, has become extremely controversial because of its in-your-face wokeness.The synopsis is described by the studio as featuring an ambitious heroine who has big dreams. With the help of her fab Godmother, she perseveres to make them come true. This new take on the classic story was both written and directed by the boundary-pushing Kay Cannon. One of my guilty-pleasure franchises is Pitch Perfect, which she also wrote. This is Columbia Picture's first exclusive Amazon Studios film.THINGS I LIKED:
Camila Cabello has a beautiful voice and did an excellent job in the title role. I've read several reviews that trashed her but I thought she was a breath of fresh air and even had some comedic chops. I really enjoyed her modern take on this epic figure in Disney history. She made some controversial comments many years ago that some critics are bringing up, but I simply judged her performance in this piece.The talented cast also includes Nicholas Galitzine, the fantastic Idina Menzel, Pierce Brosnan, Minnie Driver, Billy Porter, and James Corden.James Corden helped to produce the film, yet only has a few scenes in the story. For some reason, there is a lot of hate flying his way, but I actually get a kick out of him.Take a look at Nicholas Galitzine's mouth, especially when he sings. Doesn't it kind of remind you of Freddy Mercury's mouth?When is Minnie Driver going to start aging? She looks great!Isn't every movie better when Idina Menzel sings in it? Yes. The answer is yes.Lots of humor, both spoken and visual. I laughed out loud many times.The set designs are beautiful. The majority of the film was shot in the famous Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Several scenes were also filmed in Waddesdon Manor and Lancashire in Blackpool. Several years ago, I got to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Blenheim Palace where I learned I actually have ancestors who lived there! I slipped and fell on one of the gravel pathways at the entrance, cutting a huge gash in my knee. You could say that place is in my blood. I still have a big scar from my time there.Really fun dance numbers.Billy Porter is ""fabulous"", although I know many people will really hate seeing the fairy godmother portrayed as he does.The town crier, played by Doc Brown, offers a Hamilton-like vibe to the musical when he sings.This is the first time we see comedians James Acaster and Romesh Ranganathan in a movie.The costume that Cinderella wears at the beginning of the movie is the same one Lily James wore in her 2015 Cinderella film, except it's a different color.Beautiful costume design. The only time I was worried was when Cinderella wore her ball gown. It was beautiful but I worried that it might fall off her.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
A lot of viewers are complaining that they don't like being lectured to during the entire movie and that it feels more like a political agenda than entertainment.Cinderella throws her glass slipper at someone and it doesn't break.Whatever happened to a sense of duty and respect? The message feels like they're telling our young girls to be self-centered and to ignore their responsibilities if they don't like them.A lot of the singing is auto-tuned. In some cases, it's really obvious when the voices don't match the audio.Some of the song choices were spot on; others seemed a bit odd.Who is the villain in this story? Even the ""Evil"" stepmother isn't evil, just not that nice. The story really softens her personality and makes her just seem misunderstood.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is the first time we see the fairy godmother as non-binary...and a butterfly.A conversation about how a mouse/man pees through his ""front tail."" Cringe.No profanity, except using God's name in vain.""Progressive"" messaging to young girls.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",Cinderella

31,alcantaraj-16594,A FEATURE LENGTH JAMES CORDEN SKETCH,7,26 October 2021,"""Cinderella"" is great at being a musical, but just okay at being a romantic fantasy film. At certain times, it feels like a feature length James Corden sketch - which are, in my opinion, okay- while the scene with the Fabulous Godmother is a bit too long. As for the jokes, they can be hit or miss. The best part of the film is definitely Camila Cabello and Idina Menzel.",Cinderella
32,daisukereds,"""Word of Mouth"" the film",6,9 September 2021,"More of a Stage-Play-Singalong than an ""Adventure"". Very akin to Highschool Musical with a mix of original work and pop-songs.A spin on the Cinderella script. With an incredible production, energy and liveliness enough to brighten one's day if you come in with the right mindset. With some very good dialogue, interactions and music, and that alone is enough to warrant a watch if you are reading this for the final push. Everything about it works well, and it is pretty good for what it is. I quite enjoyed most parts.The lead (a singer in her first movie, it seems) is Quirky and charming enough. Although Cinderella's singing sounds too.. sound stage-y at times, specially compared to her step sisters' singing or even the Prince's first attempt that sound more natural. Idina Menzel is great in anything. And the rest of the cast is also impressively good and talented! More so when the movie actually makes even extras stand out. This is such a good picture to be a female actress in (with the clear female-oriented attention).As a movie movie, it is a tad underwritten in parts. Some questionable CGI. And it is longer than it should be, reaching it's high point in the middle which makes it drag for a bit. With little romance and drama.In the end, it's probably not for your average movie-goer.",Cinderella
33,jakethesnake-42007,Bad Cheesy and over the top but some parts I liked,5,9 September 2021,Oh wear to begin with this mess of a musical. First off the song chives where bad just bad except material girls that was the shinning part of the film. The acting is not bad but it's not great either. It's too over the top and busy and it tries so hard to be different and that is wear it falls. Saying all the bad stuff I enjoyed parts and I enjoyed the badness of the film it's kinda like it's so bad it's laughable good at times.,Cinderella
34,novagirl11,"great soundtrack, funny, modern, great!",8,8 September 2021,"Yes, it was a very modern adaptation, but that's the point! I really liked the soundtrack, which is a combination of pop covers (Material Girl and Perfect were my favorites) and original songs, which was great. I thought it was very funny, but a little difficult to hear at the beginning (when they would murmur sarcastic comments under their breath, for example) so I had to turn on subtitles. The cast already had big stars (Camila Cabello, Idina Menzel, Pierce Brosnan, Minnie Driver, Billy Porter, and James Corden) but Nicholas Galitzine really stole the show!",Cinderella
35,kenzibit,Nothing unique.. just enjoy the comedy.,5,4 September 2021,"Nicely done with good funny performances and good music to the ears.

43,theredsky,Cinderella Review,2,7 September 2021,"Did this film genuinely try to adapt this film for modern audiences with modern issues? Yes. Do I agree with what they were saying? Yes. Did it also feel as if the filmmakers were checking off a checklist instead of being genuine? Also yes unfortunately. I commend the film for trying to be more modern but it also serves as a massive detriment to the film. Instead of taking an issue like climate change seriously, they use it as a joke to ruin the tension of a dramatic moment. There is nothing wrong with making a film talk about modern issues but you have to feel genuine about it instead of forcing it in. There are some modern changes I like. Billy Porter's race and gender swapped Fairy Godmother was a great addition but he's only in the movie for less than 5 minutes. Pierce Brosnan was good and I liked that the film joked about his inability to sing but that was about all I liked. The rest of the film was not good or an absolute train wreck. Like the tone. The tone is all over the place and is often ruined by a misplaced joke and it works as a huge detriment to the characters. Most of the performances are not great. Camila Cabello is a good singer so why did they auto tune her to hell. It's so bad that at points, it is often extremely difficult to understand a word she is saying. James Corden is absolutely awful. It seems that almost every film he is in, the quality of it seems to suffer and it's worse here. All of the characters are often insufferable to watch and that's because the script is awful. The dialogue feels forced and weak and the sequence of events is lackluster and stupid. It doesn't help that this film is an absolute snooze fest for 90% of the runtime. I found it hard to pay attention to. Besides maybe one song, every other song is a modern rendition and they all suck. I tell you that I genuinely laughed when they did Seven Nation Army. All of the technical aspects are unimpressive for an iconic story like this. The cinematography is boring, the lighting is bland but the sets and costumes do look good however. I would highly recommend passing on this and watch the original Disney animated film instead.",Cinderella

There is no reason you can't enjoy both a Disney type version of the story and this kind of version too. The music and dancing are a lot of fun, so I certainly enjoyed that part of the film the most. As for those who complain about such anomalies from the original (i.e. The Prince has a sister, etc), what about films like Cinderfella, starring Jerry Lewis? The lead character was a man, not a woman in that one, and yet the film was quite popular. Another complaint has to do with how modern the theme is, such as Cinderella wanting to be a business woman more than a Princess. Well now, didn't they make it pretty clear with the opening number that tradition was not as important as changes in attitudes? I certainly saw that coming. There is also nothing wrong with the acting. Overall, I had fun with this version of the iconic fairy tale, even if it wasn't my very favorite of all of them.",Cinderella

She had no chemistry with her leading man. Maybe if she took some acting classes it would help. Also it was a bit TOO modern in its sensibilities to the point that we LOST the plot. This wasn't Cinderella. It was more like a political commentary about relationships and issues. So disappointed as Cinderella was always a favorite of mine. But NOT THIS TIme.

53,BijeshNagesh,A Welcome & Memorable Break From Tradition,7,5 September 2021,"Kay Cannon's screenplay and direction elegantly highlighted an alternative version of Cinderella, played by the immensely talented Camila Cabello (such delightful vocals). Kay took a classic and twisted it into a contemporary mould, highlighted by themes of empowerment, identity, individuality, self-respect, and self-love.It was an interesting take on a hugely popular character. This was especially true about Cinderella no longer depending on a 'Prince Charming' to come save her from a dreary life. In ""Cinderella"" 2021 on Amazon Prime Video, I saw a powerful rendition and remake of a live-action Disney Princess taking control of her own life.That's not to say Prince Robert, played by Nicholas Galitzine, didn't bring anything to the table. In fact he brought much-needed balance to this story. He came across as human and relatable. His 'I too don't fit in where I was born' notion made for good characterization.I was especially surprised with what Kay did with the Fairy, ahem Fabulous, Godmother, played by none other than Billy Porter. It was a bold and progressive shift from tradition that I'm sure involved cunning script-work.King Rowan and Queen Beatrice (who was alive in this version and had some of the best 'love' lines in the film) - played by Pierce Brosnan and Minnie Driver, respectively - were both amazing. So was Idina Mensel's Vivian (the stepmother), Charlotte Spencer's Narissa (the stepsister), Maddie Baillio's Malvolia (the other stepsister), Tallulah Greive's Princess Gwen (another new take on the royal roster, and one who redressed the 'male heir over a female one' dictum), and the super-talented Ben Bailey Smith (aka Doc Brown) who played the Town Crier.Plenty of other noteworthy performances from a rather diverse cast. I sorely desired to see the cat Lucifer make a comeback, but alas that diabolical kitty was absent in this story. They also didn't bring back Gus and Jaq but rather went with three mice: John (voiced by James Acaster), Romesh (voiced by Romesh Ranganathan), and James (voiced by James Corden) - they were quite funny too.I did, strangely, like the humane and familial energies they wove around the stepmother and stepsisters. The world has come far, and many families are joined outside of blood. It was nice to see Cinderella 'connecting' with her stepsisters. It was just as pleasant to see a less cruel more traditionally locked rendition of the stepmother. They each had natural, not contrived, reasons to be cruel to Ella, when they did indeed take that turn.Vivian, as a character, was quite in keeping with the era of the original 1950 ""Cinderella"" animation feature film. The 50s and 60s were a time when women who wanted to 'go into business' or be more feminist than feminine were frowned upon - more so than today.All those portions were expertly re-done. After all, just because you don't share blood does not necessarily mean you must despise one another, though there is sure to be the odd jibe now and again. Such character redesigns gave Ella more credit, and she came across as inspiring and 'onward and upward' as opposed to being helpless and exploited.Musical scoring by Mychael Danna and Jessica Weiss set an enchanting tone, not to forget the meaningful lyrics - ""If it's a million to one, I'm gonna be that one."" The music and dance routines were contemporary and well-choreographed. The whole ""Somebody To Love"" sequence was fun to watch. So was Vivian's rendition of Madonna's ""Material Girl"" and her original song ""Dream Girl"" (which was sheer perfection). Also, En Vogue's (with Salt-N-Pepa) ""Whatta Man"" + ""Seven Nation Army"" - that cello band-member did a particularly amazing bit at the end. Not to forget J-Lo's ""Let's Get Loud"" performed by the entire kingdom (!).Henry Braham's cinematography was aces. Ellen Mirojnick's costume design was exemplary. The rest of the crew, in sundry categories, all did good work on Amazon Prime Video's ""Cinderella"" movie.I could understand why some viewers disliked the film. There were multiple breaks from tradition that practically altered the original classic and foundational storyline associated with this particular princess.All this took little away from the new flavour that pervaded ""Cinderella"" 2021. The movie was an amusing, interesting, enjoyable, and captivating take on tropes and themes that were in dire need of some fresh perspective. Ella's confliction between a romantic royal life and her desire to become a world-travelling dressmaker was one of the highlights featured in this 'new take' title.If you watch this movie - which is an ode to the Feminist Spirit in many regards - with an open mind, and a heart eager to explore an alternative empowered real-life setting for (and around) Cinderella, you're sure to gain a lot more from it than you might have assumed before you started.In what felt like a long time, a man was willing to give up his dreams so the girl he loves could realize hers. There may not be a lot of takers for this notion, but I am all for it. Ignore the low ratings and critics. ""Cinderella"" will be one of the most empowering, inspiring, creative, and entertaining films you'll see in 2021 and let nobody tell you different.",Cinderella
54,madanmarwah,"Endearing, entertaining movie",8,23 September 2021,"To all those reviewers who gave poor ratings to this fabulous movie, I have one question--When you opted to see a movie on a fairy tale romance like
"" Cinderella "", what did you expect? Fast and furious?The fact is that this is a lovely version of the classic tale with some endearing performances, mesmerising choreography and comedy which amuses. Not a dull moment with all the loveable characters, the pretty lass Cinderella relegated to the basement by the cruel and scheming stepmother, the ugly, obnoxious step sisters, the charming Prince besotted with Cinderella, and the fairy godmother ( played with aplomb by black actor Billy Porter). Camila Cabella makes a winsome Cinderella, looks pretty and emotes well. Another role of the King done nicely by Pierce Brosnan.An attractive feature of this movie are around 23 sound tracks each one rhythmic and the foot tapping type. They are all very enjoyable. Worth mentioning are Rythm nation, material girl, shining star and let's get loud.Take a bow director Kay Cannon for making a thoroughly entertaining movie which keeps the audience hooked with the sparkling dialogue and splendid choreography. The script allows for inclusion of issues like women empowerment as Cinderella wants to live life on her own terms instead of becoming a queen to live a regimented and stifling life as a queen.",Cinderella

My only dislike is that a few of Cinderella's songs were too long, but all the rest of the music and dance was really well done and fun to watch. Billy Porter was an entertaining Fairy Godmother. The 3 mice were hilarious. Pierce Brosnan looked like he as having a blast the whole time. Minnie Driver can sing, I didn't know this, and she seemed to be enjoying herself as well. The storyline is only different in that it demonstrates that being a happily ever after princess isn't necessarily the best dream a girl can have, while still showing that sharing your life with someone you love is the ultimate all of us seek. Those dissing this version are either missing the classic songs and unable to accept new music, or still think a woman should only want to be behind her man.

I enjoyed the songs and didn't consider them ""butchered"". I rather liked the way they chose to humanize the stepmother and stepsisters making them more believable as people, and even being able to relate to them even if I still don't like them. The stepmother was balanced personality wise, showing her to be human with faults but not completely evil and abusive as she is traditionally. Typically Cinderella is one of my least favorite stories, it's right up there after snow white as a close second for me when it comes to the traditional fairy tales. The characters always got on my nerves in both of them. Advertising that it's good to be a dense, gullible, doormat that is either too naive and dim-witted to preserve her own life after multiple attempts to kill her -snow white- or let's others treat her like garbage and expects a man to fix her life for her -Cinderella-. For those complaining about this movie coming off like it had been written by 12yr olds, well it was made to target that age range. Js.... Why are you watching a fairy tale that was obviously made to entertain children? You can tell exactly what kind of movie it is by the trailers. Thats like putting a Disney movie on and expecting Shakespearian quality out of it. It was entertaining enough to have on for the kids without having to worry about the language or any inappropriate scenes popping up. Too many people trying to read too much into it calling it ""woke"" and trying to say its part of some political agenda, or that it is throwing ""messages"" at the viewers... I mean seriously? If you look hard enough you will always find a way to twist anything into that kind of stupidity. All the whack jobs just keep finding new ways to convince themselves everything out there is all part of a conspiracy.

Director Kay Cannon has done an okay type job with this approach of Cinderella but doesn't blossom in the way of work. Screenplay of the film can make us connect to the characters or to the scene at one point but in the split second of time it all dives down in the next scene. Story telling needed to be more polished specially when the approach is different. In its entire run you as an audience will get minimal feel from the whole movie and the rest of the time you will spend it on the skip button. Overall if you have time to spare to watch any movie then you can watch this
version of cinderella.",Cinderella

I felt sorry for him.After that it just became unbearable to watch.Fairly good choreography but the script and bad casting let it down..
Why Rogan Rangenesh??? Why? Why and James Corden and Rod Bucket?? Didn't the Producers see Cats and The Prom to see how bad Corden is?Idina, what were you thinking.Please avoid this or suffer nightmares.At the end it was just like the whole production.",Cinderella

69,wivavog,Awful trend filling reboot.,1,4 September 2021,"Not like there isn't already a hundred thousand remakes of this classic. Of course it has to have all the modern issues, trends , ect. Forced into to it like most empty tv. Also love the fact. Nobody really cares how much damage. All these adult and beyond situations. Are doing to the children. How its rare to find a child with a childhood anymore. People are way more impressed. By a 5 year old that cant teach themselves whatever with a phone. Pretty cool that they kept the fairy godmother a female role. With a over flamboyantly gay man. That must be for the kids! Already got them confused and skipping childhood. Lets incorporate issues. Most adults cant even comprehend. That should help. Then lets label it cinderella. So mainly nothing but youth watch it. Whatever happen to being original? Having imagination and artistic ability. Vs just putting in keywords. And having it ran through the perfect profit algorithm. Then just slap a established name. With a few yester year actors for good measure. Voila! A steaming pile garbage. That will go on to do more damage then good. Entertain next to no one. But more importantly. Make profit! Cause if you know anything about the industry. Theres money in trash and flops. Like a legal ins scam lol. None of this speaks quality or entertainment to me. Ill stick with the untainted memories of the original animated movie. Vs watch this cash grab garbage. Cant believe how many big actors. Are doing custodial work now a days... Pretty sad. Like yea I had 20 classic movies that rocked the box office. Left a legend. But lets come back. Do things where not associated with or known for. To get a fat and easy check. Half the time there only in the movie for 5 mins lol. Or on the cover and not in the movie at all.",Cinderella

72,gazzalodi,We did laugh a couple of times,6,4 September 2021,"So it's not terrible. It's kind of like an action movie, turn off your brain and watch stuff happen. Some of the big set piece song and dance numbers go on a bit to much, especially the ending. And, yeah it suffers from trying to be the wokest with the mostest, making sure that it ticks every checkbox and at times story be damned if it makes no sense. But most of the individual comic gags work and the 'smaller' songs are fun. We burst out laughing when they spun up Seven Nation Army.I'm not sure why they felt to need to put a 20th century sewing machine (Ella's Singer 66) complete with it's corporate logo on display when trying to present a sorta-Regency era fantasy. I mean it's not like Singer is paying for product placement to remind everyone that they used to make the best sewing machines on the planet and now they make plastic junk.",Cinderella
73,darrenbjones,A fun and lively update of the traditional tale.,7,5 September 2021,"Okay so it's Cinderella so you know what you're getting, it's all going to be about the execution. There are a number of reviews attacking the modern revisions and 'wokeness' of the film. Let's face it, if this was a traditional boy meets girl at a dance and falls in love then we'd be complaining that it doesn't work in today's society so damned if you do, damned if you don't.There are also complaints about the lip syncing but with a cast comprised of Camila Cabello (the multi platinum selling artist), Idina Menzel (Tony award winning Broadway superstar), Minnie Driver (who has appeared in musicals and recorded multiple albums) and Billy Porter (again with a fantastic Broadway pedigree) you know this cast can sing.So with that out of the way, the story is set in a traditional olde world kingdom with a monarchy. Ella has aspirations of becoming a dressmaker and running her own business but she's a girl in a world where all she can do of value is marry. Prince Robert is not cut out to be a king but his position as first born son means he has no choice.As the father of teens and tweens, this was a positive story about challenging expectations for both men and women, built into the traditional Cinderella narrative. The musical numbers were plentiful, well choreographed, lively and a lot of fun. Well worth a watch.",Cinderella

Simple answer: I love musicals, and cannot miss the musical for the whole world!And the musical it is! Great songs, preproduced by lovely voices! Songs that we all know and love.The movie itself is not that bad either. It is a modern presentation of the classical story, with the modern popular things in it.. Things that no one cannot avoid in todays movies. Sentences like: ""You are beautiful from the inside."", or ""Find your own way in life"", or ""Don't let anyone tell you what to do with your life"", ""You can do anything"", etc.Now in my time, in my youth, in movies like that there was only a story.Evil stepmother, sad and lonely stepdaughter, mean stepsisters.. There were none of that ""You can make it girl, you are the best"" sentences that we hear all the time. In fact we hear it so much, that we stop hearing it at all. Wish there is just one movie without those inspiring sentences. I think teenagers know that stuff by themselves, without somebody constantly telling them that they are the best and that they can do anything.Movie is nicely directed and the casting is great. Billy Porter is especially funny and I didn't know that he is such a good singer, Camila and Nicholas are beautiful.Scenography is perfect and as I already said- song are great.Judging by the other user reviews, I was expecting a lot worse movie, but all in all, I was positively surprised.",Cinderella
76,ivantheeditor,Cute. Doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.,6,13 September 2021,"This wasn't the best movie ever. It won't change your life. It's not your typical Disney movie (because it's not even produced by Disney) but it was fun and cute. I liked all the twists in the story. I couldn't care less about the songs - they were definitely annoying. There was too much pointless singing and dancing. However, I must say Camila Cabello was EXCELLENT. Her acting was spot on. She carried the whole movie. Truly a role model for young girls out there. What makes me sad are all the negative reviews though. This movie doesn't deserve all that hate. The fact that there are so many people out there hating on a sweet little movie like this is truly disturbing. No wonder we're being punished with a pandemic. The world is not a nice place anymore. People really need to stop being so negative and start appreciating things more. I can only imagine all the effort that went into making this movie. It was produced quite well. Give it a try. You won't regret it.",Cinderella
77,theoriginalantiblonde,Gagging on the excess of saccharine here,1,30 September 2021,"...and I didn't even last four minutes. I liked the promo, and was interested to see what they'd done with this classic. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it through the intro with the ""music"" and ""singing"" -- and I use those terms very loosely here, cos I'm still gagging hours later over the extreme sappiness of what I had to listen to in the first four minutes -- it might have been less, but my pain was so real, it felt like an eternity. I don't know who Camila is, and after listening to what looked and sounded like really bad lip synching from the so called lead actress in just the intro, it's highly unlikely I'll ever want to know. Could that intro have been more saccharine? Yeegawds, I need a shot of insulin from the sheer memory of it. This thing made music from Barbie's dollhouse party sound hard core. I'd report any parent I knew that let their kids watch this for child endangerment. What a waste of resources!",Cinderella
78,Nathan4,What a mess!,5,5 September 2021,"Quite the rollercoaster between being so cringey I wanted to turn it off...to the next scene genuinely enjoying it. Rinse and repeat and that basically sums up the whole movie. There were enough laughs and cute moments (along with the great costumes) to keep it afloat, but there were too many terrible moments to keep this from being good. Many of those letdowns have been mentioned in other reviews, but the biggest one worth mentioning again is the overuse of autotune. It made Camila's voice unbearable and ruined extraordinarily talented singers like Idina. Just WHY?",Cinderella

80,dbuckshnis,Feminism displayed and good music,5,18 September 2021,Wow - it is quite interesting how the plot line was developed and it plugs modern day ideals for of believing in oneself. Music and singing superb. Good choreography too ... but it would have bomb in theaters.,Cinderella
81,Bubba32618,"No, just no!",1,6 September 2021,"The James Corden thrusting in a rat costume is much better than this and that was disturbing but what the hell did I just watch. This was painful and long, very long. This is the third worst movie I have ever seen. This is worse than Cats, I'm not even joking and to make things worse James Corden not only stars in this, he produced and wrote it as well. I lost my mind while watching this, it was so bad, I mean so awful on so many levels that I couldn't stop laughing and losing my mind. How much did they have to pay Pierce Brosnan for him to be in this monstrosity. Please tell me, please tell me that James Corden did not just call that his front tail. I lost most of my mind and sanity during the Somebody to Love scene and I lost the rest of my mind and sanity during the Material Girl scene, that scene was hilariously awful on so many levels. The fact that they used licensed songs instead of original songs is so much better, I can't describe how funny but bad they The auto tune in this is something, that's for sure. Camila Cabello doesn't deserve to have an acting career after this, her performance was awful and her singing was so auto tuned that it was almost unbearable, Pierce Brosnan and Minnie Driver were the only one with a decent performance. Amazon why did you purchase this, it is good that it went straight to streaming instead of the movie theater, like it was supposed too but it is so bad that, that is should've never been seen by the public. The prince was garbage. The stepsisters and stepmom are terrible in this. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed of themselves and to go out in public especially James Corden. The Emoji Movie was better than this. I would of rather watch paint dry for two hours, then watch this 2 hour long movie, if it even deserves to be called a movie. I can't even comprehend how this got made. What the hell was this? My Mom wanted to stop watching this after the knights in armor started doing the stanky leg. The only thing my Mom liked was seeing what licensed song they were going to sing next. My Mom said that the Cinderella movie with Hilary Duff was better than this. This movie was horrendous.",Cinderella
82,referencegirl,Bad but Good in Spite of Itself,5,25 September 2021,"Okay, it is a terrible movie in many ways. Rhythm Nation? I don't hate the song I just don't think it made any sense to the story at all and since it is the very first song, it makes for a rocky start. I guess I'm supposed to know Camila Cabello but I'm an old fogey so I don't. What I do know is that her inability to carry a tune is so pronounced that the amount of auto-tune correction required makes her sound like a robot. And since she is singing right away, it's hard to get past. I almost turned it off for that thinking I would not make it through a whole movie of that horrible voice. Then there are the historically discordant props and costumes - also in some of the very first scenes. There is kitchen ware from the 1400s all the way through the 1940s sharing a single shelf. Costumes that span from 1700s all the way to modern day, sometimes within the same costume. A completely modern brass band bedecked with modern haircuts. I guess I'm supposed to let all that go because we are in fairy land fantasy. I'm not a particular critical viewer but that is a lot to get past. However, Okay, I was able to because Idina Menzel sings early on as well with so much breathtaking talent I got goosebumps. And while Camila cannot sing, she CAN act extremely well. She performs vulnerability particularly well and that is rare. In fact, nearly all of the actors displayed dazzling talent. And there were some spectacular moments, in particular the beginning of the ball with Whatta Man mixed with Seven Nation Army. Although the choreography, with clear nods to Michael Jackson's Thriller, was hard to get past. I absolutely loved the feminist twist along with diverse representation. If we are playing fast and loose with historical periods why not do the same for women's rights and representation? Granted, it could have been done better and it doesn't even have the excuse of being a pioneer on that front. All told, I enjoyed myself but doing so required a lot of letting go. I won't be watching it again and I'm sure glad I didn't pay for a movie ticket.",Cinderella

This Cinderella would rather start her own dressmaking business instead of becoming a princess and future queen. Her ""love"" for this prince isn't quite enough for her to abandon her dreams of female independence in a world where it doesn't exist. Does all the above make this retelling of the story a more enjoyable one? No. You're left with, wow - she gets the prince (who no longer wants to be a prince) and her dress business, too! Amazing!

91,lippylip26,A old story with a musical twist,9,4 September 2021,"Having grown up with Cinderella since childhood and seen most of the versions I found this one very inspiring in its own way
The children of today look at things superficially and not at the deeper meanings in the stories
All they interested are the special effects and skop skit and donner
They miss the important things.There are many movies with hidden and not so hidden messages
Even books and comics have these messages in them for all to see but sadly too many gloss over them and they fly over peoples heads
Just as few examples
Maid in Manhattan
It's a wonderful life
A Cinderella story
Ever After
Archie comics
There are others but I'm not going to reveal them
Go check them out for your self please
What makes this Cinderella story so different is that
A) it's a musical
B) it's in a mixed setting of okd and new
C) it's vibrant and alive
D) it's the Descendants vibrant - if you've seen the Descendants trilogy you'll understand the exuberance and aliveness of the show
E) but the most important thing that stands out is the very positive messages that comes out of the show
While not giving much away it's the same story of Cinderella that we all know and love
However there are some major changes as well
The prince does not ride off into the sunset with Cinderella yet he does get the girl
The step mother and her daughters are not as vile as the others portrayed in the other renditions of the story
Bitter, a bit abusive but at the same time shows more empathy towards Cinderella
Only one other Cinderella features this empathy and that is Ever After with the one step daughter caring about Cinderella
Her quip when the Kng in Ever After asks if she as part of this disgusting family made my day
""Oh no - I'm just here for the food "" Ever After"" at the end
There has been another musical about Cinderella with I think Oprah Whinfrey that I can't stand
A definite difference of 7 between my rating of THAT show compared to this musical version
Beware SPOILER ALERT
Cinderella has a dream to open up a dress making shop
Women of that period were discouraged from doing anything in a mans world
Their dreams were shut down
The king was the mighty ruler and he word goes
Even the poor wife of the king has no say nor his daughter
The prince like all the other versions Is been forced to marry someone of the kings liking
He is not happy about it until he sees a girl who talks back to his father
He promptly falls in love with her and seeks her out
She fails to recognise him but accepts his invite to the royal ball
The story follows the original thread but when he proposes she turns away saying she has a dream to fulfil and marry the kings son is not really part of her plan
Shen wants. To be a dressmaker and nothing is going to stop her
Prince or no prince
She helps others achieve there dreams as well
The story is a lesson in if you have a dream you go for it and don't let anyone stop you
I loved the movie
I loved the songs
Ok some weren't as great as other songs I know but on the whole were pretty good
The fun part is trying to recognise tunes from other shows you have seen and believe me there are tunes there from other shows with a different beat to it
Would I rewatch this show
The answer is a most definite YES.",Cinderella

95,TMAuthor,Bad...bad...and oh yeah...bad.,1,9 September 2021,"This is NOT a family movie. Be warned.Frankly it's a mystery as to why they even called this Cinderella. Not much of the original fairy tale or other screen versions survives in this mess.While Cabello can sing, the majority of the songs aren't all that good, and many of the actors are not good singers. Begs the question. Wait and watch Spielberg's remake of West Side Story, which based on the spectacular trailers should be fantastic.Woke Hollywood continues to force weird casting and writing into period pieces. Sometimes, as in the case of Hamilton, that can be successful. Most of the time it destroys the source material, changes the dramatic tension by eventually eliminating it and takes you out of the story every time it shows up on screen.Did Cinderella really need to become a snotty egotistical jerk?Those 10 star reviews? One or two sentences claiming ""best ever""? No. Those people must be shills. Most have only reviewed THIS movie, and joined IMDB this month (September 2021). Not cool.",Cinderella

97,AllanSmitheee,"Fluffy, light hearted family fun",7,5 September 2021,"Is it really necessary to adapt Cinderella again? No. Is it as awful as the reviews on here suggest? In my years here, I've come to accept roughly 85% of them as nonsense. There are people who want to be mad about something and those who bother to finish the movie. Now, I could very well have stayed home and watched it on Amazon Prime but I found a theater playing it and trekked 70 miles from home on public transportation (about four hours) for two reasons: A) Movie musicals have been taken from me theatrically and B) I've honestly nothing better to do.In this version of the Charles Perrault story, Ella is an orphan who dreams not of true love but to become a fashion designer. Check one for the girl who don't need no man. Unfortunately, in the ambiguously medieval times in which she lives, women doing business and anything frivolous is frowned upon.Meanwhile, Crown Prince Robert is a lad of frivolity, leaving the role of ambitious ruler to his younger sister Gwen. But, like Ella, Gwen's many ideas for bettering the kingdom are shot down by King Rowan.Kay Cannon (Pitch Perfect) has created a world where gender norms are defied and dreams take actual hard work to become reality. Camila Cabello shines in her acting debut, alongside fellow newcomer Nicholas Galitzine. Idina Menzel is perfect as the mean but deeply insecure stepmother, with the ever fabulous Billy Porter as the... well, Fabulous Godmuver in his one scene.Cinderella is not without its flaws, some casting choices questionable, primarily the presence of one (always) large hammy James Corden, who you not only see but also hear. However, there are talent who were initially cast but were changed at the last minute, including John Mulaney and Missy Elliott. Both of their presences would be very welcome.The film as a whole feels a lot like a big-budget second season episode of Glee, as it features a mix of covers and original compositions. The story opens with a nicely choreographed mash-up of Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" and Des'ree Weekes' ""You Gotta Be"". Cabello co-writes the originals she performs, but Menzel steals the show twice, first with a delightfully boppy ""Material Girl"", then later on in the co-penned original ""Dream Girl"".Overall, Cinderella is made for children and those who find enjoyment in movies that don't require deep thought. It's got some spotty adult humor but the kids won't notice, and it's a good time for the family. It won't win any awards but does everything really have to?",Cinderella

Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. Hold on this question in your mind: What if? That's what it is, right? A fantasy. A fantastical reboot to a fantastical story, but of a whole another story.They didn't even haul the main couple down a hasty rollercoaster-of-a-relationship-road, not rushing things and letting them have time and just flow. They might be out-of-this-world with all the fun, literally, but this movie focuses on the story rather than the material sensibility, more than the original if that is what you're thinking.

Add a villain (Evil Stepmother) and two mean girls (Pricilla & Drucilla).

Idina Menzel slayed as the Stepmother and wound up adding a twist to her character as well. Again, I am STUNNED by the hate on this film. Don't listen to the haters! I REALLY liked this movie!",Cinderella
110,NBates1,Cringe from beginning to end,2,9 September 2021,"Why does anyone think it is a good idea to have age-old fairy tale characters spew woke nonsense all over the place? I can't remember any story being told more than Cinderella, and this seems to me the most forgettable version out there. The movie spends far too much time giving the audience a headache either with overlong musical numbers, or with the patronizing preaching of modern 'values' that has truly become irritating. Why does every single movie and TV show nowadays have to conform to whatever agenda is promoted? It is so in-your-face that there is no subtlety left. Admittedly, the costumes and production design were rather good. Camila makes for a charming lead but cannot save the film, while usually talented performers like Menzel, Brosnan and Driver are completely wasted. The evil stepmother isn't even all that evil anymore, and is stupidly redeemed at the end, and I completely forgot the stepsisters were in it at some point. Also, does James Corden have to be in everything these days? He's not funny and nobody likes him. Don't waste time with this and STOP shoving agendas down our throats!",Cinderella

I cannot tell you enough how much I despise James cordon though. I really really can't stand him. He's NOT FUNNY. Whyyyyyy is he always ruining things even in tiny roles??? Like if his roles are so insignificant then why is he even put in things if the rest of the world can't stand him??? To purposefully ruin things? No, no no...I have a feeling this guy has connections or is even paying to get casted cuz it makes zero sense lol.OK Back to the movie..Anyways, it was just ok. Camila is good for first time, the fairy guy can sing amazing, but other acting and songs and even costumes (which are suppose to be amaaaazing) seemed cheap and corny.

It is strong and brilliant for what it is. It is a protest film, a statement by women who are demanding that they never be seen as people without their own life, waiting for some man to come save them. Using the story of 'Cinderella' is only a vehicle to announce how completely fed up women are with the simple-minded boxes men keep trying to put them in.However, I agree that they could have taken it a bit further and had Ella build castles, rather than make clothes, but I understand how difficult it would be to hide this talent in the basement.I am delighted that this generation has decided there will be no more being stuffed in a ridiculous box for women.

137,ChRiS-803,They will study this film in the future,2,4 September 2021,"In the future we will look at this reimagining of ""Cinderella"" as a text book case of what made this era of cinema really questionable. I mean I get why you want to do something different with yet another re-telling of this fairy-tale (after all the last one was only in 2015) but to massacre it the way Kay Cannon does here is insulting and she should be charged with crimes against art. What was the purpose of this story? The whole thing is just messy, chaotic, extremely PC-focused and hammy. There is GREAT emphasis to ensure that every second person is African American (tick to Hollywood diversity standards) - forget anything else representing diversity (Asians don't exist, LGBQT people still don't exist in this world etc). Again, white people are either evil or dumb except for our leading man who gasp has an earring (what a rebel!). The acting is really bad - I mean I am assuming Pierce Brosnan's $20million dollar house got a nice upgrade but Billy Porter (who's really just echoing ""Pose"") and Idina Menzel are hamming it up in the wrong way, Minnie Driver and Nicholas Galitzine are not as bad but Camila Cabello is just awful. I mean there's not a single emotion she can convey here - she looks lost, confused and struggles to deliver anything. The girl playing the sister of the Prince does a far better job. Days after fellow pop-star Selina Gomez proved she is quite the actress in ""Only Murders in the Building"", DeBello is showing that acting is not something she should try and pursue again. I mean Drew Barrymore and Brandy's feisty interpretations in the 90's should have been her guide. Oh and continuing his case for crimes against humanity - James Corden also appears because no awful movie should be without him adding that sprinkle of poison and of course he produced it. Columbia / Sony were quick to move this to Amazon streaming away from the big screen - you can see why.",Cinderella

149,ZombieGirlORV,"Fun, Witty, and Flawed",3,7 September 2021,"I'd like to take an in depth look at the oppressive laws in this Cinderella's reality, which seem to exist for no reason other than to push political ends. The Brothers Grimm wrote Cinderella in 1812, second addition in 1819. Setting wise, I'm assuming the writers were aiming for that which most other Cinderella do. A German-esk setting in the early 1800's, about when and where the original story was written by the Grimm brothers, usually with a modern twist, and this had that, in a good way. Unfortunately, laws in the world in which this movie takes place don't resemble the world or time period of the Grimm brothers. While this is usually excusable for costumes, or sets, or music. Supplementing fantasy laws like this seems duplicitous in nature, serving no other purpose than to push a political agenda. This may seem harsh to some, but in the early 1800's women in Germany were allowed to hold jobs, and have businesses. In fact it wasn't until Nazi Germany in the 1900's that things changed, when Hitler was trying to get women to have more babies and pushed propaganda for ""children, church, and cooking"" trying to encourage woman to stay at home. Many women were fired from their jobs at that time and Mothers Day was formed to further encourage women to have kids. However, none of that happened until a hundred years after Cinderella was already an established story. Prior to this period in history women were allowed to work, and many of them had to in order to help support their families. Why then did the movie choose to add this in if not to push their own political propaganda? Seeing this as a glaring flaw at the start of the movie I had to tell myself to suspend disbelief and try to imagine this as a completely different world with its own separate rules. Getting beyond this point I'd like to take some time to look at the acting which was superb and comedic, and was able to mostly distract me from the original flaw I'd noticed. Well done actors and witty script. Next the music. While most songs were exciting and fun to see carried out by the cast of Cinderella, some of them made no sense and felt like a square peg being forced into a round hole. Despite the fact they sounded grate, there were at least two songs which really made no sense and had no reason for being there. Laying that aside we'll look at the story itself. Taken from the perspective that this is its own fresh gem... I loved the story. It was fun, imaginative, and put a spin on the tale that made it all it's own. I loved it, right up until a little before the ending when the whole thing kind of fell apart. I loved the answer she gave the prince and her reasoning for it, but on the flip side of this when the Prince went back to her with his solution, they should have gotten engaged. That kind of grand gesture means he just changed his entire life for her, sacrificing his entire future for a chance to be with her. The fact she wasn't willing to put a label on their relationship more than just saying they were in love, suggests she has some serious commitment issues. Had the end come with a declaration from the king and them opening up a shop in which they sold clothing together, it probably would have been more satisfying than seeing them standing from a balcony telling everyone to ""Get loud."" It would have shown the aspects of compromise and teamwork that comes with having a serious relationship and truly caring for each other. But in the end he sacrificed his entire future for a chance to be with her and she did... absolutely nothing for him. So while I loved the rest of the story aside from the glaring historical flaw which we are pretending doesn't exist. The ending could have used a little more thought. In trying to fix what was clearly viewed as flaws in the original Cinderella, they overcorrected and ended up making her a completely uncompromising character, and in regards to love that is never healthy. Every grand gesture in this movie was done by the prince, and if this movie was trying to get across the importance of equality, then there should have also been a grand gesture for him on her part... I know this might be an over analyzation for what should be a fun kids movie, but we can redirect that attention to whoever decided to push politics' in that kids movie to begin with. Besides, the Grimm's retelling of stories are some of my favorites.",Cinderella

I knew the movie wouldn't be ""good"" good but I thought it had some potential to be ""dumb yet catchy and charming DCOM"" good. It failed me.The idea of making it a jukebox musical isn't essentially bad, but it was poorly executed. Terribly executed. Instead of singing along with some popular good songs my reactions ranged from rolling my eyes to laughing hard as the performances were either boring or very cringy (omg what was that AM I WRONG performance???).The script was shallow, with some cliche lines that looked like it came from a fanfiction written by a 14 y.o. Camila fan.The prince had less charm than a wood chair. Zero charisma and also zero chemistry with Camila.Amazon also imported the terrible idea from Disney to add a ""woke"" component to this old tale. It's even more forced than on Disney live actions. We have simply TOO MANY additions just for the sake of adding inclusion and feminism. Yes, I get it that we don't want to teach our girls that they should wait until a rich guy saves them from their problems, but in this movie the message gets repeated so many times that it almost feels like those educational videos they show at schools to tell kids that drugs are bad and bullying is wrong. It's just clearly fake and deviates from the main plot.Oh and they need to fire the person who decided to hire James Corden.The only good thing about the movie were the special effects.

It becomes very distracting.The acting was just ok in my opinion, nothing award worthy at all, and nothing that stood out!The writing (or re-writing) of this tale has every social justice fringe level stupidity thing covered you can imagine, from a crossdressing dude with a goatie wearing a sequined gown and heals, to toxic feminism, and every other thing they could grasp-at to try and be inclusive...of course forgetting that these silly fringe groups represent less than 20% of the population watching!Classic case of idiots in hollywood trying to push their 'moral superiority"" while not knowing their audience or even ignoring them, that or attempts at trying to condition and program folks through normalization efforts.The real miss here is, with the budget and resources they had, they could have produced yet another great classic even with the glee twist, but they wound up falling so far short they didnt even have the finish line in sights!I gave it 3 stars for the little bit of comedy they did get in there, but minuses for pretty much everything else, especially the toxic femininity!Sorry not sorry hollywood, but its another dud.",Cinderella

There is no risk taking and not even as good a fairy tale teller as Maleficent was largely thanked to the lack of unique ideas in visuals (should have learned from The Lost Prince, maybe).Personally, I don't mind the ""extra messages"", though very bluntly shoveled to the face. The domestic violence is the only believable portrayal those moments show how strong this movie could have been.Are the songs enough good? Nope. Camila Cabellot is obviously a great singer and she does everything with this ""Glee""-level soundtrack but just can't save it - at all. In the era of Lin-Manuel Miranda this can't be accepted and should not either.This whole concept is lost in translation (clearly shown in reviews and comments).

Be true to YOU! That's the message of this movie! It's come a LONG way from the Grimm fairytale and laughs in the face of Disney. This is the version of Cinderella (along with Ever After) that encourages the underdog to pull herself up and rise! Within being true to herself she gets EVERYTHING she desires!This movie wasn't all about Ella either. It shined a light on each main character and made them so relatable! I saw myself, my parents and their fears, my grandparents and their traditions, and the brokenness of society, governments, real feminism, LOVE, growth, being the change you want to see.THE FAIRY GODMUVA WAS LIFE!! PERIOD! That's a new millennium godmother bringing you The Elements of Earth, Wind, and Fire through a butterfly to remind you of who you are, Shining Star!! YES!! I love this version! Bravo!!The voices! The dancing! The colors! The costumes!Oh, and thank you for making the stepsisters pretty chill.

Does NOT deserve the hate.,7,19 September 2021,"I'm not sure why many are picking on this film.It does NOT deserve the hate in these comments.It is definitely NOT the 4. Something star rating on IMDb at the moment.Look it's not my favourite rendition of Cinderella - not even of the 'modernising feminist' type (that would be Ever After!)However, this is a fine film that I think would suit families/children. It's colourful (seriously some of the outfits!).How is it different?----------
it's 'more' inclusively castit doesn't follow the traditional story line. Which considering that was created 70 years ago is a good thing.it's a musical.it is a bit more empathetic to the stepmotherthe ending is different in at least three waysHow is it the same
----------
same circumstances for Cinderella and her familystill has the ball, the prince must marry, godmother magicSome are criticising the 'feminist' take but to be fair that started at least 20 years ago with Ever After snd we aren't in the 1950s anymore (Disney version), so of course it should be more representative of modern values.It feels longer than it is (1 hour 50). HmmmI like how it was pointed about the disillusionment snd frankly oppression of women- not just Cinderella but her stepmother, the queen, the princess, even townsfolk. Look it's not dwelt on a great deal but it's there which is to be honest accurate!It's fun, colourful, takes some old classic songs and remakes them (Material Girl, Let's Get Loud, You gotta be). My favourite is the stepmother singing Material Girl emphasising and empathising that in that world that's how women get security.It's more in line with Drew Barrymore's Ever After than the Lily James' Cinderella. Except this one does have a unique ending which tbh is more appropriate for 21C in many ways.I think young kids would love it.Adults would probably like it once or twice.Ever After is still the best version in my opinion. :-)

181,tribal_trudy_04,"Was ok, except for Camilla Cabello and certain changes",6,9 September 2021,"It's a very modern take of Cinderella. I found the music very distracting to the story of Cinderella, and at times too much. I like musicals done well, where songs are used for key significant moments. There were loads of songs in this...for unnecessary moments. Whilst I enjoyed aspects of the film, on the whole I didn't love it, so I wouldn't watch it again. It did not come close to the 2015 Cinderella version with Cate Blanchett and Lily James in terms of the fantastic acting in that and commitment to the story. I've watched that version several times! I think Indina Menzel and Camila Cabello have great voices but their voices eclipsed the rest of the cast! Not sure if that was a wise thing, as it meant that I really didn't enjoy it when other people sang as it seemed bad/poorer compared to CC's and IM's songs (except for Billy Porter and Minnie Driver). I also didn't like all the changes in story line. The music moments made me laugh out loud (not in a good way), especially when the UK comedians were singing! I also found the different genres of songs distracting. It might have been better if it was music/songs directly written for the story....a sort of ""Wicked"" type of film. But, alas this was not it. They tried to do a lot of song mash ups, which I didn't enjoy. I'm still being nice giving this 6/10... it's probably closer to 5.5/10, because there were too many songs at big moments. I would have preferred no singing for their main dance....they could have just danced, and sang after and it would have been better. Finally, I didn't enjoy CC's Cinderella, I definitely felt she was a singer first, dancer 2nd and actress third (shown by the last song/dance number), but I liked IM's step mum - she got the balance right between her acting and fantastic singing (not surprising as her theater background came through)...but still she was not as great as Cate Blanchett or Angelica Houston's step mum..perhaps because she wasn't allowed to act more and the songs took over! I liked the prince, except for his singing (although his voice is not horrible). I also loved Minnie Driver in this, but then I love her in anything, and she's great with dramatic and comical roles. Pierce Brosnan did well too as the king - I'm glad he didn't have a lot of singing to do! In conclusion, one watch of this film is enough. It wasn't magical for moi. And I'm not a fan of CC's music career; perhaps if I was a fan before, I would have liked her in this more.",Cinderella

The acting, dancing and singing was off and on in parts, but with the comedy it pulled it together with Billy Porter and Pierce Brosnan.

192,dan_counts,When you force a square peg into a round hole.,6,11 September 2021,"I wanted to love this move, I like musicals. And really what I think it comes down to is Camila Cabello's vocals. Seriously, I think if she actually concentrates on acting, she could be a heck of an actress. She has a natural delivery, she pops from the screen and you really want to love her character. But then the singing kicks in, and yes, she is a pop vocalist, and like most pop vocalists, she is way overproduced and it stands out here (and not in a good way). You figure in a movie that has Billy Porter, Idina Menzel, and Nicholas Galitzine you would want your star, your headliner, to sing at the same level they do, and this is where the movie falls flat for me.I like the things they play with in terms of the Cinderella story, the fact that Pierce Brosnan pokes fun at himself. There's James Corden, but I'm not a fan of his, I don't see why he moved beyond horrid Z-list British movies.A lot of people came in thinking this was somehow supposed to be a life changing movie, or some type of retelling that would make them rethink the the meaning of the universe, it isn't trying to do that. It's made for the tween and early teen set and expecting any more out of it is a fools errand.The set pieces are beautiful, the choreography and cinematography are solid 8s if not 9s. The story overall is a 6, musical numbers are a 5, and like I said Ms. Cabello falls short, not really as an actress, but as a singer and that drags this movie down a middling 6 for me.",Cinderella

I liked that they change things up and gave Cinderella a more feminist role. The one thing that I did not like was they made marriage the bad guy. I think in the end when she didn't marry the prince and they decided to just date was a little too awkward for me because they made it seem like marriage is a bad thing. That was the only thing I thought was wrong with this whole movie. Marriage shouldn't be the bad guy because it can be done while you pursue your dreams.

But you can't help wonder what could have been.I am fine with Camila Cabello as Cinderella. On the other hand, I don't know whether the voice we hear is her ""usual"" or if she was autotuned (as many have alleged), but I found her songs positively grating and annoying to listen to.I am fine with big production numbers, and I'll readily acknowledge that the ""Rhythm Nation"" number that starts the movie is not unlike the Sunrise number that starts ""In the Heights."" The (big) difference is that the latter number fits the movie. Here's the first few lines of Rhythm Nation"": ""With music by our side/To break the color lines/Let's work together/To improve our way of life"". Maybe they could have had this at the END of the movie! Throughout most of Cinderella, women have no rights, and the King can order absolutely anything he wants. Plainly, this tune would have matched the end of the movie far better.The Idina Menzel numbers, and the Billy Porter Godmother sequence were highlights. I don't mind the backstory for the wicked stepmother, and I don't mind the flamboyant, cross-gender Godmother. The numbers worked, and show that famous Broadway performers are famous for a reason. On the other hand, we could have freed up a few minutes for more useful film-making by dropping any scenes with James Corden and the mice-turned-footmen. They had completely disposable one-liners that weren't funny and didn't advance the story even a little.In order to beat us over the head with one-liners about women not having rights, the film doesn't devote enough attention to the ""real"" story. Why is the prince so head over heels in love that he would abdicate? Why does the king suddenly decide that everyone should have rights (especially the queen and the princess)? Why is the stepmother only occasionally evil (she's a bit of a split personality!). Couldn't they have moderated the basic theme just a bit to give us a genuine story?Did Cinderella have to be suffering SOLELY because, in this kingdom, women can't own businesses? That could be ONE of the reasons, but there wasn't enough of a backstory for her or some real ""meat"" to make us like/feel for her. Cinderella could have been a ""full daughter"" in this movie, and the bit about the dress business would have been the same. And, about that dress business, what was going on with her designs? Did the budget run out of money for someone to draw a few sketches that looked like dresses? Cinderella's designs looked like crayon drawings. I had a similar reaction to her aborted efforts to design a new dress after the Prince buys her first creation. We see her POUND pencils/crayons on the paper a couple of times and then crumple up the effort. There's no way that she had started to draw a dress design!So, there's enough in here to watch, but not as a ""movie."" More as a series of skits, some of which work. They could have kept a lot=t of the premise, and made a far, far better movie.",Cinderella

Of course it is possible that the blame lies squarely with the script and director but I suspect that would be a charitable assumption.

To say nothing of the progressive activism. That's gotten old at this point. I have nothing against the performers other than saying that maybe they should read scripts a little more carefully in the future before agreeing to something.

""Rhythm Nation""? I love the song but it serves absolutely no purpose here. (As opposed to the use of ""Somebody to Love."") And it's not alone, as if someone tossed a random handful of song titles into a hat and chose most of them without looking. And while I know the lead can sing, her tracks are so overproduced, with noticeably heavy compression and obvious tuning (as an effect), that it robs her performances of anything approaching a natural voice. I wish she had been allowed to sing live - or at least have her performances treated more carefully. In short, the music could have accentuated this kind of modern reinterpretation; instead, it tends to weaken everything around it.",Cinderella

The casting is full of talented musicians and Camila Cabello does really well on her role even though it's her first acting in a super production like this! It made me like her even more.

The lead actress could not only divinely sing, she could act, move and dance, and the whole cast was so well chosen. It might be the first time I see so many attaching characters in a single movie. The CGI and special effects (GOD, the way that magic dress appears!!) were excellent, and even the camera work showed creativity. I love how they filmed the ballroom scenes, especially the musicians people most of the time don't even think about. Every actor seemed to have fun and there were many hilarious moments that had me wheezing for air. Plus one, single scene that had me tear up. How did they manage to do that... I still wonder.

And omg the movie felt so long. At one point I thought it was almost finished but there was still over 1 hour left.

244,bbbutler-37914,"Except for the heavy and transparent socio-political agenda, I loved it.",7,4 September 2021,"First of all, I really liked this film. The music, choreography and several other aspects of the production values are Oscar-worthy. I'm sure it will go down as one of the best films of the year, perhaps more. I'm gonna watch it ten more times.However, this is also an undiguised propaganda tract for a ""smash the patriarchy and state"" effort. The institutions of the state, tradition, family and marriage are considered uniformly evil in their very DNA. The most direct statement of this attitude is the ""carry it, marry it or bury it...down to your grave"" lyric of Dream Giirl song at the climax.Beginning with the opening scene that establishes the conflict between the ""rhythm nation"" of Hegalian thesis establishment thinking (boo) and behavor and the progressivist ""Milion to One"" antithesis (hooray), the message is impossible to overlook.Without exception the evil characters in the story represent the status quo--those who are malevolent, selfish, mean-spirited, petty and stupid. This attribution extends to all but Ella. Even the prince, and almost all the male characters, lack the ingegrity, depth of character, honesty and hopeful attitude that one would expect from those who support and maintain a decent society.Only the dreamers and reformers, Ella. Princess Gwen, the mice and the ""fabulous godmother"" represent the positive. It is an undisguised triumph of the will against oppressive societal structures. The lack of subtlety in plot and theme and nuance of character are an embarrassment to the script writers and does no justice to the original fairy tale--or any well-told story for that matter.Perhaps the most concise statement in this film comes from Ella herself, who reflects, ""I have to try and make a life for myself by myself. Because that is what I want."" If this is not the watchword of our age, I cannot find another. It is, in the words of a modern social phliosopher, pure ""expressive individualism"" and, in the words of historian Carl Truman, ""the triumph of the modern self."" As Psalm 2:3 says, ""Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles."" It almost makes me weep with a strange sense of joy at the destruction of the system and its structures as it is portrayed in the story. It holds a similar hope and promise of which the French and Russian revolutions convinced that generation. Romantic love, however that is expressed, is all; the rest can burn.The resolution to this film, though, is wonderful. Love will and does save the day. But don't let your kids watch it unless they have very well-tuned critical thinking skills.",Cinderella
245,rspicochi-38499,Billy Porter rules this fantastic adaptation- perfectly!,10,30 September 2021,"There was NO other reason why I wanted to watch this but to see how Billy Porter performed as the ""Godmotha"". Was I shocked to see how he and this movie blew me away with fantastic songs, wonderfully fun antics, romantic love scenes (but not is a sexist male dominated way). I am saddened to see ratings of 1 or 2. Not sure how you could not see the brilliance in writing, acting, singing, as it went far beyond all other versions. Please take a look at this - I hope it gets recognized for its truly warm approach to the typical Cinderella trope. Many fun surprises await you like the mouses as funny stagecoach men.

253,seaj11,Delightful and refreshing take on an old classic,8,4 September 2021,"As a visual anthropologist, master film critic, folklorist, and professional dancer, I went in with middling expectations. I've been burned before!I'm pleased to report that this movie strikes the right balance between glitz and genuine moments, between revisionism and classic themes.Jukebox musical version of Cinderella? Check.Feminist twist on a classic fairy tale? Yep.A rapping town crier a la Men In Tights? Definitely.Costumes to die for? Oh Goddess yes.This is a whimsical and delightful take on an old favorite. I was skeptical at first-modernist takes ok fairy tales can quickly lose sight of the original message - but overall the yummy sights, clever dialogue, and the exuberant energy of a passionate cast all far outweigh the cons.Apparently, bigots and walking fedoras are bombing this page with 1-star reviews. Don't listen to them. The earliest version of the Cinderella story was from Greece, and similar tales appeared in China and other non-white places. So the reviewers complaining about wokeness and a diverse cast are just racists, plain and simple.Yes, there is a female empowerment message, but that existed in the Disney version as well. I won't give spoilers, but I will say that this movie gives both Cinderella and her prince full storylines with complex insecurities and dreams. Is it woke for a male character to not just be a dude in a suit like in the Disney film. According to the incels who are mad about ""wokeness,"" yes.My main gripe with the film is the pacing. Some of the transitions are a bit wonky. The audience doesn't have time to digest emotional movements and instead are forced to witness CGI dancing mice (yecch), one of which is voiced by James Corden (double yecch).I also found a lot of the choreography lacking. For such inventive uses of rock and pop classics, the dancing was underwhelming-although the costumes are incredible eye candy. The exception is the no-expense-spared closing scene featuring an awesome mix of Afro/samba with classic silver-screen musical movies: panoramic shots and all!I will also say that any jukebox musical that pays tribute to the Struts is worth a watch. And the original songs aren't half bad-Menzel's climactic aria is damn good. I also enjoyed Cabello's performance: she's no Idina, but she's adorable and engaging.And yes, Pierce Brosnan sings, much to the chagrin of the other characters. Bit of a fun in-joke!Overall: a sumptuous visual masterpiece with some clever ideas and a heart of gold. The pacing and transitions could be a little better, and and the overall choreography lacks luster. Still this is a refreshing take on the ancient Cinderella tale-and I personally enjoyed seeing people of color represented and celebrated in this genre. If you're bothered by seeing black, Hispanic, and Jewish actors on screen, ask yourself why.",Cinderella

Here is my take.It encourages young people to work towards becoming their best version of themselves. Only then can you take on true responsibilities. The prince's sister was clearly the better leader, her mind working on ideas to make life better. The prince still needs time to grow, and figure out his role in life. Sure, he could become a bad king, but why would we want that, just because it was his ""responsibility"" rather than his nature, such as his sisters.There was no reason to put a label on their relationship at the end of the movie. These two have known each other way to short a time to be getting married, taking on the responsibility of such a relationship. I dare say, even travelling the world together is probably too soon. Any parent, conservative or liberal, would cringe at such a decision.Anyway, enjoyable, but not a more than once type of film.",Cinderella

It tries too hard to cover a variety of topics, with very in your face, woke messages. The chemistry between the two leads was pretty awful (Prince Charming was completely cringe). There was also a weird mix of original songs and existing ones. Positively hated the end number and came away from this feeling empty.I think if they'd stuck with complete satire, it might have worked, but they tried too hard to stick to the original plot and fairytale which has been done to death. Revamping Ella as a fashion designer isn't really enough when the whole film is centered around her marrying a prince.Camila did her best with what she was given and she can sing, I do look forward to seeing her in other acting roles (hopefully with better material).",Cinderella
274,A-Ok_USA,Had potential but tried too hard,5,4 September 2021,"The message of self-fulfillment and autonomy is a laudable one that I think this movie tried hard to convey but unfortunately it fell flat. The story was sadly too thinned out by the overused music/choreography. Don't get me wrong, I love love love every song they used, but they were used in such a boring and inauthentic way... as both time fillers & exposition - not much more. Nothing made me give two spits about almost any of the characters. There are a couple of times they tease a real story by throwing out morsels about motivations, but never actually bake the whole cake. So much more could have been done to make both plot & characters more interesting while still keeping it a musical.Best parts: everything Billy Porter, Nandi Bushell's cameo, Romesh Ranganathan & James Cordon clapping (I literally lol), and surprisingly (to me) Minnie Driver! Some of the costume design was really excellent. I do like that a new generation will hear classic songs by Des'ree, Janet Jackson, Madonna & En Vogue to name a few.Worst parts: nearly everything with the prince, several of the musical performances, and sadly the dresses Ella designed were just... boring and predictable.

However, what separates it from this version of Cinderella is a) they connected the history of pop songs to the overall theme of love b) the vocal talent was much stronger. Not sorry.The lack of an original or traditional score just makes this movie look like a lazy effort. If I had to grade this movie according to high school ascension this would be like a junior who failed several sophomore courses and has to catch up. The set looks okay, the costumes are very nice, and the cast actually LOOKS the part...but they certainly dont act it. Attaching past ""bops"" to a scene and adding some choreography wont make it likeable; it actually makes it cringey. Especially when more than once, someone busts out into a rap solo.I've never been the biggest fan of Idina Menzel's voice-ever-but this movie will probably seal my dislike for her basic, nasal voice for good. Shes an okay actress but they set her very straight forward, broadway technique to an urban tune and the whole song sounded like the sound of music...disintegrating. Now am I wrong? (See what i did there)Back to the set...what era does this take place in? Mixing old english with modern slang is, again, SUPER cringey.I dont know why Rhythm Nation started this movie or why it continued to hover around...is this a movie about dancing? None of that made sense...and Camila Cabello and whoever played The Prince have some of the most atrocious voices I've ever heard on screen. Her voice is autotuned and You can actually hear the pitchy/off moments in many of her solos. Whoever plays the Prince has the voice of the typical ""white guy with a guitar and square jaw who is predestined to win American Idol/The Voice."" Remember THAT era?Billy Porter has a WONDERFUL voice. Finally and thank God someone sounds amazing and has a voice that resonates with you. The dress was fabulous too. Im not into drag culture or anything like that but Billy did THAT (*finger snaps*) and is truly the star of the film. This saves the film along with the unique idea of Cindy having talent for designing clothes. The ball scene with all the women dressed and singing was lovely and I appreciate they showed how beautiful all shades are-but the score was still atrocious.No complaints ab Pierce of course, the prince didnt need a sister, and the movie is probably better for generation Z teenagers who just really like pop hits.

A poor beautiful girl who is harassed by purely evil stepsisters and a stepmother and is saved from her life of poverty and exploitation by a rich powerful prince seems so yesterday.Maybe the story of a woman being able to transcend her class by marriage was powerful during its time, but I don't think it's so for the time we are in now.This movie took the heart of the Cinderella story and changed as many of the old tropes as they could to incorporate the messages of today - no one's purely evil (ie the stepmother) and most importantly, a woman don't need no man to save her!Above all, the movie was fun - the covers of 80's songs, dance numbers, rapping marching band, James Gorden!!,Camilla Cabello bringing her spunky personality to the character, a fabulous male fairy godmother!!, Pierce Brosnan!! And more. Probably the biggest disappointment was casting for the prince: can't really say he added anything different to the movie. If you're looking for historical accuracy and staying true to the Cinderella story, you will be sorely disappointed. This is a new, fresh take and I thought it hit the mark. Bye bye old Cinderella.

But all these suspicious reviews made me curious.Sheesh, there is NO WAY this movie is as bad as all those reivews make it. My guess is that some blog or forum whipped people up and they came here in droves to dis the flick. Actually, that Camila gal really did a good job. Again, I do not like musicals. Not at all. But this film really had some gorgeous sets, very interesting, with tasty colors and such. And there was also an effort to make some things look dingy and realistic - in a storybook sort of way.All in all, this is indeed a musical. I found the songs jolting and it seemed to me it was just singing for the sake of singing, meaning it didn't really serve to move the story along. But, hey, some people like singing, and dancing, and pretty sets. My suggestion is this: if you like attractive sets and costumes, dancing, modern pop, etc. - give it a try. If you're an old fart like me, ha ha ha, you probably not gonna like it. Even though I did kind of like it regardless.Last line: somebody give Camila Cabello another shot. I got a very strong feeling about her. I think she could fulfill a role in a legit movie (aka non-pop-musical). She had excellent presence and very believable expression. She also had confidence.

The stepmother wants cinderella to get married, makes her own daughters do the hardworking, and is not threatening to cinderella at all, all she does is yell at ella to make some tea and want her to marry a rich man, i think that's what the feminist movie team thinks it's the definition of abuse nowadays, but it shouldn't be for cinderella. ALL the changes they make to the story are extremely questionable and are there in order to demonize such things as marriage and men, not good. The movie completely misses the point of the cinderella fairy-tale, i mean, in this version cinderella doesn't even want to go to the ball, she thinks it's 'antiquated' and the prince is the one that convince her to go because somehow he is already in love with her, but that makes the whole ball sequence kind of redundant, he already knew her, he was already in love with her, he was already willing to marry her, so the ball sequence was there for... reasons? At the end of the movie cinderella still gets her prince but it doesn't have any impact because she didn't need the prince to get out of an abusive lifestyle, which in fact was fine, her life was fine, the stepfamily was nice to her and it's probably one of the movie's biggest issue, it just doesn't fit in.

But don't get me wrong, the movie did try to raise some important issues, and add a 21st century flavor to an ancient fairytale.All the fairytales are based on a prince rescuing a damsel, and them living happily ever after. This might have been the case a century or more back, but as of today women want more than just a prince. They want to be successful, to be heard, to be respected - and Cinderella did try to involve them all in its plot, however poorly it may have been executed. Also, the stepmother trying to dissuade Cinderella from following her dreams, so that she didn't get hurt as she didn't believe anyone in the society will support her being a woman - a touch of reality there.Hopefully, the future of fairytales will follow Cinderella's trail :)",Cinderella

Camila Cabello is passable, her voice was irritating at times. Nicholas Galitzine did well as the prince.

I couldn't help but feel that masculinity was considered archaic and evil but overbearing femininity was considered moral and ethical.This is not so.So many flaws with this movie and it was more a political lecture telling every man they are a piece of crap than entertainment.Even when they profess their love, she has to go to the next step of ""not wanting to put a label on it"". He denounces being king to his teenage sister (which is apparently a good idea because as long as you're female - you can lead) and still this isn't good enough for the director/screen writer.Men - unless you want to be lectured on why you are crap for 2 hours - steer clear of this woke diatribe.Btw - my earlier comment was deleted. I will keep writing a new one as the studio should not be allowed to pay to delete anything they don't like.",Cinderella
328,CoreyLamont,It's actually good!,8,20 September 2021,"Contradicting to most reviews, I think this movie is actually quite entertaining!. The key word is entertaining. The songs used were well rearranged with nice twists. Even thought the story has been altered quite a bit but so what?! The cinematography and dances were very nice. Another noteworthy aspect are the dresses and the filming locations. Overall, it's entertaining, funny, beautiful, and the music well formed. Perhaps not the film artistry the critics are looking for but it's a well made film.",Cinderella
329,helmholtzwatsonaplus,Here's why the rating's low and you should watch it anyway,7,9 September 2021,"Ignore the low rating and just watch it. A whole lot of that low rating stems from the fact that this is a fresh take on a classic. That's always guaranteed to tick a lot of people off no matter how good it is. Add to that the fact that this will considered ""woke"" by people to whom that's a swear word. That loses you at least another star. The thing is that this isn't so much woke as it is modern, as in the female lead has her own aspirations that don't depend on a husband. Oh, and there's a man in feminine clothing. Shocking, right? Beyond that, the acting is good, most of the music is good and some of it's great, the script is excellent and really funny and the casting was quite good also. I loved that they had Nandi Bushell there too. Kids will love this. I'm a grown man and I really enjoyed it.",Cinderella

332,Here2Riot,Yikes!! Just don't,1,9 September 2021,"I had to forward most of the movie that's how bad it was. There were too many songs and they were bad and annoying, the acting was cringy, there was no chemistry between characters and hard to like any of them, random rapping guy on the bridge with a band and modern dialogue/actions that throw you off with the time period, and Hollywood feminism/woke culture. This is not Cinderella at all and they should have called it something else. Don't waste your time and go watch the classic animation/live action Cinderella or if you wanna see a better modern live action go watch Hilary Duffs A Cinderella Story, Another Cinderella story (Selena Gomez), or Cinderella story once upon a time. Not amazing movies but much much much better for the eyes and ears.",Cinderella

335,ChanithaWeerasinghe,Beautiful modern style fun remake with wonderful songs.,9,6 October 2021,"The new Cinderella movie by Sony Pictures and Amazon Studios retells the beloved famous fairy tale with a few changes and songs in all kinds of genres such as pop, rock, classic...It's a very entertaining fun inspirational romantic musical film from the beginning to the end with famous songs such as Ed Sheeran's ""Perfect"", Jennifer Lopez's ""Let's Get Loud"", Madonna's ""Material Girl"" and Queen's ""Somebody To Love"" with two new originals from Camila Cabello and Idina Menzel who also voiced for Elsa in Frozen. These songs give energy to the movie and makes it more fun and entertaining as I said earlier.The film delivers the messages such as that you can do whatever you want, even if it doesn't stick to the status quo because when you become a success in what you've been working on, the status quo will also change according to you and that there is nothing you can't do if you believe in yourself and work very hard.Sure, they've added a male for the fairy godmother a and named him as ""Fab G"", but it didn't ruin the movie for me because if it was a female, the song ""Shining Star"" played at the scene where Cinderella meets Fab G won't be beautiful as it is with the male. Also, if they didn't do that change, it will be the same movie by Disney with new actors and songs from another movie company. There are more changes but I won't mention them as they could spoil the film.This new remake of Cinderella is really really great and Sony proved that they could be better than good old Disney.Hope you would enjoy the movie!",Cinderella
336,zoesamhap,It's just candy,5,11 September 2021,"Too much makes you feel blah. But it's bright, cheerful and optimistic. It doesn't take itself seriously and I don't think anyone should see it as a post-feminist dissertation on 1700 century roles of women. It's a movie with talking mice, magic and the obsolete position of a royal family. So do I look to this movie for seriousness and thought provoking moments, no. Sometimes I want to watch candy, knowing it might be too sweet, tooth-aching at times but still a nice harmless diversion. Wouldn't pay money to watch in theater though.

340,Reefmonkey,Pandering Disney Channel Movie Quality,2,7 September 2021,"Given the amount of hype Amazon Prime gave this movie, I expected at least better production quality, but this felt like a movie produced for the Disney Channel. Interiors were good, because they were filmed at actual stately manor houses, but ""town"" scenes were obviously on Pinewood Studios' backlot, not even redressed. Every progressive, girl-power ""plot twist"" was telegraphed a mile before it happened, and the message was heavy-handed. It was basically a jukebox musical, most of the musical numbers were new arrangements of Top 40 hits of the last 40 years, which made them feel shoehorned and pandering. Pierce Brosnan and Minnie Driver were wasted as the overbearing patriarch who lightens up and the stifled mother who makes him see the error of his ways. So too was Idina Menzel as the predictably not-as-wicked-as-she-first-appears stepmother. Billy Porter's flamboyant ""twist"" on a fairy godmother felt like it crossed the line from pandering to LGBTQ to outright offensive stereotype of LGBTQ. Camila Cabello's voice was that annoying breathy affected one that seems so popular among young female popstars now, and her acting was pretty bad. The prince was annoying and too pretty, with an unbelievably swift redemption arc. The town crier and his crew felt like a ripoff of Hamilton.",Cinderella

353,margarida-44311,Fresh & Fun!,8,17 October 2021,"I've watched this movie right after its release. I wanted to see how bad it was, since EVERYONE was talking how bad it was. Guess what: it's not bad. I'm pretty sure lot of people didn't even watched this until the end, but still wanted to talk bad of other's work without even bother to see more than a few moments of the picture.The musics are very famous (which is very good since I'm Portuguese), and everyone sings very well (even though I would say they could have use a little less auto tune). So I was very amused (I love the use of popular songs).There's also moments where the movie doesn't take himself very serious, which made my experience watching way better (these days every single movie takes themselves WAY too serious, even when it makes no sense). A few jokes here and there (including a scene that I had to go back a few times of how hard it made me laugh).I simply loved the duets, between Cinderella and the prince. To this day, I can't stop listening to their songs together (and the major single is also veryyyy good, as well as the reprises).The acting it's not oscar's worthy, but it was never this movie's intention towards that. And also I must say that for a first main work, Camilla was really good. I personally enjoyed watching her. I hope she gets more opportunities in musicals (her voice is so beautiful and she has so emotion!)And lastly, and VERY important was definitely the new approach with this version o of the classic. There's so MUCH representation. And now it's not just about getting married; life is so much more than that, right? So why not bring it to the screen and let young children feel represented and inspired.I Highly recommend you to watch it until the END, but without expectations of finding a new masterpiece (don't forget this is a comedy/musical meant to be watched by and with the kids).",Cinderella

364,shareelatasha,It was hard to watch,1,8 September 2021,"I'm going to start with the one good thing about this movie, the stepmother. Her songs were actually good and she performed the hell out of them. In fact anytime she sang in this movie she stole the show. I like the fact that the character was not one-dimensional. These are the only positive comments I have about this musical. They tried too hard and it was laughable at times. The songs we're all over the place and it felt messy. The movie was poorly cast, apart from the step mom. I felt Cinderella's dress was underwhelming as well as her makeup and hair. The fairy godmothers costume was better than hers. I love progressive movies but this one just didn't do it right, the writing was desperate. This movie was literally hard to watch and get through. I finished it because I was hoping it would get better. This was an epic fail, it lacks charm and finesse. I think they tend to forget that being progressive doesn't have to mean making men small. They took it too far, just let the prince be a prince. They still could have let her make dresses and have a job. But this movie was written poorly so they couldn't figure out how to make it progressive without being cringe-worthy and simple minded. I rolled my eyes while watching this nonsense. I just thought of something worth mentioning. I love the diversity within this movie, that's the only other positive thing I can think of.",Cinderella
365,heyitsanname,cinematic representation of cringe,2,6 September 2021,"I wasn't expecting much, but I've never thought this movie was this terrible!Obviously Camila and Idina have beautiful voices, and this is the only reason why I rate this 2/10 and not 1/10. I hoped for good songs, but they are pretty out of context, for example: Rhythm Nation (this version still gives me nightmares), or Am I Wrong. The aesthetic is messy. Some dresses (which are a major subject in the movie) are bad. The CGI in some scenes seems to be unfinished.Talking about the writing, instead, the characters are superficial, they miss layers: this includes the main character, Cinderella who isn't the humble girl from the classic Cinderella, but is spiteful and annoying. Her character isn't that problematic actually, but in my opinion, the worst one is the fairy godmother. This is the classic gay-representation that is stereotypical and feels more like homophobia than something good.The story is boring and slow and it looks like a 10 years old girl wrote it.As I read in a comment on TikTok: ""I'm never gonna see another movie with James Corden doing a CGI animal again."".",Cinderella

Is it GOOD? No. It's also not the worst thing imaginable.While I didn't enjoy the use of all the modern songs, the singing & performances themselves were good. In my opinion, most of the actors sang pretty well (especially Camila & Idina-duh- & Nicholas Galitzine). The acting also wasn't bad. I think a lot of the reviewers took the movie far more seriously than what was intended & that's the reason for the poor reviews. The movie was quirky & had quite a few chuckle-worthy moments. That being said, there were DEFINITELY quite a few cringeworthy moments that I could've done without (the town crier & marching band feel? Just no.). This move was just alright. Not as bad as I expected it to be, but definitely not good. It's a shame cause the singing & acting wasn't bad (in my opinion). Cringeworthy with some chuckles is my overall assessment.Also, I'm not sure why so many people dislike James Corden! I think he's really funny. I liked him in this.

Her voice is honey and I loved her acting skills. Can't believe it was her first time on the big screen. This movie is amazing and to the people who can't see that, well, I'm sorry for your bad taste. But this is amazing. Fairy tales are more than just about the prince and princess living happily ever after and people need to accept that.",Cinderella

I think the writers tried way too hard to make this a modernized Cinderella in storyline and message, ended up just being silly. So disappointed because I was so excited to see this adaptation. If I could have given a 10 for the vocal/musical performances I would have, but since the overall movie left me feeling blah, it got a 4.",Cinderella

I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",Cinderella

I'm not a fan of musicals and I generally don't watch them or I fast forward through the singing. But I decided to keep an open mind and I'm glad I did. The singing wasn't bad or over the top.I really liked the the last song and dance scene of the movie.And I love the message for girls to go after their dreams.,Cinderella

It was totally made to reflect upon some messages like supporting women in their career or casting brown people and many more.

411,manleygurl,Cute adaptation that incorporates Pop music and Classicism,8,12 September 2021,I've learned to ignore 1 star ratings. They always have an agenda. It's a fun movie and you should check it out. I enjoyed the songs they picked and enjoyed the messages they presented in a fun way. **SPOILERS** Ella wanted her own business and the man she loved was cool with that. And I loved they way they explained the bitterness of the stepmother. Sometimes people are angry and bitter because of past injustices or tragedies and not just because they are bad people. This was actually way more believable than portraying individuals as either all good or all bad.,Cinderella
412,zhanellecapinig,Lighthearted and funny,8,8 September 2021,It's not perfect and has some cringe-y scenes but it will make you laugh. It's really entertaining and should be enjoyed.

413,sinopa-09617,Meh,4,5 September 2021,"The song choices from the different eras is reminiscent of Ella enchanted without the charm. The over the top theatrics and bad directing destroyed what could have been a classic such as Brandy's Cinderella. I'm not sure who decided to use the same boring troupe of a smart but clumsy or ditzy female lead, but please just stop. Just stop. The stupid gimmicks that are used to draw attention to Cinderella is the only thing that drives the story forward. Someone please stop giving Jame Corden the ability to make movies.",Cinderella

The lead characters are never in danger, and their journeys of self-discovery see them ""woke"" up rather than wake up.The songs and dance numbers are competent but not to my taste. At times, the visual imagery is brilliant. For example, when the prince and princess dance in front of a frozen ballroom. And when the butterfly turns into the fairy godmother (?).Missable.",Cinderella

For me bringing back some hits of my youth was great and for her it was colourful and new. However, they've managed to turn a loved fairytale into a political agenda about women's emancipation taken to the extreme. It's the fact that it's taken to the extreme that they're so many negative reviews. Yes to women's emancipation...no to stuffing it down people's throats. We were both left totally baffled by the ending. 4 stars for the music though.",Cinderella

Instead we get treated to badly off key and uptempo'd versions of various pop songs.

The fact that many reviewers are threatened by it (one sentence, one star--really?) seems an indication of their cultural fear.

Although the plot itself isn't very interesting the details are! The songs which are modern songs with a twist fits the scenes perfectly, the message that everybody should be able to become whatever they want is pretty cute, even though it's cringy. Over all I would say this movie is a feel good movie but for low expectations. Also I must say I really enjoyed Cabellos performance, I mean no Oscar award here but she makes her role witty, cute and unexpected!",Cinderella
429,maya-dilati,Not the best.,3,13 September 2021,"I know its based on the obvious re-told story of Cinderella but there has been multiple to numerous remakes of this org movie.I think this has way too many musicales, i literally had to skip few mins until they're done.It has a refreshing new modern twist to it but got boring quickly
it sped through the story very fast
evil step ma and sissy's weren't that evil afterall. They were just senesless without any common sense to know how to act
the only thing i liked about it is Cinderella seeking her independance through establishing her own business in a man-driven society.Wouldn't bother watching it again.",Cinderella

I agree that this was in no way the actual Cinderella story. WAY too much veering off course. However, I love some of the actors, like Minnie Driver, Pierce Brosnan, Camilla Cabello (well, as a singer, not an actor), Billy Porter. The entire message of the story was totally changed though, even the characteristics of many of the main roles, and it leaned (hard!) towards a preachy feministic vibe that seemed forced. I read a lot of James Corden bashing on here, but I watch his show every night, and adore him. Glad it was free, though!",Cinderella

It was a very loose adaption of the classic story of Cinderella but with a modern day twist as in girl chooses career over marriage proposal (in a nutshell). It reminded me a lot of the Descendants series and if you go into it with an open mind and are prepared to be entertained by musical mashups, gorgeous costumes and a fun and silly storyline then you won't be disappointed.",Cinderella

I love the colors, the costumes, the hard work put into the songs, scenery and script.It was nothing short of spectacular. Some people may love and some may hate it but if you watch it without trying to compare it to the old classic then it's a beautiful original movie of its own.I didn't watch it to see another ""Cinderella"" adaptation. I watched it to see if Amazon can make movies. And they blew the house! Disney, Netflix and big movie companies can tremble because Amazon Originals gonna make a hit!The songs were gorgeous! Inspiring and beautifully set to the theme of the movie.I also love how they made the stepmother not ""evil"" but also just another broken person like all of us who needed to remember who she was and her purpose.The prince was also not cheesy like the ""classic Prince Charming"" but also someone with personality and one who's truly his own.Cinderella was also beautiful in her own vibrant way that's so refreshing! She was so human! There! Thank you! A human character and not just some made up, Barbie, too good to be true princess mock up! No, they made Cinderella HUMAN again in this movie. She was actually RELATABLE! You hear me folks! Enough with the Barbie movies.The old classic Cinderella is a movie on its own.This new Cinderella is a movie on its own.Don't try to mix the two. They are their own. Separate creations. Don't try to watch it trying to compare it to a movie made a hundred years ago. Lol. Of course you'd be disappointed!But I wasn't disappointed because I didn't watch it trying to squeeze this amazing original movie into a ""Cinderella"" BOX! This movie is made OUTSIDE the BOX! It's ORIGINAL. Love it!The casting was beautiful. They couldn't have chosen a more perfect cast. Love them all!The scene with the king and queen having their marriage conversation has touched my mom and dad's marriage. It was beautiful. Life changing.",Cinderella

439,sjessie_140,Singing was unwatchable,2,3 September 2021,Turned it off after about 20 minutes. The movie looked pretty enough but the singing was terrible to watch. It was so incredibly overproduced that it more so felt like the characters were listening to a cd than that they were singing the songs themselves. It was really jarring. I tried skipping the song to make it watchable but there were just too many songs.,Cinderella

All of that being said, I was very disappointed by this one. Besides some good actors, (james corden ugh) and a great introductory performance by Cabello, this movie just fell completely flat in my opinion. I didn't like the songs, the vibe (billy's fairy godmother oh god) or anything really besides some of the actors. Overall, very forgettable and nothing unique or special at all.",Cinderella

It's the former. The movie is inclusive and from a feminist standpoint, which was refreshing. My children loved it. Not saying you can't dislike it and be a feminist I just find that people who have a strong hate reaction to something and point out some minor flaws to justify this is maybe not looking deeper into their soul??",Cinderella

447,deleau,Why is it a bad movie?,4,5 September 2021,I think they should warn viewers that this movie is for 8 year old max. I think kids really enjoy this movie.I think that is the heart of the problem with this movie. It has newspaper reviews etc... and so a grown up audience goes watch it. There are higher expectations than a kids movie.But the movie is just some more or less extreme famous cliche popsongs around Cinderella without any intelligence around it. The songs don't fit the story and there is no attempt made to at all add basically anything else than some people singing those songs in an awkward way.But kids will like it.,Cinderella

Princess Diaries with more HITS. A MOVIE and A TOP 40 ALBUM! Id like to see the conference room where they wrote this, the wing of audience test screening rooms and focus rooms where the characters, dialogue and music were all engineered. I bet it was awesome. This movie tries so hard to seem authentic, to find even a shred of human-like emotion. In the end its just robotic, pop-factory garbage.",Cinderella

This movie is NOT for you if A) you have problems with a Black, gay, fabulous godmother, B) you feel like diversity has been forced on you, or C) if you've ever used the word ""woke"" in a derogatory way. In fact, this movie talks directly to you. Here the king speaks for white men.King: ""You're making me wildly uncomfortable.""
Queen: ""You think you're the only person who feels stress? God! Try being your WIFE!""
His response? ""You're being unreasonable now.""So, yeah. This movie is not for you and you'll just get your feelings hurt, so stop giving it a ONE!The movie's theme is ""I Choose Me!"" and that's exactly what the movie does. It doesn't care what you think. Hate it? Go away! Love it? Then come along for the ride, 'cuz it's gonna be what it's gonna be!This movie owes more than a little to Mamma Mia! (it even has Pierce Brosnan), with some Knight's Tale and just a touch of Disney Princesses thrown in. Yes, you should be able to guess the ending right after you meet Princess Qwen, but you won't care! (Mamma Mia! Was way better, but aimed at an older audience.)Things I liked:
-Dresses. All the costumes were perfect.-The music. I thought it got better as the movie went on, but maybe I just got more into it. (Note: Brosnan joined Mamma Mia! Just to act with Meryl Streep. He asked, ""Who is singing for me?"" They said, ""You are!"" His response? ""If they're dumb enough to ask me to sing, I'm dumb enough to do it!"" He's not a great singer, but he is better than this. The character was supposed to be bad, so take it easy on him.)-It was diverse. (Don't come crying to me that an imaginary kingdom has brown, gay, or trans people in it. The monarchy is still white, anyway.)-Characters were not who they appear to be. You get glimpses behind the cardboard cutouts of who these people really are, and it makes it much more enjoyable. Yes, some changes were a little rushed, but they packed a lot into this movie.-It was FUNNY! It was self-aware but not too far. Really, it was ridiculous, but it was a musical and I thought it worked. Again, the movie leaned into it and went for it. Remember, it doesn't care what you think!-Nandi Bushnell playing drums.-A woman writer/director. I saw 5 minutes of Mamma Mia! And said, ""Oh, a woman directed this!"" (C'mon. Sophie wears a one-piece. It's obvious!) Here the dialogue (like what I've already quoted) shows a female perspective. And it works!In short, a kids' movie that adults will enjoy.",Cinderella

Billy Porter is as the ""fab g"" is also surprisingly enjoyable. There's alot things they changed from the classic Cinderella especially from Disney.Okay now lets move on to the things i dislike.

Just picture them all sad and angry about something so silly. I say give it a go. You'll most likely enjoy it. I did. I really doubt that you will feel the same way these Karens on the internet do after seeing it.",Cinderella
461,santossofiaezra,Wonderful Soundtrack and Improvements!,10,10 September 2021,I know that many people didn't like the movie because it is different from the original story but I love it.

We really enjoyed it and had a lot of laughs. Sure its not the traditiional Cinderella you might be used to but try and embrace some change for once.

I set alerts and reminders, I was so happy for a ""fresh take"" on a classic story,... but nope!!!I was very disappointed! Take out all the signing and maybe the acting would have gotten it 5 stars! Maybe! The ""cool"" updates, earrings, nose rings, and teen slang etc. (what a joke) were horrible.I so wanted to love this, but it was just bad...Signing looked like it was dubbed, and was really over annoying at times.Very sad from what could have been excellent!!! There were moments where it could have been turned around but they missed the mark.With a little editing this could be a great film!Maybe someone will fix it, Wouldn't be had to make a few adjustments and make a great film.",Cinderella

470,komorebimuse,Wildly Uncomfortable,2,3 September 2021,"Who wrote this? The stepmother is abusive, the prince's father needs anger management. It's daunting and exasperating. I wanted it to finish soon enough. This could have been progressive but the telling of the prince to Cinderella that she couldn't be what she wanted to be is just setting women back to the 1950's. The music, comedy and the actors are why I gave it a two star but the plot and dialogue stink.",Cinderella
471,pearlcruzpickle,Good fun with helpful lessons,9,4 September 2021,"Not all movies need to be deep. This is a silly good-natured fun movie and anyone who wants to lighten up a little during these times will appreciate.A lot of criticism about being ""woke"" and girl-boss themes but when you are actually a parent of a 15-year old girl, and you want to give lessons about focusing on school vs boys, but you know you can't tell her that directly without having any form of possible negative impacts, having a movie like this with Cabello as a role model is INVALUABLE. I don't expect these negative reviewers to understand something as important as that but there you go. It has a clear audience maybe you are not one of them but if you're just looking for something fun and or something that your kids can learn from, there's a definite audience who will appreciate this.",Cinderella

So watch it only when you love singing the whole movie.",Cinderella

474,sherelleforeshaw,Shouldn't be called Cinderella,4,3 September 2021,"10 minutes in and already maybe 3 songs, kind of off-putting and annoying. Are they in England ? Alot of English cast but Cinderella is American quite strange. Why are they revamping old songs, don't like it and there all old old songs like 80s. It takes away from the feel of Cinderella. How amazing at the entrance to the ball to see women of different ethnicities dressed in the cultural attire-e.g. African, Indian saris loved this, would love to know which part of the worlds the other dresses were from. Loved the scenes where original music was used eg.the shining star song where the godmother comes, feels more fairy tale esque. Loved the modern twist where women don't seem like the usual damsel in distresses,girl bosses. Camulla was a great choice for cinderella and I can see her doing naby other acting roles, definitely in comedy . The guy who narrates and raps inbetween scenes is dreadful, stiff and annoying. I wouldve preferred if this wasn't called cinderella as it taints the sentiment if the original, this plot was weak.",Cinderella

I saw the negative reviews and expected crap. I was actually pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy any Cinderella story, Idina Menzel, Billy Porter, pop music and a whole lot of color I don't see how you wouldn't enjoy this. IGNORE the comments saying it's ""woke,"" ""political propaganda,"" ""virtue signaling..."" (all words I keep hearing from right-wing extremists). IT IS A MUSICAL FAIRYTALE REMAKE, do audiences want to see the same exact story/movie? NO! It's 100 percent appropriate for this decade, if not long overdue! That being said, it does fall short in some ways: choreography lacked variety, script was weak, Billy Porter didn't get enough screen time, and it felt rushed. HOWEVER, it was fun, funny, and empowering. I was impressed by Camila Cabello's performance and Idina Menzel's original song. What I saw was a cast thoroughly enjoying themselves, and that alone is enough for a softy with a B. F. A. In Musical Theatre Performance. (I will confess that my 10 star rating was made with the hope of counteracting the 1 star haters who just don't get it.) Pick up a dessert tray and pop some bubbly for this one.",Cinderella

478,emily967166,Camilla's Singing Ruins it,5,3 September 2021,"Listening to Camilla is like listening to a hyper chipmunk with bad auto tune. That aside, I did enjoy parts of this movie. Notably, the Fabulous godmother.It's a classic fairytale for the woke generation. But, the movie lacked depth. It was superficial and the message it was trying to convey didn't hit home for me.It's an amalgamation of all the previous Cinderella movies before it, from Ella Enchanted to Cinderella (2015). It could've done with more satire and better sound production along with better singing from Ella and the Prince, they really were dreadful.For me, Idina stole the show and added the depth that the film was missing.Overall, it's a fun film and the kids will love it!",Cinderella
479,beg37,I guess they could not find a lead that could sing,4,7 November 2021,"If you like Millennial and younger preachy movies, the garbage is your movie. The female lead cannot sing to save her life. The only person who sang worse was Pierce Brosnan. This is not Cinderella.",Cinderella

It allows you to see the ""wicked"" stepmother in a new light and is suitable for all ages.",Cinderella
482,borjaspablo,Why ruin a classic?,1,6 September 2021,"They wanted to make the most politically-correct movie ever, I get it, but write your own story, and your own music while you are at it. Doing it over a classic, doesn't make it good, but incredibly annoying. It would have been absolutely unwatchable, if it wasn't for the fairy godmother. Skip to that part, and then turn it off.",Cinderella

Nothing worked in this film. They tried to be original which just came off as desperate. The acting was boring. The actors were trying. Failing, but trying. I give them credit for that. Otherwise the movie was absolute trash.",Cinderella

487,k-jovanovicc,"Cute, but boring",6,10 September 2021,"I expected more comedy and more dialogue. I realize this is a musical, but still for two hours as long as the film lasts there is too little dialogue. Also, I hoped I would laugh out loud given the comidians that star, but oh well.I still love this lineup, I think a good job was done there, but it seemed a bit forced. Sure, a nice movie to watch, but it doesn't meet too many expectations.Camilla did well in this role, I like the idea that this movie represents, a modern princess who wants to pursue a career and she did it perfectly.All in all, a nice movie to relax.",Cinderella
488,Avidspider,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT,10,4 September 2021,"This clearly (judging by the reviews), is a movie you are either going to love or hate. Roughly half of the IMDB voters rate it 8+, and the other voters rate it under 5 stars. I believe this movie warrants a 7-7.5, but I have rated it higher to counterbalance those dunning the movie with 1-2 star reviews. Ok. It is a musical, so don't watch if you dislike musicals. Is this movie an academy award winner? No. However, it is entertaining, but may disappoint diehard musical aficionados because the songs are clever re-workings of popular tunes, and are not entirely original. By all means do not watch if you have it out for Camilla Cabello, because she has both singing and acting chops in this movie. And if you just hate musicals written with humor, by all means turn this off right away, because there are funny bits throughout this musical, made funnier if you have watched all the previous Cinderella movie iterations. Speaking of iterations, if you are just over the whole Cinderella thing, this one won't change your mind. It will however delight those looking for great dance numbers, great tunes (all of which you already know, so you can hum along), great musical actors, fun lyrics and a fun script. If you're a James Cordon hater, I guarantee you won't like him here, but if you do like him, he will not disappoint, and he may even make you laugh. If you are looking for something to criticize, this movie is as good as any, and maybe even better because it takes a stab at being diverse, inclusive, and politically correct. Whether it does so enough on any of these fronts is really up to you, and what you expect out of a light-hearted romp that does not take itself as seriously as you may be.",Cinderella

491,pzac,Better than I thought,8,5 September 2021,After reading so many terrible reviews I wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised that it's really quiet entertaining. The two main charters are perfect. Love the music and dancing. It's like watching a musical on Broadway. I haven't made it to the very end yet. If I change my mind I'll come back but so far it's worth watching if you like campy musicals. Wait till you see the fairy godmother and the three mice. They are a trip.

It is precious and wonderful. Billy Porter as the Godmother is perfect casting. Don't listen to the hate. Old minds, new movie.

The actual conflict written in considering the fairytale trope of the girl needing to marry otherwise she will not survive. It is humorous and everything, but the pain is still there. Everything is turned on its head and stays of solid ground. The whole world was created around the usually one-sided characters. Yes, Gwen could be a little more. And dang it the songs just blend perfectly with everything. And the crown achievement is casting Idina Menzel as stepmother. She was just epic in all respects.

Nothing about this movie makes sense. From the ""woke"" plot to the horrible song choices, to the terrible casting, this movie really nailed getting it wrong. It's borderline hilarious that Amazon has ""Insists on the Highest Standards,"" as one of their leadership principles, and yet allowed this atrocity to be released.",Cinderella

The music and performances were a delight to watch, the costumes and choreography make the show pop. I laughed out loud more than I have at most movies and shows I've watched lately.

Afraid of a world becoming too inclusive of deversity.Some of us, certainly the minority of reviewers who see value in updating Cindrerella and making it current and fresh just happen to not be so caught up in the fear and resentment of change.It would be great if "" they could lighten up"", but that's not likely to happen with such closed hearts and minds.

It's a cute, fluffy, fairytale musical. It's not deep, it's fun and sweet. If you were expecting Macbeth, you'd be disappointed. If you were excepting a musical fairytale . . .

540,rearestar,I absolutely loved it,10,3 September 2021,"The new update to the well known Cinderella story, makes it so much more great! I absolutely loved the whole film, from beginning to the end!Sure, one or two covers weren't the best choices, but overall I loved the idea of also including famous songs into the fairytale! The fact that Ella has aspirations of her own and is determined to change her life is so full of life to watch!One point i loved to the moon and back was that the side characters , so the evil stepmother, the queen, king and so on, also got their backstories, as well as how the life would be for women who tried to be something, that wasn't ''supposed '' to be done by them. The struggle not only women were faced with were made aware.For those who like Camila Cabello's music, this film is especially nice, as we get to hear her sing quite often. I have to say that I think she acted absolutely great for this being her debut film, as well as including the comedic factors.I think one of my fav scenes would be at the ball when they dance, (i will not specify who dances, as the review would be marked as spoiler than) since it makes me want to dance the exact same dance with someone.The whole movie kinda adds in present elements, be it the vocabulary or the whole presentations of characters.The scene at the ball :costume was absolutely stunning, stunning. Like look at the costumes, oh my gods they are so beautiful!Overall, the whole cinematography is real nice, with the bright diverse colours and generally as well diverse cast and representation.Sure for those who liked the traditional Cinderella , this version could be quite different as the first big difference is that Elle wants to be independent and build something on her own, along with the fact that the Prince Robert also has a little sister and mother. So it's made obvious that there is an quite interesting dynamic over the whole film, which changes. All the characters, and i mean all so all who matter , have reasons for acting the way they do and even if the reasons may not be ''right or worth recommending'' they still make sense.I extremely enjoyed the movie, i sang along had to stop shrieking a few times, laughed, adored and feel happy that i did not wait to watch it for later!!!Absolutely worth watching!!!!!",Cinderella

Was never a fan of musical movies but seeing this, as it consists of pop musics & originals, I really wanted to see more of this kind, POP MUSICALS ??!! (Not sure about the term).. The cast of the movie is just perfect!! Before watching this movie, I thought Camila Cabello would not be that great at acting, but she literally proved me wrong... (No offense to Camila) Most importantly, this modern remake is really empowering, and I am pretty sure this would inspire Asians (mainly from Southeast Asia, as traditions here are very common and strong so people who want to become something different could only be what they are meant to be).

He was handed a rubbish script and some lipstick.Pierce Brosnan needs to sue somebody because he was obviously sold a lie when he got involved in this movie, as was Idina Menzel.James acaster and romesh ranganathan were actually pretty good.

The environment/setting felt too fake, the mice were too fake (very bad CGI) the story was hard to tell cuz there was too much music going on, I'm pretty sure the movie is about 97% songs and 3% story with people that actually talked. People started to sing randomly every 3 minutes, way too much! And there were some serious cringe scenes, wayy too weird.Didn't like the pacing of the movie, it felt too rush to me; didn't like the jokes (weren't too funny to me except for the fairy godmother), didn't like the songs, especially because they weren't original, would have liked if they used their own songs. There was no connections between characters at all, no chemistry between Cinderella and the prince (when the prince sees Cinderella for the first time and he suddenly falls in love with her?! From veery far away, I mean I get that the movie is inspired by the classic Disney movie, but ngl I felt more real chemistry in the animated movie than this one), plus I'm not too sure how Cinderella appeared on top of that statue from nowhere?! Also not sure why most of the cast had a british accent but Cinderella, the step sisters and the step mother didn't? There were some characters that literally had 2 lines in the entire movie and literally forgot about them on the way. I quite like the fact that the movie is more about girls power and all. That's why 2 stars.",Cinderella

This movie shows womenpower. Some people may just judge this as a normal romance movie in which the poor damsel in distress is saved by the Prince Charming...But we should see the main thing. Ella is so determined to make a name of her own. It is so clearly shown here that she wanna be known as herself ..as ELLA. Not as the Queen of (whatever the name of the land is) or as the prince's betrothed..or whatever. She just wanna make the world know her as Ella, the designer. I respect that girl. She chose herself over the kingdom and the Prince Charming and that is something each and every girl should learn. And I respect the Prince too. He decided to respect his love's decision. The step-mother is not as cruel as other cinderella step-moms. Well, that's a nice thing. And the same goes for the step-sisters too. The King and the Queen were nice too. The Queen also portrays a powerful woman. Well, about the King ...at the brginning we might think that the King is a cruel person, but later understands that he is a softie. What else...hmm

572,susanitapinto,Worst Cinderella I've ever seen!,1,4 September 2021,"I'm a huge fan of Cinderella since I was a little girl! Growing up in Cabo Verde I think the majority of little girls there dreamed of being Cinderella, and hope for one day to leave poverty and to go to Europe or North America and live in a big castle (house) and find someone handsome who love us.Naturally I watched all the Cinderella movies I could find, since the 1914's Mary Pickford appearing magically in one of Pickford's dvds as a bonus feature, passing through the Disney's 1940's version, don't forgetting the ones stared by Julie Andrews, Ginger Rogers and Cheryl Smith. More recently I've seen the ""new wave"" of wonderful Cinderellas Brandy, Hilary Duff, Drew Barrymore, Selena Gomez, Lucy Hale and Lily James.So also as a huge fan of 5th Harmony and Camila naturally I couldn't wait to see this one. And regretfully in my opinion it was and awful movie.The writers tried to innovate so much it barely resembles the ""original"" stories everyone knows! It hugely miscast, and Camila is such a bad actress. Although I love her music videos.I thought Billy Porter lacked the ""magic"" to be the fabulous godmother and he's performance was almost as difficult to watch as the ones James Corden always gives to his roles. The prince is so blend I don't even recall he's name, and there's no chemistry there.The music was another blow to the movie there barely no original songs this gives a huge blow to the ""originality"" this musical tries to have and after all this is lost it turns out to be a mediocre musical.To end in a positive note to me the star of this movie was the already great Idina Menzel who gave her best and was superb as Vivian, but a great actress can't save a second rate movie.1 disappointed star * from me.",Cinderella

I'm not trying to be offensive, but the whole political agenda stuff just ruined it. I get that's the normal thing now, but come on. When I think of the whole classic, old times, original Cinderella movie this one was not even close. If there would have been some OG songs, instead of early 2000s that everyone knows, I think I would have liked it a little more. Usually when I think of princess, fantasy movies I instantly think of the sound track. Like when you think of The Little Mermaid, the song Under the Sea might come to mind. But even after watching this movie a hour or so ago I can't even remember any of the songs from it. Total disappointment. Don't waste your time or money on this.",Cinderella

577,outinritefield,Terrible acting and singing,1,4 September 2021,"I wanted to like this. It's bright and colorful. But the acting and singing are terrible. Idina Menzel and Billy Porter are the only ones that can actually sing. The auto-tune is on overdrive in this movie. The dialog tries to hard to be funny and 'normal.' Using already known songs works all the time, think Ella Enchanted, except the actors in this movie didn't do them justice. They left you wanting the original singers. Not to mention the lip synching is horrible; it looks like actors are doing bad karaoke to the movie's sound track as opposed to singing it themselves. Overall it's trying to hard to be something it can never be. Better casting and writing would have improved this tremendously.",Cinderella
578,mamahen18,Better than the others say,6,18 September 2021,"Is it going to win any awards? No. Is it as bad as other reviews make it out to be? Not even close. Yes, the dialogue is a little awkward at times and the acting can be stilted. There are moments where the mice/footmen are immature and just annoying. And there wasn't any point where I felt like this was real life, the way good movies can make you feel. I didn't get pulled into another world with the characters. So the acting isn't Oscar-worthy... but the story has been updated to encourage girls of today and the music is on point. I knew almost every lyric to almost every song and wanted to get up and dance and sing along with the characters. The costumes are a joy to look at and the story is a somewhat inspiring take on a classic. I personally thought that the performance of ""A Mighty Good Man"" at the ball was hilarious and the duet of Ed Sheeran's ""Perfect"" was sweet.So is it a great film for the ages? No, but it's a cute film to watch and have fun while watching!Note: There are a few moments through the film that if you're in a traditional Christian household you may have to explain to young children but it's not blatant and most will probably go over the head for many. But you may need to be prepared to answer questions about why the fairy godMOTHER is very clearly masculine.",Cinderella

583,solangeleichtle,"Beautiful costumes, nice story, bad choice of actors",5,3 September 2021,"The only characters I enjoyed watching were the step family and the prince. I liked the twist they gave the step mother and how she wasn't a total slave driver to Cinderella and more so treated her as a less favored daughter. Though I know she wasn't a total saint considering she was going to marry her off to someone she didn't like and she wouldn't even be married into someone with a rich title. The prince was very handsome and entertaining and I liked the twist they gave him and Cinderella in the end with the prince giving up his crown to be with Cinderella who instead of becoming a princess, achieved her dreams as a designer and gave the royal title to his sister. That being said, Camilla's acting was not suited for this role. I get this is her first acting role but all in all, this wasn't a good choice for her first acting experience. Her singing voice is too pop sounding and the way she portrayed the character was too modern day teenager for my taste. I have faith she can do other roles that are more suited for her type of style in singing and acting but this was not it. Also, it seems kind of insulting to purposely have Pierce Brosnan play a character who can't sing considering how apparently he can't sing in real life. I hope he wasn't offended by this. I also didn't like how they didn't stick to doing just original songs and did a bunch of covers of classic songs. Was very cringey to watch that. Then again, I kinda felt the same way about Mamma Mia so don't take my word for that. At least Cinderella did have their own songs as well. Also and I'm sorry to James Corden fans but why him? Why must he be in so many musical films? He was another one I was uncomfortable watching especially that scene where they all turned back into mice. That was beyond cringey. Like why was he the only one who briefly had a human head and a mouse body before completely turning back to a mouse? Why was that necessary? Honestly, if they stuck to original songs, had someone else play Cinderella, had someone else play James Corden's role and as others have described, have it be less girl power while men are treated like scum or belittled or humiliated I would've enjoyed this movie more.",Cinderella

587,MysteryGirl,AVOID this Scarytale,1,5 September 2021,"For those who still have Amazon Prime, or were planning on watching this new woke version of Cinderella...... save yourself the pain. I'd NEVER let my kids watch this trash. I love a great Cinderella story, and this is nothing close or has any vague resemblance to the fairytale. There is no real plot, and it's just a series of overdone musical numbers that go from one spectrum to another without continuity.It's a musical with all dialogue being sung. With headliners like Idina Menzel, and Camila Cabello, you'll recognize Minnie Driver as the Queen mother and Pierce Brosnan as the King. Every single one of them should be embarrassed by their performance. It's just painful. About 10 minutes in, I'd seen enough and began fast forwarding. Billy Porter plays the Fairy GODMOTHER decked out in an impressive golden glittered leotard and a full orange high shine satin ball gown coat dress. That costume is the real star and highlight of the movie. Pitiful if a costume outshines the entire movie. This is nothing but an affirmative action piece where every ethnicity, every color was listed and checked off. I think the only thing missing is a straight white male. The Prince is wearing hot pink lip gloss! Does Cinderella get her happy ending? Is the stepmother evil? This is the EVERYONE gets a trophy of wokeness, even if it bores you, the audience, to death. The acting is subpar, the musical numbers are a mismash that will hurt your ears, and the storyline is in no way related to the classic fairytale. If the object was to make the worst movie possible, then it was a success.Since it's included with your Prime subscription, it would be a crime to charge for this abomination.",Cinderella

The incessant, screaming, caterwauling that they hope to pass off as singing is ear-splittingingly headache inducing. I had to FFWD through the singing and there's at least one number that's far over auto-tuned.The story is obviously forced to fit someone's idea of a reflection of modern societal ideologies.

But the way to NOT get feminist points across is to make them totally oversaturated and put them in a terrible movie.Cringe does not begin to describe this. It's like the writers googled gen-z slang and tried to fit as much as they could into the script. I'm on board with modernizing Cinderella so that she has dreams and goals other than being saved by a handsome prince, but why try to make the stepmother likeable? You can be pro-women and still understand that there are some bad ones.I gave it three stars because I don't think it's the worst movie ever made and it MIGHT be enjoyable for kids. It had some good songs, albeit they were ruined by the actors singing them (don't cover Queen, kid).There seems to be a shockingly high number of 10 ratings on this.

The modern slang terminology as when the stepsisters talk behind their mother's back referring to ""that's how old people say pop it"" for example, is not only addressing our children as idiots who need to be spoken to slowly, but also teaching them to be rude and disrespectful to their elders and parents alike. That parents are idiots to be laughed at, and dismissed. It's a theme the prince, the stepsisters, everyone of the younger generation going around rolling eyes at their elders and insulting them.Language, bad role modeling, disrespecting, drunken hunting stories aside from the main characters, the lip syncing to old pop staples is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen.Cinderella for some reason has shells braided into her hair, and the wrapped loose leather belt of her ragged dress, she looks like a pirate!

As if the classic, animated Cinderella film and the modernized ""Cinderella Story"" movies were not enough (among other versions of the tale). Here we have yet another one, and it's definitely not as good as the 1997 musical with Brandy.They could have made a modern, general musical with an original and beloved plot and familiar songs but nope. I think the only scenes that made me chuckle even a bit were the ones involving the mice post-magic.

In fact, Idina Menzel put Madonna to shame, imho.Yes, this is campy, but it is a retelling of a fairy tale, so of course it is cheesy etc. The costumes and choreography are great, Camila does a great job, and yes, a great message to girls and women today. My actual rating is probably more of a 6.5, and I consider myself a conservative rater.

I don't usually mind Camilla Cabello but her singing was just loud and kind of un-melodic if that's a thing. It's great to try to make some of the silly princess stories into something better for girls to be inspired by but throwing everything at the wall and not even waiting to see what sticks seems to be what the makers of this movie did.

Also the casting was awful as well. The prince had zilch likeability and no chemistry with our ""progressive"" hero(ine). The bizarre choice of British ""comedians"" in support roles were also baffling and extremely annoying throughout. I can only guess that their management team had something to do with the production or weird blackmail photos of the director somewhere hidden in a vault. They added absolutely no comedic value to the film but plenty cringe factor. Again quality control. James Corden used to be a good, up and coming actor/writer but now whenever you see his name anywhere near a film cast you think his inclusion is only due to his recognition factor.

Enjoyed the songs but the acting was horrendous and stale. The script was so poor. I agree with another review that James needs to stop doing movies. I only gave this movie a star because of the singing. I feel sorry for Pierce and Minnie having agreeing to do this movie, they are too good of actors to waste their talents on this.stinker.",Cinderella

If anything, it's a bridge to have interesting conversations with younglings.",Cinderella
673,yhumwkazim,Overall amazing,10,3 September 2021,"As a mother of young girls, this is the kind of fairytale I would love my girls to watch. It's so much fun to watch, cast are wonderful, the song choices are excellent and overall well executed. I would totally recommend, I have watched it twice with my girls today which surprisingly the reason for them to keep their iPhones away, and i love how they react to the movie and sang with it and before I forget the lead Camila is phenomenal, Billy is such a fabulous godmother, Idina with her powerful voice, nick could sing wow and the rest are again amazing. Bravo an excellent Cinderella of this generation!!!",Cinderella
674,rachellorde,This new Cinderella may be my favorite movie this year. Thoroughly enjoyed it.,10,3 September 2021,"I watched the movie with my two young daughters and I was indeed very impressed. I knew my daughters will love it, and they did. But I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film. It was captivating from the first scene to the last. For this being her movie debut, Camila Cabello did a phenomenal job as Cinderella. For me, she stole all the scenes she was in. I believed in the love story, she has great chemistry with the actor playing prince Robert (Nicholas Galitzine). And of course, Idina, Minnie and Pierce were all in their element. In fact, the entire cast and all the backup dancers where fantastic. I really appreciated director Kay Cannon's fresh take on the story, giving each character depth and bringing the values of this classic tale into the current times. Cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. Likely to watch it again as my daughters will want to see it many times over.",Cinderella
675,rachellorde,This movie is pure joy. Highly recommended.,10,3 September 2021,"The mixed reviews had me worried but this movie is pure joy. I did not expect to like it as much as I did. Brilliant cast all around. Camila Cabello really impressed as Cinderella, this role fit her perfectly as she seems to have great comedic timing & presence as an actress in addition to her great vocals and stunning looks. Between the storyline that's much more interesting than previous versions of this classic tale, the music, dancing and jokes, I didn't want it to end. I'll be watching again, this is a must see in my opinion. Well done to everyone involved.",Cinderella

I saw the reviews on here and cringed a bit, then I looked at the critic reviews and saw the AV Club gave it a good review and I knew it would be alright. The movie is a lot of fun. The messages are good and they incorporated a lot of modern songs into the situations which was neat. By the end of the movie both of my children we singing and dancing. If you want the Cinderella of the past go watch that, if you're open to a new interpretation give it a try.",Cinderella

More like the total opposite.The singing, the acting, the whole frigging set-up, like... what? I can't. I just can't. Call me old-fashioned, but some things aren't meant to be turned into something that ""fits"" the 21 century. The fairy godmother is a man? A man?! Nope. Just... nope. Ugh. I'm out.",Cinderella

682,daveroberson,"If your looking for a ""classic"" remake - you will not find it here.",10,6 September 2021,"After watching the film twice, then reexamining the reviews from the critics and IMDB users, here's my take on this brilliantly updated story.As mentioned in the title of my review, if your looking for a classic Cinderella story remake - this is NOT the film for you! If your a fan of other takes on the classic story - say Ella Enchanted mixed with a little Ever After story line with a completely diverse cast, the read on.From the starting point introducing us to the movie - I was thrilled at the throwback for Jackson's Rhythm Nation. Perfect description that often gets overlooked in other films where characters of the time period are in fact part of the same daily rhythms, routines and traditions.Tying in Queen's - Somebody To Love was an awesome nod to Ella Enchanted but this time it's how we come to meet our prince and his struggles.For those who do not get why Pierce Brosnan is singing, you either have not watched Mama Mia or are severely late to the ball on this one. Minnie Driver's perfectly timed quip says it all.I loved seeing a somewhat softer version of the evil stepmother played by Indina Menzel and wools have loved to see more of her story - but for this film it was enough.I also LOVED Billy Porter's entrance and introduction and agree with some critics he along with Driver were completely underused.Overall - I still give this a 10 for the music, imagination and casting. Camilla Cabello was pure joy to watch in the title role.",Cinderella
683,jchacn,An expensive cliche,2,10 September 2021,"This is how a group of businessmen see society and try to make the best selling product. They are based on numbers, not in art. More money, less message.",Cinderella
684,miscot-36622,Don't understand the hate,7,6 September 2021,"I don't really understand the hate...actually I do. I've noticed that the more modernized or ""woke"" something is, the more haters flock to bring down the rating.This movie surprised me. I thought I wouldn't like it, but I found it very cute. I think it was nice to see a version where the prince didn't save Cinderella, she didn't want to go get married and be done with it, she had goals and dreams. She could have chosen the prince and been free from the stepmother as it usually goes, but she couldn't give up her dreams for him. It's important for kids to see both versions, the original and one where they can see there is another option.Stepping away from the feminist aspect, I think this movie was fun. Camilla's acting was much better than I expected, Billy Porter was fabulous as the Fairy Godmother, and the modern music was a fun spin. I don't think it deserves the hate it's getting. Is it a perfect film? No. Is it worth one star and hate? Also no.Watch this movie and decide for yourself. I think kids will enjoy it and you will too.",Cinderella
685,jhpvyzb,Just bad,2,8 November 2021,Considering the story had already been written and is successful I wonder how you manage to make a film this bad. I suppose it has Corden in it which explains a lot as the guy is pretty terrible in most things he does.,Cinderella
686,traderhman,Cinderella Trainwreck,1,4 September 2021,"This was not Cinderella, which is fine, but give it another title.The music was all over the place and I had to fast forward through a lot of it. The genres just didn't fit together. Maybe an original soundtrack would have helped.I think Camila Cabello is an OK singer, but seriously, she needs to learn when to dial it down and not over sing every song. Too many runs and Wo-ohs. It did not sound good. Actually, I liked her more when she was not singing. That goes for all the actors. Normally, I like a good mix of music and dialog, but was fast forwarding through most of the singing after the first 20 minutes. It was on the painful side of things.Peirce Brosnan and Minnie Driver were actually pretty good, but overall the character development was so poor, it was hard to like or care about anyone.Billy Porter could have pulled off a flamboyant Fairy Godfather if they would have let it go that way instead of forcing it with a dress and God""Mother"". I know that is his trademark schtick, wearing dresses, but it just got in the way.If you want to convey a message in a movie, it should be subtle so the viewer can ascertain their own meaning and message. This was 100% Wokeness force fed the viewer. Just stop. You are not changing anyone's mind and sacrificing quality entertainment for your own agenda. Sometimes a story is just a story. Let it be itself.Lastly, I don't get the ending. Without giving anything away, Ella didn't achieve any of her goals. She sacrificed one outcome for one that is actually of lesser value, lesser benefit, lesser power. She didn't get her dream, although, they tried to intimate that was the conclusion, but it wasn't. She could have chosen the other path and still done everything she is going to do in the path she did choose. Think about it.",Cinderella

688,kushagra-79548,Ummm.... OKAY?,5,4 September 2021,"Remaking a Disney movie, let alone a princess tale, is an extremely difficult job to do, due to enormous, well knowledgeable and familiar fan base, spanning across generations and ages. You have to have it perfect, or else, the world never forgives it. Regardless to say, This movie was strange. A mix of flavours if I can frame it properly. Yes, the final message that love will save the day was loud and clear. Finally, as all Cinderella stories should be, she finally ""had it all"". The film tried to include all factors of the classic in it, but that's all it could do - try. The soundtrack is different, was not expecting that, but gorgeous and melodious nonetheless. A refreshing, new look at the story, but did we need that with such a star studded cast, who could have done wonders reiterating the story as it is. I really wanted to see the classic tale told as it is, properly in live action, seeing the cast.Still processing what I saw. U should see it too.Byee.",Cinderella
689,ryanmccarthy-87095,Fabulously Fun! (I think some of the bad reviews are fake),8,8 September 2021,"Either the reviews saying this is the worst movie in history are fake, or they're giving it 1-2 stars because they're, to quote Top Gun in context, ""abused children.""I am usually a harsh critic of new films, but I found Prime Video's 'Cinderella' starring Camila Cabello and Pierce Brosnan absolutely fun, intelligent, and overall fabulous. Camila has some serious acting chops and better comedic timing than most up and coming ""stars."" I look forward to her future work.Those who write reviews that claim the film swims on ""woke"" waves and feminism give me serious Incel vibes. It's not drowning in wokeism, but to designate it as such clearly shows that there are uneducated people who don't think that a Queen and a Princess didn't want to put up with misogynistic bs- and this film (sadly) attributes only about 120 seconds of the Queen and Princess telling the King he can be kind of a dick. And ""Ella"" is still after finding the ""one.""The soundtrack is a mix of originals and modern pop songs, taking a note from Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! Props to fitting Seven Nation Army into the royal ball scene. And I have to note the script has a healthy serving of clever and well delivered wit.Pour a drink and go enjoy yourselves.

693,milliemouse-16370,Could've been something Good,4,8 September 2021,"I only watched his movie because of the bad reviews it was given. Before passing final judgement I decided to watch for myself. And yikes.The music was the biggest put off for this movie. I wish they would've done original songs instead of putting old hits into terrible renditions. Ella did not have a fantastic singing voice, and I was shocked to learn she was the singer of the song ""Havana"". She had nowhere near the same level of singing or passion. Everyone had a mediocre voice in general.The story left much to be desired, I don't understand why she couldn't be a princess as well as a dress designer. What is the downside?? The prince needed way more development on why he absolutely hated his cozy life where he could drink and hunt all day. Seems unbelievable he'd give up the crown. Also they made his sister so annoying it didn't make any impact that she was given the thrown over him.The acting was either exaggerated or fell flat depending on the character. Honestly my favorite part is the Fairy Godmother. He was lively, the outfit fun, and I think it was an interesting change from the original. Especially the fact that he was a butterfly Ella saved.I get this movie was trying to be progressive or woke or whatever, but I wish there was overall more effort into making it a GOOD MOVIE. Could've been a hit, I loved the diverse cast and that Ella had personal goals. But the prince just giving up his position feels wrong too. They could've had them balance each other our like he learned work ethic from her and she could learn to relax while having a successful business whole being a princess. Not the worst adaptation of Cinderella I've seen (there's like a hundred by now) but leaves much to be desired.",Cinderella

There are some weird choices and feminist messaging is sometimes too heavy handed. But overall, this movie is actually enjoyable.Sometimes I had a feeling that everyone in this movie is an idiot. It's really stupid comedy movie with really good musical performances and dancing choreography.James Corden is in this movie so that's always a con for a movie. But good side of things is that he is present for couple of scenes only.Really huge problem of this movie is ""messaging"". You are watching really dumb comedy movie, and all of a sudden SLAM - women deserve better - and then we are back to watching stupid comedy movie.

I'm not a writer by any means but I feel as though certain characters could've been written differently (closer to the original) as the actors selected would've definitely lived up to these roles.What redeemed this movie for me was the cast, the music, the dancing and the vocals.

You want a guilty pleasure and this, in my humble opinion, delivers.It is a campy, visually glorious, ridiculous romp. There are some marvellous vocal and dramatic moments. Special mention to Minnie Driver. And an even bigger shout out to Pearce B for terrifying us for the entire time that he will sing at any point (I won't ruin it for you). The movie addresses some great plot discrepancies in the original fairy tale which I really enjoyed.Do what you actually want to do.

The acting is like you expect it in a theatre and on purpose.You should NOT watch this, if you expect a ""classic"" Cinderalla story and by Classic I do not mean the original stories from respectively the 17th and 18th century as TV has changed the original stories up quite a bit, starting with the name of the main character.

And why would you let someone else get the role of Shawn Mendes, great effort was put into this, but wasted on horrible storywriting and acting that could have been done a lot better by far.Well at least, I could say the mice were great, the prince did somewhat of a good job, the king did his role, however, the movie already started with a badly played out beginning.I almost questioned myself the plot/objective that this movie aims for somewhere in the middle when she denies wanting to be with the prince.I don't wish to recall any much more of this movie. Waste of budget.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. In fact, if you haven't watched this movie, don't, because you'll regret almost every moment of it.And why is this 4 stars, it should be fortunate enough to receive that amount of star ratings.",Cinderella

The movie overall was very entertaining, I grinned most of the way through. The music matched the scenes well and had great renditions of the song covers. This was a fun reimagining and didn't take itself seriously enough to make any theme too heavy. I really don't understand all the hate this movie is getting, it's by far my favorite Cinderella story. Also I love Idina Menzel that woman can sing, I don't know who the fabulous godmother was but he had a fantastic voice as well. If you like musicals you'll like this.",Cinderella

It's a very good message in the age of #metoo and women's empowerment. Plus, it's got a pretty good soundtrack. It won't win any Oscars but it's a fun watch for the family.

It displayed a lot of culture and there was a theme of women empowerment. I loved the diversity of the characters and music. I feel that those who don't like any of those things or change, are making it their mission to lower the rating as much as they can by rating the movie a ""1."" I've seen this trend lately over the last few years various films that had too many black and brown people in it.

769,Sylvia-DreamWeaverFilms,I Enjoyed It Enough to watch Twice!,7,6 October 2021,"I'm generally not a fan of adulterating someone else's story. ""Write your own story"", I say. I wish when filmmakers give someone else's popular story a completely new twist...they would do the same to the film's title. ""Cinderbella"" or ""Cindersella"". This would give people a heads-up that the story has been tampered with...and then they would be less likely to get such negative reactions from the audience... and it's more respectful to the original creator.That said, I still really enjoyed this movie. This film is feisty, humorous and creative. (Though there were some issues). The story is definitely more empowering to girls than the original story. The set design and costumes make it fun and visually stunning.The casting was good. Loved all of the actors in their parts. Both Camilla Cabello and Nicholas Galitzine, individually, have tons of charisma, charm and talent. Their match-up is fine, but there simply isn't that off the charts chemistry between them, which would have made the film even more magical.Felt there was an inappropriate shout out by a group of women vying for the prince's attention at the ball, in a film also meant for children, among a few other things. But otherwise, a family film that older kids adults would love.It is a pet peeve of mine, as a parent, when adult content is thoughtlessly thrown into a film parents would think to take their kids to. It's ignorant and selfish to think it doesn't matter. In this information laden world where kids are already inundated with way to much to soon, we need films that safely just let kids be kids for a while. It's one of the biggest complaints parents had regarding this film, and it's one of the reasons for docking stars here. Parents are tired of it.So, now speaking strictly to the adults, this a comedy...so more light-weight. There are some good laughs. The pace is a little dizzying, but still, I enjoyed it for myself. It was a fun film to watch.",Cinderella

It isnt a classic.Fans of Miss Cabello are going to love this and her acting was OK. She hammed up the role just enough.There were definitely some miscast roles, but all the actors played this a little tongue in cheek.This was a live action version of all of the recent animated movies acting as a vehicle for a pop soundtrack.The writer and the director could have made a much better movie by focussing on some of the other characters like Princess Gwen.",Cinderella

But the FX seemed quite basic and cheap compared to today's standards.We don't need any more ""James Corden being James Corden"" roles.Great actors and performers, yet the script holds them back from developing better characters.Overall...it had some great hits and some dreadful misses.",Cinderella

My oldest, who is critical of most movies sat through it and even laughed at bits.Is it going to win film of the year? No way. But it was good for what it was. I don't understand all the 1 star reviews because I've seen much worse films than this. I don't know what people were expecting?I enjoyed the music overall, though some arrangements were odd trying to make the songs fit the scenes. It definitely feels like someone's dream project come to life.My main issue was the costumes- some characters were dressed in baroque french style, others modern. How did Ella afford all the fabric to have 4 dresses in her basement? Ella's designs were boring (a pink and brown dress?) and all the same (one shoulder) and her fabulous ball gown was not flattering.The prince was in drab outfits and didn't stand out. He wore black a lot, which I didn't understand because most of the costumes were extremely colorful.Anyway, you could pick apart lots about this movie, but it WAS enjoyable.

The songs, both old and new, were pleasantly surprising as well was the entertaining choreography. Idina Menzel singing ""Material Girl"" and the Prince singing ""Somebody to Love"" as well as the other ""old' and new songs were not expected, but were entertaining and appropriate.

For people who believe that happiness and joy are an essential part of life, and even paramount. For those who hold and strive for friendliness, kindness and courtesy in relationships. For people who know that love has different manifestations and it is important to combine all of them to be satisfied. People who have imagination and insight, combined with serenity and ease. The film is intended for those who are children either by age or by soul, and continue to carry a piece of children's cheerfulness in themselves, regardless of their age.",Cinderella

It's a different view, a different telling, a different story with, what just happens to be, characters from another story and somewhat similar plot.This movie stands on its own.

813,emmahumphreys,Pitch Perfect meets the spirit of British Pantomime - Wonderful,9,3 September 2021,With a British cast and filmed in Britain it's fantastic that a strong British humour comes though and that it has the authenticity of the fairy godmother being played by a man.This is for older children who have started to see the world and are seeing that the world isn't quite like a fairy tale but instead is rich and interesting.,Cinderella

People need to chill their ire and channel it somewhere far more deserving than a mad and silly romp like this. This is fun and stupid and brash and as bright as a rainbow unicorn strapped to a floodlight. Kids loved it. Yes, it is clunky in places but it also has clever and funny moments and clearly has no intention of being taken seriously. Lots of good songs, lots of good singers (and Pierce Brosnan).",Cinderella

818,evannaar,It's okay - nothing great,6,3 September 2021,"The 2021 reimagining of Cinderella is very, well, 2021. I appreciated the new direction that the creative team was trying to go - casting a male (Billy Porter) in an iconic female role, having a lot of depth to the King & Queen's story (Brosnan and Driver respectively) and having Ella (Cabello) maintain a desire to run her own business - but there were a lot of issues with the film as a whole.To begin, there were only (I think) 2 original tunes. The rest of the movie is a jukebox musical and while this works at times, sometimes it doesn't. The opening ""Rhythm Nation"" and ""Am I Wrong"" scenes come to mind. I think that Menzel's rendition of ""Material Girl"" and Porter's ""Shining Star"" were fitting, however.As you will probably read in a lot of reviews on IMDb, the film pushes a strong feminist message and it worked relatively well. However, I can't help but think the film was trying to be too ""cool,"" which dampened the message that was trying to be conveyed.Overall, Menzel stole the spotlight and Cabello's awkward rendition of Ella gave me a few laughs - at the very least she was relatable. The film has its weakness (for the love of everything holy please stop casting James Corden in these roles) but was a fun watch. I don't think I will ever watch it again, but it's worth the 2 hours to watch once, and only once.Verdict: 6/10.",Cinderella

823,Court-Court,GirlBoss done wrong,4,8 September 2021,"Sadly, the story left nothing to be desired. The only thing I could say I enjoyed about the movie was the song selection. That being said, they sung entirely too much with each song having to fit the scenes. The prince felt idiotic and lazy. The princess didn't know how or when to bring up her political ideals and thoughts about how to improve the kingdom. This felt rushed and it depended on the audience loving the story of Cinderella. I didn't feel much of any chemistry between him and Ella. Maybe we weren't supposed to? I think the main problem with this movie is that they paint the world overly mysogynistic. The message was cliche "" follow your dreams"".... Might as well bring back the ""toothsome"" farm boy. Having one of the sisters falling in love with that guy would've been a better story. The costume design sucked too and they never changed Ellas hair. She honestly looked the worst out of the people who showed up to the ball. Cheesy acting as well.",Cinderella

It's not your typical girl follows prince. It's about time our children see these dynamics in film. Girls do not need a hero, they need to believe in themselves and chase their passions. Camila Cabello is also super adorable too. From my 4-year-old niece to my 35-year-old sister, we all loved it.",Cinderella

Virtually every other vocalist outsung Camilla - the main character. It was almost as though they tried to make her seem pitchy and shrill during her solo numbers, and the excessive use of auto tune on other songs was off putting as well.A million cliches and woke tropes got shoved into this movie, including a gay man being labeled a fairy. The awkward mashups of songs that quite frankly made no sense in the movie and the terrible arrangements didn't help either. Even the star power of Idina Mendel couldn't save this tragedy. They tried. They failed.",Cinderella

2 more modernized
3 the audio was offIf people can just get past the political crap. Such a entitled selfish rating tbh.Honestly, we loved the movie. It was different. It was fun, a bit funny. It was certainly a different twist of the Cinderella story. I was dancing to part of the movie, singing along to a couple of the songs. If i critique anything, the audio was a bit off. It went from soft spoken to loud singing pretty quick. Other than that. People are just looking for reasons to hate this film it feels like. Everyone is just really hard on this movie and i feel like they miss out. I loved the casting. I enjoyed the songs.

This is a movie that you can't watch seriously, it's so obvious it is from the director of pitch perfect, the movie gave me that vibe.It's a totally different version of what we've seen of Cinderella and that's what I liked. Imagine if it was the same whole story, why would you watch it? It wouldn't make sense, so I appreciate that they put a twist on the story. And make it to empower women not like an old fairy tale.I'm not going to say it's perfect, with a perfect screenplay that deserves an Oscar or the best musical of all time because you have to keep on mind that it was also created for children specifically BUT DO NOT BELIEVE TROLLS. I don't know why people insist on despising the movie. Or it is because is Camila Cabello (who was incredible in the movie btw) or because the story is very inclusive (yes, those comments are very racist, xenophobic and homophobic wtf people we are in the 21st century we must grow as persons and stop having closed mind) or because of James Corden (who appears less than 10 minutes in the film lol)
All this is not valid to despise the film because then it is not an honest critic of what the film really is.If you don't like this movie, you probably have a bitter soul. The objective of the film is to make you sing, laugh and even reflect on how women are silenced in society.Also apparently it is Camila Cabello's debut as an actress and I can say that it was incredible, she is a super talented person and she will make you laugh in the movie. The truth is I love that girls can see her as a princess because she seriously gives them a super important message such as following their dreams and to not care what others say.",Cinderella

871,lukas-32648,Fun and entertaining,9,3 September 2021,Musicals are not my preferred kind of movies. But because of the low ratings I was curious what's behind this.This movie is entertaining and full of modern songs and interpretations. It takes itself not that serious and this is why it worked for me.I think the low ratings are mostly from traditionalists who expect the ninety-second filming of the usual cinderella story. Their disappointment about this modern version results in one and two stars ratings.I recommend this movie to all open minded persons. It is like a breath of fresh air compared to other interpretations of this subject.,Cinderella

It was sweet, light and good listening. I normally don't like musical movies as they can be so over done, but this was easy listening, beautiful voices and a new take on the songs.The plot line was altered and worth a remake. I liked the fact we are seeing something different made which draws attention to the way things were in history, where women didn't have their own voice. While also drawing attention to historically how duty was more important than happiness.I loved the fact that the step mother and daughters weren't evil. They were just trying to do what they thought was right. The evil step mother has been so overdone. It was such a nice refreshing take, to see reason behind the actions.It's not a masterpiece, but it's worth watching while spacing out of real life for awhile.Highly suggest people ignore the reviews and make up their own minds. If you like pop music, chick flicks/ teen movies and/ or light comedy, you'll probably enjoy this.",Cinderella

The Prince go out of his way to go and find Ella and Ella follows her dream not matter what that is impressively beautiful to see. Also the fact that the queen and princess where included in this version of the story which is one of the million reasons that this movie is different from the typical cinderlla story. This movie is Original and funny ,unique and inspiring and also there is ni somehow deffend the cause of the women. So this movie deserve at least a 8.5/10.",Cinderella

881,banafshehbts,CHANGE is required if IMPROVEMENT is what we want,10,11 October 2021,"Loved it. I always didn't even like the ""traditional"" cindrella story. The traditional cinderella was realy useless just had a nice face and uselessly nice behaviour. It had that, for no good reason (maybe jealousy), cruel step mother and that useless prince who fell for cinderella's ""face"". But you know, you need to ""CHANGE"" in order to improve. Yes, they changed the original story, but IMPROVED it a lot. The ella here has a dream, works hard to achieve that, thinks rationally and is independent. The prince here also has a mind of his own and fell for ella's chararcter not just her FACE you know. Other characters were also nice. The step mother had a REASON for her actions. Absoloutly enjoyable and great casting. Great vocals. Loved them all.",Cinderella

888,byrondeanakugak,Sike.,3,8 October 2021,Like a lot of Hollywood movies these days. The only selling point is the diversity factor. Hard to really pretend to care if you're not living in western countries and unrelatable in all aspects compared to previous Cinderella adaptations.,Cinderella

Excellent singing, fantastic acting, and beautiful sets! Exactly as it should be in order to be relevant to modern times, reflect our current culture, modern music/stars, and be an updated version of a classic story. If we retold the same exact stories with the same white characters, nothing would change and it would be boring. The people hating on this movie need to get their heads out of their rear ends and get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Nothing good in life ever came from being comfortable. Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.",Cinderella

892,toerkfitz,Love this movie!,9,16 September 2021,"Firstly, those who were looking for a real life version of the cartoon...go watch the several other movies that do just that. Quit hating on this one just because it doesn't really follow the cartoon version and that it's a MODERN take on it.There are a few things that kind of bothered me...
The royal family mostly had accents, but everyone else didn't. And they didn't really explain why this was...Some of the songs really didn't fit in to the scene they were placed.I thought there was going to be more original songs, so slightly disappointed by that.Some of the actors, great acting....but ah they shouldn't be singing.Oh...and this definitely should NOT be labeled under the ""family"" section. This is definitely more fitted for teens, young adults and older...not young kiddos.Also...I agree with the name shouldn't be titled just Cinderella...it should have been like Cinderella: One In A Million or Cinderella: Dreams Come True...something other than just Cinderella.Other than that...
I love love love the MODERN take on it, especially how the whole ""Hey I just met you, but let's get married"" concept was changed. That doesn't happen in real life and it's refreshing to see on screen what actually does/can happen. She wants to follow her dreams to be a seamstress and GASP! He follows her instead of becoming king. His sister then becomes Queen, which let's be honest that was the better choice.",Cinderella
893,DrJables,So adorable and I love the new take on it,10,6 September 2021,"I was waiting anxiously for this film. I don't usually like musicals. But the musical parts were actually cute and fun. People rating this 1/10 because it is a ""woke"" version or showing some type of ""political correctness"" are just mad that there is diversity in this film (which is weird). Camila Cabello sings reallllllly good. The million to one song is on repeat on my phone. It was such an inspiring wholesome movie. I love movies like this :)",Cinderella
894,samanthalynn-68084,Amazing !!,10,5 September 2021,"I don't usually do this and when I looked at the one star reviews I was shocked ! Out of all the Cinderella's this one was by far my favorite ! It was modern, hilarious and so cute ! If you don't like singing movies then ya you probably won't like it but I love the singing and dancing . The natural comedy it had was amazing ! I don't think it pushed political agenda . We are in 2021 people ! Women can be leaders and have their own businesses ! Kings aren't it anymore ! Lol anyway I thought it was awesome !",Cinderella
895,julieadupont,Pretty and ridiculous,4,4 September 2021,"Is this movie a hot mess of silly? Yes. It's ridiculous, but kind of cute if you have a few hours to waste. You have to let go of thinking this is a ""period"" movie. Although it's sent in a ""past-like"" setting, the clothing, body jewellery, and language is all over the place. The music is sometimes fun, sometimes cringe-inducing. You have to just take it for what it is and not over analyze.Kudos to the costume designers for the ball scene; I wanted to pause every 2 seconds to admire the dresses.4/10 for nice costumes and mild entertainment value.",Cinderella
896,loweryeric,A fun movie made in the right time.,8,11 September 2021,"This is a fun movie with endearing characters, entertaining music and dance numbers, and is beyond timely. The actors and the acting carry the fantasy of the story. The 1 star raters are clearly maladjusted malcontents who prefer a world in which women are mindless, passionless, and subservient to men. The original messaging of the story of Cinderella is out dated and wrong and if you believe that messaging shouldn't change then you are as outdated and regressive as the story.",Cinderella
897,birolercanli,Originality not found,1,7 September 2021,I understand the message the film is trying to give however unfortunate the language would be. But if you want to deliver a message deliver it with a novel piece of work. Don't go ahead and rape a classic tale. You could have created a new tale and it wouldn't be half as disturbing for people.,Cinderella
898,meghubley,Embrace the Cringe,9,20 September 2021,"Ok, is it really a 9? No, but I had to offset all the negative reviews. C'mon people, this movie is cute! I mean, what were you expecting? It's a little cringey, yes, but it's also adorable, and highly watchable with my 9 year old daughter who loves music and dancing. Leave your attitude at the door and just sit back and enbrace the cringe.",Cinderella
899,viganocamilla,Not as cringe as I feared + Idina is the bloody best,10,3 September 2021,"Actually pretty fun. Idina Menzel's vocal performances and acting are amazing, she really is the sole star of the movie.I liked how every character got a little bit time to shine, even random guards or citizens.In the end, the movie is more fun than cringe (as I initially feared).I give it an 8 cause it's a nice movie to watch to shut your head off and enjoy some music.Can't stress enough how much I enjoyed IDINA fricking MENZEL in this one, I'd give it a 10 only cause of her.",Cinderella

The music went well with the scenes, there was alot of funny moments, there was an incredible moral behind this story, they kept alot of the original Cinderella storyline and added a modern twist!! The fact that this movie was about woman empowerment alone it should get great reviews especially right now!!! The only negetive in my personal opinion this movie has is the singing sounded off key with Cinderella only on some scenes, overall people need to stop being so negetive the movie wasnt bad at all...",Cinderella
904,AbbieMargaret,It was different,8,19 September 2021,"I think that the film is quite good - it's definitely a different take on the original Cinderella story, and I enjoyed the comedy element. There are some subtle quips in there that made me chuckle with there comparisons to what has and hasn't changed in todays society.It was a bit difficult to believe the Prince suddenly did a sudden change around of personality in such a short period of time, but again, this is trying to portray a fairy tale style of writing in a comedic way.There's a lot of reviews here which put the film in a bad light, but I think you need to watch and make your own opinion. To be honest, after a terrible week I've had, this film mostly made me chuckle and sing along to some of the more upbeat songs I knew.I admit, the Fairy godparent, played by Billy Porter - definitely stole the show in my eyes. I wish there were more scenes with him in, or more songs. I loved his entrance, outfit and his voice was phenomenal! - he brought a lot of character into the film in just those 10 minutes.Camila Cabello - her voice, while not the soft voice linked with most typical princesses in the stories, carried a certain spirit that brought life to the character Ella, which worked well with her determined, aspiring personality that was being portrayed.I think Cabello, whilst not known for any acting in her career, really did well in this film. I certainly laughed at some of her comedic quips that she pulled off.I also appreciate the dynamic and character development with Ella and the step-mother, this version was definitely more believable in my eyes.My overall review is it has its good and bad parts, as many films do - but it was worth the watch, though I now have a few songs stuck in my head.",Cinderella
905,marwantarek-56924,awful stuff,1,10 September 2021,Give me my money back this is a disaster and the worst movie ever.,Cinderella
906,meawishali-57741,Irritating,3,4 September 2021,"For me personally this was one of the more terrible version of Cinderella which is a shame as it's alway been one of my favourite childhood movies. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because 1. The fairy God Mother, 2. The Three Mice, 3. The guy the kept singing the announcements ( his was the only singing I enjoyed) other than that I felt thoroughly irritated throughout the movie, a very awkward watch. Definitely would not watch again.",Cinderella
907,Dominique_beauty,"I Loved, Loved, Loved this movie",10,4 September 2021,"This was an amazing new twist to the Cinderella story. Although I love all of the other versions, this has become my favorite one. The music, the humor, the real feelings the characters felt and spoke on! Love love love. And. Billy Porter was amazing and looked fabulous!!!!Well written and put together, for a time right now when laughing and joy is sooooo needed! This was a great breath of fresh air.",Cinderella
908,explorer-8272,Modern musical retelling falls flat,4,4 September 2021,"This version of Cinderella is a modern musical retelling that's most similar to The Greatest Showman or Moulin Rouge in style.Movie-goers expecting a classic fairytale will be disappointed, as will those who are overly sensitive to moves with girl-power themes who may feel offended.Viewers who don't mind either will find an enjoyable family film that doesn't take itself too seriously, but one that's unlikely to be too memorable.",Cinderella
909,madeleinehperry,I really didn't hate it!,7,17 September 2021,"Started watching this expecting to have to turn it off after 10 minutes but I actually had fun. Don't get me wrong, there were a LOT of cons (the dialogue, acting and singing were all incredibly poor and the leads had absolutely no chemistry) but it was a fun watch that didn't take itself seriously which allowed me to enjoy it. The girlboss message is heavy-handed but it's genuinely also refreshing to see. Also the amount of men getting very upset over this movie adds at least 2 stars to my rating we love to see it <3.",Cinderella
910,desislavageorgieva-77989,Calm Down!!!,10,3 September 2021,"It seems people are getting mad at this movie because ""it doesn't feel like the classic fairytale"". Well...that was the whole point of it. To not feel like the classic fairytale but to rewrite it in a new way. That doesn't mean there's not a message worth spreading.This is Camila Cabello's acting debut and her performance was outstanding.The soundtrack was amazing and I truly believe ""Million to one"" is a song capable of making you cry.Also, can I ask why people think a movie musical is bad just because James Corden is in it? He is playing a mouse. Just a mouse. He barely has lines. What's your problem?And yes, the fairy godmother is a man, so? What's so wrong with that?May I remind you there are dozens of adaptations of Cinderella. Yet you still want the exact same scenario.",Cinderella
911,lalacampu,A quite lovely musical,10,4 September 2021,"I don't know why it has a low rating when I found it a the same level as ""Beauty and the beast"".SPOILER
I really liked the modern messages (feminist) it spreads changing a bit the original story like Ella choosing her life work before being a princess and hil leaving the crown to his sister in order to fight for her love. Also I think every song fits perfectly with its situation (like ""Perfect"" in the dance) expressing what they think. Camila has surprised me and I found Pierce Brosman acting funny too:)",Cinderella
912,julietan,Want to love it but poor execution,2,5 September 2021,The concept and intentions were good. The art direction and costumes were beautiful but the acting and script is painful and the musical numbers sound like someone accidentally sync'd the movie to the unmixed tracks. The whole movie feels like the director strew a bunch of YouTube & TikTok gag videos together and called it a movie.It's like they tried to make a Lin Manuel movie meets Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist by dropping choreographed pop song numbers into the storytelling except they phoned in all the dance and musical numbers. This makes Cats seem like a masterpiece.,Cinderella
913,educationldr,Maybe under a different title...,7,9 September 2021,"The movie is a musical so for those who do not like musicals this is definitely not a movie to watch. However, this version of Cinderella is not the traditional prince who comes to save Cinderella version...this is an independent Cinderella who wants to save herself and make her own dreams comes true. Given a different title to heed the changes, I think people would be more open to the story. I raised two independent daughters and now a granddaughter who need to know they have to save themselves.",Cinderella
914,moonjosh-52951,I don't even know what to say,10,7 September 2021,"Regardless of the fact that there is a bunch of different remakes of Cinderella this is the only one that shows character development, and character personality, and that you don't need a prince or in modern terms a man to give you meaning and life. It's one of the very best remake of the film just for that reason. This shouldn't be compared to Disney, they don't own the movie. The story of this one should be remembered and honestly should be shown to the newer generations.",Cinderella

Should be illegal to do that to a Queen song.,Cinderella
917,kellis-07920,Adorable retelling of a classic fairytale,8,4 September 2021,"I quite enjoyed this movie for what it was, a simple, smart and modern retelling of a classic fairytale.

918,johnedwardperry,Simply put.....BAD,1,4 September 2021,Where to start? Just swipe left or right BUT DO NOT PUSH PLAY. This movie is like food that you didn't expect to be so bad and can't get the taste of it out of your mouth.,Cinderella
919,bis-73867,Excellent example of modern women,10,5 September 2021,It's high time all classic movies to be remade to reflect the personality of the modern women. It's so inspiring to see even the villainous women in the original story of Cinderella are portrayed nicer in this new version. All we were seeing in the classic movies were just the narrow perspective of men. They idea of how the women they love would be and how the women they hate would be. That's not the reality. That should not be shown to the younger generation any longer. We need more movies like this and please more women and other underrepresented categories need to review this movie.,Cinderella
920,meganpenny,Truly Painful.,1,3 September 2021,"I am still working out how to get back the 2 hours of my life I lost on this film. Even my 7yo gave it a thumbs down ...wish they had told me that earlier in the film so I wasn't stuck watching it til the end.Weak acting, casting was wrong and just felt like a Bollywood mess.

922,goeglyd,It's ok,5,7 September 2021,"I have no problem with diverse casting because the story of Cinderella can be found in many cultures around the world. Also, I have no problem with the more modern take on Cinderella not waiting around for Prince Charming to save her. I doubt the target demographic of pre-teens and young teens would buy into that outdated trope.Casting Minnie Driver and Billie Porter was genius. I wish they had more to do in this film. The young leads didn't quite have the acting chops to make this a great movie. But then, I don't think this was intended to be more than a fun romp anyway.",Cinderella
923,zjsmaensii,There's a Reason You're Triggered,10,6 September 2021,"This movie was a great adaptation. Look through all the negative reviews and you'll see them for what they are - people getting triggered seeing representation they don't like. This movie has representation, plain and simple. It's a musical, meant for the whole family, with a message: you can have it all, and be who you want to be, plain and simple. It tears down patriarchal ideals and gender norms - if that offends you, you may not want to watch, but I'd take a deeper look at that...",Cinderella
924,xaviorbringas,Women do not need a man,6,5 September 2021,"Most Princess movies carry the tradition of a helpless female in need of a man to save them. In this adaptation, Ella follows her passion and encourages other women to do the same. Even Gwen and the Queen stand up to men Who patronize females. We need more movies for little girls and boys that demonstrate female empowerment. Especially in these times when men want to choose what a woman can and can not do!",Cinderella

927,keikay,Nowhere near as bad as these narrow minded people say it is.,8,11 September 2021,"Came here completely unbiased. Actually maybe a little biased against it since I found Camilla's music a little annoying. BUT. The way people are calling it a disrespect to the original animated film, I have to ask. Does every movie based off of another have to be the same? (It doesn't). There were many cliches, yes. And it has progressive undertones, yes. But honestly, it's not unbearable the way it is in other movies. This movie knows it's being stupid and goes with it. And that's fine with me. The music was fun. I don't care that it wasn't completely original. Movies that try to be deep and fail are way more cringe and dumb stuff people put together for fun. It's not boring or hard to watch. Honestly if you thought you were gonna cry or something, you should have thought about it a little first. Just because everyone around you says they hate something you don't have to hate it and say ""this movie sucked with the exception of the mice"". Safe opinion. Think critically. Also nothing about the movie was ""feminist"" besides millenials ""yass queen"" humor. It was a FINE movie and people love to take their chance to say ""this movie sucks"" to get an easy ""HELL YEAH"". Now maybe the movie isn't worth going to theaters to see but someone played it digitally for me so I'm all good. Decent movie if you're not an asskisser or ""born in the wrong generation"". 8/10.",Cinderella
928,simrahaids,good considering it was camila's debut acting role,7,3 September 2021,"I thought the movie as a whole was filmed well, good usage of camera work lighting and mise en scene. Reading through these reviews i did agree with most points made however, the movies motive was to show a different side of a story a flip of the script if you'd like. This movie was not meant to be a 'new original' it was meant to show a story with a changed narrative.This movies target audience was aimed at today's generation of younger teens, i as 17 year old enjoyed it.Considering it was Camilas first role in acting she did well. She took the character, became an author and wrote a story through the eyes of Ella.Of course the original will always be a classic.Overall i'd give the movie a 7.5/10.",Cinderella

I just have to say I Honestly don't understand why such the negative reviews. This is better then the 3.7 so far on reviews as of writing this. I have to give it a 10 just to make some score up for it, It's about a hard 7 it's pretty good. It has Great music, Camila Cabello was amazing in her first acting roll. Idina Menzel voice you sometimes forget how wonderful her singing voice is, All the singing was spot on. Was it the script ? Everyone should already know what to expect with Cinderella a little bit of a tweak at the end but nothing to over do it. This film is much more better then the 2015 one. Heck hay I go so far and say maybe the best Cinderella since the 1950 animation. Yeah reviews and people seem to be giving unnecessary bad reviews for everything these days I think your kids will love this too :)",Cinderella

It looks good. The modern music choices are largely fun. The rap pieces used at first made me think they were just rehashing what worked for Hamilton. But that turns out not to be the caseThe bad:
It's over the top preachy on political messaging. Some of the changes to the traditional story worked. Some failed miserably and seriously breaks the spirit of the story... A fairy tale.Too bad. Another movie with some solid ideas overshadowed by poor preachy political messaging.",Cinderella

The aftertaste was me smiling, humming melodies and being filled with positve vibes and hope, hope for the better, for the better world where people, girls in particular, can follow their dreams and remain humble and nice, and emphatic and giving. Isn't it something that the world needs?!I loved the cast, Camila Cabello is authentic in her role, charming, goofy and adorable, strong and determined at the same time; Billy, Idina, Minnie are gorgeous in bringing their characters to life.

950,sycfge,Okay,5,3 September 2021,"Obviously this is different from from your traditional treatment of Cinderella and meant to be two hours of musical fun however I think they went too far with the woke agenda, especially with Gwen. The ending is just absurd and actually cringeworthy with Pierce's character's serenade then what he decrees. Camilla was by far the letdown of the movie for me. Her singing is surprisingly poor even with auto tune and reverb. I listened on a reference system and her voice is harsh and grating, whereas all the other vocal performances on this musical are superior to hers. There's lots of feel good fun moments but it just could have been so much better.",Cinderella

It had a stellar cast each giving it there all, great musical numbers and was carried beautifully by its two leads. Other standouts were Billy Porter and Idina Mendel.More importantly the message and small twists added to this classic story were more then appreciated. Ella is determined to make a life for herself and doesn't throw it away for the prince, this time the prince throws his life away for hers. The prince also never forced her to stay or chased her when she left. He even helped her escape the palace! It was also incredibly diverse compared to its former adaptations.The main takeaway is this movie is for children with a strong message for young girls. Put yourself first!",Cinderella

958,dawsonindallas,It gets worse the longer it goes...,1,12 September 2021,"And it's all production's fault.I really hope these actors were paid well (and were contractually to make this movie), because all too many are far more talented than this script or direction can offer,Billy Porter as the fairy godmother just makes sense. He brings the Houston, adds a little bit of Jackson, and just exudes Billy Porter in the role. And after over half a movie watched (and then ditched, we'll get to it), his presence and excitement for the role seem to be matched by no one. But why the rename? I get 'fairy' has been used as a slur, I haven't been immune to it. But he's playing the fairy godmother, who is always fabulous. And if it was problematic issue, why is 'godmother' okay when 'fairy' isn't?This small detail of dialogue and script however, is thematic overall of just how off-kilter this production is. Sets are gorgeous, but lost in the brim and din of candy-colored coifs and confections (and baaaaaad accents). Oversaturated reds, scathing fuchsias, acidic yellow, neon algae greens. It's all too much!Very much like the music itself and the song selections. I say selections because this is a jukebox musical. Pop songs galore, and even songs which aren't pop, turned into something only sixth season of Glee worthy. I literally stopped the movie as the Prince's rendition of 'Seven Nation Army' began. You don't do a Madonna cover perfectly (Menzel) and then go twenty minutes later do the exact same treatment to The White Stripes. It's hard enough with Queen being so over-karaoke'd just because they're song rights are cheap enough, that when an overpopped cover breaks out you just kind of go with.Cheap is a good word for how this movie comes off.Don't get me wrong, every talent in this dungheap has skill in spades; but it's like they're trying to keep Cabello surrounded by the pop she knows so no one will have to work harder as she catches up to other styles of singing.And if all that wasn't enough to convince you not to press play, let's just talk about this script, character development and numerous plot holes.Cinderella is made out to a be a servant girl here again in this iteration, yet her stepmother does the laundry. Her stepmother has her own version of labor clothes for doing the laundry, which leads me to think the stepmother does routine housework. Maybe not a lot of housework, but in this anachronistically Edwardian-era hamlet world our characters reside in, even helping out minimally with the help would free up hours in their day. So even if her step-sisters get to wear the prettier clothes and sleep on the softer beds, Cinderella doesn't seem exactly ABUSED. Just neglected. She literally narrates how her stepmother doesn't bother her in the basement.We do see abuse though, which comes out of left field. When Menzel's character flings ink onto Cinderella's dress and clutches the girl's chin in her hand. The physicality is very left field though, we had not seen Menzel's character act with such ferocity or cruelty until the point.The conflict in the story seems to mainly stem from the kingdom being ""traditional."" That isn't really elaborated on however outside of the two main storyline arcs: Cinderella can't own a business because a woman can't own property and therefore can only manage her own house, and the prince must marry and produce and heir.In this movie, Cinderella isn't so ham-eyed towards her prince. By the time I stopped watching, this motivation never wavered, Cinderella only wants the opportunity to make a better life for herself, and her chances of gaining that opportunity are squandered by the ink-cident (ha).The prince starts off shrugging off a marriage proposal, one which sounds like a business arrangement. Which, albeit, much of his life per his father (played deliciously by Brosnan in one-note character) sounds like a business arrangement. Maybe that explains why he's so enamored but Cinderella when she first speaks out, and their later conversation in the town square.But when so much of his character was set forth in that opening scene, the bro-man-child he protested himself to be, suddenly warms to the ideas of conformity his father has set out for him, it feels disingenuous to the prince, to a character. If the audience is to believe in the empowering message Cinderella is fighting for, why can't we also give more to what the prince can offer?Unfortunately what the prince could offer has been relegated to a new character: the princess. Yes, in this telling of Cinderella, there are TWO royals. And the princess, just like Cinderella, is passed over and dismissed because of her gender.This is a serious topic, one which we are literally fighting here in Texas (again), concerning body autonomy and sexism. The message is relevant.Which makes it all the more disappointing when this feminist icon royal is given the direction to act like an amalgamation of every character Katherine Heigle has ever been forced to play. The princess is hard to watch because she is given no character beyond the smart girl in the room nobody wants around.This movie isn't a feminist statement, it's candy-coated trying-to-be wholeness attempting to outdo the Brandy/Houston Rogers and Hammerstein ABC telecast on a Hollywood budget. Terrible CGI, terrible direction, terrible song choices (though well-sung) with terrible compositions.Get Disney+. It has the Rogers and Hammerstein version.",Cinderella

The trailer made it very clear what the movie would be like and it exceeded my expectations.This movie is a fun, joyful retelling that gives a better message to young kids that you can follow your dreams, and you don't have to wait around for someone to save you. Great song choice spanning decades, and a couple of brilliant original songs as well. I thought Camila made a wonderful debut and her life is a little bit of a Cinderella story as well so it was a fitting role. Amazing cast with Idina, Billy, Minnie, and Pierce and loved the other younger cast members and their story arcs as well. My family loved it and while I would have given 8 or 9 stars I felt the need to counterbalance the 1 stars made by people who didn't even watch it and obviously mass reviewed it to intentionally bring down the rating out of some hateful motivation.",Cinderella

Even from the trailer i could tell the director had no understanding of the original story, but the movie is so much worse.Bad acting/plot/worldbuilding aside, this change to Cinderella's personality to make her seem more ""feminist"" is absolutely inane.Implying that the past versions of Cinderella were only stuck in their abusive situations due to their passiveness is the opposite of feminism.

I know Camila has haters but the people ""mass hating"" this movie are jobless and definitely don't get the point of having a female lead with ambitious.

All in all an enjoyable watch I'll likely take the time to see again.",Cinderella

Everybody, from my little cousins to my grandma, laughed, teared a little bit, sang and danced the whole movie. I also appreciate this modern take, it's so much needed today. Amazing cast, beautiful vocals, very good chemistry between Camila and Nicholas. I liked the prince character the best, because he is supportive and shows he's a real sweet man, who doesn't feel threatened by woman power.Loved Idina's and Camila's vocals, Billy's incredible presence and Pierce Brosnan's total change of character from Bond.",Cinderella

Just downloaded the soundtrack to listen to the arrangement of ""Am I Wrong"" and Camila's runs throughout the movie. I thought her timing was very natural. It's weird how people get very attached to the old storyline and leave a bad review. I thought the writer updated the storyline just the right amount. A couple of jokes are written a bit oddly from my perspective, but my husband and I genuinely laughed out loud a bunch of times. Gorgeous costumes, too.",Cinderella

I found myself enjoying it as much as they did. The jokes were genuinely funny and delivered with perfect comedic timing by the lead (Camila Cabello) and all the supporting cast. I was surprised to hear this was Camila's first role in a movie, she has impressive stage presence and owned all her scenes expertly. Very pretty and charismatic indeed. Prince Robert played by Nicholas Galitzine is equally impressive and the two of them have great chemistry making the romance come to life. The heavy-weights in this film - Idina Menzel, Minnie Driver and Pierce Brosnan - do a fantastic job as expected. The music score is well chosen and executed, and I really liked the song Cinderella sings - Million to One - which I believe is an original song written by Camila. Last but not least, director Kay Cannon succeeded, in my opinion, to put a fresh spin on this old tale and make it relatable to young girls and boys. Overall, I fully enjoyed it and I would happily watch it again.",Cinderella

Chefs kiss to Camila Cabello in her debut performance she was amazing and looked like a seasoned actor, her wit. This cast needs to do another movie together or play together and Oh my Idina and Camila is a must they just play off of each other perfectly. I would say this would be great in theaters too but there is a Lloyd Webber Cinderella that could be confusing. The cast at first seemed to have small parts only for them to shine in the middle or at the end that was something I enjoyed seeing plus an added bonus of Pierce and Mini what a hoot.

I grew up with the Disney cartoon and so when the remake with Lily James came out and there weren't my songs, I hated it. This version also played with feminism, which I felt wasn't as forced as some other movies, so that was nice. And the comedy in it was great!",Cinderella

Kinda give me the move Prom vibes.The cast is star studded and extremely talented making it all the more entertaining and exciting to watch. OFC Billie porter grandmother character was Iconic and kind you he was dancing in HEELS From hell!Camilla voice was great no surprise there! Her acting was surprisingly decent kinda reminds myself of her real self. She really was just present and didn't lose sight of herself which is great being it's the first time she's acting.The story was rather quick which is good cos in this movie the one can only expect that the music number to be amazing which it was.It was different in a good way. It is very relatable in the modern society today. Very diverse and it brings the message of empowerment, inspiration, dreams and ambitions and perseverance. It also breaks the bubble of tradition making it super exciting and motivating. I had a rush of emotions throughout the love especially the musical numbers. The insert of modern songs was awesome! And it's kinda witty.Ahhhh! I can go on and on but you watch it for yourself. I love this movie the prince and Camilla was so swoon worthy.

1071,izzysinternet,Nobody Asked for Another Cinderella Adaption,7,3 September 2021,"Among a sea of Cinderella retells -- many of which are beloved and adored -- adding another modern take to the list seemed arbitrary. However, it's hard to complain when the film isn't all that bad. Ella's defiant determination to make a life for herself, separate from society's expectations, is made clear immediately. Absurd gender roles and the lingering effects they have from generation to generation are confidently challenged, which is something that young viewers can definitely benefit from watching.Going into this, everyone knew that seasoned actors like Billy Porter and Idina Menzel would knock their performances out of the park. But the real question I'm sure a lot of people had was: Will Camila Cabello be able to keep up? Well, yes I believe she did! Sure, director Kay Cannon wrote the character specifically with Cabello in mind, but her acting chops still shined from beginning to end (and thank goodness for that).I enjoyed the film, but I can understand why others may not. My biggest gripe is that I wish all of the authority figures, who were completely unrelenting the entire film, didn't suddenly decide to have a change of heart at the very end. It would have been more realistic (yes I know this film has talking rats) if they were still unaccepting of their kids decisions, even after seeing how happy they were. I can only imagine how helpful it could've been to so many viewers to see how Robert and Ella grapple with knowing that they've disappointed their parents, and how that will probably never change.All in all, decent.",Cinderella

I'm assuming they didn't appreciate the concept of the fact that Cinderella was conflicted to either chase her dreams, or be a royal, but I don't have an issue with this, and I'm not quite sure why someone would. The fact that the concept of a women taking charge of her life is too ""woke"" and is considered hard to watch, is most likely the point of the message. Was it a bit forced, for me? No. For others? Maybe. It's not ""woke"", it just makes sense for this version of the story. Cabello's performance blew me away. Her acting was amazing considering it's her first acting gig, let alone her amazing voice. This movie isn't perfect, but it is nowhere near as bad as these critics say. Great watch if you go into it with an open mind, and remember that this is a new telling of Cinderella, not an attempt to recreate Disney's version.",Cinderella

Loved camila's debut as an actress especially on the sad scenes like you truly feel for her and root for her. If you'd ever watch ANY cinderella movie you know what you're getting into a world of talking rats and fairy godmothers so the fact that some people take it too seriously it's kinda weird, the movie itself jokes about it and it's cool. It doesn't have to be a cult classic, it's meant to entertain the viewer just about right. Idina was amazing as always, you can't hate her even when being ""mean"" she was majestic and billy porter was brilliant too in his role so sassy. Nicholas was handsome and believable such a nice rolleout for a prince to be funny idk why they always make princes bland and boring, he was dope.

1090,cecilefrederick,Surpassed my expectations,10,3 September 2021,"I went in to this movie not really knowing what to expect, and to be honest I had already made up my mind that it was going to be really bad. I'm not a fan of musicals and I didnt like the fact that they reworked some familiar songs instead of there being all original songs. But that was before I actually watched the movie. The songs that they reworked were so well done that I found myself dancing and singing along and really enjoying them, and the original songs were extremely moving. I wasn't extremely sure how Camila Cabello would do playing the lead.. but she was amazing! Encouraging any of you who haven't seen it to go check it out for yourselves. It is definitely not exactly the usual Cinderella story and there's diversity and inclusion but not to the point where it's hard to watch or enjoy. It's a fun watch, even the one or two cringe/slightly cliche scenes didn't take away from how good this movie is. People being negative are just being so for no real reason in my opinion..because this movie was really well done! Go watch for yourselves before letting negative reviews by people being bitter over the changes they made cloud your own judgment. I think this movie has a message that alot of young girls today need!",Cinderella

1095,taniatony,Fabulous feel good movie!,10,3 September 2021,"I am shocked by the amount of negative reviews on here for this film. No it's not like the original, but it's not meant to be! Yes there is some girl power, but the feminism is not over the top and in your face, it's just enough, it's light hearted and fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A really great feel good film, lots of fabulous famous faces and lots of singing along from me! I can't wait to watch it again with my children who I know will love it too. I really hope to see the star rating go up on this one as more and more people watch it. Well done to everyone involved, I loved it!",Cinderella

I know that the directing was a bit weak and the shooting as well, but the performance of most of the actors was great and they convinced me.. Camila surprised me with her first movie and it would be like this.. I know she could have done a better job, but come on, it's her first acting experience.

Its a glorious piece of colour, story and foot stomping music. Just a sheer delight to watch. It's fun and political correct . Pierce Brosnans signing was very tongue and cheek whilst the rest of the cast handle vocals beautifully. Choreograph was amazing. Come on people lighten up. This is entertainment.",Cinderella
1121,melody-26355,I adore this movie!,10,15 September 2021,"I honestly don't understand the ney sayers when it comes to this movie. I have probably watched this version of Cinderella about ten times already! It's light hearted, fun, funny, witty, uplifting and I knew most of the songs, so I could sing along! And the songs I didn't know, well now I do! It takes a jab at the patriarchy without being aggressive, which I thoroughly enjoyed, ""I don't make the rules, I'm just the king""! THIS is the Cinderella story I wish I would have grown up with. My three year old also loves this movie, he calls it the ""butterfly"" movie 😂 Camilla Cabello, I hope you read this, job well done beautiful girl! The entire cast; Job well done beautiful souls! Thank you for this movie ❤ Because everyone should know that we have reached a new age, and this movie embodies all of it. Dare to dream ❤🙏✌🌍 Yes you CAN have it all!",Cinderella

1127,unhappysydgal,"Joyful, fun and easy watching",9,3 September 2021,"Cinderella (2021) is full of joy and humour, and a very easy watch for the whole family. Think Bridgerton (not the saucy parts) meets Glee, with a dash of Hamilton, and the humour of Pitch Perfect (which Director, Kay Cannon, is widely known for). Sure - the messaging of an entrepreneurial girl-boss Cinderella, hustling in a medieval patriarchy is overtly pandering and formulaic, but it's done with good humour and self-awareness. Where the movie falls short is in its character development and overall pacing. Motivations and growth are inconsistent, particularly with Vivian, the 'evil' stepmother. Nonetheless, the cast do a stellar job, the aesthetic is gorgeous and the musical numbers are fun.",Cinderella

I'm so happy nd proud of Camila ♥♥",Cinderella

From the very first moment the medley of Rhythm Nation/You Gotta Be begins to the very end of Let's Get Loud I was singing along every word. The renditions of Am I Wrong and Perfect were next level!! Every main character in the movie gets their own time to shine and are not just background characters used to prop up the leads. Camila Cabello, Idina Menzel and Billy Porter were definitely the standouts for me though. Can't wait to watch this again and listen to the soundtrack on repeat.",Cinderella

1140,spaceanthariksham,"I loved it , as I m going through forced marriage by my parents and so many other things...it makes me feel good seeing this kinds fantasy movies 😍😍..I love fantasy",10,3 September 2021,"I really liked this move..I don't get it y many are hating on it in IMDb reviews..
1. They say it's girl power movie,I mean duh ..read the title again (like the world never made an entire film with man using women in only bikini's ...entire movie evolution is men circled so far )
2. They say it shows all man as bad and incapable or like a joke... honestly it's not 2021 to see gentleman around walking treating women normally....its BC century...like women abuse and torcher is all fairy tale ????...even in my mom's time..she forced Married at 13 and now I m been forced Married at 23 , I don't understand y the world deny a person's pain because that person is a women.????? That explains the negetive comments, and yess...the prince choose Cinderella and makes everyone fall for him unless ur a male dominative mind person and is expecting the prince to be like A KING (dominative one) ,
3.mostly they say the new cindrella movie spoiled the concept of original...I can agree with that .. because original is too brutally true..I don't think in original it's possible for a women to be happy in anyways ...and new movie kinda is fantasy where actually everything is reversed...u see women do rule, u can catch glimpse of women trying very hard to achieve , and yes 2021 cindrella would never happen in real life , old cindrella can happen because there is nothing more than marriage and ball in it so yaa..3. Its horrible to see people show there back on this movie ..it's quite controversy
Think about it a Cinderella fans are people who love to see cindrella to be lucky because she faces many problems but the question is wt kinda luck people want it to be ??? The cindrella fans association wants the luck in the form of Prince..I repeat again ... ONLY prince so basically they are kitty party little girls who want luck to change life not ur work
Well it's possible the 2021 cindrella be a disappointment because it has no luck....it has hardwork in it and I can understand y kitty party fans are disappointed may be ...sleep on bed and dream of Prince charming giving u ur brain back.",Cinderella
1141,monicaaslater,100% worth watching! I enjoyed every min of this film.,10,3 September 2021,"Baffled by some of the negative reviews I've seen here. These people must have either not watched this film or are severely biased for one reason or another (based on comments, seems people are bothered this Cinderella dares to defy some traditional stereotypes). Because I cannot think how anyone could actually watch this movie and not enjoy it. It's funny, it's pure entertainment, the acting is phenomenal and the music score makes you want to get up and dance along. Director Kay Cannon has updated the story to give Cinderella a much needed self-confidence, but it's not overpowering in the plot, just fits the story nicely. This is what young women need to see today. Also, kudos to Camila Cabello who made her movie debut here as Cinderella and blew my mind. She commanded the screen every time she appeared in a scene. Not only is she beautiful, but also a natural comedian with a voice & stage presence to match.",Cinderella

And it is true that the things we watched when we were kids influence the way we see the world as we grow. That is why for so many years I avoided princess story until this one. From the drummer girl, to every female roles in the town and at the palace, to step mom and sis, to ella, to princess gwen and the queen. I feel seen and heard as a woman. Props to Director Kay.

It definitely had some moments that make you cringe a bit with the music or jokes, but there was a freshness to it that was enjoyable at parts too.

Don't waste your time.",Cinderella

There are some good parts when they dance at the ball, her dress at the ball, the song they danced to at the ball the mice were funny. There is an agenda being pushed and it needs to stop. It's ridiculous and irritating. Far from cute and not something a child should be subjected to.

1169,kaylajupe,It's okay...ig,2,3 September 2021,"Okay so here's the thing I somewhat enjoyed the movie had a nice message to it....but it did have it's fair shares of bad to it. I only wanted to watch it because Camila was in it and ""A Million to One"" is a pretty good song, since this was her first movie roll I'll cut some slack on her acting but the others not so much. Okay first things first many scenes were cliche or to predictable, and many scenes kept shouting out ""deep"" messages at me throughout the whole movie, I mean it's cool and empowering but maybe try not to shove so many in my face in an hour and fifty two minutes like stick to one and give little hints to the others (if needed) and the prince's acting was horrible. I have a lot on my mind but I don't feel like writing a novel (yes I have that much to say)...literally... but long story short I was not impressed by the movie all I care abt is that Camila was beautiful and she did well but other than that I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE AN HOUR AND FIFTY MINUTES OF YOUR DAMN LIFE oh and please go follow me @Jupecrazy_22505 on Instagram :)",Cinderella

It doesn't matter if it's different from the cinderella we've always seen, it's an amazing version with a necessary message. I wish I had seen this movie as a child.

1176,danielhdez-60843,A great and more inspiring version of Cinderella,10,3 September 2021,"At first I was not going to watch because of how many Cinderellas there are. However, after I noticed Idina was acting I thought I would give it a chance.The best decision I've made! It seems this is Camila's first movie and she nailed it. I was impressed at how good she was! I loved EVERYTHING from the movie. It is clear to see that many people hate it but I do not understand why. In this new version we get to see a new kind of Cinderella that puts herself over a man. Even though there are many middle-aged men that reviewed this film poorly, I think it will help a lot of kids, especially girls, to follow their dreams no matter what. I really felt inspired with Ella and the songs she sung. Especially ""Million To One""!",Cinderella

It felt like the writers looked at other Cinderella adaptations, picked elements from each one and made them worse.The leads had no chemistry, the song choices were meh, the step family had no edge, the modern slang and mannerisms were jarring, character and plot developments were weak and I found Billy Porter to be a poor man's Whitney Houston. ""Ella Enchanted"" did a better job of blending modern with fairy tale and that movie was a terrible adaptation of it's book.The best part of this Cinderella was Pierce Brosnan singing and, if you've seen ""Mamma Mia!"", then you know how the rest of the movie was.There are much better versions of Cinderella out there, go watch one of them instead.",Cinderella

1192,simonavrabcova,"Women tell story from their perspective and men got pissed off - what a ""surprise""",10,3 September 2021,"I assume most of the 1-star reviews come from the middle-aged male audience who aren't even the target market for this movie anyway. But here they are telling their opinion no one asked for - as they feel obligated to do for centuries. Moreover, you read they turned it off after the first 20 min. I would never be so confident to write a review on something I haven't even finished watching. Are you over-confident or the contrary? But back to the movie... as much as it can be over the top at some moments, it works. I think it is exactly what creators wanted it to be. The satire works, the hit songs work, the costumes are to die for and I love that it is diverse and colourful. Anyone talking about agenda - I don't get it? It is not the classic story, so it is an agenda? Because it talks about messages that society today finally talks about? Yes, please! What were the classic stories? Nice ideas of women dreaming of a better life which usually resulted in marrying a rich prince? Do we really think women in the past didn't have different dreams? I bet they did but all those stories were written by men with similar closed-minded opinions as to the one-star heroes in this review section. Fairly Godmother can't be a man? Why not? Do we also think there have never been men dreaming of wearing a fabulous dress? Women are wearing pants and luckily no one overreacts on that anymore... The script isn't the agenda of the 21st century, these are people, stories and dreams that have always existed but didn't have a right to write about them before. So, we have classics that are just the copy-paste one-narrow views of similar men. Did I like the classic stories as a kid? Sure... there wasn't much of anything else. Did I ever as a little girl dreamed of my life ending up as a fairy tale where I marry a rich prince? Never! Not even as a 7-year-old girl. The only thing I probably really wanted from all that stories was the dress and shoes which I knew I will buy one day when I want and when I make my career. So, if agendas mean diverse points of view, accepting the world is colourful by all means, freedom of choice and open-minded society, please, bring it all on. The most important message is thereafter all - love. I hope in 50 years my grandchildren will call this movie the CLASSIC! Even if not for its cinematographic qualities then definitely for its storyline.",Cinderella

1201,natashaakib,"Joyful, funny and a great cast",8,4 September 2021,"Cinderella (2021) is full of joy and humour, and a very easy watch for the whole family. Think Bridgerton (not the saucy parts) meets Glee, with a dash of Hamilton, and the humour of Pitch Perfect (which Director, Kay Cannon, is widely known for). Sure - the messaging of an entrepreneurial girl-boss Cinderella, hustling in a medieval patriarchy is a little bit pandering and formulaic, but it's done with good humour and self-awareness. Where the movie falls short is in its overall pacing, losing momentum in some parts and then ramping up at the end again. Nonetheless, the cast do a stellar job, the aesthetic is gorgeous and the musical numbers will make you smile.",Cinderella

1225,bbstanacc,Great Movie (LITERALLY NO WOKE AGENDA...),10,4 September 2021,"Genuinely, this movie was great, from the production, set design, soundtrack, down to costume design. There was some clichés here and there but other than that it was extremely well made and well executed. It was also very kid/adult friendly because my children absolutely loved it. Everyone can act and sing, so I was shocked when I found out about some of the horrible and downright homophobic/transphobic reviews calling this left wing propaganda...There isn't an overly suffocating amount of feminist (or as reviewers call it 'girl-boss') messaging spewed throughout the film. It is relatively tame and the main focal point of the film is about picking YOUR happiness which happens in both the male and female leads respective storyline and is made abundantly clear mere minutes into the movie.The real only progressive thing in the movie is the fact the Fairy Godmother (Or in this case Fabulous Godmother) is played by a gay black man (which is where most of the homophobic/transphobic remarks are coming from). I did NOT find his role as the ""Fab G."" to be overbearing or the dialog to be cringe worthy. I thought his performance was quite nice, his entrance was excellent and worth watching the movie just for THAT ALONE.""I couldn't even make it past 5 minutes"" Then why are you reviewing a movie you basically have not seen...""They changed things that ruin the original concept"" then go watch the 10 other Cinderella remakes that has the original concept... This was very CLEARLY advertised as a reimagining and NOT a remake, so it is bound to be DIFFERENT...""There is too many songs"" It is a musical... Like that is all I have to say.I don't why some reviewers are bringing up the ""capitalistic"" nature of Cinderella (as if owning a business is only a capitalistic thing)
like this is not a family movie marketed towards kids... that is the equivalent of saying ""Elsa has some characteristics of Hitler..."" then proceeding to give it 1/5.Now since that is out of the way, I absolutely think this movie is a 10/10 and inspirational for our generation. Idina Menzel, Camila Cabello, and Billy Porter are easily the showstoppers in this film with some great surprises from Minnie Driver towards the end!",Cinderella
1226,bmcczdsvg,Absolute Non sense,1,4 September 2021,"One statement - WTF was this movie?I love fairy tales but this was the first one I struggled to watch. The storyline does not relate with Cinderella at all. Either make it completely modern, like Hilary Duff's Cinderella or just classical. None of the characters make sense. Camila Cabelo's acting is atrocious. If they wanted to promote women empowerment, diversity and self acceptance, it could have been a different or modified name rather than Cinderella and literally putting all characters in a mixer. I was so excited to watch it but wasted 2 hours hoping to see if it gets better at all. But its a horrible watch all the way.",Cinderella
1227,hydrophobic-36544,People are just cranky about something different,10,4 September 2021,"I saw a lot of reviews rating this a 1 and while I didn't expect this movie to be a masterpiece, I knew based on the reviews I read that there was a lot of personal bias going on. This movie was really good and very funny. It was well-acted and well-sung. Was it the best movie ever? Of course not, but it's certainly not worth the 1s it's receiving. I wouldn't even say it's a 10 but I'm rating it that to try and help offset the unfair reviews. I'd say it's more like a solid 6 or 6.5.So why are we seeing such a low rating then?We've got a movie that did a great job of sending a different message than the typical Cinderella without being too over-the-top with the beliefs being shared. We've got the godmother being a gay man, the lead is latinx, we've got toxic masculinity being challenged, women empowerment, and so much more. Let's be honest - we're living in a time where a lot of people are clearly uncomfortable with inclusion and to see such a wonderful classic redone with such a diverse cast to represent our real world and society... A good chunk of people are going to be upset and uncomfortable because they're the ones who don't want to accept the beautifully varied world we live in. A lot of what's been said about this movie I don't hold to be true and some of it I think is just so vague that there's even a chance they've not seen the movie at all. It's been made very clear to me in other reviews that they're struggling with their own discomfort and I truly hope that someday they'll outgrow it.But as for the movie? It's really good and so worth the watch. It had a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, the messages were not overdone, the acting was pretty great - especially for Camilla's debut acting role. There were multi-level jokes for all ages included and the songs were fun. I'm happy I watched this and definitely recommend it to everyone else.",Cinderella

1242,khushiaditi-37039,THIS IS THE BEST,10,4 September 2021,"I loved it. It's ssssssooooo good. Like everything is so good. The songs, the actors and the comedy top amazing. It's like camila was made to act. I can't wait to see more movies by her.",Cinderella
1243,mcclintockerin,"10, and here's why...",10,4 September 2021,"....If you're upset because it's not the same as other Cinderellas, then that makes sense - this is a different Cinderella. This young woman shows you within the first five minutes when she sees her reflection in a mirror - confidently winking at herself. She's not slouching, not meek and looking sad or upset by her circumstances - because she's above it, believes in herself and has a plan to get out. I don't recall the other Ellas having a plan for herself. I read everyone saying that it was over-the-too woke, but you know what? Girls and women have been fed for generations crap that dictates how a woman will respond to others (be safe cause someone was mean, be vindictive, etc.), what she's responsible for (everything, including men's feelings and protecting men's feelings and ego), and what will make a woman beautiful and desirable (petite, fair, blonde hair, blue eyes, timid and ""nice girl""). This Ella stands and walks confidently, with her shoulders back. I love how the step-sisters actually were not overly cruel and nasty - they actually talked to her a little bit, didn't do the lions share or cruelty or bullying (well done, Idina). This dynamic doesn't play into the trope of ""mean girls"" and putting you g women against each other to fight each other for attention, material things, or men. Nearly every person performing with a musical instrument was a woman. They featured all shapes and sizes and types of women. The stepsister who was curvy was actually given lines - and good ones - which included self-confidence in herself. Again, no sloughed shoulder or being meek, mild, timid, unsure, ready to be ridiculed - nope. Billy Porter was the best damned Fairy Godmother ever. That is all. When they depicted scenes that involved the Prince interacting with other young men, they didn't get all frat boy or bro culture. They modeled what male friendship can be - being vulnerable, sharing emotion, and not mocking or shaming one another (basically, no toxic masculinity). The costumes are awesome, lively, and fun to look at (costume designer was a woman), the music was fun and well-selected for the scenes (music also put together by a woman), and every time you could feel a stereotypical scene about to happen or a formulaic conversation which would inevitably put a woman down, it went in a different direction (written and directed by a woman, and had multiple female producers). The songs were fun, the dancing was incredible, and there were a lot of cute, funny moments. Was there pop culture cheese? Yes. Did it occasionally feel like it was ""trying to be cool?"" Ehh - a little. But Cinderella was a confident woman of color who wanted to pursue a career and be an entrepreneur. And we don't know if she will ever necessarily get married (""we don't have to put a label on it, we're in love.""). I'm glad that women, girls, and little boys will get to see this alternative to the previous renditions. Very clearly, the people who pulled this movie together (ahem, women - and feminist men who know real talent) wanted to make it inclusive and have characters that most people could recognize themselves in when they watched this - why is that so wrong? To be different and to broaden a story so that everyone can share in it? ...It's a really good movie. Done.",Cinderella
1244,ashley_t_collins,Cringeworthy,1,4 September 2021,"I was so excited about the movie and went into it knowing it's not going to be exactly like the Disney version. They really did try hard on this movie to make it fun, entertaining, and overall enjoyable. However, the songs don't make since according to the plot or the scene. It looked more like they shot music videos to the songs and then mashed them all together to form a movie. I honestly felt second hand embarrassment and cringed while watching it. Also, I didn't completely understand the rapping in the middle of certain scenes when they would make royal announcements. The one good thing about the movie is they all have beautiful vocals and I did enjoy the songs (as long as I did not watch the movie while listening).",Cinderella
1245,gildardorumen,We had a great time!,10,4 September 2021,"We really had a good time! This movie is getting a lot of hate from baseless opinions and people who just go with the current. There's no doubt we live in quite a cynical world. Too many comments saying it develops on a political agenda. I'm sorry people, but we are part of a world that is constantly evolving, however, I found myself related to the main character. We must always fight for our dreams and goals without toeing the line and being afraid. I think those topics of our current context don't feel forced in the movie, it might seem like they are, but just stop for a moment, take a look around you, watch and listen, then you'll maybe broaden your perspective a bit about the world.Camila Cabello surprised me. She delivers a natural lovely and inspiring performance. The rest of the cast was also very good. Billy Potter really shines and irradiates magic, and Indina Menzel was cruel yet moving. And actually, the stepsisters and even the stepmother weren't too mean, but that is how life goes you know. Almost no one is too good nor too mean. Even James Corden was good in his role along with his mice partners. We got the exact dose of his humor to be entertained.So please, try to avoid being predisposed and try to go beyond the cover. Maybe the variety of types of songs might shock you at first, bit of they play a purpose in the film, as they do, then they're there for a reason.I might give it a 9 or even an 8, but I totally disagree with the very low rating it's got, so I give it a 10!",Cinderella
1246,shunodayasser,Camila doing amazing,10,4 September 2021,"So great have so much fun. I don't know what this people rude about . Camila doing amazing
The cast not great but not bad and James is worse rule in the movie , Kay could do much better but it's good
The music in the movie are great . Milion to one is so great.",Cinderella
1247,mkekahu,Billy Porter--yaaaassss QUEEN!!!,10,4 September 2021,"Ok, so yes it's a musical. And sometimes it's super gay-like rainbows and confetti gay-but it's a wonderful update to an original story rooted in patriarchy and classist stereotypes. Yes, a woman can have it all-including a fabulous godmother (Billy Porter you're amazing!)! Also, love the climate-change elements-progressive, smart, and necessary. Should have focused more on the sister :) Let's be real-so many ""critics"" are hating on this movie because it refuses to do the same thing over again. Some parts are a little cheesy but it's not supposed to be some serious movie. It's a fairytale! And it's ok to rewrite them from time to time.",Cinderella
1248,erin-86711,"Not A Disney Musical, But Magical All The Same",10,4 September 2021,"If you're looking for a Disney Musical Movie, look elsewhere. This show is part parody, part Broadway musical, and entirely a work of art. Stunning costumes, impressive choreography, and a beautiful blend of funny and serious, this is easily 5 stars. People who go into this looking for the same boring story will be disappointed, but those who are open to a different experience will find themselves enjoying this immensely.",Cinderella

People who are too obsessed with THIS fairytale value violation as if world doesn't have worst violations of human rights, democracy etc. There is no fixed values in art. Anyone can be creative to any extent they want. It is not a crime. If they are so offended by breaking down few stereotypes and let a girl to choose her dream instead of being damsel in distress, I can't find another better term to describe than 'insane'. Final request. Watch the movie and have fun while it lasts!!!",Cinderella

Why you would and then leave a one star review is just petty and mean and doesn't do the film justice.Its a great feel good modern version of a story that has a terrible original moral to it. The girl being saved by a man who didn't even remember what she looks like! This version is sooo much better to watch with my daughters.If you do like the above genres, give it a go. It's funny and sweet and very watchable. Plus they made it during a worldwide pandemic! Kudos for that too!",Cinderella
1252,shananaa,It wasn't that BAD y'all calm down !!!!,7,4 September 2021,Honestly surprised!!! Camilla Cabello's acting was actually pretty good and rather better than what I was initially expecting. The movie has a modern twist to it and although it doesn't hit as different as the 2015 Cinderella and the other older adaptations it's still pretty good. Everyone who is writing those dramatic a$$ reviews can literally just dial it down a notch because y'all are really taking it out of proportion.But uh Prince Charming looked really ugly with that Clay Jensen haircut.Some bits of the movie felt really comical and we're enjoyable. BUT Why does James Corden have to be in everything though.... like he adds nothing to the movie and is just a waste of screen time.,Cinderella
1253,matildamahl-53220,Junk,1,6 September 2021,"I already wasted enough time watching this movie so won't waste more writing this review.

1254,yukiko-34391,Not that WOKE,1,4 September 2021,"Its obvious this movie is trying for inclusivity points, and I appreciate that there were alot of people of color featured...However, I am still disappointed by the lack of East Asian actors. There was such a great opportunity to include some East Asian people in the marketplace or at the ball, and I only saw one, and she was wearing a blonde wig.The fact that the movie is so obviously trying hard to be WOKE and inclusive though, rubs salt in the wound. Its like East Asian people are an afterthought, even when movies are actually trying for diversity...I have a beautiful young Japanese American daughter, and I want her to feel proud of her heritage, and it just sucks that here wasn't anyone in the movie that looks like her.The movie itself was cute and nonsensical... Nothing revolutionary, but I liked the guest stars and cameos (like that adorable drummer girl) and seeing a brown girl as Cinderella.",Cinderella
1255,ayanacreativities,Amazing!!,10,4 September 2021,This movie was sooo good and the people who say it was trash are people that hate Camila or they are too biased. If you get rid of the other Cinderella movies and it was just this one no one would have a problem with it because they are too hooked up on nostalgia. The acting and songs and just everything about it is great. If people have it a chance and didn't have high expectations than they would have rated this movie higher.,Cinderella

She's a natural. All actors are great. Good casting. They're legends. Everyone played their part. I love how they showed us the story behind the characters. The chemistry of the prince and princess they're too cute. Really amazing musicals and mashups. YAS SING. Plus it's so funny. Literally no dull moment. The women here are bosses. Insightful and refreshing. You just cant help but admire everyone. The movie served its purpose - make girls and women feel empowered. It made me smile. Will definitely recommend to my friends.

They just sang near an hour. I think i really need to wash my eyes.Third: the main story of this movie (Cinderella animation) was much much much much much much better than this. From the firs sequence i guess what will happen in the rest of movie and i was true.Overall it was better to they didn't do that with Cinderella.,Cinderella

I liked that it allowed her to choose ""herself"" in a world of peer pressure and fitting in with the status quo.

But for me, this is one mark before and after for fairy tales.So don't be unfair and stop acting like you are a critic from movies acclaimed.Sit with your children, nephews, or nieces and see their enjoy faces.

The cultural representation, the costumes, every song impeccably placed...the messages: Love, is a wonderful addition to life but not necessarily the only nor most important goal! Live YOUR life on your terms. Chase your dreams. It's fresh and socially relevant to the message mother's are trying to teach their girls!Most the men here, commenting that it was disappointing...I have no doubt many a women have given you the same review.Women empowerment is only an ""agenda"" to those who don't empowerment women. Sit down and let this gem shine the way it was meant to for the audience it was meant for. Believe it or not, not everything is for or about you!

Although it's a huge disappointment and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it. It gets very annoying after some time and it's quite insulting to the original classic, The lyrics have become a little too much and almost every phrase is sung into a song.

Camila played an adorable and very charming Cinderella, and Idina Mendel as the stepmother absolutely wowed me (I loved Dream Girl so much!!). The romance was sparking with chemistry. What surprised me the most was how hilarious the mice were when they turned human, I loved those scenes so much. Costumes were breathtaking and this movie truly blew my expectations.I don't know why people are giving such bad reviews, I'd even understand if it was 3-5 just because they didn't enjoy it, but to go as far as calling it a 1 star movie is ridiculous.",Cinderella

Like come on. What's not to like. They included diversity of their characters, they showcased many different cultures through the fashion. And thank god they finally addressed the women's rights issue that is evident in A LOT of classics. Thank you for showing young women that even though they might love the boy, you should still always chose YOURSELF over anything. Always dream big and always follow it. And thank you for showing that us women can say no, that we don't have to be quite just because that's what society expects of us. And thank you finally for continuing the change of normalising all woman in male dominant career roles. THANK YOU.",Cinderella
1309,dxnyhrndz,Wow!,10,4 September 2021,"Loved Kay Canon's Cinderella movie, Camila did such an amazing job for her acting debut, 10/10!",Cinderella

Has got to be the best version of cinderella yet just because of it's modern twist which will inspire and encourage future generations that you should always follow your dreams and believe in yourself!

1313,wzjy,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,4 September 2021,"I kept watching in the hopes it would get even a tiny bit better, but it never did. The whole movie feels forced and the actors seem very aware of just how terrible it is. A waste of Brosnan's and Driver's talent. Billy Porter was a glimmer of light. Terrible script. Terrible casting Just terrible.",Cinderella

Different from other Cinderella movies but that's what the intention was. Creating a mix of the old and the new. Anybody going into this was going to be disappointed because it wasn't your classic Cinderella story. I thought Cabello did a great job on her 1st acting gig. Loved the cast, music, costumes and scenes. Would like to have seen more interaction with the stepsisters but I would watch it again.",Cinderella

1337,maruenes-48263,A movie perfect for children,10,4 September 2021,"I'm not a fan of Camila Cabello but I decided to watch the movie and it has a great soundtrack, I couldn't stop singing lol. This is a movie that you can't watch seriously, it's so obvious it is from the director of pitch perfect, the movie gave me that vibe.It's a totally different version of what we've seen of Cinderella and that's what I liked. Imagine if it was the same whole story, why would you watch it? It wouldn't make sense, so I appreciate that they put a twist on the story. And make it to empower women not like an old fairy tale.I'm not going to say it's perfect, with a perfect screenplay that deserves an Oscar or the best musical of all time because you have to keep on mind that it was also created for children specifically BUT DO NOT BELIEVE TROLLS. I don't know why people insist on despising the movie. Or it is because is Camila Cabello (who was incredible in the movie btw) or because the story is very inclusive (yes, those comments are very racist, xenophobic and homophobic wtf people we are in the 21st century we must grow as persons and stop having closed mind) or because of James Corden (who appears less than 10 minutes in the film lol) All this is not valid to despise the film because then it is not an honest critic of what the film really is.If you don't like this movie, you probably have a bitter soul. The objective of the film is to make you sing, laugh and even reflect on how women are silenced in society.Also apparently it is Camila Cabello's debut as an actress and I can say that it was incredible, she is a super talented person and she will make you laugh in the movie. The truth is I love that girls can see her as a princess because she seriously gives them a super important message such as following their dreams and to not care what others say.",Cinderella
1338,ematar-45392,Ruined only by critics.,7,4 September 2021,"Honestly this is such a great funny movie, with great covers and music. It's very family friendly with a great twist on the plot and some added coherence to it which I found amazingly creative and awsome. Camilla can very well sing and act at the same time and it shows. So if you're looking for a funny musical to enjoy whenever you're sad ot with family, I can definitely recommend this one.",Cinderella
1339,anabelcairo,Haters gonna hate,10,4 September 2021,This movie is amazing. Camila Caballo is the cutest. Minnie Driver deserves everything. Idina Mendel is the shining sun. And Whitney is smiling down at Billy Porter for being such a Fabulous Godmother. Don't be a hater.,Cinderella

I honestly thought it was brilliant. So upbeat, and such a new take on a classic film. The ending was refreshing, (the stepmom, the wedding, the crown) for years, girls have grown up thinking their career takes a back seat. Loved the modern take on a classic. Songs were great, cast was great. I don't get why people are rating it so badly.",Cinderella

Why would amazon even make THE classic cinderella story when Disney has already done it like 5 years ago? There has been so many adaptations of Cinderella already that are so different from the disney story... Why are people still surprised that it isnt exactly like the motion picture?

1373,peoggu,6 out of 10 why?,6,4 September 2021,"I like the movie on how much the said villain (the step mom) has reasonable back story, and the actress executed it perfectly, I love it. It became interesting that they added more little plots on the characters like the sister of the prince (i know the story isn't focus on her but there should be something more than being a can't-read-situation-eavesdropping-girl), and how ella strive to became a businesswoman. But in romance, it's cute and all yet i feel like there's something missing. Idk where if its in chemistry or acting or to the script 🤷. Overall i enjoyed it but its not a type of movie that i would rewatch again, but i would casually recommend it to the young audience.",Cinderella

1377,boyharmonizerph,Cyborgerella on its own rights,1,4 September 2021,"I thought Cabello has a unique voice but in the movie she clenches her jaw to make her sound more unbearable. Heavily autotuned that is different from the other Cinderella we know who has a soothing voice and a vocal powerhouse. She wiggles her jaw up and down while singing but it doesnt help at all and at first i thought it was part of the joke, but its not. I know that this was a comedy but it was unfunny and unnatural. I passed beyond an hour mark but didnt bother to finish because I felt embarasses that such movie was even brought to life.",Cinderella
1378,itspearlyshellz,A modern Cinderella,10,5 September 2021,"It has music, costume, humor, and so many more. It accomplishes its role of having the old story and twisting it with modern twist that empowers women especially the little girls who will watch it.",Cinderella

I have 2 young daughters and am very worried about the messages they receive from pop culture.A great message of female empowerment from this movie and I had no idea Camila Cabela could act! She did a great, believable job.",Cinderella
1382,roseoak,You probably have something better to do...,1,5 September 2021,"Most of the singers were spot on. I liked seeing some new people preform that I had not seen before. The prince has an amazing voice. And Mini Driver may have done her best work. However, even those great singers and some well chosen songs were not enough to save this movie. It was cramming ""woke"" and ""women's lib"" down my throat the whole time. Supper preachy. Not enjoyable. It could have been so entertaining with a more subtle message, but instead they chose to preach, preach, well ...you know. Don't waste your time.",Cinderella
1383,irenehankins,Left a bad taste in my mouth,1,5 September 2021,"Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation was a message to the ignorant racists at her time- called for world peace, for unity. Its not in good taste to cast a woman who called her black coworker the n word, monkey, laughed about it with her friends, as the lead. And to have a bunch of white people butchering Janet's song at the same time? This movie feels like a joke.But honestly even if Camila wasnt the racist she was, i genuinely wondered during the movie if she had any sort of training for acting on camera/film, or classical singing. Her voice was constantly breaking and not in a way that sounds good like how some singers can do. At times she often sounded like she was going into a different key, the notes were all over the place. I really do not understand what James Corden saw.Idina and Billy tried to save it.The Hamilton-esque rap scene was nice.",Cinderella

Good adaptation of the original.,8,5 September 2021,"So I am a big fan of the original Cinderella movie but I can appreciate the many variations of this movie that have come about over the years. This movie has a stellar cast and really puts its own spin on the original movie. If you watch this and expect for it to be the same as the original, you'll be saddened by the fact that it's not. It is a way more modern version of the classic but I don't think that makes it bad. It's just a different version and my girls and I really enjoyed watching it.",Cinderella
1385,delgadochrissss,IM FLABBERGASTED AND IN ALL,10,5 September 2021,Wow... she truly amazed me... I literally cried of Joy. I love her so much. She's pure and talented in everything she does.

1387,asiadreid,This is why you don't mess with classics,1,5 September 2021,"I honestly couldn't even make it through 20 minutes of the film. They were trying way to hard to be different; this movie is the ""pick me"" of recreated classic stories. This is also a prime example of why you shouldn't cast someone just because they can sing.

Humoruos, witty (it has many tiny funny moments), and updated story.Camila was fresh, the music was absolutely fanstastic (loved that it had us singing and wanting to dance and also reintepreted the lyrics according to the movie).Wardrobe and decoration were amazing.

And you could never go wrong with adding Idina Menzel and Billy Porter in this movie. I dont understand why some people are ""hating"" or ""bashing"" this movie tho. Just enjoy it because that's what the movie is for.",Cinderella

I am glad I agreed to them because I didn't expect the modern takes in this movie. I thought the story would just be the same as the traditional one. I love how this focuses on feminism, every character especially the women have their own story. It isn't just about cinderella wanting to have a prince but also her ambition to achieve her dream career. This Cinderella is what I want my kids to grow up to.",Cinderella
1407,algiezaa,10 stars,10,5 September 2021,"10 stars because contrary to haters beliefs this movie is not trash. I tried to watch it with low expectations because of its reviews but the movie proved me wrong. Camila Cabello, Idina Menzel and Billy Porter really shines and this movie.

1409,msabansmith,"Harry and Meghan, the Musical",2,5 September 2021,"Generally poor performances and a closing story line, reminiscent of Harry and Meghan.Why 2 stars? Simple really, a couple of the songs were excellent and Idina Menzel's performance was terrific and the dress transformation was cool. Other than that, it dropped 8 stars through its casting, performances, story, direction and left me wondering if it was a 'traditional' comedy musical or a pantomime.",Cinderella
1410,prettypednekar,Camila shines bright,10,5 September 2021,Not a camila fan but this movie is one of the best version of Cinderella with strong women empowerment message also Camila's acting is cherry on the top she definitely doesn't deserve this hate.,Cinderella

1431,Peachesandpits14,Rhythm Nation,2,5 September 2021,"Immediately I was thrown off guard by this film. The singing was good but I don't know why they made this a jukebox musical it made not sense. Rhythm Nation was the weirdest choice for an opening song. Why James Cordon was in this I will never know, he is in so many musicals now a days and I don't think he's good in any of the others musicals. That opening was kinda odd but then that guy Thomas his introduction was creepy and I hated it so much. The costumes were pretty good I guess but other than that I would skip this movie all together.",Cinderella

They build up the characters personalities through the songs and expect you to sit through a remade ""classic pop"" song every minute.The movie had strong female empowerment vibes but only built on Cinderella's and used Princess Gwyn as a sad comedic relief/a sad puppy with no power. The Queen Beatrice could have been built up but she was hollow too. Even the Fabulous Godmother, who I was so excited for, flopped.I'm so sad that this movie didn't deliver the way I was hoping.",Cinderella
1433,tytamae,CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE HATE,10,5 September 2021,"This movie has great music and good message. I simply can't understand the hate this movie is getting. It puts effort in showing the misogynistic world we are at and those who left a bad rating sets the example for some of them. It also represented the LGBTQ community. Yes, the ending was quite predictable because I did but I still liked it. From a music fan who enjoys all sorts of genres this is a YES for me. All of us may not enjoy it like others but this movie is definitely not horrible. Great movie, soundtrack and cast. A MUST WATCH!!!",Cinderella

I also found Camila's character and James Character very funny and amusing. My sister and i have watched this movie 4 times and we still aren't sick of it and it came out two days ago.",Cinderella
1436,danielarohan,"A refreshing, modern interpretation of the folktale",10,5 September 2021,"A feel-good, light movie as not many are made these days. Loved the modern interpretation of the folktale... the sweet atmosphere, the pop music we know in a different context, the unpretentious humour, and the actors' performances. A little bit like not taking themselves seriously... but still quite good. Acknowledged Camilla's courage to try something different... it does take courage. True, the director has created an inclusive and easy-going world, and why not? That's the artistic vision... because this is a movie, a lovely musical, not the real world, isn't it?",Cinderella
1437,aivil-58232,Perfect for a nice evening,10,5 September 2021,"Loved it! It's exactly what you need after a long day at work, nothing heavily artistic and psychological, but interesting enough.

Wonderful and worth watching!",Cinderella
1441,jamesraeks,"Fun, enjoyable movie.",10,5 September 2021,"I had high hopes for this movie because of the amazing cast and I was righty. Camila held her own with the likes of Idina, Billy, Nicholas etc... who are all actors. She acted beautifully and it didn't feel forced. Her portrayal of Cinderella is excellent. I never doubted the music because of Camila & Idina and they obviously delivered. Billys 10 minutes where incredible and he really piled on more talent. Nicholas was amazing also. Maddie and Charlotte brought a fresh take to the step sisters and I really enjoyed their harmonies with Idina. Shout out to Pierce Brosnan and Minnie Driver and everyone. The cast was full of diversity and the storyline was important, fresh and fun. The changes made like the sister being added and the backstory of the step mother was really needed. Kay Cannon really delivers with this movie. I knew she would since her previous work still holds like Pitch Perfect. This adaption was so great and not anywhere near your typical 'Cinderella' story. Also shout out to the editors the transformation scene's where stunning. The 'Perfect' dance scene was incredible.",Cinderella
1442,ajoi-38285,Really?,1,5 September 2021,"First off, why did we need another Cinderella movie?? Pretty sure there's dozens of the same story and better ones at that. The whole movie just felt like another cheap cash grab and didn't put any effort or consideration at all.There's so much potential being thrown away in the film industry with every movie that comes out these days. Really is a shame to see but not as much as a shame to watch this movie 😐",Cinderella
1443,juumrocha,A lighthearted and fun surprise,10,6 September 2021,"This movie was a great surprise to me. I'm a huge fan of Camila Cabello, but I have to admit I was a little scared of what would come out of this. However, her performance fitted perfectly with the tone of the story, which is suposed to be lighthearted and humurous. Idina Menzel was perfect as the stepmother and Billy Potter might have had a short time on screen, but he definitely stole the show for me. The King and Queen were a stand out to me, one of my favorite parts for sure, and all the other charecters were amazing as well, altough I would have loved to see more of Princess Gwen. Prince Robert was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent sure from the start, but as the movie went on his character grew on me.I'm no expert on the musical genre, but I thought the song choices were perfect and made sense with the storyline. Sure, I would have loved more original songs, but overall I think they did a great job. And as for the costumes, I loved how they tried to mix morden and classic. One of my favorite things about this movie was how coloful everything looked, which fitted the story perfectly.As for the message of the movie, I thought it was refreshing to see Ella wanting to chase her dreams instead of giving them up for the opportunity of marrying the Prince and it makes me sad the amount of people complaining about this.Lastly, the humor on the movie was done perfectly in my opinion. I know it's not everybody's taste, but it was a highlight to me how Kay Cannon managed to bring her own twist to it, reminding me several times of Pitch Perfect, one of my all-time favorite movies.At this point I'm not really sure if people are just hating for the sake of it or actually giving it a chance. Of course, I know this will not be everyone's cup of tea and that's totally normal, but I truly don't believe it deserves all this hate. It's supposed to be just a fun and light take on the this old farytale, so I don't understand why people are taking it so seriously. It's not supposed to be watched like that and I feel like most people are having a hard time understanding this not Disney.",Cinderella

Half the music is uninspired, shoe-horned in Glee style covers of popular songs that have nothing to do with each other; the other half are original songs that are either generic or annoying.This really did not have to be a Cinderella movie. The classic story elements like the glass slipper and the evil stepmother seem like they're only there out of obligation while the real plot happens around them..

The music, choreography, props, settings are also worth watching, Kay Cannon did a great job this time, and about Camila aka Cinderella, as a debut film for a singer-songwriter, she did a really great job in her role.

There is history and there is drama. There is conservatism and there is LGBTQ representation. You name it and they have it.I am afraid this is such a uniquely fun movie that is bound to keep all eyes glued to the screen- irrespective of gender or caste. If there is any movie where the girl can CHASE HER DREAMS and at the same time, have a loving family- this is it.In my humble opinion, this movie does not deserve the amount of criticism it has been receiving. Why is it that all feminist theme movies receive it? Especially when EQUALITY is what us human beings want!!?The music and filming is beyond amazing. I daresay this is one movie which has it's songs set straight- the lyrics are just what you want to hear- realistic and pleasing.I honestly would like to see similar adaptations of the stereotypical and gender biased stories we teach our preschoolers in the name of fairytales.I rate this movie a 10/10 and highly recommend it to everyone!!!!!",Cinderella

1487,gfrancomg,"Not a typical Cinderella, watch with an open mind!",10,7 September 2021,This is my favorite Cinderella movie. The songs are modern and something you can sing to. It's also very modern. I love the more female strong lead. And the messages they give is very powerful and very enlightening. For people to compare it to Cinderella is something you will be disappointed because this movie is nothing like that. It does have the 'basis' but not to that degree.I feel like our new generation would like this movie more than the older generation for sure. So watch it with an open mind !,Cinderella
1488,andrewgertler,a good movie.,10,7 September 2021,"At first i thought i was going to let me down so many times i saw it all over the place. I thought it would be a dumb movie, but it exceeded my expectations. I loved it and my daughter keeps asking me to put it on again. It's a cool movie, i recommend it. Do not expect disney tale, it has nothing to do, but super watchable.",Cinderella
1489,barbguevara,Love it!!!,10,7 September 2021,"I love this new version, it was fun and I love the music they chose. From Queen to JLO. Amazing!!!",Cinderella
1490,kathrob-21432,a good classic.,10,7 September 2021,"Is a film that I expected not to have a complex story. Billy Porter as fairy godmother was sensational. Idina is always perfect in everything she does. It's a really fun and contagious movie. Camila Cabelo was good for a newcomer, I think she has a future as an actress. I loved the movie's soundtrack deserves more recognition. And what was the prom scene? Definitely the best. I recommend!",Cinderella
1491,luanagt-66231,Good,10,7 September 2021,"Acceptable. It is a

1493,perimisim,Made an IMDB acc just to leave this review,1,7 September 2021,"I get where they were going with this modern take on Cinderella, but it was executed so horribly. The plot was so cheesy (along with the CGI rats), the lines were tacky, and another recreation of Cinderella is just unnecessary.Also they sang modern songs which had NO correlation to the story like ""Material girl"" and ""am I wrong"" which was just extremely cringe.",Cinderella
1494,sarakraemer,Terrible,1,7 September 2021,"Don't watch it. I feel like they tried to make it like the greatest showman but failed horribly. They tried to stick a song in where ever possible and it was just to much. You've been warned, huge disappointment.",Cinderella
1495,kuroitenpi,What are you afraid of?,8,7 September 2021,"One of the lines in this movie put it best, ""old white men are only afraid of colon cancer and cultural change"" (e.g this movie). It took me a few minutes to warm up to it, but I really enjoyed the movie and its shifted perspective putting women first. This is what our children need to be taught, not that men rule and women are second rate.",Cinderella

They had such amazing singers and such beautiful songs! I loved this so so much! The story was so amazing! I Loved this take on the classic Cinderella story! This was a very fun, very beautiful take on the story! It was so wonderful and has such amazing story! I appreciate that this is empowering women and young girls! Such a great example for little girls and boys all over!",Cinderella
1497,johannahwoodhams,Who approved the script for this movie.,1,7 September 2021,This movie feels like a group movie project for high school that is awful. The entire movie was awful and cringy and full of unoriginal music. The only acceptable character was the Princess who wanted to change the kingdom and redistribute wealth. I can't take movies like this anymore.,Cinderella
1498,nicolecrandell-93132,Hmmm I want to like it.,3,7 September 2021,So I watched this money twice. Trying to see if I like it. I can't fault it completely. I understand someone had a vision and tried to execute. They took a chance. I also can't fault the actors. I really like Billy Porter in this. To my chagrin. All in all. The movie is not my cup of tea but it may resonate with other. It was flawed but at least they tried. It's better than the movie I wrote. Full disclosure I loved the Brandy version and could help but keep comparing them. Would I recommend it. Probably not. Would I watch it again. Yes possibly. I just want to see if it has redeeming qualities.,Cinderella
1499,orizarcarlot-38074,a wannabe movie at its finest,1,7 September 2021,I can't even call this a movie. It's just a big piece of sh**. Too bad there's no 0 star.,Cinderella

1502,tamaralynngomez,GLEE lover!,7,7 September 2021,"I had to create an account just so I could write an honest review. If you enjoyed the tv show Glee, or more currently Zoe's Extraordinary Playlist, you'll enjoy this modern spin on a classic tale. Several of the songs were covers and it was fun to see them appropriately woven into the tale and the mash-up was well done!My 7 and 8 year olds were dancing most of the movie the second time we watched it. Representation matters. A Latina leading female and Billy Porter as the Fabulous Godmother broke stereotypes which the world needs to see broken.Also, as a mom to two girls, it was inspiring to see a young woman being told by her family and society to fit into a mold, a mold which she then broke and took her suitor and stepmother positively along for the ride.This new Cinderella is entertaining, culturally relevant and I hope to see more films like it. Could it I have been better? Maybe, but for the budget, it was great! The choreography was AMAZING, 10 out of 10. Casting could have been better with the prince and his family and possibly the stepfamily however Camila Cabello shines and the town crier role is well done.",Cinderella

1504,darlingmkt-32278,It was the worst version of Cinderella EVER!,2,7 September 2021,"The first thing that stood out was the horrible dress designs. If you are going to destroy the original version of Cinderella and make her a dressmaker then at least let her design gorgeous dresses. They were seriously horrible and I wouldn't dress my dog in them.The second thing that ruined this movie for me was the lack of chemistry between the prince and Cinderella. I mean we watch the show for the romance...why did you take that out?The music mashups were tired...we have seen all the good mashups in Pitch Perfect. But they ruined it a step further by combining too many genres of music. It was like a very long and very bad episode of Glee. And the melismatic signing was not lip synced well and frankly it was overdone. Did anyone else notice how the sound mix was off. I mean the walking and other sounds were louder than the signing voices. It was odd.If you are looking for the happily ever after, you won't find it here.",Cinderella
1505,erisgame,WOW I didn't think it could be this bad,1,7 September 2021,I tried to like this movie but OMG is is so bad I can't even laugh at it. Stay as far away as possible. You have been warned.,Cinderella

1509,ztfktxx,I enjoyed it!,5,7 September 2021,"I think many of the reviewers took it far too serious. I actually enjoyed it. The songs were good, love the cast and there were several funny moments that I actually laughed at. (You try hunting a fox while drunk - it's very difficult!).UK Comedians Rob Beckett, James Acaster, Doc Brown and Romesh Ranganathan did great in it as did Minnie Driver, Idina Menzel and Pierce Brosnan (as expected). Camilla was also an alright actress in my opinion. Did a nice job.Take it as it's meant to be. A kids movie with some solidly performed pop songs and you'll enjoy it!",Cinderella

1520,helenliubc,Great movie!,10,8 September 2021,"I can predict why this movie gets so many 1-star reviews while I was watching it. You can tell this movie is about feminism and to be Yourself regardless of what people might think about you from the beginning. This story is about women and men who stand up to fight against the tradition. No doubt there is hate for this type of theme.All I can say is - this is great movie, great acting. You can tell they are struggling in their own life and have their own mind. They look like actual people rather some guys in a fairytale.This is a modern version of an old fairytale. I love it!",Cinderella

1522,sarinaminaee,"Sorry,but I loved it!!",10,8 September 2021,"Well everyone is saying the acting was poor,but I liked the acting,I think Camille played the part skillfully.the plot and the changes that was made,was disappointing for many,but I loved it,we're living in 21st century,women have to be heard,we shouldn't lose ourselves to money and fame and think that our comfort lies within living with a rich man. We can have dreams we can follow them and success.the fact that Cinderella of our story wasn't blond did make me think that we should come out of our childhood fantasies,and the fact that the fairy godmother wasn't at all what we had seen in the original animation made it twice interesting for me.the songs weren't original like moulin rouge,sure,but they were sung beautifully in my opinion.i loved how Cinderella wasn't some shy gall in the story,she was fierce and witty,fun to be around and she wanted to become something herself. Vivian was cruel because of her husband and the life that was forced on her and it's quite understandable because we see women everyday in our lives who didn't reach their dreams because they had to be perfect mothers and wives. I loved the change,I loved the songs,I loved the dance, I loved the plot and if you think I have a bad taste,I don't care.Hope you watch the movie and enjoy!!",Cinderella

The music was so much awesome and all the cast did a very great job...love the change in this movie.. I don't like old Cindrellaa, any of them but this edition is my favorite.. that's perfect to me.",Cinderella
1525,chicdrummer,Everything I hoped for and more!,10,8 September 2021,"I've already watched it three times and I can't stop grinning! What a fantastic new vision for a classic story.I was hesitant at first seeing Camila on the posters (especially after seeing how much a lead actress-who's not an actual actress-can tank an otherwise enjoyable reboot *cough He's All That cough*) but she was incredible. Great comedic timing, fantastic emotional delivery, obviously incredible singing voice. No doubt we'll be seeing more from her.Billy. Freaking. Porter. THIS is how you cast a musical y'all. The Fab G was definitely who I was most excited to see and she did NOT disappoint. What a genius and fun twist on the fairy godmother. Uproariously funny and THE PIPES! What an incredible talent and what an iconic performance. We've had Whitney and now we've got Billy. There will be no topping this.While we're on the subject of Broadway royalty, my second favorite update this film made was to the stepmother. Cruelty for the sake of cruelty with no real motivation has always left a sore spot for me with the stepmother. Disney's live action made an attempt but ""because you're young and innocent"" is still pretty weak reasoning. Idina gave a beautiful performance as a woman who was cruel because she knew what cruelty awaited the girls out their front door. She was Ella. A girl who wanted more and it broke her. So yes she was mean but there was a reason why. So, so good. And the mutual respect they showed each other at the end of the film... *chefs kiss*Lastly: Prince Robert's squad. I died when they all rolled up to the ball together. Something about him having his bros with him throughout the film just warmed my heart. You beautiful human!I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this film. So many laugh out loud moments. I'm a sucker for self-aware comedy in films. Just the right amount of cheese for a feel good romance. Wonderful soundtrack with some fabulous original songs. Thank you Kay Cannon! Thank you for not giving us the same old Cinderella we've already seen over and over. It's been done and, let's be real, they're untouchable so why run it again?",Cinderella

But watched it again and loved it the second time once I knew what was coming - I love Camilla cabello and Idina Menzel, and think camilla did a great job being a modern heroine.Didn't like the mice - they didn't need to be so squeaky singing along. Didn't need all the over the top Disney type costumes- I'm more of an Ever After style lady. Also, Thomas?Love billy porter and Minnie driver. Prince - really I needed rege jean-page let's be honest. Overall though I like it and we need something this positive right now.",Cinderella

1538,kellyholtz,It's different,10,9 September 2021,"It's a different spin on the tale. I like the songs chosen too. James corden is a bit cheesy. But why do all the reviewers have to overthink the whole story? What ? You don't like that a man is the fairy godmother? Why focus on that? Just ignore the fact that it included everyone and is supposedly trying to be ""politically correct"". Enjoy the story and the singing. Sad people can't enjoy a current, updated version of a classic. Seriously Cinderella basically was written during a time when women had very little rights and men were the breadwinner. It's nice to see a modern spin.",Cinderella

We already have enough the of the classic Cindrella movie the same old poor Cindrella mean step mother n sisters and a prince charming.Casting could have been better but otherwise I'll watch it again n again . Kids should watch too life is not just about a Prince charming a girl can follow her dreams and still get a prince .Those who say it is terrible well then they must be really old to think that. Not appreciating the something new .,Cinderella

1546,mindycutting,I wanted to like this soo badly....,1,9 September 2021,"SPOILERS:
There were too many changes to this movie it didn't make it any form of Cinderella. 1. Cinderella was poor and treated badly yet in this movie had enough money for gorgeous fabric and wasn't actually not trully mistreated. 2. Cinderella always dreams of finding her prince and being swept away to his castle... In this, she decides to NOT marry the prince and keep her freedoms and to not even put a ""label"" on their relationship. 3. There's just too many to put in here. Great cast of characters, but bad plot line and over acting. They needed to not force the changes to make it millenial friendly is what I have to say. STOP DOING THIS! This was NOT Cinderella's story so change the name please!",Cinderella

1553,EssenceSeeker,"As A Feminist, I Have Issues With This",4,10 September 2021,"I appreciate when writers are deliberate with their messages and up-date issues in old storylines, but I fear when it's done like this, it doesn't help. This up-dated take on Cinderella is forced and dissatsifying. Feminism isn't about switching roles (spoiler: the prince now becomes the princess' side-kick), it's about empowering women, not about disempowering men. Also, if a female character is empowered in a new way in a classic story, that shouldn't mean that the story becomes worse, an empowered woman should improve the story (otherwise what message does that send?, plus it doesn't make sense). If the king could easily decide to make his daughter queen, it should have been easy for him to arrange for the future queen (Cinderella) to be a dressmaker. The whole conflict that makes her choose her passion over the prince seems constructed and unreal. In the end, the storyline forces the prince into the position that Cinderella rejected. That's a really unhealthy relationship dynamic. That's not what feminism is about.",Cinderella

1555,claudiareoyo,Watch drunk,2,10 September 2021,"I was told to watch the movie because ""it is actually good"" after I found the ads to be annoying. I was right.-It tries to be both Hamilton and Moulin Rouge in the way they chose their jukebox music.The song choices often felt misplaced.The motivation to make the prince dumb/go against the grain was lost.The way they set up the princess to end up ruling seemed like a last minute detail they threw in to act more progressive.musical numbers went on longer than they needed toCamila often fell flat in her singingthe villains never really stay villains long because SUDDENLY they need to be good peopleI feel like they should've gone campy overboard. The fabulous God mother is a great example of that over-the-top it should have been.Only watch while drunk.",Cinderella

Some can even say that it's comparable to the 2017 hit movie musical ""The Greatest Showman"". With its all across the board incredible cast and gorgeous soundtrack, this movie gives you no choice but to smile. Camila Cabello does a fantastic job in her acting debut by effortlessly and naturally coming off as witty. No doubt, working alongside talents like Idina Menzel and Billy Porter only made sense. That being said, I leave you with this. Turn the movie on for just 15 minutes and you'll find yourself watching the entire thing.",Cinderella

It was fun singing along with my daughter to songs that were already familiar. I liked that it was similar to other Cinderella movies and the twist was fine, didn't ruin any part of the movie. She still gets her kiss from a prince in the end! I have never written a review but I wanted to help this one along! I've seen a lot of Cinderella movies and this was definitely one of the most fun ones! There are plenty that are much worse.

To those who don't like it... Kick rocks... I'll watch it over and over again for me and you too lol 😂!!! Love it and Camila Cabello!!! Stop hating!!! 😂",Cinderella
1563,kateabbott-01151,Just Change The Title,7,11 September 2021,"Most reviews on here is bashing this movie because it's not true to Cinderella - and it's not. The forever cruel stepmother and sisters are just humans, the lead has ambition and goals, the prince is an actual character, it's in on its own stereotype. But guys, it's not the worst story. Can it be improved? Absolutely. I can think of a dozen things that might patch things up. But do I like seeing modern songs cut into a female-forward storyline that encourages girls to put themselves first!? Of course! It's a great leisure watch. If you had named this movie anything else, it would easily gain a few stars from most of the haters. Maybe just mentally call it ""Ella""?",Cinderella

1565,ujwaltikhe,I AM A PART OF RHYTHM NATION,10,11 September 2021,"Cinderella of the older times wanted to marry the prince to make her life good. But, Camila version is something really different , A girl who want to make her life through her own struggle (what could be more better). The ""MILLION TO ONE"" is the best music I have heard in my life.I still laugh really hard whenever I remember the scene when the mice turned human and Camila said "" You guys are men, I thought mice are women "" ( something like that : ) and one of those mice fall because he can't balance without tail (I mean it's really funny).I never know that Camila has these talent too. Her voice is really Magical enough that if you ask the Butterfly genie (or whatever it is ) to give me something like that , then he will reply "" Magic has its own limitations "" lol.",Cinderella

What's wrong with people?!The old Cinderella's fairytale was awful. A weak girl who can't say no to anyone!Really how can you say it ruined that??This Cinderella (or we should say it right, Ella) corrected the old version!This is how it really should be :)
Just loved it.",Cinderella
1567,ashleyqcravens,Confused by bad reviews??? It's amazing fun with great music.,10,11 September 2021,"I have never once written a review, ever. But I am confused as to why someone couldn't enjoy this movie. It's a well acted, modern, empowering, fun movie with amazing music.People need to lighten up and stop hating.",Cinderella
1568,christinalukiewski,I can't believe a movie could be this horrible!,1,11 September 2021,"I wanted to turn it off 3 minutes in but I persevered.Do NOT believe any review that gave it a 4 or above. All of the verbiage in those reviews are the same: funny, hilarious, woke, haters, etc. Those are most likely paid for.My first complaint is the music. Remember in A Knight's Tale when they used modern songs and it worked and turned out great? This movie uses more modern songs but they've change the arrangements and almost all of the actors could not sing. I can't believe that they had a musical with so many of the actors not being able to sing on key. The music seemed rushed and out of place. It does not create a smooth flow with the story. I don't think I can explain clearly enough how terrible the music, the arrangement, and the singing is in this movie.Secondly, there is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters in the movie. If the premise of the movie was supposed to be completely changed into a girl power motto, then maybe it would've made sense but as it is, the stepmother and stepsisters are supposedly still evil in this remake. Although everyone in the family supposedly treats Cinderella as a slave and verbally abuses her, the viewer does not feel the distain by the step mother and step sisters nor any sympathy for Cinderella The Prince and Cinderella were lukewarm with no spark when they acted together. The only real emotion sensed was the King being evil. There's no character development so you don't have any empathy or feelings whatsoever towards the characters.For all of these reviews saying that people are giving it low reviews because they don't like change and the wokeness of it you would expect there to be a lot more diversity in the cast. I believe that it was only the fairy god-parent that went astray from earlier adaptations. If they had cut down the length of the songs a little there were plenty of opportunities to insert other things into the script. If you consider a woman who wants a career and ambition beforehand or instead of getting married, I guess they consider that woke as well.Also, this movie is not funny. This movie is not hilarious. There are a few one liners that invoked a smirk at best. I found more humor in the original animated Cinderella. The director or writer or someone definitely squandered the opportunity to increase Billy Porter's screen time to pepper more humor into the script. The problem isn't that people need to suspend their beliefs, the problem is that the movie is vacuous and shallow and just plain boring. The costumes, set, and cinematography are mediocre. No amount of ""lightening up"" or ""stoppage of hate"" will make this movie palatable.I signed up for an account just so I could leave this review because I don't want anyone to waste almost 2 hours of their time hoping that this movie will get better.",Cinderella
1569,joshuacallaway-08105,It was awful,1,11 September 2021,If you tore out the true premise of the movie and filled it with garbage that was the entire movie. My teenage daughter thought it was awful and suggesting her friends to not watch it.,Cinderella
1570,sofiecarmen,Foolish Movie/No Logic,1,11 September 2021,"I don't understand why this story was made as Cinderella.Why did the Prince had to rush finding a wife to marry to become the King, and in the end his sister became the Queen without a husband??The songs throughout the movie sounded to be advertisements. This was more like a musical of something else other than Cinderella. Come on!After the ball, it seemed to be they didn't have enough time to do a story, it became all in a rush... Lol..",Cinderella

1578,katharinefabro,Wonderful Take on a Classic,10,12 September 2021,This film had the perfect mix of classic Cinderella mixed with changes in the plot which made it a pleasure to watch. If I wanted to see the exact story of Cinderella I could have watched any of the 10000 versions that already exist. This film is in a league of its own. The soundtrack was EXCELLENT. So many remixes of well known jams plus a few well written originals. A lighthearted movie with humor and music that made it a joy to watch (even for my husband who claims to hate musicals).,Cinderella
1579,michaelrenzi,Amazing interpretation on a classic for a modern time,10,12 September 2021,This movie is a great retelling on how Cinderella should of been. Women empowerment! It's not about getting married to a man to find happiness. It's about following your dreams and putting yourself first. Great acting & amazing songs for the new generation!,Cinderella
1580,mjcano-44427,EMPOWERING take on a classic story,9,12 September 2021,"I enjoyed every minute! The empowerment demonstrated and encouraged should not go unappreciated! I admire how this story has been utilized over time to break the status quo and push boundaries. This is coming from somebody who loves the Rogers and Hammerstein version, which is still my favorite!The amount of negativity about this film is extremely disappointing, but I guess ""nothing is impossible, things are happening every day.

1582,awest-23961,not enough focus on the plot,7,12 September 2021,"The songs were such an interesting twist as they are familiar to the audience. I will say that no cover of Queen's ""Somebody to Love"" will ever beat Hathaway's in Ella Enchanted for me. That aside, ""Whatta Man""/ ""Seven Nation Army,"" ""Dream Girl,"" and ""Material Girl"" are my favorite from the movie.Cast wise, i was excited by all the familiar faces; however, i have never seen a movie with Galitzine. He does have an intriguing energy when he acts; i'm excited to see him in more films.The plot was highly enjoyable and unexpected, but i felt that the movie itself was more about the songs than the plot or romance. The mice were a huge part of the sideline comedy and were highly entertaining. Cabello wasn't my cup of tea in this unfortunately. There were times where i found her acting poor, but i did highly enjoy her blunt, funny moments. I also love the fairy godmother! It is such an interesting twist!Overall, this movie sparked with creativity and energy. (energy as in my cat and i got up and danced during their remake of Sheeran's ""Perfect""). As mentioned earlier, this is a movie that i felt relied on the songs much more than the plot or romance between our characters. It was a light, satisfying film, but i doubt i will watch it again except for a way to pass the time.",Cinderella

1585,abreenj-30200,"Had potential, but couldn't reach it.",1,12 September 2021,"This movie had a lot going for it with the cast. But overall this script and weird song choices didn't allow them to shine or showcase their talents.I am all for a diverse cast, updated societal values, and female empowerment. I just don't think this film hit the mark. At some points the script felt like it was written by someone older trying to be cool, using millennial lanugage incorrectly at points. The whole movie felt forced. I understand wanting to give this classic a spin. If your going to do a huge alteration on the storyline of a classic, give it a different name to change the exceptions and standards for this movie.There was a lack of character development on characters that could have been a really bright spot. The princess could have been a shinning light of female empowerment, but just hid around the palace and jumped out shouted progressive ideas every now and then and then was dismissed. The prince just fell flat for me, with almost feminized growth. He went from a party boy to following a girl like a puppy (giving up everything to travel with ""no labels"" girl who is traveling with a beficator).With the town crier, I felt like they were trying to mimic the merry men from Robin Hood Men in Tights, with trying to give the narration an up approach just felt out of place and not on the same dynamic as the rest of the movie.Overall watching this movie was like watching a car accident. I just couldn't look away and kept watching for a redeeming quality. But unfortunately more and more cringlworthy parts were in store for me.",Cinderella

I thought it was so sweet, and different from any other ""Cinderella"" movie I've seen. If it was the same that would be so boring. I loved the sister aspect, and how it showed women wanting to pursue their own dreams instead of the whole, ""save me, prince charming"" vibe.If that's what you wanted watch the Disney or live action version.

Example: The fairy godmother was a fairy godfather-AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING A FAIRY GODFATHER!I don't feel like there was a whole lot of real acting, just famous people being themselves trying to be funnier. I did laugh, because it was so bad.

Yes, the godmother was male. And yes, there are a lot of songs.... but you could tell all that from a preview. If you aren't into that kind of movie, don't watch it.

1616,siewwen-33248,The character motivations make no sense.,1,16 September 2021,"I'm a woman so i'm all for feminism but the plot of this movie is so stupid. The characters make no sense.In life everyone always says at the end of your life what you will cherish the most is not your job, but your relationships. If Ella didn't love the prince her decision to be seamstress to a stranger woman on her ship while she travels around the world would seem ok (just a bit like a slave master relationship maybe) but if she loved the prince shouldn't she have been more conflicted about her decision? A job is never worth the ones your love.And what about the prince? Would his decision to give up the crown just to follow Ella around the world while she works (even if he claims he didn't want it) haunt him? Look at the psychological stress on stay-at-home dads who feel doubts about their self-worth even though they have accomplished much. How is this even a healthy relationship? How useless can the prince be?And the weirdest is the stepmother. It's like the movie didn't know what to do with her, go pure evil, semi sympathetic, pure evil again or I don't know. Why force her to marry Thomas though she claims she wants what is achievable for Ella? If she truly believed that she should get married and give up her career, then why not at least try to push her towards the prince again? She purposely went with Option C, the least desirable one just for the sake of injecting some drama into this movie. And at the end she's suddenly sympathetic and happy for Ella again. WTF.And the princess too. She's supposed to be smart, and yet every action of hers is her failing to read the room. Or at least mildly trying to manipulate the people around her. How would she make a good ruler at all, someone with no EQ.At the rate i'm going, the only people who are not objectionable are the mice and fairy godfather. The rest are just awful.

Certain things were questionable like the prince's behavior at the beginning and etc but what isn't in Disney movies anyway?

Idena gives a great human side to the step mother and pierce brosnan was hilarious. Minnie driver was great. Camilla and the price were fantastic. Ignore the haters and give this a chance.

1650,jsookie,Terrible-Not worth watching,1,28 September 2021,"I have never written a bad review before but, in this case, I think it's necessary. The most disappointing part of this movie was that this was a wonderful and talented cast but the writing and storyline were so bad that even a great cast could not save this. In this retelling of Cinderella I lost respect for the prince, who didn't care about his kingdom, people, or responsibilities. He just followed her around like a lost puppy while she never showed appreciation or commitment of any kind towards him. There was no compromise in this relationship at all. It was a one-sided love where the prince gave up everything for her, with no thought to anyone else, and she simply accepted his sacrifices, giving nothing in return. She initially rejected him and only changed her mind because she got everything she wanted, on her terms alone, and with no thought towards what he had given up. They didn't have a discussion about whether he should make those sacrifices and they didn't discuss how to make her dream come true without him losing his station in life. For his part, the prince exercised very poor judgement throughout the story and didn't show any maturity or growth. Again, this was extremely bad writing. Fans of Cinderella, please don't waste your time watching this. It was so disappointing.",Cinderella

The movie has fun and believable characters with real depth and dimension, fantastic costumes, dazzling choreography, a thought-provoking perspective, and a powerful cast. It is dazzling and irreverent and subversive in ways some folks might not understand, but that we should all celebrate. It asks us to question our assumptions about every character, from the ""evil stepmother"" to the ""Prince Charming"", and everyone in between. I was shocked at how powerful, beautiful, and FUN the movie was, and disappointed in how misunderstood it is in some of these reviews. Watch it with an open mind and enjoy the magic.",Cinderella

I think it speaks more on who the 'average' audience member is than the entertainment quality itself. The movie was fun, current, alive, & maybe too 'progressive' for the Trumper class expecting your tired old Anglo Saxon misogynistic Princess routine. If you're that crowd- skip it- you'll hate it. The ahead of her time (some might say 'feminist') Cinderella with bigger dreams than merely chasing a Prince, multicultural cast, gender bending 'Fabulous Godmother', interracial relationship, funky spins on musical numbers, politically outspoken Princess, called out ridiculous King, & so on & so on- will totally offend you & your ""Make America Great Again"" aspirations- but if you're anyone else give it a go! You might just love the spin they put on this & be excited about sharing it with your young child like I did!

Could hold her own in a musical which news dash, she can't. Out of every cinderella remake this has to be by far my least favorite. I didn't like this at all. Camilla is no Cinderella.

Camilla's vocals are impeccable. Words can't describe how much I loved it! My new favourite movie.I don't know why there is so much hate to this, I think people just don't understand that this movie wasn't made for older generations, it was made for the new audience, and me personally think it is outstanding.

For Me....",6,29 October 2021,"This is not the original to say the least, but in another way captures modern technology's way of making things like special effects and costumes exceptionally beautiful. The snarky tone of joke telling was too much for my old fashioned ways, as it is seemingly aimed at the young cool or older cool people. I loved the costumes, exceptionally done. This movie is also focusing more on women's empowerment in certain aspects, which is nice, but took a major shift for me in the in doing in this particular story. Overall, the musical scenes are great, but made me a bit uncomfortable with the cool factor added in before the emotional songs. A magical movie, but takes adjusting if you're old fashioned or emotionally sensitive to snarky attitudes.",Cinderella

The super woke plot is hot garbage. India Mendel's talents were completely wasted in this movie. The songs are entertaining but fall flat for the most part feeling like generic karaoke. There's no chemistry between Cinderella and the prince. They completely ruined the original plot since they know each other through the whole film. Cinderella isn't oppressed like the original character. They missed the mark wirh the evil stepmother and stepsisters. It would have been 100% better with the original music from the animated Disney film. And somehow they make the awesomely charismatic James Cordon super annoying and unlikeable.

While I wouldn't say it was the greatest version of Cinderella I've ever seen, it was still cute and fun to watch.SPOILERS:

The world is more accepting and it's time we finally get to see different people playing different roles and breaking stereotypes Second, it's not a danger to your children! This movie shows nothing dangerous and harmful to children. Why? Because Billy porter is playing Fabulous Godmother and wears sparkles?! I didn't know that was dangerous! Please. Kids don't care...parents care. They are the harmful ones. Lastly! WHY ON EARTH would anyone ANOTHER classic fairytale. Cinderella is a story that's been done 1000 times and everytime it's the exact same. This showcases a twist on the story! Cinderella doesn't need. Man. She doesn't even want the prince at first and even openly mocks him! She's a strong, confident woman who gets joy out of life by her passion to create art! Even when she's presented with a choice of the prince or her business, she turns down love! There are hints to the OG fairytale but even the stepsisters in this one are not as cruel. The one liners are funny, the music is fun and the movie had me ""ooh and ahhh"" many times! It's a completely new and fresh take on the story and I think it's a missed opportunity for anyone who chooses not to watch! Also that cast is really great! Watch the movie!!",Cinderella
1697,tayroni66,JUST THE KIND OF MOVIE WE NEED RIGHT NOW,10,4 September 2021,"With everything happening in the world (and in Texas) right now, an empowering movie showing girls and young women that we have a choice in life is more than necessary. Make it entertaining, feel-good, fun and full of singalong classics and a sure-to-be-Oscar-nominated original in ""Million to One"" from star Camila Cabello and you've got something the whole family can enjoy and watch over and over (I know my daughter and I will!).A great cast that doesn't take itself too seriously (like some of the critics of this movie seem to) delivers one-liners provided by writer/director, the fabulous Kay Cannon (Pitch Perfect, Blockers) in a retelling for the 2020s. This Ells, played by Cabello in a brilliant debut, is sassy, funny and confident (and her voice is divine!). She has a dream and no Prince, no matter how cute or how much she loves him, is going to get in the way. Neither is her not-quite-evil stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel). It's her Fab G, played by scene-stealer and award-winner Billy Porter, who casts a spell to send her off to the ball in her uncomfortable glass slippers, but the ending is anything but fairytale.Modern classic songs and fabulous costumes and choreography are scattered throughout the film to get you singing along and stomping your feet, the love story is adorable, the King and Queen were hilarious, daughter Princess Gwen a breath of fresh air, the stepsisters not so ugly in looks or character were delightful.There were some totally laugh out loud moments and at the end I realised the only times I hadn't been smiling or laughing were the times I shed a tear or two. So for a fun night grab some popcorn and your favourite people, throw away any pre-conceived ideas and prejudices and enjoy this lovely movie. I will be rewatching every time I am feeling like the world is getting a little too real.",Cinderella

I'm pretty fussy about movies in general, particularly remakes and revisions, but Cinderella was a story begging for a change. Lighthearted, charming, great sets and costumes, good dancing, and 5 voices good enough to give me goosebumps. Relax and enjoy it.",Cinderella
1714,mdierksen88,Lackluster,3,9 September 2021,"The music did not do this film any favors. They used some great songs from legendary artists, and they all fell flat. The original (I think) pieces were not at all enthralling and did nothing to progress the story or elevate anything or evoke emotion. Billy Porter was the high note. His entrance, the outfit, the attitude. Should have had more screen time. Some funny one-liners, but nothing at all meaningful. No one in this cast should sing. None of them sound like they've had any training, to be perfectly frank. Overall, very disappointed.",Cinderella

1720,rebelruthi,Worst Cinderella movie made,1,4 September 2021,"Cinderella with humans was made years ago with Tony Braxton. Whitney Houston was the Godmother. The rest of the cast was diversified. All singers and dancers and it was a replica of the movie from the 1960's with Walter Pigeon and Ginger Rogers. Its members were of different races. There was less singing in the Cinderella movies from years gone by. Also the cartoon movies that Disney made were more enjoyable.Cinderella's dress wasn't in her size. Her top was way too big for her breasts and chest. She bounced around so much you could almost see her boobs.Billy Porter, who I have no clue who he is, got my attention with his gorgeous outfit and his magical want. I didn't notice a black gay man. I noticed a wonderful man in gold, who was or should have been the fairy godfather, but he made a great godmother just the same, esp had he shaved off his mustache. From a glowing butterfly to a golden godmother.The music was too much and the songs were ""niche good"". Less music and more acting.The prince fell in love too soon in the movie. They both fell in love with each other, but he wanted a princess and she wanted her Clothes made by Ella. Did they ever agree on that. And the foreign queen wanted Ella to pack up and leave right away. What about the Royal Marriage first. I was surprised that the princess became the Queen. And her brother was still the Royal Prince.",Cinderella

1722,ryan-stromek,Nothing Wrong With Cute,10,4 September 2021,"I'm not sure why this movie is being so hated. It's silly, sure, but it's very cute. All movies don't need to be extremely deep. That being said, can we talk about how the stepmother was given more depth than any other Cinderella movie has before? I absolutely appreciated her not just being this flat, selfish character. This movie also accomplished what I feel Ella Enchanted failed to (I LOVED the book, but the movie was awful). It was quirky, made fun of itself, and relentlessly mixed time periods. It was a great family movie, and I laughed and sang out loud with my daughter through-out the entirety.",Cinderella
1723,elisheva2453,Adorably Hilarious,10,12 September 2021,Love this modern twist on the classic Cinderella tale. Good cast of celebrities and great music. Overall a wonderful movie to enjoy with friends or family. Can't wait to watch it again!,Cinderella
1724,samd0001,Don't listen to the negative reviews,10,5 September 2021,"I saw this without looking at the rating and was shocked when I saw all the low ratings! I thought the costumes were spectacular, the music entertaining and a lot of fun, and Ella's acting was terrific. Then I read the critic reviews and didn't agree with a single thing they said! The costumes were confusing? Why, because they didn't stick to boring period pieces. They dared to be creative! Oh the horror. The story didn't match the original? That's the point! Instead of making Cinderella some poor wench whose only prospect is marrying the 2 bit prince they gave her a real dream. Even more, they are giving countless children a real dream. They had an obvious feminine agenda? If you think the original fairy tale didn't have its own agenda (frankly, the exact opposite message) you don't understand the purpose of fairy tales. In this case, dare to dream! You don't need to rely on a man to make your dreams come true. But that doesn't mean you have to shut out love. It's a nice message. The characters were too slapstick and shallow? See the original... In this version, at least I felt like I could relate to the stepmother, the king is still a tool, but the prince was actually cool! I love how they made the silver chained pocket watch the prince wore look like something a modern rebellious teenager would wear. I loved how they adapted old songs to something a younger generation will enjoy. Pay attention to the lyrics. There are subtle changes to adapt it to the Medieval setting. So much fun to see! Do you have to suspend reality a bit to enjoy the film? Sure, it's a Disney movie. What did you expect, Shakespeare or Voltaire? But the story is endearing. The morale that children should follow their dreams even if sometimes our parents let their own failures guide them is pertinent and valuable. How many little girls have real parents like the step-mother? How many little girls have parents like the original step mother who locked Cinderella in a basement and made her live as an abject slave? This story is more relatable to a younger generation and enjoyable to watch for older folks too. I think there will be many little girls driving the rest of their family crazy watching this film over and over again. That's what a Disney movie should be!",Cinderella

1728,mkroeger16,Changing Stereotypes,7,11 September 2021,"I see a lot of negative reviews for this film. I disagree with most of them. This film was not meant to be serious or meant to replace the classic tale we all know and love. This film was just meant to be a fun interpretation and challenge societal perceptions. Not only is Cinderella not some ""damsel in distress"", waiting for someone else to come save her, she wants to save herself and to be a businesswoman. Even today, it can be hard for women to be taken seriously when they want to have their own business and this film touches on that.They also touch on the patriarchy where the royal line tended to only go to the male heir. Yes, in history there were legendary female rulers, but the monarchy still tried to always to go the male heir unless left without a choice. It is clear that the prince doesn't really want the throne and that his sister has brilliant ideas to help the people and wants to be in charge.Another issue they address is how woman who marry powerful men can feel like they have no voice and are simply ornaments. They also change how Cinderella's step-mother is perceived as well. In this film she is the ""evil"" step-mother. She truly does care for Cinderella and wants to take care of her but she was raised where women HAVE to marry for money in order to survive. This is still a common belief today, where society still doesn't pay women an equal wage let alone a living wage.One of the best challenges they did was casting Billy Porter as the godmother. He brings a great and unique flare to the character. Billy Porter is an amazing idol who makes a statement in everything he does. He is definitely someone to look up to.The music in this film is fun, energetic, and classic. The choices fit the moment and assist in telling the story with a creative flare. They mix both new pieces and classic songs.I think this movie is worth the watch when you just want to have a fun family movie night.",Cinderella

I look to most films solely for entertainment and enjoyment, and that is how I rate the films I watch.Everyone has their own opinions when it comes to remaking a classic. I can agree that the changes in the storyline, the added messages, and the lack of depth can leave one wanting more from this film. However, I did find myself laughing along, swaying & singing to the music, and enjoying the modern hints to the movie. If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is not it.

It's probably my favorite of all the Cinderella movies & I HATE musical movies. But this one is great.

Sure there's a message of the empowerment of women. But think of your little girls how would you feel if someone told your baby girl she couldn't do something because she was a woman. Little girls should see women achieving their dreams against all odds! Little girls should see a woman that has a man that not only loves her for who she is but encourages her to achieve everything she wants in the world. Prince Robert didn't just save Ella they helped each other and Ella didn't just cry woe as me she fought for her dreams . I will agree that as lovely as James Corden is he doesn't need to be apart of every single new musical. Camilla was lovely and found myself in stitches with Billy Porter. Give it a fair shot don't just listen to the reviews! Form your own opinion!,Cinderella

Cinderella is my favourite besides all the other Disney princesses. I loved it! It had everything I was thinking it was going to have. I've seen so many Cinderella movies and this had it's unique quality to it, it was funny and original songs. It was nice to recognize some songs. I knew more songs in this movie than in any other movie. It really was nice to see that they kept some stuff from Cinderella movies. Even added their own twists. My best advice is to go and watch it. Don't judge a book by it's cover! It's unique in it's own way. If all the Cinderella movies were the same would they be fun to watch? No! All of them got to be unique in it's own way, like all of us.",Cinderella

There was so much representation in this movie such as a gender fluid fab g, a latin princess, a desi princess and more! They even touched on important topics such as misogyny and women's rights alongside with breaking stereotypes. I loved Camila as Cinderella, she exceeded my expectations and everyone did a fantastic job. The music was so so good and I completely fell in love with the characters. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie and was close to tears several times. This is the only cinderella my kids will watch in the future, I'm so proud to be a part of a more progressive, less stereotypical generation.

I love the original Cinderella and majority of the spin offs, but this was horrible. I enjoyed some of the musical songs but there were only a few original songs and the rest included various old and new songs that just didn't work like 'Lets get loud"", it gave off a Spanish vibe that just didn't make sense with the rest of the music and context of the movie. Just found the movie to be pretty long for a poorly presented 'Cinderella' storyline and character development.Also I'm all for ""girl power"" but it's a bit much having it brought up basically throughout the whole movie.Does not deserve the title ""Cinderella"", if you want to make a spin off or want to change the entire storyline then give it a different title!",Cinderella

They marketed this film as Cinderella focusing on her passion instead of just the love story, that means of course it's going to stray from the original movie. And as for the reviews saying the movie is too ""woke"", they are shining a light on all of the blatant issues that happened during that time period and in the original film.

1813,nmdibble,This isn't Cinderella,2,4 September 2021,"I was really hoping from the commercials that they were going to lean into more of a satirical take on the age-old adage of falling in love with someone after one night, however this movie takes itself to seriously. I didn't feel any connection between the prince and Ella, and they changed to any of the building blocks to allow this to be a Cinderella telling.The stepmother does not hate Ella, she really just wants her to marry rich so that she does not have to suffer for the rest of her life. All she wants is her family to marry up in the world, which was extremely common for the times. The stepmother does not have to hate Ella per se, however it is extremely out of character when she spills ink all over her dress and then pulls her hair, even the stepsisters are confused by it.The prince is just obnoxious. He's not grounded in reality at all, and I actually felt like he looked like a pirate before the movie even made that joke. I did somewhat enjoy the addition of princess Gwen, however she was also too over the top.I don't really see a point in of this story, and one moment they're telling you to follow your dreams, and another they're telling you marriage should only be for love. There is also no character development throughout the movie. Ella starts off dreaming that she could open a dress shop, she does not end up opening a dress shop. The prince starts as an immature child, and ends as an immature child. The king starts off as a hypersensitive overly masculine character who likes to put his wife down, and while he shows his wife some love and respect later in the movie, he doesn't change as a character. Gwen spends the whole movie popping up from behind portraits and stating something about poverty.The original songs were not bad, however all of the licensed material I skipped through. It was too cringy and two over the top. James Corden was particularly bad and he had a horror segment I feel like. And one scene where he's changing back into a mouse, the mouse remains with a human head and proceeds to scream in Ella's face for about 5 seconds. None of the other mice do this.This movie is run time is also obnoxiously long. It comes in at just under 2 hours somehow. The stepmother also figures out that Cinderella was the one at the ball, and encourages her to marry the prince. For some reason Ella does not want this. She wants to be her own boss, which brings me to another issue I have with this movie. They push the girl boss narrative so bad that they do not acknowledge the amount of power a queen has and how she can change the kingdom for the better with her progressive ideas. Instead she wants to open a dress shop. That's all fine, however the movie never addresses why she doesn't feel like she can be a princess while still managing and working her own shop.Overall this did not feel like a Cinderella retelling in any way. It would have been fine if they had dropped the Cinderella farce and had made it an original fairy tale-esque story.",Cinderella
1814,lansfordcarla,This is what?The 3rd Cinderella movie. It's been modernized before,10,15 September 2021,"I hate to see so many people criticize the movie as if it was up for an Oscar. This is a cute movie to encourage girls to think about themselves first. In the end the guy can decide to either support her or let her go. He picks her. I can go into why people would hate the story, maybe to close to when Harry met Meg? Anyone in a loving marriage understands that it is give and take and tons of supporting each other. This movie just makes it clear with no smoke screens. We complain that fairy tales give girls unrealistic ideas and then slam a movie when it makes it not so perfect. I hate to see the hate.",Cinderella

A woman can run a business, rule the kingdom or do whatever she desires with support of all around her.

I did however think when Ella sung the first song that it was going to be awful as the sound/acting didn't really sync up correctly, the same for ellas next song too, it seemed like production could have tweeked it more as it just didn't sound quite right, far too autotuned, loud and lagging but then the rest of the songs worked well. The godmother and rest of the cast were great, I loved the songs and dances and the sets were perfect.

I'm a huge fan of Disney growing up and so was intrigued to now find a 2021 version, which was surprisingly witty & captured my attention throughout the entire movie. I love musicals, & the modern song choices were on point for every scene. Super cute!!! I sincerely do not understand all the low ratings & complaints I'm seeing. I laughed out loud on quite a few moments. Plot twist towards the end of the movie, I'm not too sure about how I feel about it, which is why I gave this rating a 9 but really I would've given 9.5!

1821,oreasa,Just no.,1,9 September 2021,"To be honest from the get go: I'm not theat big on either romance, coming of age or musicals at the best of times, but i decided to watch this because i really like Camila. But this... This.As a horribly movie addicted person I've come across my fare share of cringe over the years, but this movie had me wanting to skip so many scenes, that I was completely relieved when it was finally over.I feel absolutely no need to comment the story, because we all know how it goes - even if they deviated from the original the slightest bit. The story baseline stayed the same and so this has no part in what i thought about the movie as a wholle. I'll spare you a lengthy description of the story and just get to what i actually want to say.I get the need to take a new spin on old stuff, to freshen up storys and trying to put them in modern day context, but this mushy soup of mainstreamed ""this is how we have to think today"" messages feels just forced and predictable. In their need to conform to sending the right messages, they made their characters malleable and bland. Absolutely none of the characters feel honest, none of them are even the slightest bit believable or relatable. Same goes for the characters relationships. They all lack depth, even if you can (at times) see the well intentioned but ultimately badly acted out character ""strengths"" or ""growths"".It all feels shallow.Sad to say, that not even the music was able to save this one. Camila's Voice showed none of her usual finesse in the songs, it was always just sing-screaming and powering through...
And even the great Idina Menzel couldn't convince me. Her ""Material Girl"" was slightly amusing, but while you had abolutely no connection to her character, you actually couldn't have cared less.I tried to be open in hopes of getting surprised by this movie, and surprise me it did. But unfortunately it just showed me, that it is even way worse than I had suspected it to be.Even if you are a fan of one of the actors or singers, do yourself a favor and skip this one.There is no gain whatsoever by watching this.",Cinderella

It was a pleasant surprise to see even more British comedians pop up (excluding Corden, I cannot stand that man, I wish he had not been in it.) but not even that could make it a good movie for me. Costuming was strange, Camilla's voice is sub par, and even though I like that it was trying to be progressive it was trying really hard to do so.

1849,afondmemory,Bad!,1,10 September 2021,"Bad.Poorly written.Too bright.I would have turned this movie off within the first 5 minutes, if I wasn't entranced by the production budget shown in juxtaposition to how awful the use of song and dialogue are, let alone shot sequence and storyline.Who let them dO THIS?There is no emotional draw. It is almost as if they said ""this story has been told too many times how do we tell it in a way where the reviews aren't that bad."" An alternative storyline where the don't tell the storyline at all. The dialogue is the length of that of a children's flip book and the depth of a pop song.Let's not even get into the use of music and lyrics in the movie. The lack of writing therefore transitioned into the lack of creative direction.Colors threw up on the screen in a bad way. I almost did too.A single earring and puka shells. We're DiFfeRenT. Costuming then became where each person hand sew their own outfit at the craft table backstage.I love the fact that this feels like a Camilla Cabello music video made for my mom. So basically...I loved the movie/huge fan. I'm just a lowly t*k t*k user without standards of film or function and this is my favorite one! Groovy!My nipples are hard just thinking of the princes' leather petticoat!We don't have to put a label on it...

While this may not be considered the best movie of 2021 by the standards of stuffy, jaded critics I've added it to my favorite of the year list. It has talented actors with amazing voices, beautiful sets, costumes, and musical production. Enough of the classic fairy tale whimsy to be recognizable, but with modern sensibilities, music, and humor. Cinderella has always been one of the most bland of the fairy tales so seeing a more empowered message for boys and girls to follow their dreams is a refreshing take. If people really have a problem with a woman wanting a career and someone to love then that is just sad. My family loved it, my daughter has a strong but compassionate princess to look up to, and we will be watching it multiple times in the future.",Cinderella

Camilla Cabello is as enchanting as ever and a fierce advocate for defying the odds to become something u never imagined you could be. A role model for all our daughters.

But it's lacking the angst and longing of the original. Cinderella was a simple, sweet girl who was deserving of a happy life, but instead was dealt a sad, difficult life with the loss of her beloved father. As a result, she became the imprisoned servant of her mean step-mother and inept, spoiled step-sisters. None of this seems to be acknowledged or showcased in this film.",Cinderella

1887,akane-51938,Surprised it wasn't terrible,7,4 September 2021,"As I looked through the reviews after watching the movie, I was surprised they were so low. I noticed a lot of people griping about the plot being ""woke"" or not being strictly adherent to the traditional fairytale - or, heaven forbidden the fabulous godmother is played by a man. I personally think that if those are the worst things about a movie, it's not that bad at all.I was a little apprehensive going into this movie. I didn't know anything about it other than it was a Cinderella musical with Camila Cabello and Idina Menzel, but that was enough for me to give it a shot. When I realized they were using some famous pop songs for some of the numbers, my nervousness went up (especially when the audio syncing in the first Camila song was off and she looked like she was badly lip syncing. That got better in later songs.). But as I kept watching, the slight plot modernizations to the traditional tale grew on me, and the familiar songs were well incorporated. I liked how the step mother and sisters were humanized in a realistic way, and Cinderella wasn't just looking for a prince to save her, but realized having one love her was a nice bonus. Minnie Driver was a joy, and Pierce Brosnan clearly had some fun with his role. In fact, it looked like the whole cast had some fun with this. Yes, there were some cliche or cringe moments, and I wasn't super enamored with the 2 main dresses, but the sparkle on the second one was spectacular, so I was willing to overlook the interesting pleating in the back.Overall, I liked it. It's not the pinnacle of cinematic masterpieces, but it doesn't need to be. It has a good message, and it's generally a fun time. That's good enough for me.",Cinderella

The music is great!!,6,1 October 2021,"I've seen all the other Cinderella movies as well and though this one is a bit of a women's lib telling of it, I enjoyed the music and the dancing. It's great background noise if you're doing something else. I actually really liked it!! Camilla Cabello is adorable as Ella. She can certainly sing!! Billy Porter is interesting as the Godmother. Quite frankly, I didn't watch it for a few weeks because I wasn't sure about him playing in that role. But after I watched it, I was blown away by his voice and his range! You can tell his background is Broadway. I would say this version of Cinderella is more for adults than kids. If you are like me and your kids grew up in the 80's, you'll recognize a lot that music. Perfect by Ed Sheeran is a sweet moment at the ball between Ella and Prince Robert. I have the movie on when I'm painting (artist) and I find my feet tapping. So it's not the beautiful movie that Disney made a few years ago. It's still great singing, fun dancing, a few laughs, and a different ending.

1901,oooamandaa,New Wave Cinderella,7,12 September 2021,"I'll start off with a new things I didn't like. Cinderella was like a PG version of Moulin Rouge which just can't be done. I thought the cover song selections were attention seeking at best. ""Oh Wow! It's a Janet song!"" The songs just didn't align with the story. Seven Nation army when the Prince is trying to select his future Queen, really? As far as the acting goes, Camila Cabello is sometimes very cute & hilarious. Other times, she's quite obnoxious. I didn't sense any chemistry between her & Nicholas Galitzine.Now, Billy Porter was a true gem. I loved every single moment of his scene or grand entrance we should call it. Billy Porter stole the whole show & I love that he used modern day lingo like ""Yasss Queen,"" it's just cute & modern. While watching Billy Porter, I couldn't get my eyes off of his outfit & then I noticed that wardrobe in this film was stunning. I love the visual effects of the film & there was just an abundance of glitz & glamour.My favorite part about the film is the new take on the story. I love how Ella loves the Prince but she just wants to work as a fashion designer. She can have both. I love how the Prince opted to travel the world & not rush into marriage. I especially liked how the Prince's sister became Queen at the end. All of the story changes made sense as the characters unfold. Even the evil step-mother, Idina Menzel, had a very realistic story line of resenting her dreams because of how her life turned out & spreading her pessimism over to her girls for this false sense of protection. I love the story line behind this. Just wish the other elements I mentioned before were a little less cringey.",Cinderella

Baz Luhrmann took Romeo and Juliette and Moulin Rouge to new heights by interjecting pop culture In to movies set in the past, and it clearly works! Yes, this is not the typical ""Cinderella"", but come on now, this movie has been remade so many times. I love this musical version and let's talk about the actors.

1926,jaciart,I just... *sigh*,2,4 September 2021,"I was super excited to watch this movie when I first saw the trailer. When I learned that Camila Cabello would be the lead, I was stoked! Like, I had the release date in my calendar and everything.Unfortunately, all I got was disappointment.When I go into a fairytale remake film, I look forward to new renditions of songs from the original, but more importantly, I'm ALL FOR the inclusion of new ORIGINAL songs. This movie instead brought covers of a wide variety of songs that sent my mind spinning and had me scratching my head (often with my thumb on the fast-forward button). If the film had been set in a distinct time period and setting that matched with these songs, it would have been different. Instead I found myself thoroughly confused about what was going on and why certain artistic choices were made.I get what they were trying to do, I really do, but this movie gave me a similar vibe to a Cinderella remake that was done (quite successfully in my opinion) back in 2004, and this movie just fell flat. There were different aspects I liked about this movie (Kudos to Ella for not giving up on her dreams), but overall I feel like this Cinderella movie just failed. The storyline wasn't as strong as it should have been and it felt like a lot of things were glossed over. I wish there had been be more romance/character building between Prince Robert and Ella - mainly in their learning to understand each other's passions and how to balance their dreams with the feelings they felt for each other. And If I'm honest, Robert and Ella as a couple didn't make a whole lot of sense because he didn't seem to have any real passions or dreams himself. It seemed kind of superficial.The movie was also rather cringey at times - ie. The admittedly murderous Queen..the mice's brief discussion about their *ahem* 'tails', and don't get me started on that opening ballroom scene and musical number...*cue shudder*It was fine as a one-time watch, but I don't see myself watching it again in the future.I do have to say though, Million To One was by far my favorite song of the film and I've already listened to it several times!It's important I mention that I do feel like Camila Cabello did a good job in her role - as well as some of the other actors - I just think the whole thing felt a little disjointed and didn't come together as well as hoped. They had a fairly strong cast for this film. If things had been done a little differently - particularly song choice, storyline, and a few other details - I think this could have been an excellent film. However, it just kinda made me sigh in disappointment.",Cinderella

1930,travisalley,It was entertaining!,8,4 September 2021,"I don't get the people hating. Maybe nothing tops the classic cartoon version for them. I was entertained by this, and I appreciated the message. It was a classic with a twist. It's worth your time.",Cinderella

Does not take itself seriously and that's the charm!,8,11 September 2021,"There are movie musicals that take themselves too seriously and are TERRIBLE for it... this is not one of them! This Cinderella does not claim to be Shakespeare. It's filled with puns, humor, and misunderstandings with tight choreography and talented singers. It's silly and fun and light and exactly what I needed on a Friday night after a long work week.",Cinderella
1932,kayla-39751,My kids loved it!,10,3 September 2021,"Take it for what it is, a bright, colourful, cheesy, humorous musical and enjoy it. If you want to look further and deeper then it's clearly not for you. It was fun to watch with my girls and the music was brilliant.",Cinderella
1933,whitlahoward,A misconbobulated mess,1,6 September 2021,"From the start the sister's introductions were to be narcissistic and cruel and they neither fit their roles or played a consistent character besides being sassy and embarrassing air heads. The story line was confusing to follow from the start and it continued to get more confusing. The music was trashy and awkward, THEY DESTROYED QUEEN WITH THIS GARBAGE MOVIE. The relationships between characters was nonexistent. Don't waste your time.",Cinderella
1934,melissaday-93022,Absolutely Loved!!!,10,26 September 2021,"One my favorite versions of Cinderella. I loved everything about this movie from the actors to the music. I read the poor reviews and I just don't get them. This is a fun, lighthearted movie. Sure it's not going to when any acting awards, but I still loved it. Please watch and decide for yourself!",Cinderella
1935,libbylake-56307,"Amazingly beautiful interpretation of a classic story, ignore the haters",10,6 September 2021,"I've been an IMDB lurker since it's inception and love reading the comments for both films I've loved and those I've hated. Until now I never felt compelled to create an account but today I did, just so I could defend what are the most judgemental, overblown and ridiculous reviews and ratings I've seen.'Cinderella' is an explosion of joy and light, coming at a time when this world could use some joy amidst the darkness. The most extraordinary aspect for me was the way modern music was so beautifully and seamlessly woven into the script. None of the songs chosen felt forced, the lyrics of each lent themselves to their respective movie moment perfectly.The casting was ingenious. Camilla Cabelo doea an outstanding job in her first acting role, she was wonderfully suited to play the fiesta and fearlwaa Ella. Idina Mendel is perfection as always, and I loved that her role of stepmother, and those of her two daughters, were not as nasty as they were in the original and other remakes. Minnie Driver was a atandout as Queen Beatrice as was Tallulah Grieve as Princess Gwen.Now let's talk about the costuming and production, juat spectacular, I mean, WOW!!The detailing on each and every costume, from King Rowan down to the peasants was stunning, and the production and visual effects were rich without being overblown.And the movie is funny y'all! I literally laughed out loud so many times! The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, its irreverence and obvious jabs at the patriarchy and other social norms was clever and timely. It is not ""woke"" as the armchair critics are calling it, it's simply calling out the injustices of the world and righting wrongs in a humorous way. Since it doesn't take itself too seriously I'm not sure why others are??",Cinderella

1941,farhannaqui,CABELLO FANTASTIC,8,3 September 2021,"The film with the cast is amazing, the only flaw I could really see is its plot. It needed to be more structured as well as more realistic. It needed more and production such as effects needed to be more clear and seen as a serious film. The musical element was good but it seem to had a blurry filter over it which was a bit too much to process.

I gave it another chance few days later and dont know how but survived till the end.Oh dear, its so sad. This has nothing to do with the well know beautiful mesmerizing story full of love and sacrifices.The main message in my opinion? ""Me, myself and I"", no real relationship, no commitments, its great because i dont have to have any responsibilities, its perfectly fine to be selfish to the bone. AGH.. Good luck with the next one.",Cinderella

I think I read another review of someone saying ""if they hadn't of known the story of Cinderella, they wouldn't have followed this"" and they are right!Note to Producers- If you want to change the plot and push a different message... name the film something else!!!A great cast line up (even if a very random mix) subjected to being in a bad TV movie that looked and felt so fake and staged.A 2 hour film that half of it was bulked out by a selection of mostly rubbish pop music that the writer clearly thought the lyrics enhanced the story.... it didn't. Therefore, 1 hour to fill with actual script. No character depth or development and I honestly did not care if they got together or not! There was absolutely zero chemistry. I didn't care about any of the characters by the end!The princes idiotic behaviour at the beginning was so out of place it made it unbelievable that Cinderella would even like him!I wouldn't even bore my kids to get them to watch this.",Cinderella
1944,fasterbunny,It was unwatchable to me,1,4 September 2021,"I found all the unlikable & uninteresting (including the protagonists). IMO, there are more than enough versions of this fairy tale story. This whole movie played like a bad music video and had no magical feel to it.",Cinderella

I liked the updated music as well as seeing people that looked like me in the movie. It also showed how women could have their love and careers or dreams too. I'm sure some people won't like that. But I found it it to be entertaining and the mice cracked me up. A different spin on an old outdated tail made in 1965. The clothes and hair, sets and scenery were beautiful.

It's not as bad as Cats as so many seem to believe.Give it a chance, if its not your cup of tea then that is fine, its definetly for a certain type of person.

The music is great and I loved the modern pop covers.The 2 original songs they made were breathtaking.Cinderella, portrayed by the popstar Camila Cabello who surprisingly made her acting debut in this movie (she's so talented I thought this is her 3rd starring role) is sassy, funny and kind. She's not the over the top annoying girlboss you'd expect. She's rather compassionate with a progressive sense of humor.Loved everything about this movie. Can't wait for more!",Cinderella

THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU!IMDb ask if this review contains spoilers. Nope, the film does that all on its own.I gave it two stars as it's impressed me with how bad it is.Nasal singing with drawn out vowels in every song.

1970,maryjosparks,Unwatchable Garbage,1,15 September 2021,I was excited for this movie but that feeling quickly turned to boredom and absolute disdain. Was it over 3 hours long or did it just feel like it? The lip-synching was terrible. The dubbing bothered me the entire movie. I had high hopes for Camilla Cabello but she bombed this role. The singing wasn't good and the acting... trash. The whole story was cringy. Pierce Brosnon and James Corden should be embarrassed they participated in this mess. No chemistry between the characters either. I don't usually take the time to write reviews but this sucked so bad I had to say something. I'm mad that I wasted part of my Sunday on this. Stick with Ella Enchanted or Into the Woods if you want a twist on the Cinderella story.,Cinderella

Yes, it tries hard to be contemporary and inclusive but with all the social turmoil swirling today, one can hardly blame those who want to make a definitive statement. The songs are great, choreography is awesome and the costumes are exquisite. The point made with creativity and aplomb.There will be a bevy of detractors who need their Cinderella to be blonde, soft-spoken and shy.

It was not funny at all, I spent the entire time rolling my eyes every time Camilla's shrill voice began singing. I understand it's a musical but come on, do we really need a song every 2 lines? Besides the dresses she created were hideous. This has to be the worst adaptation of Cinderella, I would not watch it again even if someone paid me.The attempt to make this movie funny was honestly cringe worthy, every joke and ""funny moment"" was just dry and had me scoffing.The only good character was the fairy godmother.",Cinderella

So what if it isn't the ""classic"" message that so many reviewers are whining nostalgic for. Do you realize that the ""classic"" message is that a girl's highest aspiration should be finding a man to take care of her? That message is archaic and damaging! This movie tells girls that they're free to follow their dreams, without a man, if they so choose! They have that strength. What's to hate about that? There's also the message to boys that their careers/dreams don't automatically take precedence over their partner's. A happy, fulfilled partner is a GOOD thing, worth making some sacrifices for! There's nothing to hate about THAT message either!All that plus music and dancing! Again, why the hate??",Cinderella

If you like musicals then you'll enjoy this. The music is fun and they've captured some great classics. The whole family sang along!,Cinderella
2006,mdolly-29784,People ratings I give 1 star Movie was fun,10,11 September 2021,"Spoiler alert people's reviews are what is cringey and problematic. The movie is fun. Full of great music, dancing, and Billy Porter as the fairy godmother and narrator is amazing.",Cinderella
2007,mariammostafa-33356,Not Cinderella and definitely another cats movie,3,6 September 2021,"I didn't hate it but still it was so bad, from costumes to the King to the godmother and the story line, its definitely cringey and not worth the time to watch.",Cinderella
2008,billwatts-58040,Nice to see a new take on the classic,7,3 September 2021,"Honestly surprised by the reviews for this film. It was refreshing to see a modernised version of this classic tale. Every Cinderella released is the exact same, this brings a new angle and yes it does send messages but so does the classic. But surely you would want your kids growing up thinking they can do whatever they want for themselves and not the dinosaur and untrue message that you will be whisked away by a prince at the end of the day.",Cinderella
2009,blossoming-59222,Exhilarating,10,3 September 2021,"I usually hate musicals but this one is an exception! I loved every part of the movie, every scene eas entertaining to watch and the emotions portrayed by the actors was so good and I loved how everybody had a backstory! Every character had a story to say and not to mention, the vocals serve by the actors was busy amazing! Also the kid who played the drums for let's get loud in the end, was just mind-blowing.",Cinderella
2010,jules000,"Hellow It's the 21st centery people, this is just a movie that fits in :)",8,4 September 2021,"I enjoyed this movie very much!! Loved the modern twist, the diversity of the cast, the songs, the singing and the message.This is what we need to precieve as ""true love"" The I love you, I will support you in following your dreams, I will listen to you, I respect your opinion and I believe in you 🌞 The fact that the prince asks; ""I will love you if you feel the same way"", it's soo romantic!! And then the: ""let's not put a label on it"" Soo great! :) Also really liked the music and the end in which the king realizes he owes his wife an apology, really inspiaring, from now on I will aplogise to everyone in this way, made me laugh a lot! Must watch, and truly a feelgood movie. (I have seen a lot of better movies tho, but if you feel like watching a feelgood film with great music and originallity, this is the one) ✨",Cinderella
2011,ravenoussix,Absolute garbage,1,5 September 2021,"Another hard pass woke movie, do not watch, skip. Waste of time. All woke will fail.",Cinderella
2012,cassidyrae-16808,Don't believe the bad reviews.,10,4 September 2021,"Was there a campaign to rate this moving poorly because of the messages within it? Good god.It is a really good movie! Some people enjoy different takes on stories. They combines all of the Cinderella adaptions into this movie, which gave my millennial soul a nostalgic feeling. The music is good, the voices are amazing.Don't go into it thinking ""I want this to the the exact same thing as the original animated movie""- it's not that. And nor should it be! It does a great job of twisting the plot just enough to give it a modern feel with messages that are important to hear and see.If you enjoy musicals, quirky characters, the occasional cheesy line, and important messages sprinkled throughout- this is your movie.",Cinderella
2013,kaliweftie,Good for families,8,5 September 2021,"I don't know why people are hating on this. It's a fun, light, family movie with nice twists. It was a refreshing take on a classic story but they made it their own. It is far from perfect but it's not as horrible as some people make it out to be. I mean, what were you expecting?",Cinderella
2014,mobincamilaizer,THE MOVIE IS GREAT,10,3 September 2021,"Such a great movie, loved the feminist message
it had a great cast and a perfect soundtrack
Camila Cabello's acting and singing was so good considering it was her first performance
would recommend watching it (if you care about the message)",Cinderella
2015,mauritsjeroen,Cannot be more bad,1,7 September 2021,There is no character that is actualy performing an acting role .It is all one big emo senseless ride with no depth or feeling or attachment. This is not a movie or even a musical . The playback is terrible . The music is no real music just noize .,Cinderella
2016,pauljohnson-23990,Music was okay,3,3 September 2021,"The music and singing and the dancing were okay. They took a children's story and modernized it. That was okay, but then they promoted LGBTQ such that it distracted you from the movie. I wouldn't recommend it.",Cinderella
2017,gloretta-72999,Wonderful and Enchanting,10,4 September 2021,This take is so refreshing. Ella believes in her dreams despite hardships. She wants to take care of herself financially by doing what she loves. This doesn't stop her from being a sweet and kind hearted person. Plus amazing music and dancing. A joy to watch.,Cinderella
2018,kissalielasanya,Must watch,10,15 September 2021,"This is the best adaption of Cinderella I've watched. It gives each character a diversity and more depth that other movies failed to include. Cinderella is not a damsel in distress waiting for a prince to save her, the stepmother is not 100% evil, being royalty doesnt mean that you are not with problems. This movie also shows how males condemn woman thinking that they are more greater and how the family suffers when the father is greedy for power. The final scene of the queen shows that the females finally got the power to use their voice.I really like this movie the casting was great and the songs are really good. I keep on watching it again and again.",Cinderella
2019,katie_emma_lane,Feel good vibes,8,4 September 2021,"Really enjoyable to watch loads of famous faces, comedy and great songs!A modern twist on a classic.If your looking for the OG story you won't find it here.Honestly was so much fun to watch and some great music !!!",Cinderella
2020,idklet,"Honestly, I don't get the hate.",10,5 September 2021,"I've seen so many comments in this section saying how awful the movie is but I found it amazing! As someone who grew up watching fairytale movies, I always thought I would easily find someone as the princes we see on those kinds of stories, but we all know that real life is really different. This Cinderella can be truly inspiring for the young girls growing up in this age since it has such a empowering message about following your dreams (and that you don't need a man to do so).",Cinderella
2021,bklamutt,I loved it!,10,9 September 2021,"I could see how people didn't like it, but I loved it. If you overthink it and think about what its saying and not just go along for the ride you may not like it. I don't think about how a movie applies to modern issues, I just enjoy the movie. The music is amazing and the romance is real and funny. I have watched it none stop since it came out and will continue to watch it until something makes me as happy.",Cinderella
2022,longsandra-81214,Fantastic,10,11 September 2021,"It was glorious. I loved the music, dancing and the characters. I also liked the social messages. Anyone who didn't like this must hold ancient beliefs about what human beings are truly like - especially women.",Cinderella
2023,kepesoglouanastasia,really good,10,5 September 2021,It was amazing and funny. Camila did an amazing job and its worth seeing it.,Cinderella
2024,iolandalino,I truly loved it!,10,3 September 2021,A super fun movie with a great message and an even better cast ( especially Miss Camila Cabello ) !! I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.,Cinderella
2025,locheerchick,What Romance?,1,3 September 2021,"This movie spent so much time on singing new-age pop music and being incessantly sarcastic, it not only lost it's Disney charm, it lost any chance for character development or likability. The romantic connection between the leads was completely non-existent to the point where I genuinely didn't care if they got together or not in the end.",Cinderella
2026,abbygrothe,Watch only if you actually want to raise strong a** kids that buck gender roles,10,19 September 2021,"Y'all. This movie.I'm feeling empowered. As a frickin 24 year old. I wish I'd had this as a kid, wish I would have grown up as a little girl getting to watch amazingly strong women kick booty, take names, and stand up for herself and her dreams. Watch this. Like now. And dance yo booty off because the music is AMAZING. Also Billy Porter. That's all. Totally fab. Put aside your ancient views and give your kids something of value to watch, with amazing men as queens and women starting businesses.",Cinderella
2027,nadiyadongek,Good soundtracks and cast👍🏻,10,3 September 2021,"Camila makes my nephew happy hahaha, and the 3 mice made him laugh, and he asked to buy a mouse.",Cinderella
2028,rishi-01313,So bad,1,19 September 2021,"Not sure how anyone can screw up a classic like Cinderella but this is so bad. Can't understand how this ever got green lit. Story and scenes all over the place, music random and half the dialogue doesn't make sense. Rediculous interpretation of such a classic. Don't waste your time.",Cinderella
2029,gugukaungkyawthant,Really! Don't let your kids watch this.,2,6 September 2021,Cinderella's character is completely destroyed and the story gets worse over time. I really can't bear to watch this.,Cinderella
2030,Marianne-wells,I liked it,7,10 September 2021,"It's never going to be a total classic but it's fun, it's cherry and its got some comic timing. Some great smaller roles from the Taskmaster contestants (love Doc Brown) too.",Cinderella
2031,sara_hosseini-32370,WTF,1,6 September 2021,Who allowed you to touch the image of our beautiful and kind fairy and create such a meaningless story? Make a new movie and create new characters. Stop meaningless reconstructions of our childhood dreams.,Cinderella
2032,chnasdaq,BEST LINE IN THE MOVIE,3,15 September 2021,"""Don't look at me.""Not being cruel. I spare you the whole essay I writes q to myself.This sums it up. Watch it and write your own film review! Got up to 54 on the Cringe Counter.Especially you fellow screenwriters. You can learn more from a bad film than a good one. Worst opening and closing numbers since Greek tragedies added a Chorus.BEST REVIEW GOES TO:
: Feminist. Dash. I HAVE MY CONCERNS.",Cinderella
