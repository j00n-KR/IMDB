0,SnoopyStyle,escapist franchise,5,11 September 2021,"Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell) is on a mission to take down Minos and Ben Miller (Logan Miller) is willing to support her at all cost despite his panic attacks. As they pursue the investigation, they get trapped in a subway car with four other escape room winners, Rachel Ellis (Holland Roden), Brianna Collier (Indya Moore), Nathan (Thomas Cocquerel), and Theo (Carlito Olivero). It's a tournament of champions. Behind the scenes, Claire (Isabelle Fuhrman) has been imprisoned by her puzzle making father (James Frain) after her mother gets killed in an escape room.I can buy the movie logic of the extravagant puzzle rooms. I don't like it but I can accept it. I can't accept how Zoey and Ben get trapped in the first place. It's completely unreasonable that no other civilian wouldn't just randomly walk onto that train car, even if Minos could trick all those winners into the same place. The other problem continues to be that nobody ever grabs a weapon into the next room. I do like the bank escape room. The beach escape room is too unstructured. The acid rain idea is too ridiculous. All in all, there is some fun in an otherwise ridiculous escapist franchise.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
1,nogodnomasters,"To the hammer, everything is a nail.",6,24 July 2021,The first question that came to mind was which Escape Room is the a sequel to? That is answered in the opening scenes as they replay part of the first feature. We are expected to know Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) from the first film. They are captured along with other champions who we don't know and are forced back into the game of frantic people screaming and attempting to figure out puzzles in a minute or so. I was not as impressed with this film as the original.Guide: No sex or nudity. Two softly spoken F-words.,Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
2,kosmasp,Champions of ...,6,4 August 2021,"I think it is quite the exaggeration to call those involved here ""champions"". But what do I know right? Also being a horror ""veteran"" I was not really surprised on where this movie went - the ending that is. For some it may be quite the twist, but I'm guessing not so much.But back to the beginning. Literally, because the movie gives us a ""previously on"" skit at the beginning. Which might be helpful for those who either haven't seen the first one (which I find better than this) or those who have forgotten about it. And it is all woven into the plot and story of the movie.Having said that, the likelihood of things happening the way they are .. happening here ... it's not just slim, but impossible! And the twist does not really hold that up, unless there will be a big reveal in a third part ... which even if there is, it can't cover all the holes this has ... swiss cheese is probably jealous - because of the size but also the plethora/quantity of holes on hand.The actors are ok all things considering, but they won't be able to make moments less cringe worthy - and as I already said, the suspension of disbelief you need for this one ... it's not enough to suspend it! You have to hack your suspend to pieces, put it in a shredder, light it on fire, take the ashes put it in a rocket, shoot it into outer space - aiming for a black hole, where you have to hope and pray it'll dissapear! Then and only then, you will be able to forgive how ridiculous many things are ... seriously though: if you can't sit back and relax, but start thinking about anything happening here ... the fun will dissapear (fun as in because it is a movie, not because you are a sadist)",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
3,jboothmillard,Escape Room: Tournament of Champions,5,26 July 2021,"The original film was a big hit, it was almost inevitable that a sequel would follow, and I was interested to see what would happen next, directed by Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key). Basically, Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell) and Ben Miller (Logan Miller) are recovering after surviving the deadly escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation. Zoey has found coordinates to the corporation's New York City-based headquarters in Minos' logo, but having a fear of flying, she convinces Ben to drive there. Finding the building, it is derelict, and a vagrant is there who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben chase the thief, getting into a subway train car, failing to catch him. Soon, the doors are locked, the car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station. Zoey and Ben are sealed inside with the four other passengers, Rachel Ellis (Holland Roden), Brianna Collier (Indya Moore), Nathan (Thomas Cocquerel), and Theo (Carlito Olivero). Zoey and Ben learn that the others are survivors of Minos escape rooms. It is then revealed that are in an escape room, and they theorise that they are part of a Tournament of Champions. The train becomes electrified, and they must collect subway tokens to get out as the electrocution increases. Theo is killed while the others manage to escape. As the group rest, Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who did not feel physical pain. The survivors enter the next room, a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. Deciphering a complex route to cross the floor and avoid the lasers, Nathan suffers a crisis of faith and knocks himself unconscious, activating the lasers. The group manages to figure out the route and escape with Nathan before the lasers cover the entire room. While in the room, Zoey noticed frequent references to someone called Sonya, but is perplexed that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group. The next room is a sandy beach with a shack, lighthouse, and more references to Sonya. As the group search for clues and try to solve the puzzle, they discover the beach is covered in quicksand. Rachel is swallowed by the quicksand, Nathan sacrifices himself to save her, but sinks to his own death. While Brianna unlocks the intended exit to the room, Zoey finds an alternate route out of the escape room. An argument between the group breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey, while Rachel is forced to escape through the exit she found. Ben sinks beneath the quicksand trying to get out and is seemingly killed. Zoey and Rachel mourn the others and vow to take Minos down. They make their way out through a manhole and appear to have made it out into the city. But quickly realise they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. A countdown displays, and each time it ends, acid rain is periodically sprayed into the room. The group figures out the room's puzzle and open a taxi to escape, but the door is locked, leaving Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain. The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya. Zoey realises the rooms are based on days out Sonya had with her mother, who is revealed to be Amanda Harper (True Blood's Deborah Ann Woll). Amanda appears, having survived her fall in Zoey and Ben's original escape room encounter. She explains that she was forced into making rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle maker for Minos. Ben also reappears, trapped in a cage that starts rapidly filling with water. When Zoey refuses Minos' demands, she and Amanda work together to free Ben. They start a fire in the escape room and manage to break out, fleeing the facility. The trio report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down. Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, Zoey realises that the plane is another escape room set up by Minos. The unseen Gamemaster mocks them for falling into their trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin. Also starring Lucy Newman-Williams as Therapist and Scott Coker as FBI Agent. Russell, Miller, Woll and the others give good performances, the opening flashback serves as a helpful reminder, the maze of advanced escape rooms is much more elaborate, with equally deadly traps, the bank scene probably being the most memorable, there are the small moments that may annoy you (how did Amada survive the fall?), but the mystery element continues to keep you hooked enough, a reasonable horror thriller. Worth watching!",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
4,CinemaSerf,Messy and ridiculous...,6,14 September 2021,"Mercifully, this sequel is shorter - and actually a little more succinct/better paced - than the first one, but sadly it still just reminded me of a modern day (and more violent/lethal) equivalent of ""The Adventure Game"" television series that saw kids facing seemingly impenetrable challenges. Only this time, instead of cheering on the kids, I was cheering on the game so it might more speedily rid us of these rather insipid characters for whom death can only have been a blessed release. It's not in the least scary nor is it in the least plausible - and that's what really let's it down. Of course it's cinema, of course tube trains don't have trap doors that lead to collapsing lighthouses and other such nonsense - but for jeopardy to work, some part of our brain - however willingly we may choose to acknowledge it - must be prepared to accept the basic concept. Here, I cannot imagine that anyone over the age of 8 could be even slightly engaged, much less frightened by any of these risible scenarios.

Fair enough. Hopefully they are not laced with the fatal goings-on which we see here.Listen, I quite enjoyed it - it fits the Saw formula of imaginatively engineered deaths, although it is far less gory - but it was profoundly stupid and entirely unbelievable. It makes no sense. We don't know who is doing this or why - presumably pay-per-view for rich people who like seeing people die in imaginative ways, or similar - but the sheer logistics and cost defy reason. We have gallons of acid pumped as rain onto a mocked-up New York street, and an actual Manhattan subway car hijacked and electrified to name but two.Seriously?There had better be a pretty good explanation for the finance somewhere down the line, what with the cost of Manhattan real estate!",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

I usually enjoy almost anything I watch but this left me feeling unsatisfied and hated the ending! I'm generous for giving this a 6 I even wanted to like more just that there's a lot of yellIng, not much of soundtrack, bad cgi, not much character development for the new characters and felt rushed.

9,cruise01,"Fast paced, thrilling, and entertaining.",8,23 July 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Escape Room continues where the first has left off. With the two leads trying to stop and expose this organization that is orchestrating illegal threatening escape rooms. The two leads are put into another set of escape rooms with new people. Which all have a connection of some kind. While they try to solve the mystery and escape.The plot is still a little shallow. Barely any motives behind the organization. Besides they get away with everything. There is a couple of twists. And the ending twist is kind of predictable which you can see coming.The cast is great. The action and thrills are exciting. The escape rooms are crazy and insane. The movie does move at a electrifying pace.,Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
10,Tweetienator,Hm,4,8 September 2021,"The first Escape Room was nothing special but some solid easy pop-corn ""horror"" movie, the second one is a rather disappointing affair. The trouble begins right with the killing of the wife of the puzzle maker - how you will explain to the police that she got cooked in the sauna without explaining why you got a device to close the door from the outside!? And if you take away that device (or it won't be discovered), why the woman just did not open the door? Suicide by cooking yourself? That's just one example of how the plot of Tournament of Champions lacks in many scenes basic logic and therefore is totally unbelievable (far more than the first one), and what you get is more or less one action scene after another, mindless, making you rather numb than excited. A redundant and rather unnecessary sequel. The first one I rated 5, this gets 4 points but no more.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

13,jtindahouse,Electrically paced; if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy this one too,8,1 July 2021,"I really enjoyed the first 'Escape Room' film back in 2019 (it feels like longer ago than that for some reason). The movie was pretty well received and did well at the box office so of course a sequel was going to come along eventually. Plus the ending of the first one basically demanded it (an ending that is recapped at the beginning of this film in case you were wondering whether you needed to see the original first before this - although I would still recommend it for other things that crop up during the sequel). So here we are two years later getting that follow-up, and I have to say it was a pretty darn good movie all up.I'll start by saying if you struggle with suspension of disbelief in films then you are going to struggle with this one a lot. There are some elements to this movie that are so far-fetched they don't even try to explain them. You just have to accept them for what they are and sit back and enjoy the ride (if you can).Both of the movies in this series have PG-13 ratings, but it really doesn't take anything away from either of the movies as far as I can tell. People still die in some pretty horrific ways, however the movie isn't going out of its way to rub your face in it. It has a strong enough story going on that it really doesn't have to. We know the stakes are high and (almost) no character is safe.The pacing of this movie is electric. It's short at only 88 minutes, but even then it's over before you know it. Once the action starts it never relents. These movies are almost like a hybrid of the horror and action genres and I think that is one of the reasons they work so well. People who like horror are able to enjoy the action elements just fine, and people who don't like horror know that the movie isn't setting out to scare you or gross you out at all. There's a really good balance found here.The only criticism I'd suggest was that some of the new characters could have done with a little fleshing out. There's a scene where everyone goes around the circle and says their name, and that's about the extent of the development we get for a lot of them. It makes them a little hard to care for, and makes them feel quite expendable.If you enjoyed the first 'Escape Room' you're almost certainly going to have a good time with this one too. This one follows a similar formula, but has some unique twists and turns to add something to the series as well. I had a really good time with 'Escape Room: Tournament of Champions' and would recommend people check it out.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
14,stevendbeard,If You Are Missing the Saw Movies....,7,16 July 2021,"I saw ""Escape Room:Tournament of Champions"", starring Taylor Russell-Words on Bathroom Walls, Lost in Space_tv_2018; Logan Miller-The Walking Dead_tv, The Bling Ring; Deborah Ann Woll-The Punisher_tv, True Blood_tv and Lucy Newman_Williams-London Has Fallen, Everest.This is a sequel to the 2019 minor hit-it cost $9 million and made $150 million-so with numbers like that, there was bound to be a sequel. If you are missing the Saw movies, this should fill the gap. It puts people in escape rooms where they have to solve puzzles to get out and continue along to the next test. Taylor, Logan and Deborah are survivors from the first movie and get roped back into the games. Lucy is a therapist that Taylor is seeing-because of the events in the first movie-that is trying to get Taylor over her fears. Taylor & Logan get on a subway train and the games begin anew. They also find out that 4 other people on the train have been through the games before so that's why it's called the tournament of champions. The ending leaves room for a sequel-if they make big bucks.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.It's a little better than the first one with more elaborate traps-probably because of a bigger budget-but I don't think I would buy it on DVD.

15,tadpole-596-918256,My grandpa says that back in the 1900's there was a film . . .,7,28 July 2021,". . . called DEER HUNTER about people playing a game called Russian Roulette, which got many players shot in the head. Worse yet, so many innocent bystanders were gunned down by through-and-throughs, ricochets and outright misses that the Authorities had to outlaw this pastime, as well as branding anyone caught playing it with a big ""R"" in the center of their forehead. The poorly-named ESCAPE ROOM: TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS proves that there are no champs in this pernicious contest, as no one can truly escape. Furthermore, even more random members of the public are endangered by ESCAPE ROOM than by Russian Roulette.

17,kevin_robbins,"The games themselves are excellent, the execution of the storyline is putrid.",3,22 July 2021,"Escape Room: Tournament of Champion (2021) is a movie we caught in theatres last night. The storyline follows various survivors of previous Escape Room experiences as they find themselves caught in another game of cat and mouse with the organizers of the game. The winner of the previous game has her sites set on bringing down the organizers of the game. This movie is directed by Adam Robitel (The Taking of Deborah Logan) and stars Taylor Russell (Waves), Logan Miller (Love, Simon), Deborah Ann Woll (Teue Blood) and Thomas Cocquerel (In Like Flynn). The storyline for this picture had so much potential - the mental state after you survive the game, character back stories, fantastic game situations and scenarios, great back drops - but how they put all the pieces together is absolutely awful. It's like a sprint through every game/situation. You really don't ""care"" about what happens to any characters because while you know an inch about their back story they aren't on the screen long enough to develop any feelings for them. The main character of this film is awful - making rediculous decision after decision and jumping to various conclusions throughout. I love how the whole movie starts with her randomly parking in the middle of the road in Manhattan and just walking into an empty lot where of course she gets jumped by a homeless guy - who happens to be a track star who runs like an Olympian . The movie falls apart from there. I will say the games themselves are excellent, the execution of the storyline is putrid. Id score this a 3/10 (and my fiancée said that was being too generous).",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
18,alindsay-al,An Average Sequel,5,19 July 2021,"After watching the first film in the franchise I have now watched Escape Rooms sequel Tournament of Champions and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two returning characters from the first film Zoey and Ben as they attempt to track down the company behind the escape rooms when they get dragged into another game.Main Character
Taylor Russell and Logan Miller are back as Zoey and Ben and similar to the previous film they are just functional. Despite the fact that they were in the previous film I didn't find their characters any more interesting, they were alright before and they're only alright here. The actors are trying and that is the credit I am giving them but they don't give you lots of reason to care and the forced connection between the two of them falls a bit flat.Supporting Characters
Continuing the them from above, the supporting characters are better here then the ones from the first film but they just fall a bit flat in the terms of characterisation and making the audience truly care about them. There were some interesting ideas and some okay characters but the film fails in creating an interesting group of characters to get invested in.Story
The story is better in this film as a few of the characters have some actual thought put into them. Also, despite the fact that the ending is absurd and elements of it don't make sense, I can't deny that it intrigued me and had me actually wanting to see a third film in the frachise. But there are so many elements of the film that make no sense and the issue is still there in making you care about these characters are the fact that they are in real danger.Script
The script does hurt the film, the dialogue is clunky, cheesy and generic. It really holds the film back and really saddles these performers with dialogue that even the most experienced actors would struggle with.Style
The style of the film is the one element that is really improved. The escape rooms are much bigger in stakes and style and it looks impressive, whoever, was the person behind the scenes that designed these rooms they deserve big credit as they are fun to watch. Also the pacing is very frantic which if the characters aren't going to be particularly interesting it allows us to watch them in perilous positions at least.Overall
Overall, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is an Average film that improves on the original. I would say it isn't a film worth going to the cinema to see but maybe Escape Room 3 will finally deliver a good film in this franchise.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

20,Pairic,Enjoyable & Fast Moving,7,24 July 2021,"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions: Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) survived the Escape Room but no one believes them about what really happened, therapists try to explain it away. Frustrated they go the derelict HQ of the organisation behind the Game. They are tricked into boarding a subway train and their carriage is separated and crashes, then it becomes an Escape Room which is electrified. Their four fellow travelers also survived previous Escape Room events. While it's all bunkum, it's enjoyable bunkum as they traverse the Rooms. Going through ban halls and vaults, dodging lasers which cut, reaching a beach which has quicksand traps. Again characters are sacrificed, so don't get attached to anyone, they might just melt away in (acid) rain. The tension is maintained throughout and the narrative advances at such a pace that you don't have time to stop and think about the non sequiturs and plot holes. Just enjoy it!

22,masonfisk,EVEN WATCHING CLOTHES DRYING CAN BE THERAPEUTIC...!,7,9 August 2021,"The sequel to the 2019 hit finds the last 2 survivors, played by Logan Miller & Taylor Russell, still coming to grips w/the events from the first film w/Russell seeing a shrink & still not being able to travel via plane while Miller, who's holding a romantic candle for her, tries to maintain a semblance of a normal life. Knowing the evil corporation behind everything resides in the Big Apple, Russell convinces Miller to drive to the big bad city but no sooner do they get there, Russell is mugged prompting the pair to chase the crook to the subway where he gives them the slip & as their train car, which contains 4 others, soon find themselves being taken against their will as the train car uncouples, they're all thrust into another intricate escape room scenario, w/the further revelation the other 4 contestants are also survivors from past campaigns. What follows is a cinematic Russian doll motif, much like the first entry, where all the competitors find themselves in a room, have to figure out an escape w/the clues strewn about & as their number dwindles, end up in another room & rinse & repeat. Not as gut-wrenching & soul destroying as the other horror franchises out there, I'm looking at you Saw (Spiral really?), w/a winning performance from Russell (who is quietly essaying an impressive body of work, see her work in Waves) & a strong supporting cast for the most part (which includes Indya Moore from FX's Pose & Deborah Ann Wohl from the first film in a surprise reveal).",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

24,aidanratesmovies,"Better than the first, but still hardly worth watching",5,28 October 2021,"Entertaining, although quite unoriginal, Escape Room Tournament of Champions is exactly what you would expect it to be- full of fun twists and turns and dim witted characters along the way. I have to say what the film considers to be the biggest twists throughout are incredibly predictable. The script has its moments of cleverness, but hardly is able to make a dent in terms of memorability. Lead actress Taylor Russell and Logan Miller try their best along the way- but it feels too silly and contrived to be believable- especially with so many references to the previous film. I will admit I liked this one a bit better than the original. It definitely made more out of the films potential, even though it still really didn't reach it yet. It's an amusing time for thrill seekers, and horror fans alike, but it's not anything special or memorable- just an entertaining way to spend 90 mins just in time for them to make another film. In the end, Escape Room Tournament of Champions is okay at best. A mediocre horror film, adventure film, and much more, but it is fun to watch at times- and an improvement upon its bland origins.My Rating: 5.5/10.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
25,rgkarim,"A Fast Tournament Of Thrills, Some Chills, and An Ending That Spills",7,16 July 2021,"LIKES:Good Pace/Short Time:
Sequels sometimes lose their steam and pacing, getting lost in trying to introduce the new pieces and quips to the world. Not the case for Escape Room 2, as the movie opens with little delay and dives back into Minos' nefarious plans from the first film. Our group gets jammed right into the traps and keeps the excitement of life or death going with little hesitation. It's a rough ride of traps and deciphering the mystery as our heroes try to beat the evil corporation making their lives into sport. In a way, this short time does add an element of thrills, and keeps the movie exciting from start to near finish.The Main Character:
If you are like me, one of the biggest selling points was the woman who led the charge in the last Escape room antics Zoey. And once again, the girl has got some props that I enjoyed watching once more. That same heart, charisma, and brain power is loaded back into the mix and still just as endearing and fun to watch. The actress Taylor Russell brings that performance back in spades and makes her character just as believable as before, if not a little more melodramatic in this installment. Still, it's nice to see her same characteristics being built upon, but still keeping those familiar and strong characteristics in check.The Balance Of Characters:
If you've read my reviews, you know how I find the importance of including a character means utilizing the character well. And sure enough, this movie accomplished the champions quite well given the circumstances. Like the first movie, I felt good involvement with each of the players, only this time with the stakes known, it allowed for better chemistry and expertise solving the harder puzzles. I liked seeing the personalities clash, the specialties come together, and the relationships foster, all while giving a little touch to help add some levels to the performances. Again the acting was well done by all members, hitting the stereotypes and then tearing those will down a little as they hit their mark.The Twist:The twist was a nice surprise and something I did not expect given the direction of the movie. Much like the first movie, there is a connection between each room and Zoey's attempt to decipher the mystery is part of the alluring component once again. When that revelation comes to fruition though, I give them props for the surprise coming out of nowhere and how they utilized it into the story, helping make some connections to the past that help with the story element of the movie. I can't say more without spoiling so moving on.The Rooms:
By far the best point for me on this movie is whoever plans the rooms for them to play in. Once more the planner of the games had a massive clever streak going, bringing strategy, teamwork, and deadliness the games hold in their seemingly pristine, high definition, settings. The Tournament of Champions ups the stakes and really brings convoluted puzzles, using riddles, hidden clues and attention to detail to help coordinate. That fast paced timing works super well to increase the intensity, and I loved seeing the character quirks come out as fears, limitations, and strengths to help elevate the games to the next level. Championship levels really do go far, with so many clues and pieces to figure out the next part of the puzzle, impressing me with again how things lined up very well. Sure a bit abstract, and some suspense of disbelief of how quickly they solved the puzzles. Still, the continued baiting of the traps and the intensity of how many will make it through to the next room, is certainly the strongest piece that had me leaning forward in my seat waiting to see if predictability would be broken.DISLIKES:The Pacing:
While certainly good, the movie's fast pace also sort of shreds some of the others things I loved about the first installment. The first film had much more dive into character psyche, prowess, and tested those elements to help extend the story past the gimmicks of traps and help you attach onto the characters a bit more. While the faster tone does indeed amp up the suspense moments of those rooms... I do wish that they had either extended the total run time or injected more character components into the mix to really give us more of the champions who had survived hell.The Sound Level:
With sensitive ears like mine, the special effects are a bit too loud for me for this film. I had to cover my ears during many of the louder traps and when that happens it adds a little annoying factor for me during the review.A few more traps needed, or more time in the traps:
I mentioned it earlier, but the movie's traps are again the selling point of the film and in the first film I loved those intense bouts of being in those intense rooms, pushed against the wire and desperately searching for clues despite the fears before them. This time though, the rushed pace in most of the rooms kind of lost that level of depth I loved in the film, the character driven moments that forced the characters to step up or reveal the vulnerabilities to help push the team forward. Oh sure, there were a few moments that succeeded primarily with the character Nate, but most of the deeper moments became a bit cheesy for me and not quite as tight as the first installment. In addition, some more time spent in the rooms could have allowed for more time for our characters to bond and expand their dynamics to the point of again seeing if these new dynamics would last or protect them from the impending doom.The Ending:
All weakness mentioned the worst part of the movie is the last 20-25 minutes where the movie's rules and logic suddenly crumbled. For one thing, the twist that came sort of establishes a new set of rules that does take part of the edge off knowing what the writers can potentially do. Second, all the qualities I mentioned I liked about Zoey and her cohorts suddenly seems undone as the movie tries to close this chapter and potentially prepare another one. The wariness, the attention to detail, and the logic all seem to just get zapped away, in some forced attempt to promote some level of closure, the writers and directors tried to do their best to mislead you, but it only resulted in eye rolling, over the top, corny moments that completely feel different to the movie I had been watching prior to it. Perhaps something can help correct course in movie three, but come on.The VERDICT:The second round of escaping rooms still has plenty of heart and thrills that made me fall in love with the installment the first time. A fine leading actress/character leads this new top of the line cohorts in some of the most intense brain busting puzzles I've seen, and it all works at a fast pace to keep you in line with the most dangerous game. Escape Room 2 does still accomplish fashioning characters who are deeper than an MTV special, and seeing the talents come together a little more was another plus to this film. However, the very nature of the fast pace may have also robbed the movie of some of the elements I liked in the first one, primary the compelling relationships we got in the first set of games. The interconnectivity, and using history to fashion growth was missing in this film, and I felt a few character moments could have been put to good use if truth be told. Throw in a little hidden political agenda and the worse components of the ending and you've got a little buffering that toned down the quality of the film. Still, overall I had fun with this film and feel it can be enjoyed in the theater or at home to a similar degree.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 7.5

26,vengeance20,Good Sequel But Lacks,6,17 July 2021,"So after 2 years of waiting we finally get Escape Room 2, AKA Escape Room: Tournament Of Champions! While a good sequel, it lacked.The film picks up on our 2 victors Ben & Zoey who are still suffering from the events of the previous film where each of their friends were killed in a bizarre set of Escape Room devised by Minos. They track the shady organisation to a New York City Headquarters but suddenly find themselves unwillingly thrown into the Escape Room games once again, this time with other victors/survivors from the previous Escape Room Games! But a sinister twist awaits them at the end!I found the film to be good, the Escape Rooms for one were pretty creative, if not a little more creative than the first film! The effects were pretty good also as with the deaths scenes! The characters were ok, but nothing special aside from the 2 main leads obviously!There's some eye candy here & there & the runtime which was short at 1 hour & 22 minutes, had great pacing & did engross me into the films experience!My issues with the film however are that it feels & doesn't seem to go anywhere! Like there's no further explaining who Minos is, nor do they even break any new ground with this sequel which throws us into the darkness once again as soon as the credits roll! There's no conclusion as such & I was hoping for more in-depth & explained sequel! Sadly I never got this & was left with more questions than answers, there is word of a 3rd film being made & I do hope it clears things up more as this film didn't really do that!I liken the sequel to a rushed version of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire -The Quarter Quell with horror & thriller elements added in!Overall, it's a good sequel but it doesn't move the story along any further & still leaves you guessing & scratching your head! It lacks a more in-depth story to Minos & their shady organisation which is what I was expecting in this film! Instead we got new Escape Rooms (which to be fair weren't bad), an out of the blue twist, & a cliff hanger ending! I've got to hope they'll make an Escape Room 3!6/10.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
27,arungeorge13,"Not much to admire here, except for the puzzle sets and some throwaway thrills! [+52%]",5,9 September 2021,"Are the puzzles over-the-top? Yes!Are the characters thinly sketched? Yes!Is there a twist ending? Yes!Is it PG-13? Yes!Escape Room: Tournament of Champions feels like a rehashed version of the original than an actual plot-forwarding piece. I get that there's no Escape Room without the increasingly non-sensical puzzles, but having no character destinies worth caring for, it feels like an exercise in empty thrills. Literally every puzzle is solved at the last second - the creativity in designing those sprawling game sets is the only thing here that intrigues.A film like Escape Room needs a vulnerable protagonist (Taylor Russell's Zoey - check ✔) and a strong antagonist. Saw had John Kramer, Resident Evil had Albert Wesker, and more. Other than the name of a corporation (Minos), Escape Room is yet to find its one true iconic character (and no, it can't be Zoey). Until then, it will always remain Saw + Final Destination Lite. The extended ending even leaves the door open for yet another sequel; one that I'm not very excited about.

28,gedikreverdi,Claire is the next Jigsaw or should I call her Amanda?,6,11 September 2021,"I agree that it gets so cheesy at times that I almost hated it. But the rooms were really cool the car than uncoupled down in New York Metro, the Art Deco bank, the beach which was the best of all and acid rain in the street. Although the clues were a bit too complex (I think they wanted to look too smart because it's the champions this time), I enjoyed how the rooms looked. Joey is very smart and composed as she was in the first film. What I like most about this film is Claire because that Jigsaw-esque character is what this franchise needs. His father was the man behind all this and he would hold his daughter captive because she was genius and design incredible rooms. He also killed her mother. Joey helped him get out and then helped Ben too. Claire locked up his dad. The police busted their headquarters and they were all arrested and Claire seems to be in charge now. It's not that clear but she seems to be some kinda of a sociopath which would make his mother uncomfortable and I guess she'll create rooms for people to take revenge and to teach.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
29,hnt_dnl,Terrible sequel,1,22 September 2021,"I quite enjoyed the first Escape Room from 2019. I thought the various rooms were unique and clever and the way that the characters figured out things was fairly organic and believable. But this sequel ESCAPE ROOM:TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS (2021) quadruples down on the stupidity. First, based on the conclusion to the first movie, it was obvious that a sequel was never meant to be made as the ending basically gave away the main goal of this movie. As soon as that psychiatrist lady in the opening scene asked Zoey what would it take to get her on the plane, I immediately knew that she was part of the evil organization that created the escape rooms. It was just way too transparent. The writers built an entire sequel around a plot point that they gave away in the ending to their first movie. Next, even though I liked the first film, there were really only three characters that I even liked among the main six players and the top two died (or so I thought) and Zoey was in the third spot. So, basically, the two surviving characters from the first film were my THIRD favorite character Zoey and a bottom three character Ben. And as unlikable as I found Ben in the first movie, he was plain insufferable in this sequel! The guy just kept making unnecessary and unhelpful sarcastic remarks while the new 6 set of players were trying to survive the new game.Also, unlike the first movie where I at least liked 3 out of the 6 protagonists, in this one, I really didn't like any of the new players. Interestingly, much like the first movie, my least favorite out of the 6 died first, so that's something. But the most egregious mistake the writers made was bringing back my FAVORITE character Amanda from the first movie and destroying her character in this one. Amanda made the ultimate sacrifice to save the group in the first movie, then the writers went for a cheap explanation as to how she miraculously survived. So now the writers ruined my favorite character from the first movie and guess who my second favorite was? You guessed it...JASON and he of course ended up a bad guy in the first movie! LOL Hence, there are really no characters I ended up liking in either movie after this sequel. And what a bad sequel it is. As I mentioned before, the 4 new characters are nothing to brag about. The acting was so bad in this that it's got me wondering if Holland Roden was really ever any good in Teen Wolf. It's like she forgot how to act after that show and honestly, I even thought she was a tad overrated on that series. The 3 returning actors from the first movie didn't fare much better. Taylor Russell isn't much of an actress and I think it would be better to get some fresh blood for any future sequels planned. Logan Miller is just plain awful. And the writers did Deborah Ann Woll dirty. The writing in the first movie was so much better than this one.As organic as the problem-solving felt in the first movie, it was the complete opposite in this one. I get we have to suspend our disbelief that these 6 people have experience with escape rooms and can think on their feet, but this was ridiculous. Characters could just magically figure stuff out after looking at the first random object in these vast rooms and by some miracle, they always chose the right order of the clues that helped them escape the room. On top of that, every character could just decipher a clue in a matter of seconds, which made all of their internal struggling, yelling, and heavy breathing laughable. It's like they were smart and dumb at the same time. The ending tried to explain that the ease was on purpose, yet it felt more like plot armor writing for the main characters. The clues weren't easy, but the figuring out somehow was.There was a ton of Captain Obvious dialogue in this movie. Characters would literally just say out loud stuff they were doing that was obvious to all the other characters and constantly tell the viewer what they were doing on top of all of that. ""The door is closing"" ""We've got 1 minute"" ""This is another escape room"" The ""tell instead of show"" school of writing. The film was also very predictable. There was the obviously shady psychiatrist, the guy stealing the locket to get them on the subway, the early ""flashback"" scene between Zoey and Amanda telegraphing that Amanda would come back alive somehow, the game within a game. And all just to get Zoey on the plane, which we knew was the goal based on the end of the first movie anyway. In summary, this sequel was a waste of time, but the first movie made so much money, Hollywood said let's make another one, like they always do. I'm guessing this inferior sequel didn't do so well so maybe that means there won't be a third film to dilute this franchise any further.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
30,thekarmicnomad,Very average - so it could be worse,5,15 October 2021,"The god like puzzle masters entrap our protagonists again for some more deadly escape room antics.Unfortunately, most of the things that made the first one good don't transfer over to this movie.The characters are pretty plain and have to blurt their life stories out so we can get on with the action. So, when a player inevitably gets killed it is hard to feel anything for them.The puzzles are intricate and interesting, but watching someone else solve them isn't. The players run around like idiots randomly pushing buttons before suddenly realising they need to perform some really obtuse calculation because a cat winked at them or something equally as random.A lot of the puzzles don't feel fair either, and the organisation running the game is so powerful and evil there doesn't feel much point in playing the game.Just like the first movie the worst part is the stupid ending.This was an alright watch, the levels of acting and production are perfectly acceptable and it doesn't drag on.There is fun to be had here and I wish I could be nicer about it because it looks like it has had some love put into it - I think it just tries to reach too far.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

34,bob-the-movie-man,Utterly Clueless,3,21 July 2021,"I only gave Adam Robitel's original ""Escape Room"" 5/10. It was perhaps hoping for too much that his sequel - ""Escape Room: Tournament of Champions"" - would be better.Positives:
As in the first film, Taylor Russell again stands out as a personable, attractive and convincing actress. She deserves a role in something a lot better.The production design on the ""game sets"" is certainly very impressive.Negatives:
The fact that SIX people are down with writing credits for this astonishes me. The whole thing comes across as lazily plotted, with virtually no character development of the players. (Yes, even less than the first film.) You might think Nathan (Thomas Cocquerel) as an athletic priest might be an interesting character. I was expecting him at one point to channel the dramatic demise of Gene Hackman's similar character in ""The Poseidon Adventure"". But no. Nothing much is done with this.It's a movie where the more you think about it afterwards, the less sense it makes. Some examples:-- People are dead, but then again - when inconvenient for the plot - dead no longer.-- There's some bizarre ""daughter kidnap"" sub-plot at one point, but that's never referred to again.-- Acid rain has no effect on a lock... until that is, the rainwater is captured and poured on the lock! Bonkers!There's a tragic amount of inane running around and wailing that gets mentally tiresome. You can imagine this written in the script as ""Now run down the corridor and adlib some 'teenagers in peril' noises"". (This is a best case guess: I'd hate to think that some of the ""Quick!""s and ""Hurreeeee!""'s had actually been scripted).Summary Thoughts on ""Escape Room: Tournament of Champions"": I found this one to be tragically bad. A lame attempt to cash in on the bizarre $155M success of the first B-movie.

It's well-paced, something stupid is constantly going on, the dialogue is hilarious (all the characters constantly report on what they are seeing and what is going on).It is predictable, and the ending can be spotted a mile away, but it is still entertaining as a b-movie.

36,Movi3DO,Solid and entertaining,8,7 August 2021,"Look for the clues, study the clues, master the clues...The sequel to the 2019 Escape Room, which meant this review contains **spoilers** from the first movie. Our two survivors are back trapped in another series of games from Minos, along with other previous survivors.The first movie was not too bad, but for me, the sequel is a major step up. I had a lot of fun with all the escape games. The premises of each game were interesting and complexed, and most of all, they were incredibly intense. As time kept running and running off, I was more on the edge of my seat. Even more, the movie had little break between each game and kept the intensity high throughout.The acting was also solid among everyone. Our main character, played solidly by Taylor Russell, was clearly smart, as well as the villainous organization. I also liked that the director was aware of what the movie was about, so there was minimal attempt to give backgrounds to the side characters. However, they did gave some quick background anyway, and of course those didn't have much impact.My biggest problem was probably the PG-13 rating. Similar to the 2019 movie, some gore would have made the ending of each game more intense and impactful. They moved on very quickly from each game in order to avoid the gores that they could have shown. There could have been more fun.Overall, a solid and entertaining thriller throughout. 8/10.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

42,CANpatbuck3664,More of the Same but I Dug It the First Time and It Worked For Me Again,8,22 August 2021,"If you know what you're walking into, the draw for this type of horror movie is the game instead of the people in it. So the question becomes, is there enough here to keep you interested? Provide some scares and some thrills? Keep a few surprises up its sleeve? I would say the answer is yes to all of the above. Each set piece is different enough from what came before and while some of the overall beats of the story are familiar, I didn't see an easy solution to evade the danger of each room or start snickering that the way out was too easy to spot. A nice inclusion is that they have to work together to circumvent each room which makes it easier to root for the contestants. So from this element, Tournament of Champions delivers the goods.It was good to see Taylor Russell and Logan Miller return as Zoey and Ben respectively. The original didn't feature transcendent performances but both were capable members of the cast. To my surprise, I think they have pretty good chemistry and they deliver the same kind of solid work as they did in the original but even better. With the leap they both made from 1 to 2, it would be cool to see even more growth in a 3rd entry. I was happy Deborah Ann Woll reappear as Amanda even if it was largely in flashback. She was the best performer in the original and her return was welcome. Holland Roden, Indya Moore and Thomas Cocquerel all get the job done as the new contestants in this round of the game. The movie is short on character development for everyone (more on that later) so they all have to work with what they're given and they all have their moments with their respective screen time.I enjoyed this movie for what it was but its detractors do have the facts straight about it. This is largely the same recipe, with the same ingredients and mostly the same finished product. There's no revelatory details given or a more final reason for Minos torturing these people or having unlimited resources to toy with their victims (there is more there but to explain would give away the end). I don't want to sound like an apologist but there's no mandate that a sequel has to be wholly different or reinvent the formula. This isn't new for the genre, why do you think we got how many sequels to Friday the 13th or a Nightmare on Elm Street? So if you didn't like the original or if you need something new, there's no need to apply here.As much as Tournament of Champions doesn't rewrite the formula or hugely expand this universe, I think this franchise has a lot of potential and its underrated. Despite Escape Room being completely outlandish, its not as mean spirited as the Saw franchise (or any less implausible) but just like Saw, its about the traps and Tournament delivers on that front. Throw in a decent ending twist and I got what I wanted out of Escape Room 2. If you enjoyed the first one and aren't expecting too much in development or progression, this is worth checking out.

44,trinaboice,So much screaming and mumbling,5,10 July 2021,"Movie review: Escape Room Tournament of ChampionsIN A NUTSHELL:
This is the sequel to the first Escape Room, which was a movie I thought was pretty fresh and fun. If you saw and liked the first movie, you'll probably like this one, although I think it's inferior in many ways.In this installment in the franchise, six people unwittingly find themselves locked in another series of escape rooms, quickly uncovering the fact that they are all survivors of other escape room games. Joining forces with two of the original survivors, they get killed off one at a time until... The movie is directed by Adam Robitel.THINGS I LIKED:
The introduction of the film shows clips from the first Escape Room movie that was released in 2019 to remind you of what happened and who survived. The film picks up a short time after the first movie.It starts off pretty slowly. Nothing much happens until about 20 minutes into the movie.If you love solving puzzles and mysteries, you'll probably get a kick out of this movie.The first film was marketed as a horror, but this one is much less gruesome than the original.The cast includes Taylor Russell and Logan Miller from the first movie, as well as new additions Indya Moore, Holland Roden, Isabelle Fuhrman, Carlito Olivero, and Thomas Cocquerel.It's suspenseful and you feel some tension with almost non-stop action.The movie flies by quickly.There's a twist. I love twists.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It helps to have seen the first movie to understand more about the two main characters and the villains.Sadly, there is no character arc at all, so the movie seems pointless.Soooo much overacting and screaming.None of the new characters are very appealing or even interesting. We just don't learn anything about them so it makes it really hard to care whether they live or die. I don't want to give away any spoilers...but I was really happy when the first person died because ""they"" were easily my least favorite.Sometimes it's hard to understand what everyone's saying because they're either yelling or mumbling.It would have been way better if each of the characters had a special set of skills that would force them all to listen to one another and help. Instead, they often just yell, ""Listen to her!"" referring to Zoey Davis (played by Taylor Russell) who is the smartest person in the rooms every time and solves everything.The clues fly fast and furiously. In fact, people figure out clues so fast and race off to the next one before you've even had the satisfaction of mulling it over in your brain to feel smarter than the characters.The action scenes where all of the characters are screaming and running around are just too frenzied.There really isn't any plot. There's nothing that really propels the story forward. There's no big payoff that leaves the audience satisfied.Terrible dialogue.The musical score is mostly annoying with pounding sounds and screeches.Some of the clues and details make no sense at all. One example is a scene when there is acid rain melting metal and everything in its path, but for some reason, an umbrella is able to protect one of the characters.The villain is faceless, which could be fun, but it's also just annoying.Yep, the movie ends with a tease for ANOTHER sequel. Is that something you want?Unfortunately, the movie is extremely forgettable. There were no stand-out moments that made me excited to watch them again.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

You never knew what would be the piece that would fit. I am one of the few ppl that if you had to count on me to help you with an escape room, you would surly die! That being said, I think every thing that happened in this movie happened as expected out of ppl who were really playing. With so many bad reviews I wonder if they are true fans or just nit picking because things were not A+ perfect. After a while lets see if you can come up with new ideas to out stand your old ones. I will say this, I have never seen a movie with TWO bad guys at the end! This movie was insane, and if you loved the first one you will love this one, just not as much lol. Only thing that made me roll my eyes was how the girls died in the acid rain instead of running back under the tarp in front of the store.

Escape Room 2: Tournament of Champions is about six people who unwittingly find themselves locked in another series of escape rooms, slowly uncovering what they have in common to survive. Joining forces with two of the original survivors, they soon discover they've all played the game before. At its best escape room 2 was mediocre, at its worst it was an absolute cash grabbing mess.My first few positives would be the set up and fun idea. The good cinematography. As well as the good character background and humour. I liked that the film gave the main two characters from the first film Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) some good background into where they were at with their lives and dealing with the aftermath of the first film. It gave you some insight into both characters and due to the attachment to them from the first film, set this up on the right path. I also thought the set up and general idea was fun and a good idea for a sequel. Having everyone competing having previously taken part in the games was a fun idea, and it made it more interesting in terms of it being different as to why they were all chosen. This added a compelling element to the film and set up a good mystery. I also thought the cinematography improved considerably within this film. You could tell they put a higher budget within the rooms and the overall look of the film, and it showed. With much more realistic and aesthetically pleasing rooms, and it made it look more like a film that could hold its own with other horror thrillers within this genre, so they stepped up in this department. I also thought some (not all as will be discussed in upcoming paragraphs) of the humour landed well. Some of the cast especially Logan Miller and Holland Roden had some good comedic chemistry, it bought some much-needed breaks within the tension to learn or just have that little moment with the characters to connect with them more.Now for some negatives. The opening was unneeded, the dialogue was terrible. The characters were unfortunately direct copies from the first film and the performances were not very good. The opening for this film felt unneeded, it just repeated what happened in the previous film. It treated the audience who have all most likely have seen the first film like they were dumb. It just felt unnecessary and it was almost treated like a tv episode not another feature film. The dialogue was terrible. Extremely corny, simple, and ineffective. The script was lazy and amateurish and really cheapened the film. The writing really wasn't up to standard and was a very noticeable issue. Unfortunately, the performances here were not very good, they ranged from laughably bad too mediocre. It just felt like a student film, no offense to the actors it might have just been how they were directed or the script, but all they were doing was shouting at the screen the whole time and reacting in an over-the-top manner, I did not see any star making performances here which is a shame. What also didn't help this was the fact that the characters felt like direct copies of the ones from the first film. From how they looked or behaved, to even their specific role within the film. The new characters didn't stand out at all and no effort was put into making the audience care for them.My final few positives would be the tense tone, building of tension. The creative escape rooms. As well as the decent final twist and final act. The film was at its best when it focused on its escape rooms. They were fun and creative with some really interesting puzzles for the characters to solve. The bank escape room was incredibly strong and easily where the film was at its strongest. It executed a great tense tone and built tension very well, with the rooms unpredictable nature, and for those brief moments of adrenaline you cared about what happened to the characters. I also thought the final act and the plot twist was decent. I respect the film for going in a surprising and different direction that I didn't see coming. Was it executed in the best way, definitely not but it added an interesting new dynamic to the film and rose the stakes well.My final few negatives for the film would be the dumb character decisions, lack of character depth. Lack of development to the plot, and finally the odd creative decisions. This film was riddled with odd creative decisions and dumb character choices. It felt like the film deliberately removed the characters or seemingly killed them off to then have them reappear without any explanation twenty minutes later. It was creatively strange and made the film come across as very clunky to me, and the characters made too many dumb decisions, disobeying the other characters, or not listening to them even though they were right, it just came across as forced and irritating. I also thought that the characters lacked any form of depth. What I liked so much about the first film was that they spent time giving each character a motivation and some background so you could connect or understand them as people more. All of that went out of the window here, the film treated the characters like afterthoughts, with no background or depth so therefore my interest in them decreased as the film developed, it was very lazy writing. Finally, there just wasn't enough development to the story, it just felt like a repeat of the first film with the escape rooms. They didn't expand the story world or develop the villains at all keeping the audience in the dark to lazily set up another film. This made my interest in the film slowly decrease as nothing of notable was happening to expand the franchise.Overall, Escape Room 2: Tournament of champions is a fun idea and is certainly watchable. With some creative escape rooms. But It offers nothing new and loses what worked so well with the first film. The tension got lower as my interest waned. Leaving you with a recycled, cheap, and messy sequel. That just honestly felt lazily made.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
57,aastikhimta,A fine sequel,7,10 September 2021,The plot starts from the end of last part and the first room was fine too. Idk about others but this was something new and I loved it .

However by the halfway point, I was just hoping for the movie to end. Outside of the visuals and effects which I thought were fantastic, everything else stunk.First the acting was so bad in this movie. Second the movie diddn't have a coherent direction and it was all over the place. Third things that happened as well as characters actions defyed any sort of logic even for a movie. Lastly the movie overall was very draggy.Skip this one, you're not missing anything here.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
59,bangel3322,Alternate version better than theatrical.....,8,14 September 2021,"Ok so I've seen 2 versions of this film. I saw the theatrical version, which saw the character of Amanda return as the room designer, and then there is the version where we see the puzzle master, Henry whose wife died and he has his daughter, Claire locked in a cage. Now the second version is much better because it makes much more sense than the first version. At the same time, I really like the first one because the twist that Amanda had designed the rooms based on her daughter was a really good twist, however the second version where Claire turns out to be psychopath is even better. (Makes room for a third movie). However I know the DVD release is going have an additional 25mins footage and so I don't know if that's going to be completely different, but I'm excited to find out.I loved the first film, I thought the actors (apart from Zoey) were great and the rooms were so meticulously detailed. In the second film the room traps are even better and more intricate. Really have to give props to the writers for coming up with such unique ideas. Again, I liked the cast of the second film (apart from Zoey; something about her is rather annoying) and it really was a good, thrilling watch. For me though, I would have liked this to have been a little bit longer. Yes, I know in the movie they have a time limit in each room, but as a lover escape rooms myself, I almost wanted to solve the puzzles along with them, but it was so fast that some of the intrigue gets a little lost in the speed. Nevertheless I really enjoyed the story, the acting, the detailing; all just brilliant. Depending on which version you watch, you may need to see the first film. But they do give you a recap of what's happened in the beginning so you'd be able to follow along.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
60,movieman6-413-929510,Hopefully this film series can be escaped from.,2,31 July 2021,"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is sequel of the movie Escape Room from 2019. This sequel is directed by Adam Robitel, who also directed the first part.After Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) think they have put their escape room experience behind them, they end up in an escape room with four others. Together with the others they have to survive from new, bigger and more difficult escape room. While doing this, the players must also discover what they have in common in order to stop the organization behind the escape rooms forever.Because the escape room from 2019 earned well, there was opportunity and money for this sequel. They make the situations of the escape rooms a bit bigger and more exaggerated. For example, the film sets look a bit better and more creative compared to the first film. With the visual effects you can still see that they have been placed in the film with CGI or a green screen, so that the credibility of the film is somewhat lost. The film is also a bit too unbelievable, because many things happen too precisely or on time.Although the puzzles of the escape rooms should be more difficult in this second film, the characters still manage to solve the mysteries quickly. Sometimes so fast that you as a viewer don't get a chance to try it yourself, so that the fun of the first film is lost in this sequel.The acting is done in an appropriate way by the film cast, but except for the returning characters, you get too little background information from the new characters for the viewer to really care about them during their escape room ordeals. Some die in the film themselves before your as viewer learns the names of their characters.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
61,leesimon-26357,Insultingly bad writing and dialogue with good production values,3,19 September 2021,"This and the first one are great ideas. I so want to love them both. This one is MUCH worse than the first. Much, much, much more insulting to ones intelligence, simply in terms of how people talk to each other, and how scenes move between one another.Here are 2 things that are unarguably great, in my opinion and for my taste: the soundtrack and the set designs (despite some lazy inconsistencies in certain integral set pieces that screamed ""just leave it in, no one will notice.)But the story development, plot points and dialogue (ie. All of the writing) was so terribly awful.Stupid and lazy writing examples (spoilers:) blood money refers to proceeds of crime, not inheritance, why does someone fearful of flying plan a plane ride when renting a car is always an option, why is the dad obsessed with killing zoe, why is the daughter a prisoner, why does a ""prisoner"" (not really) tearfully blurt out that she know hat it's like to lose a mother, when she is the one who murdered her mother, why is the daughter for, then against, then for again, then against again, then the mastermind of Minos, why is there a plot point about melting a chain using acid rain that falls from the sky, when the chain is fully under the rainfall, and finally why does Minos have control of the New York underground? There are at least 100 other examples of lazy plot holes.Even the trap rooms are not as ""realistic"" as the first, in that the first one had bombastic, insanely expensive and creative rooms, and this one has rooms that don't follow the laws of physics, or even their own internal rules.I just really hated it. I might see the first one again, but I'll never watch this piece of crap again. I also completely agree with the review that says that the first 20 mins are a total, stupid waste of time. It's not as low as 1 star, because I genuinely enjoyed the soundtrack, and I found that the music fit the tone. The movie also looks good. Money went into the sets and cinematography, just not at all in the writing, obviously. Watch it once so you can say you saw all the trap rooms.

63,tfminfl,its Saw... for teens,7,28 July 2021,"528. Escape Room: Tournament of Champions. Went into this one with really low expectations, and that worked because I kind of liked it. In other words, I'll probably never watch it again, but if someone else was watching it, I'd say, yeah, that wasn't too bad. I can't really say that I remember the first one all to well, or if I even watched it, but lucky for me this one is pretty short and spends a good amount of that short runtime recapping the first movie, and doing a montage leading up to the main characters getting 'trapped' in the new escape room? But it's not an escape room. This is a Saw movie for 13- to 16-year-olds who don't have cool parents that let them watch R-rated movies. It even has a previous survivor named Amanda, hmmm. Instead of mastermind Jigsaw running the show, it felt more like the wealthy people behind the events of Hostel. In this the main characters Zoey and Ben, part 1's survivors, are investigating the company behind the escape rooms, and find themselves on a subway after being mugged. After what seems like an accident, they discover that they are trapped in another escape room, oh no! What about the other passengers, well, it just so happens that the handful of people in this subway car, are survivors of other escape rooms as well! One even exclaims this must be a tournament of champions, no joke there... And like the Saw movies, they must work together to figure out the elaborate traps to survive each room. My guess, this was a Saw script at one time, and someone passed, someone else picked it up, changed a few things and boom Escape Room franchise born. Like I said going into it with low expectations of watching a horror movie made for younger teens, helps a lot. For what it was, it was decent. Short enough with a decent pace so boredom doesn't set it. The acting, well it's like any other teen horror movie acting, meh... Filmbufftim on FB.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Direct sequel to the 1st movie Escape Room (2019), with Zoey willing to expose those who designed these deadly Escape Rooms and Ben following her as she saved his life despite the fact that he realizes the danger they are running into. Eventually they will have to deal with new escape rooms and with them will be also survivors from other escape rooms, making it something like a tournament of champions this time. Like the first film, this one is also quite intelligent in the rooms design and in the deadly traps against time, with very good effects and direction and generally quite good acting. The struggle for survival against time and deadly traps, and the strong suspense, also in the positives of the film. However, the fact that it was short in duration and did not go deep enough into the new characters of the film, as well as the fact that it came into action almost immediately, are the downsides. The film should rebuild the new characters for the viewer, something that it did not do. Also some characters should have been more convincing, like Claire (Orphan) and some of the other survivors. The big positives, however, are the revelations about the mysterious unknown creators of the escape rooms, as well as the big plot twists at the end of the film. It leaves room for the third and perhaps last film of a very good trilogy in general in the genre and perhaps the best with this concept.

All I wanted was an hour and a half or so of decent entertainment.Well, I didn't get it.I don't want to tear this movie apart but it was no where near as good as the first. The characters had potential to be interesting, but they were never really developed. The puzzles were either too complex to follow or they just made no sense at all. Part of the fun of the first one was trying to solve them along with the cast, but you really can't do that with this one. The "" surprise "" ending was just goofy fan service. Sadly, because I really wanted to like this one, I have to say that Tournament of Champions is more like Tournament of Fail.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

This movie was welcome especially after watching countless movies on streaming at home since more than a year here in Canada. The premise is similar to the first movie as this one is a direct sequel and it starts of immediately. No boring or dull moments.

94,Benslie,Just watch the trailer for this movie,4,28 July 2021,"I wasn't a big fan of the first movie but one of the things I could appreciate about it was the production design. This movie built upon those smaller rooms to help create these much bigger ones. The rooms easily felt like their own characters in the movie and probably were my favourite ones since the actual characters were still very much boring. It honestly felt like none of the actors were really giving it their all even in moments where they're close to death. You never feel connected to these characters and wanting to route for them to survive. I feel like the only person who was actually trying their best was Logan Miller and to that, I have to give him props. I would recommend that if you're planning on seeing this movie maybe skip watching the trailer and looking on IMDB since both spoil an already predictable movie. At first, I thought the ending to this movie was much better than the first one but then the more I thought about it the more I realized that I figured this all out at the very beginning because of the trailer. I feel like the main issue though for this movie is most likely the movie's run time. Unlike other sequel movies, this one actually has a shorter time which meant that a lot of things had to be bullet-pointed and rushed. Apparently, it also meant they didn't have time for dialogue with a shorter run time since I felt like there was barely any talking in this movie. In the end, this movie just makes me appreciate the first movie so much more and they should've just done an anthology series for these movies.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

This one was kinda hard to keep up with but still entertaining for the most part, although it did copy some stuff from first, like instead of drowning they were being buried.I was worried it would lose the horror element and would be more action adventure thankfully it wasnt. The characters from the first were also better written, and more memorable, i dont see myself remembering the people here except for the two leads.The twist i saw coming a mile away.

96,waltermwilliams,Escape to Cape Town,7,5 July 2021,"When the original film only cost $9m to make but raked in over $150m naturally Columbia Pictures created a sequel.Rarely is a sequel as good if not marginally better than the first incarnation, but this one is.You have 88 minutes to find a an exit from Escape Room: Tournament of Champions.If only more movie makers could tell their story in under 2 hours like Director Adam Robitel...the man behind both films.The sequel is set in New York, but actually filmed in Cape Town & Western Cape, South Africa.In this version of the story (which I feel is part of a trilogy) the six chosen players have all survived their own game against a faceless corporation...hence tournament of champions.Clearly the producers have a much bigger budget to work with than the original movie and aren't afraid to spend it on lavish Art Deco Banks with frickin' laser beams, Beach landscapes with dangerous sands, New York street scapes with acid rain and Underground Railways with shocking journeys.Little known stars Taylor Russell and Logan Miller are back as Zoey and Ben trying to expose the corporate monsters behind these lavish games.In fact, these movies doesn't rely on any marquee names to make them work...its more about the puzzles as they and the cinema audience try to solve them before time runs out.Despite the implied violence this action, adventure, horror fest is only M rated.Don't expect ""Saw"" type on screen torture, this is more Hitchcock inspired horror in your own mind.This movie will do for Escape Rooms what ""Final Destination"" did for Flying and Highway Road Trips.Just be prepared to suspend belief that these convoluted Rooms were made by some powerful rich people who get more than just their kicks on Route 66.Be prepared for another instalment in this series, judging by the open ending to Escape Room 2.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Lacking in any logic or characters who talk and act like people.Then. I saw the extended cut.The original cut makes it obvious they were working from a very bad script and plot. Several characters who seem to be the puppet masters behind the scenes of the games. Sadly, these scenes are turgid, boring and make no sense in the narrative.It's so clear the theatrical release went through a lot of reshoots to somehow make the story work. They failed.

Overall: 49/100
IMDb: 4/10
Letterboxd: 2/5I was disappointed with this one. It didn't bring as much excitement or energy as the first film did. The acting didn't feel emotionally driven, was kind of rigid, and sub-par at best.While, the escape rooms were obviously different from the first film, they didn't feel all that dangerous. They were cool concepts, but they didn't provide the same heart-pounding action and excitement of the first film. Lastly, while the story was decent, in that it made sense and it was somewhat enjoyable. Nothing truly stands out about it. A certain point in the beginning of the film things peaked and then just kind of held a line until the end.Overall, not a film I'd recommend watching in theatres because it's not an outstanding movie. It's mediocre at best. Acting is rigid and nearly emotionless, story, while good, isn't engaging, and there's nothing truly horrifying or thrilling about this movie.That's it for this one....

102,Healing_Process,A movie originating from the intellectual pursuit of Escape Rooms and turned into a pseudo-intellectual Attention-deficit movie of poor writing,3,27 September 2021,"This movie is hardly anything like the first one. If you're expecting this, prepare to be disappointed. Not only disappointed that it isn't like the original but disappointed because it actually insults the intelligence of all humans who watch it.They make the rooms chaotic, not memorable, and not fun to solve. They give no character development and they only yell at each other without even allowing the audience to solve the puzzles with them. This whole movie only raised question marks. The ""Champions"" go through the rooms so fast the movie will be half over before you even know it and when the final ""room"" is solved, the movie takes a nose dive to end it with a ""twist"" as fast as possible, so fast that you will scratch your head even trying to understand how the movie came to its conclusion.This has to be one of the worst high production cost movies I've seen post-covid. It never gives you a break, there are no smart moves, its yelling for the sake of yelling, bad humor for the sake of bad humor, plot armor and over the top privilege for the main character, and a weird feminism over tone where its the women who behind everything and the women who are the smartest while they kill male characters and make them seem dumb or a form of cannon fodder.I would be please advise to watch this with caution and be careful watching this.

103,flowerstardust1979,Forced Sequel With Bad Acting.,4,12 September 2021,"I quite enjoyed the first movie, it wasn't a masterpiece but it was fun.Tournament Of Champions, a forced sequel purely put together as a moneymaker which no doubt involved 2 hours of writers around a table for 2 hours scratching their heads to scramble together some sort of script. This was the outcome.Tournament Of Champions spends the first 15 minutes with a quick recap of the first movie followed by a silly opening scene to explain the origins of the first movie and what is to follow.We are left with the two original survivors and introduced to some new characters who are the Champions of other escape room's. Pretty much none of the new actors have any acting ability, I'm so bored that I'm fixated on wondering how many fillers Holland Roden has had to look so unintentionally angry, pair that with around 4 escape room's, some okay CGI which I'm assuming is to divert your attention from the plot, ending with a barbaric ""twist"" And some more bad acting. Logan Miller is the only talent in this farce.Poor show, gave extra stars for the only impressive star of the movie, special effects.There you have it folks, Tournament of boredom. Where have all of the decent scriptwriters gone?! Please Sony, don't make a prequel!",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

This one on the other hand, the script was awful - cheesy, pointless dialogue, a lot of the puzzle resolves happened so fast and weren't as well thought-out as the ones in the first film, the characters didn't have any depth and were annoying; it even felt like the actors knew the script was terrible, a lot of them looked like they were there just to pick up a paycheck.Something else I liked about the first film was that it was paced really well and had intricate and interesting puzzles, but in the sequel everything is just rushed, nothing but screaming, panicking and then quickly and randomly solving the puzzle without giving the viewer time to digest what even just happened.It's a shame, I was really looking forward to this film, but in the end I was left disappointed by its terribly lazy and all over the place writing. This franchise went from a film worthy of being shown in theatres, to some cringy TV movie.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
105,jimwt66,Made in a rush to cash in,4,5 October 2021,The movie while looking good was pointless. The previous type escape rooms movies such as the one before this or the Cube versions were better. Everything was rushed and yelled.For some reason they made it out like Zoey was some genius but nothing she did was really earth shattering in the way of intellect. It wasn't till the end where they were talking about a bunch of symbols and she was saying descriptions of them in nerd words (which was no help at all but I am guessing to finally show that she is smart) that you could think she was smart. The one guy kept saying she saved me so we need to do what she says is not a reason to believe someone knows what they are doing.The acid room was stupid. A splash of the acid hits their skin and it gives them blisters but a squirt bottle of it on a metal lock eats right through it in seconds. Let's not forget all the things they were touching in that room that had already been sprayed in acid and yet no burns when they touched the wet surfaces.The only death that would seem to be nasty would be the acid room. The other one was electric shock and then being buried under sand.Overall I was disappointed in this. Basically their escaping each room was based on luck except for the one where she helped the trap designer to escape. Then we find out it was just a little girl who was born a sociopath and liked to hurt things. It seems she was locked up to keep her from hurting random people in the world and instead hurt the people they wanted hurt.,Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

I think I enjoyed the first one a little bit better. It would have been good if they gave a short character development of the other casts that we didn't see in the last one.

107,tomtalbotty,The mysteries just keep unraveling,10,21 July 2021,"Just been to the cinema to watch Escape Room 2 the tournament of champions. Like the name suggests this is putting six people together like the orginal movie into different Escape Rooms, but this time it is people known as the champions basically people who have beat the game before, but obviously Zoey and Ben are the ones from the previous Escape Room movie and the only ones that where both of them made it out alive due to Zoey pretending to be dead when gassed in the hospital in the previous film. Then fighting to save Ben as well so both of them made it out unlike the others where there is only one winner per Escape Room. In Escape Room 2 these champions now face it head to head as they are tricked into participating in this Escape Room like last time, but with interesting twists and turns along the way. The Escape Rooms got even more creative with them becoming more complex, however I did feel like they kind of rushed over them unlike the first movie. Obviously this maybe intentional by the writers as it sets up Zoey and Ben's next chapter as Minos controls the game and only makes you think that you have some kind of control, which overall makes for an interesting watch and nothing is ever what it seems. Hoping for a third movie to tie it all off, which I hope the writers have taken this into account. I highly recommend this film a very fast paced continuation from the last movie with amazing set design incorporated into the VFX. The plot twists just keep on coming well done to Taylor Russell and Logan Miller for your amazing performances as well as the rest of the cast and crew on making this movie so mind bogglingly entertaining as well as leaving us on the edge of our seats wondering what happens next. Also one last thing is I have never seen a film do a previously before it was like watching a TV show, but I appreciated the recap at the start preparing us for the mysteries that is about to unravel. I definitely think movie movie sequels should do this as people can easily forget key details. 😲😀",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

I actually enjoyed the first one and this one too, but one thing bothered me throughout the whole movie. It was STRESSFUL! Seeing them try and solve it. A feeling that makes you want them to escape already or to figure out how. It's both a good thing and a bad thing.Pros:
CGI is goodActing is good actually.It's a very good thing that Zoeyy and Ben were only best-friends because it would have been a show stopper for me if they got into, you know.A bit thrillingI like the twist! I didn't expect it and it's one that actually satisfying.Sick dubstep for the end creditsZoey and Ben rocks! (RIP to the others though)Cons:
Enjoyable but annoying to watch because seeing them solve these complex escape rooms is stressful in a way.

122,jaredkjacoby,On Par with the Original for Better or Worse,6,18 July 2021,"Tournament of Champions takes place after the first film, but it strangely ignores the ending from the first film where MINOS is setting up the traps for Zoe and Ben who agree to take a flight to take them down. Instead, the story follows Zoey driving with Ben to New York City after letting her fear of flying get to her. The two make it to the abandoned building before being mugged and led to a train. Said train happens to be an escape room and Zoey and Ben must survive the rooms with four other champions.I have a big soft spot for the first Escape Room. As flawed as it was, it left a bigger impression on me than most films that I gave higher scores to. It made me think of a reality game show crossing over with The Running Man. At its best moments, it was damn good. I guess you can call me a fan in a way. Even though the ending was an annoying sequel bait, I still wanted to see what a sequel would do. Does Tournament of Champions improve on the first film, or does it join the long list of pointless sequels? Or possibly both?As someone who liked the first film quite a bit, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a mixed bag, but it mainly leans on the positive side. It takes a few steps forward and a few steps backwards in quality. First, the rooms themselves. They are awesome. Each one has a unique twist and each room is better than the last with the city room being my personal favorite. There is a bigger sense of urgency here, especially in that particular room. There is even a room that had two exits which was pretty cool. The beach room was incredibly impressive for its size and production values. While there are less rooms than the last movie, the traps and riddles are better because they improve as the film continues whereas the first film's few rooms flamed out after the excellent upside down room. The production is great and the rooms look quite real and terrifying. I buy them as real deadly escape rooms. The beach room in particular looked real for a second, but then it turned out to be painted as one. It just looks great. The cinematography is pretty solid as well with a few shots being great such as the characters running upstairs in a screwy staircase that shows their shadows in a fun way. I liked everything about the rooms and the production and the fact that the budget for this film was so low makes its technical aspects even more impressive.The biggest problem for me is the characterization of the new characters. They all had potential and were pretty likable to some degree, but we learn very little about them. One of the new competitors gets killed in the first room before we even learn their name. To be fair, that might be a result of shock value to get the audience to realize anyone can die in these situations before you get to know them. Brianna is hugely wasted and is one-dimensional. She gets so little to work that even the guy who died in the first room is more fleshed out than her. Rachel and Nathan are a little better as they have some development, but they do not stand out compared to Zoey and Ben. I just wish they had more characterization because I like the cast as a whole especially Indya Moore and Holland Roden. They do a great job handling their development throughout the film. As for Zoey and Ben, they are likable as they were in the first film, if not more so. I like that Zoey has started feel some regret about her choice to come back as she questions if she is really doing the right thing. Ben in general is so much nicer here than the first film. He changed completely and it is for the better. He was a bit of a bum and troublemaker in the first film, but he is a friendly and loyal guy here. I was gritting my teeth for their survival the whole way through. It helps that Logan Miller and especially Taylor Russell give great performances here.The story is terrifying on its own. Zoey and Ben get robbed to their next big mission essentially. Just the thought of being mugged and being brought into the deadly rooms again is pretty terrifying on its own. I think both Escape Room films work better as action-thrillers than pure horror films. Sure, there are some scary elements here, but it is fast paced and the players need to think three steps ahead. However, some of the rooms are horrifying and last one before the twist takes the cake. Also, the twist at the end involves one of the players from the first film and even though it is a bit unbelievable, it is quite terrifying to see how this organization breaks people. That is what makes this film work. It does not rely on jump scares or shock value (though they are there), but the atmosphere and reactions of the characters. This film is even more bleak than the first film. There is very little sense of fun because all of these players went through this before and now they have to do it again, possibly having to kill each other to survive. The only thing is that I think the deaths in the first film were handled with more care. The players in the first film took time to mourn the deaths of their teammates or fellow competitors which made them more emotionally impactful. Here, they kind of die and the others move on, though there is one death that stood out. Overall, the plot is fine, the dialogue is solid and the twist at the end is genuinely surprising. I did not expect the movie to make the turn it did at the end. Unfortunately, this movie ends with another sequel hook. Thanks Sony...Escape Room: Tournament of Champions will not win any new fans over, but I liked it about as much as the first one. It is a good sequel to a flawed, but fun thriller. I got what I wanted from the film for the most part: insane escape rooms and traps.

Sort of like a cross between The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and a much tamer version of Saw, Tournament of Champions follows Zoey and Ben, the survivors from the first film who find themselves trapped in a new and more elaborate game concocted buy the shadowy organisation Minos, alongside a bunch of other previous winners.There are some pretty intense sequences in this film and the rooms overall are an improvement on the original. There's a particularly good one set in a bank vault with a laser security grid. I thought the characters as well were less obnoxious and more likeable this time around, but you won't be particularly gutted to see any of them killed off. The distinctly sub-par acting also didn't help, I actually laughed at one point because the line delivery was so poor.It was weird to see the film open up with a 'previously on Escape Room' recap that you'd expect to see on a TV show, and the ending was just as facepalmingly silly as the first.

127,adotson-98233,This fast paced thriller is better than the first,7,22 July 2021,"""Escape Room 2"" is a very fun, and fast paced movie that features great production design, and clever puzzles.What I liked about the movie is of course the rooms themselves. They're very well designed and very fun. The production design is fantastic. The performances also were pretty good. I thought Taylor Russell gave a better performance here than in the first one. Also the pacing was pretty good. It never got slow or boring. And I really liked how they have hints early on on the movie to suggest something bigger which I thought was pretty cool.Now this isn't a perfect movie, and I do have a few issues with it. First the ending is not very good. It does the same thing the first movie does and it just didn't work. Also the movie didn't do a lot new from the first one which felt like a bit of a wasted opportunity. And finally the characters aren't very well fleshed out. They're played well enough to make me care a little about a few of them.Overall despite this movie not doing much new, and not sticking the ending, ""Escape Room 2"" is still a very fun, and enjoyable thriller with great production design, good acting, and fast pacing.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

136,malice_o_conner,"A intelligent concept, lacking the rest",4,2 August 2021,"While I appreciate the concepts drawn in by the first one, an escape room that's bigger than anticipated. However this one takes away from that theme by over-doing everything, the games are changed rules, the people know the game now, and everything becomes different. Usually this can work but I felt the writing was horribly flawed and the characters I didn't really know or care. (Minus the originals)
They tried to make a few twists and turns but they fall flat as either to obvious or that it's nonsensical. While the clever trap rooms had some ideas to make a puzzle it almost seemed overly convenient each time, where the traps were designed to kill, the designers some how knew who would survive or not, as well as the players almost seemed to get into position with the most effect to solve the puzzle. This is a decent popcorn movie but I'd wait to watch at home.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
137,Darvener,"Horrible cinema experience with bad VFX, screenplay and almost everything",1,2 October 2021,"Six winners of previous escape rooms are catched again by Minos and they will play an escape game again.This movie is directed by Adam Robitel - the director of the first movie, and written by four people Will Honley, Maria Melnik, Daniel Tuch and Oren Uziel.At the beginning of the movie they recapitulated to us what happened in the previous movie in a strange way that doesn't look good. After that they will catch the six winners of the previous escape rooms to one subway car and then they will start playing an Escape Room: The Tournament of Champions. First escape room is executed quite cleverly because players need to find all false advertisements and then pull all necessary levers. The concept of all escape rooms is that all the rooms must be done cleverly, because otherwise any idiot would solve it and this Minos don't want to, but there are rooms that can solve any idiot. This hasn't been anywhere told, but by a simple logic this is true, because what organizer would like to create rooms that can solve anyone without a brain or without logical thinking.Director of this movie is Adam Robitel who was director of the first movie Escape Room. As I said at the beginning they will show us what happened in the first movie. The idea to recapitulate what happened in the previous movie is a quite good idea, but they showed it to us in a strange way that doesn't look good. After that you can notice that some performances of actors are not done well, you can see from their mimics and by the loudness of voice in rage situations that they are acting and this doesn't look natural. For this movie I think that Adam Robitel didn't do a good job enough, because he wasn't able to force the actors to act naturally and to empathize with their roles.Screenplay was written by already mentioned four writers Will Honley, Maria Melnik, Daniel Tuch and Oren Uziel. As I said before the first puzzle is quietly made good, but after the subway car it is worse and worse. I think that they have written characters with some logical thinking but during writing the script the writers have lost their logical thinking. In some puzzles the characters noticed something that is hard to notice and everything feels scripted. Almost nothing here doesn't feel natural and many of the things that were shown in this movie are not possible to create in the real world. Dialogues are written poorly and in some situations the dialogues were stupid. The screenplay for this movie is very, very bad.In the main role was character Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell) who was in the first movie too and she wanted to go after Minos because of justice. Except the two characters Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell) and Ben Miller (Logan Miller) there are new four characters Nathan (Thomas Cocquerel), Rachel Ellis (Holland Roden), Brianna Collier (Indya Moore) and Theo (Carlito Olivero). All performances of actors are on a strong average and in some cases below average. If we omit the performances of actors, the actors are chosen wisely, except for Thomas Cocquerel because he doesn't look at the character as they described it.The camera wasn't bad in this movie, but there are some problems too. In some cases the camera could be better - I mean better camera location, better angle or the camera could less move in some situations because it looks very strange and unprofessional.The VFX in this movie is horrible, because it looks very cheap. It looks that most of the budget was spent on something else than VFX. It is very important for this type of movie and I don't understand why they made low budget VFX.Movie wasn't good at all and I can't recommend it to you. Screenplay is very bad and the director as well. The whole movie feels that it is made by whole unprofessional people who are doing their first movie. This movie is a horrible cinema experience with bad VFX, screenplay and almost everything. It only deserves 4% for the first puzzle, if the first puzzle was horrible, the movie would get from me 0%.4%",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
138,tampajoey,"Rushed, chaotic, and disjointed compared to the first movie",6,13 September 2021,"My initial reaction was that the puzzles were underdeveloped, over-simplified, and often glossed over too quickly making this sequel feel mundane and void of originality. The entire movie felt rushed which diminished the feeling of suspense. Character development is non-existent, leaving the audience detached and impervious to this cast's fate. However, Taylor Russell did another masterful job playing Zoey and I've become a fan of her work. If there is a 3rd installment, I hope the writers and director put more thought into constructing the puzzles and devote more time examining, diagnosing, and solving them with a more meticulous suspenseful pace.

142,labeebster,"Tiny Entertainment, Huge Agenda",2,11 September 2021,"Another franchise going further in the direction of the leftist/liberal agenda. Horrible acting, horrible writing, unbelievable characters, pathetic script. This movie is not made for entertainment but it's another leftist/liberal message.The writers were like, 'Oh let's kill the athletic white man first because well, he's an athletic white man. Let's call someone ""European a-hole"" but let's not call any black or Asian person an a-hole. Let's kill all white men first and leave only women for the end. Also, let's make all the evil people behind this as men and ninety nine percent white. But wait, the evil white man needs to have a family and the person behind the intelligent rooms must be a female to make her look more intelligent than men. Oh but wait, she can't be evil because she's a female. OK so let's make the evil man force his wife and his daughter to use her intelligence in an evil way so they can appear as victims. He must be so evil, he would have no problem choking his own daughter and killing his own wife. And of course, the daughter is so intelligent that she can lock up the whole evil team of men within seconds.Last but not the least. Ben is saved by the female and he can't escape on his own and needs help of the intelligent women who have no problem solving puzzles on their own.""
Seriously, if they want to make a sequel, this is what might work: New actors. Zoey & Ben are too obvious now. Everyone knows they won't die. Less shouting all the time. Less of ' that character must be saved because it's a female/black person/Asian.' Less of 'that character must either die early on or be evil because he's a white man.'

To me the characters are not the most likeable so the support and rooting for them is not there.Overall: The movie is similar to the first in terms of quality and plotlines with just a bigger budget. However, it still does not go all out in creativity of puzzles or stick the landing with its storytelling containing generic characters.With a title and plot of a story of Champions you would expect some smart and intelligent puzzles with great characters, but you get quite the opposite and an almost copy of the first.Some of the puzzles are creative, but overall a good live escape room will definitely serve more enjoyment and creativity than this movie.2.4/5.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

However more than the first one this managed to capture really well the atmosphere of what it's like doing an escape room - everyone scrambling around shouting out what they can find in a frenzied panic. Except here of course the threat is death. I also think they did make a real attempt to make it unpredictable who was going to get bumped off and when, I didn't see them coming when they did. I watched the alternate cut, and read about the differences to the theatrical cut online . The 2 cuts are significantly different so consider which one you want to watch.

But it ended up being kind of a boring movie. I think what made the first one work was the concept and the idea and the story wrapped around really good character development and relationships. This movie seemed to abandon all that and mostly focus on diabolical traps. It kind of reminds me of Final destination sequels. Each movie just forgot about the story and just turned into a competition on how much more gory and graphic we can get and how we can find ways to be more clever and killing people.

The beach scene at night is particularly gorgeous.What I did notice is, due to the success of the first movie, presumably with a more family-friendly audience, that this movie has lost most of the gore and adult content.

However, the 2nd Escape Room is shorter and has a much faster pacing than the first one, but most importantly everything is just so chaotic and messy all around.

Also, all the deaths are absurdly elaborate, involving some fantastical contraptions that look like they came out of an unusually stupid episode of the original Star Trek series; but this was probably done because more realistic and explicit death scenes would restrict the film's access to younger audiences. Anyhow, the whole movie is pretty much just a set up for the final plot twist, and without spoiling anything I'll just say that the twist is just preposterously unexpected and will leave many viewers scratching their heads out of bafflement as it just raises many new questions. I would recommend the ""Tournament"" only to those fans of the original who don't have high expectations from the sequel.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Really......when the entire purpose of these games is for disturbed rich people to watch people die? But that's just the beginning of the inconsistencies and implausibilities for these movies.....that are far too rehearsed, orchestrated, and regulated to make one feel like it's happening real time. The characters magically pull clues and answers out of thin air......just in the nick of time to solve the puzzle.....emotionally confused actors becoming rocket scientists! Then we get the ridiculous sacrifices......let's see now.....we could go under the car.....or just let acid spill on our bodies......well what did the writer call for......maybe let's dive into the quicksand? Or how about the mother who trusts her sick and twisted husband, a designer of the death traps, not to lock her in the burning sauna? So implausible is this movie that somehow this escape room company manages to take over and use a public subway system for one of their designs!

Then I went back for the extended cut and oh dear. It's dreadful. The acting of the new characters is attrocious and story just isn't as fun. In fact it's downright boring and stupid.

181,dizzymediainc,Poorly done,2,18 July 2021,"You can really tell they were not thinking when they made this movie, it is so bad lol it's barely watchable. At the very least Zoey is still all cute and cuddly but she's really not as smart as they portray her to be.If she was, she would have caught on to the obvious hints in her psych session or in the police station and she would not have gotten on a plane right after the incident. So... you have to wonder about her intelligence because they make her seem super smart yet she misses so much and even throughout the movie, it just seemed like she was a bit slow compared to the first movie.Straying off from Zoey, the rooms were poorly designed, with little to no hope for the players, compared to the rooms in the first game where they actually had time to survive and escape, where as here it's all time limited and forces you to progress, no matter how many die.It just seemed like it was not really planned out and they needed excuses to kill off various players in order to progress the story, and then at some point they reveal ""but wait we don't actually kill them"", yet throughout the whole movie all the players died lol like what? XD oooookaaaayyyyThis breaks a lot of the rules the first movie setup thus breaking immersion, i just couldn't take it seriously with how many bad plot holes there were and poor storytelling.In short, if you want an actual good escape movie, the first one is definitely better than the second.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

184,benjinightingale,Oh ok,4,11 September 2021,"So the first was really good , great casting and effects and a storyline which literally gave them a really great excuse for a sequel ....... I mean .... we got one .The first half was ok , felt a little rushed and not sure why but voiced over??? .After the subway scene it kinda just felt like it took a line of speed and everything got amped up but not in a great way . Then it just got silly and why with the effects did they loose the balls this time around ? Some scenes special effects were completely PG for the actually scene and what was happening, you had a great set up here for a gross epic point in the film , but made no sense! Either go balls to the walls and commit or don't bother the person doing it is obviously talented but again I feel a big wig got their way and they were wrong . The ideas were sound but just executed Like they had 2 days left to shoot half a film . The actors ( main contestants ) were great and pretty much they only reason why I carried on watching ! Especially hiring a trans woman of colour who can act , which I fully back applaud and supporter so bravo on that . The edit was poor and the sound just didn't need it and money was wasted . You can tell talented people worked on this film but I feel they weren't able to do what they do possibly because they were overridden by higher pay grades abd those people I feel aren't as talented maybe , and I hope they notice this . Anywhooooo super just meh about it . First one I'd watch again and again , this one ????? I'm good . You tried and made a film so kudos to you , anyone deserves respect for doing it but maybe don't rush it if a third one happens, or you take part in another project .

I kinda enjoyed the first movie even though it was pretty dumb, but this one takes it to the next level.The plot is so bad to the point it doesnt make any sense. The acting reminds me of those low budget D grade movies. Everyone i wailing through the entire movie to the point you have to mute your TV. The level design is horrendous and its made just to kill off all the people one by one. Everything happens so fast not even einstein would be lucky enough to get the clues. The characters dont talk like normal human beings but like scripted caricatures. There is also a dumb plot twist at the end that i couldnt care less.Waste of time and a pretty unnecessary sequel.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

189,brionesb,"Entertaining, but predictable sequel-bait movie",6,16 July 2021,"After the end of the original movie, it was pretty obvious that there was going to be a sequel that continues the story. This is the sequel to that movie.Right off the bat when the movie starts, the first movie and its events are re-capped which I thought was nice. And then this movie starts to basically pick up from there and starts getting into the story with Zoey, one of the survivors from the first movie, talking to a therapist. Ever since Zoey survived, she has been constantly looking at everything around her with paranoia as if she's still mentally stuck in an escape room. She mentions to the therapist that she has been thinking about taking a break & getting away, which she is encouraged to do and does so with the other survivor from the first film.From this point on, things happen & we eventually see both Zoey & Ben wind up in what turns out to be the first of many escape rooms and we meet other survivors from other escape rooms run by the company Minos. We then watch as the group attempts to work together as a team to solve the puzzles littered throughout each room they encounter, with a few of them meeting their end along the way as expected.As an overall movie, I thought this was a decent entry, if not a bit predictable. Right from the start, I guessed that it was highly likely that Zoey & Ben would survive so that there could be a third film and of course that turned out to be the case. I also predicted that the movie would drop lots of numerous, not so subtle hints that all of the events are leading into a third film. Most people seeing this will most likely quickly realize the Escape Room series was intended to be a trilogy. I don't really mind this, but I do wish that it felt less like they were using this movie to setup the next one and told a more complete and self contained story.Thankfully the overall acting was decent & most of the characters were likable enough. I also thought that most of the puzzles they encountered in each room were interesting, although I really disliked the one that took place in an underground bank. I thought this was the weakest and left the least amount of time for us the audience to puzzle our way through the clues they encountered. Otherwise, the rest of the movie seemed good enough.When the third movie finally comes, I do sincerely hope that it tells a satisfying story and wraps everything up rather than setting up the next one. I also hope they don't run this franchise into the ground by endlessly releasing sequel after sequel after sequel as this will quickly get old. Go see this if you were a fan of the original, I think you will be mostly satisfied given all of this movie's flaws.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

194,DTKinetic,"Fun, Flashy Continuation but doesn't Surpass Original",6,17 July 2021,"The Escape Room franchise has offered us a colorful, entertaining mix of action, suspense, horror, and adventure in the form of elaborate rooms with creatively deadly demises not too far from the vibes of Saw and Final Destination, though more mild/moderate on violence and more game/strategy oriented.If you liked the first movie, you should like the second. Although, be warned the only real improvement to this movie is the production & special effects.The characterization, plot, acting, etc of the first movie is on par at best if not lacking a bit more in those departments. Which is disappointing because there was more potential and more directions that could have been taken which were missed opportunities.The movie runs at a breakneck pace. The movie is exciting, and the first puzzle is really well staged, allows time for suspense, and I could mostly understand the puzzle. After that, the movie is often rocketing too fast to process the clues or doesn't make you anticipate the fear/peril of the trap before it presents itself.Outside of the original Zoe and Ben,I had no interest in the side characters--unlike Jason and Danny in the first whose personalities and roles really changed the aura of the scenes they were in--these characters just felt there. And in the beginning and ending, characters make decisions that don't add up.The fast pace just doesn't allow for further character development or thoughtful decision making. There IS one nice dilemma at the end of the Lighthouse room. But it lasts for 5 minutes and the end result is not satisfying. The plot is the same. There are a couple of twists near the climax but even having not expected one, they didn't have as much impact as they could've.Overall though, it's a fun diversion and continuation, with plenty of creative ideas and imagery. The puzzles are cool, but I think the puzzles in the first build more on practical fears and threats. If you liked the first one, then you should be pleasantly entertained still, however a more solid improvement would've been appreciated.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Then there were a few things that just made absolutely no sense to me. With all that said, for the most part, I found the rooms tense and enjoyable. The majority of the film is spent solving ridiculously hard puzzles and that was fun for me. Maybe on a bad day I would give this a 5 and I totally understand the lower ratings.

That's fine. But these characters have no... character!One man's an idiot, the women are very smart whilst the other men are both simps.

224,jboormancross,Mixed bag,6,16 July 2021,"I feel incredibly conflicted when deciding what to rate this film. If I were to base this film off of its opening 20-30 minutes which consisted of incredibly poor acting, writing, editing and predictable cliches or the endings insultingly stupid plot twist of Amanda still being alive and in charge of creating this films game based on the fact she ""beat the game"" as she wasn't seen dying on screen even though she clearly didn't beat the game then I'd have to rate this film a 1/10.However this film does deserve credit for creating characters that are willing to work together as a team and care for one another which is definitely a massive improvement on the previous film and other films similar to this. However I couldn't help but feel irritated by the films opening Councelling scene which tried to claim that Amanda and Zoey supposedly cared for one another in the previous film which is a load of nonsense. On top of this the foreshadowing at the beginning of the film is incredibly patronising, as it attempts to point out things that will later appear in the film as if the audience were children who couldn't follow a films incredibly basic plot.What I find so bizarre about this film is how well designed and directed the actual escape room scenes are compared to the rest of the film. It's feels almost as if they were made by a completely different director and film crew as Opposed to the scenes outside of the games. These scenes really struggle to build tension however they still remain fairly enjoyable and allow the characters to actually show some care for one another like I mentioned earlier which differs from tradition with films like these. Overall this made the film far more refreshing and watchable than films such as the Saw sequels.The film may be full of plot holes, poorly written dialogue and crammed full of incredibly poor acting but it still has some sense of style which it deserves praise for.I'd rate this film a 5.5 however as you have to rate films on here as a full number, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and round it up to a 6/10.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

And then somehow all the champions get into exactly the same train, which even weirder for ben and zoey as they were just chasing the junkie.The movie starting pretty boring. The middle part of the movie is for me was the best part of the whole movie. After the games end, its declined. That is it. Only the games is worth watching. The other things is just dumb thing happening.One last thing, the female lead (zoey) acting is so freaking bad, i swear to god.

The performances are mediocre. The cinematography is fine with a few scenes with very good lighting. The writing of this film really tanks it. The dialogue is horrendous, the characters are unlikeable and i wanted all of them to do die. The story becomes more and more nonsensical, formulaic and tiring as the film went on. I liked one of the rooms, the rest were either forgettable or downright boring. The film tries way too gard to give tension to the audience without really knowing how to properly.

But the movie is plain and just basically the same as the first one.I know, right? What did I expect from a part two of a movie about a escape room?But anyways, they tried to pull this Sonya story as something mysteryous that was actually later revealed in seconds and it wasn't so great or intelligent or whatever, not gonna lie. Didn't like how they used the ""If you didn't see it, it never happened"" line to basically explain everything. Yeah, the rooms were cool, very entertaining, but that's really about it.There are some very questionable things like, we know how the two characters from the first part got into that train, but, the others were just there? Also, why on earth would they have to collect the acid that was raining to melt the padlock when it was raining ON it too? Wouldn't it have melted already? And by the way, what's the point of getting someone like Rachel, who doesn't feel physical pain in that kind of game if it's only going to be ""curious"" for the people betting? And did they all have to face a guy trying to kill them at the end of their games? I mean, they mention that but never really give an answer.I don't know, I really hope there's no part three because they messed enough with a second one and that ending was extremely forced.So yeah, a 6 mainly for the cast and because it's entertaining.

I honestly don't get why this movie wasn't rated higher because each moment led to a nail-biting, intense feeling of whether they were gonna survive and how exactly they escape each room. The plot twist of who returns, was a major surprise because I thought they were honestly dead after watching their end scene in the first movie.

251,hassanm-30449,"Started off promising, but ending was disappointing",6,17 July 2021,"This sequel started off with the main character wanting to expose the people who set up the escape rooms and destroy them. She ends up at the location she believes is where the gamemasters are, and I this point I wondered, if you find them how exactly are you going to kill them? You don't have a weapon nor any military or combat training? Just ridiculous.The protagonist then founds out the people in charge want her to design new rooms in order to survive. But she declines and somehow escapes only later to find out she's in another escape room. She's meant to be very intelligent, surely it'd make more sense to agree to design the game rooms then find out more about the people in charge.Also, towards the end after the main 2 characters escape, its revealed that the police have found the dead bodies and apologise to the main 2 characters for not believing them before letting them go and board a plane. So you're telling me that these two have escaped 2 deadly escape rooms where many have died and the police are going to let them go without any protection!!??Throughout the movie we don't learn anything about the characters, aside from being previous winners, there is nothing that draws us to the characters. They could have picked the gameplayers randomly from the street and the audience would not have felt any different towards them.Finally, why would they end the sequel in the same manner as the first, in a plane!!???Overall I liked the rooms, but found the story very ridiculous and not very believable.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

For example will Claire continue with the rooms and become worse than her father when it comes to designing rooms and how they die or is their other behind the project we just haven't seen yet. Maybe Claire is stuck in rooms with zoey and Ben.Either way many have said the movie was horrible but haven't really seen the bigger picture of where these movie are actually heading.With that being said it's fun playing along with the movie and trying to solve the rooms before they can.Hope you all enjoy the movie with open minds.,Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Come along Escape Room 2. In writing this movie you simply had to put the main characters in some more rooms and move the story forward. They even had the plane ""room"" setup from the last film.. So what's the problem? After arriving at the location to find the Escape Rooms our 2 main characters are tricked into running several blocks across New York, down until the subway and onto a train car. When they get onto this train car they learn it's full of several other ""champions"" from previous games. Let's backup and look at them events. The 2 main characters had to arrive at building X at X o'clock. Then be tricked into running after a guy and pass countless New Yorkers, jumping over the subway gate without a ticket and not getting stopped / challenging and then ending up on this train cart. At the SAME time we've had to get all over 4 ""Champions"" onto the SAME train cart at the SAME time (they were not kidnapped or anything)... without any other passengers attempting to enter this SAME cart?? How on earth is that possible! At first I thought the ""champions"" the other champions must be planted there.. but nope.. they're meant to be real.. This is never covered in the movie we're just expected to accept that they all ended up there at the same time. Let's skip to the end. So all these games have taken place under New York. We know they got a train cart somewhere under the city but it cannot of travelled more then a few miles. So how on earth does the last room end up in the puzzle makers house!!! Why on earth would you do that and how is that physically possible? They clearly live in a large house in the middle of nowhere.. not central new york.

The rooms weren't as inspired as in the previous movie nor were connected to the characters' past traumas. All that happened inside the rooms was a bit random, honestly.The worst part was the ending. It felt rushed and all over the place. Like... What's supposed to happen after the final scene!??

Then on top of that Amanda shows up at the end of the movie so to me I feel like all the characters from the first movie is still alive, why I think that I am about to tell you. So when Danny dies first he goes under water with bens lighter ironically and they all escape then next up Amanda falls to her death they move to the next room and mike gives his life up for Ben Jason and zoey, zoey fakes her death and Ben and Jason fights for the antidote to move to the next room Ben has to solve the ending room which he didn't because zoey helped him by stopping it but when Ben reach the end he somehow gets his yellow lighter back what tripped me out about the first and this one is Ben and zoey manage to still come out and everybody else dies when the tv showed that four bodies was discovered they didn't do that for the first movie so I really feel like Danny mike and Jason is still alive and now Ben and zoey have to find them oh and another thing where did Amanda go at the end when she helped zoey rescue Ben.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

Characters backstories not well explored so was hard to have a bond with them before they died, one of the ""champions"" died before we even knew his name!. Return of Amanda was a good twist, but the justification behind it...bit ridiculous. People who beat the game before are then supposed to create the new game...except Amanda didnt...she lost first time round. Bens constant ""trust Zoey, she saved my life"" was his standard response to every situation. How they got everyone they needed to in that one subway car at the beginning was a bit hard to believe. The inevitable set up for another movie at the end was no big surprise, but with the outing of Minos...how will they move the story along.

-Brianna(the influencer) seems like having a reasonable meltdown after facing what is this all about. Just a couple of minutes later she is straight up confident about beating the system. Like what? Nice switch. Get them girl i guess.-We already lost our first guy, thank god the drunk priest gave him a little peaceful ceremony in the middle of chaos. Just like reality really.Room number 2(bank):
-Lovely reaction time from Rachel when she stepped on the table, most people would die there, but she has superhuman abilities to instant freeze while rushing somewhere.-This room is just so weird they barely know each other, they work like a team, they find everything really fast, while they had 10 minutes(that's nothing). But i guess we have to accept that they're this good despite having some really crazy ideas too.Room number 3(beach):
-The famous walking backwards without looking around cost us another person, Nathan the priest. There are more things to mention but this would be too long.Room number 4(acid rain):
-That is the smallest umbrella i've ever seen. The one that Zoey held in the huge rain. I don't think it should be able to protect her.-Someone else mentioned it already but it's true, the chain didn't melt when the acid rained somehow, very weird.5. The ending: I might just forgot something, but who the hell is the dude that is helping Zoey and Claire (the locked up girl)? Why is he helping them? What is his part in this anyway? What is Claire's real problem? Where it came from? Why didn't she felt loved in the past? I just have so many questions. I guess we just have to figure out everything ourselves.Such a disappointing movie after the first one, it had way more potentials than this.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

It was entertaining, interesting and I didn't feel the time at all.For sure this movie isn't perfect at all, it's very easy to find lots if flaws in it. But for me it did perfectly what it intended to do which is entertaining the audience. Honestly cinemas are lacking nowadays of the movies like this...modern horrors are boring, sci-fi repeating themselves and not surprising anymore so this kind of movie is really great with its unique idea and a great action part. Especially for those who like me miss Saw and Final Destination movies.Definitely recommend it!

..
.So, near the end, Claire (the trapped girl designing the rooms):
pressed ""0"" as the last number on the sequence; zero wasn't even on the options on the tv screen shown.the ""keypad"" where she typed the numbers was INSIDE THE CELL. Afterwards, when she murders her dad, se does it by pressing the numberns on the out side!Now, you could say that there was another one on the outside, but, her dad wouldn't be locked anymore anyway, he *knew the password* and could have tipped it to get out while they were in his study/office.Besides that, she says that there was some sort of mechanism bellow the sand to save the players. Where's the priest?! Or was the mechanism only bellow the lighthouse and Ben fell there by a crazy chance?Moving on...
The movie was too fast paced, this type of film needs to show you a problem that you, the viwer, has a chance to solve, or at least try. The puzzles are thrown at you so fast that you cant even have the slightest imersion before they move on to the next room. Its just people screaming and solving puzzles in seconds; with another flaw beeing the fact that the solutions were almost always easily available to them, as if they were dumb.Talking about dumb, is that what they think the viwers are? One clear example is when Rachel says she doesn't feel pain. It was clear that either the acting was toooooo bad or something was going on, she took way too long to notice her hand was burning, the flashback was incredibly unnecessary.Other thing, there's no, and I repeat, NO HISTORY BEHIND THE OTHER CHARACTERS. You know nothing about the dad (henry), sonya, claire, brianna, rachel, theo and nathan, honestly I just know their names 'cause I googled it. There should have been at least a little bit of background on them.The first one was amazing, with the tension buiding up in the first scene while they slowly notice that its a life-and-death situation and gradually solve the problems; in this one they had no time whatsoever and some parts were way too unfair, like when only one person got in the cab, I mean, excuse me?! Someone NEEDED to be at the booth in order to open the cab, so... just kill them, whatever, why giving people any chance, right? And, if you don't care about the other characters' chance, 'cause well, only Zoey mattered to Claire, right? Yeah, could be, but here's the catch, she's the cleaver one, what if she solved the rings problem and went to the booth to do it? Would she be left to die while years of claire's plans go down the drain? What if she drowned in sand in Rachel's place and no one tryed to save her successfully, that would have been a drag right? Oh, poor claire, just deal with it, it's not like you've been planning this thoroughly for years, right?I hope the next one is more down to earth, not just a desperate way to try to make money.There's no need for big props and sfx, they should focus on the script, characters, ambiance and pace better.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
299,emilycarteruk,Decent enough but slightly predictable,6,16 July 2021,It's not better than the first one but it's decent enough for a sequel. The rooms are exciting and original but the storyline is predictable and lacks something new.,Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
300,massimosamdal-76840,Awesome,5,17 July 2021,Honestly I really enjoyed this. I for sure would like to see a third movie in the works.

302,guahansoldier,It's an ok movie if you don't really care about character development,4,20 July 2021,"This movie is not great when it comes to story telling. Forced narrative, making audiences build a bond with the characters in a short time. After you start to understand the characters, they kill them off anyways. Giving you false hope in actually developing a concrete storyline for us to follow. You start to not want to invest the time or effort in any of the characters due to the lack of good writing and thought out plots to further their narrative. Honestly, it's an ok thriller movie for a kid that doesn't really care. Happy watching!",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

309,terelindarosa,Everything WRONG with this movie,1,4 August 2021,"~~~~~~~WARNING SPOILERS~~~~~~~~In comparance to the first movie, this is a whole waste of time just to steal money from the fans.1. We make no progress whatsoever in the story. The first one ends with them planning to get on a plane, the second one ends with them finally boarding the plane.2. We receive new characters with no context at all. The whole movie is about a whole new escape rooms with survivors from previous escape rooms and we don't know their story at all and they kill them off almost instantly.3. The New Characters.The first movie surrounds characters that were the only survivors of events where everyone died. So the game works as a ""no one will care about them"" ""we can fake their deaths easily"" situation. It's like finishing the job. Plus! Each of the escape rooms is based on their trauma.With our new characters we get an Influencer, a priest, a girl with a weird decease and a nobody (because they kill him off without even telling us his name). And they kill them all off in what feels like 15 minutes.4. The Escape Rooms.In the ending they try to explain the stupidity of all the rooms with the simple explanation of ""it was on purpose"". Each room was very easy to solve specially because they were LITERALLY giving them all the answers to every room on their faces.So if this was on purpose, this alone is enough to tell us this was all a waste of time.5. The Logic.A. The Electric Train
The towel could protect them. They never used it.Zoey used her phone (electronic) to record; she should've died by just taking it out.There's a moment when a character tosses keys to another character and they get electrocuted yet just by giving the keys, they're safe.... I'm pretty sure it's still the same situation, isn't it?B. The Lighthouse.If Zoey found an entrance for the employes.... why did the ladder start disappearing?C. Amanda
In the first movie there's a news report about her dead body somewhere else.This movie makes no justice to the first one.The acting wasn't even believable in comparance and all the twists were predictable.Personally I loved the first one and was excited to see the sequel and it let me down completely. Maybe the third will be good.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

316,garlandmnina,2 different Movies,9,11 September 2021,I saw the movie when it first came out. The 1st version I saw started off with Zoey in therapy. The therapist was showing her clues. But at the time Zoey did not know there were clues. The movie also had a scene towards the end where Ben was in a room that was filling up with water and he almost drowned. The ending was Ben and Zoe finally got on a plane and the plane ended up being the start of a game which would have been the next escape room 3.

320,sleepparalysisdemon,Poorly paced while taking itself too seriously,5,23 September 2021,"I like the concept, same with the Saw concept. I like people using their wits to escape death traps, but in this movie the puzzles feel silly and the way they connect the puzzles at the end in such a boring way. The characters have no development and it's hard to care about them, and I get easily attached to characters.The pacing is the worst part about this, however. The puzzles are super fast paced and leave the viewer no room to think about subtleties, and the ending feels so rushed, where they quickly speed through everything like they have a checklist of things they have to wrap up.They also explain that Ben survived through the sand, but Nate is never mentioned again. All the character deaths also feel so half-assed. They die for such stupid reasons.The room traps were pretty cool, though. I've always like the concepts of the rooms the most. Zoey's actress steals the spotlight, playing her role too well to be in this movie.Overall, it could be a fun movie but the director took it too seriously.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions

more action packed than the first one imoamazing sfxbad :
felt rushed, could have spent more time for the main characters to get to know each otherthe acting seemed unrealistic to how a normal person would usually react in a situation like thatideas and concepts were creative and nice, but played out badlypuzzles seemed way easier than the first partsummary :
basically more of the same, but couldn't keep the hype.the quick pace makes the puzzles less enjoyable.i don't like the acting in this sequel whatsoever.Recommend :

I also liked how the cast was full of new kids on the block when it comes to acting! The film gave me everything I expected it to give me! This is definitely a film you need to watch in theaters. It won't give you the same feel and effect at home. Go to the theaters!! I would love to watch it again if I could!

330,adelkadechert,"Could've been way better, because the potential was there",6,28 August 2021,"I had high expectations for this movie, because I liked the first one so much, but... I'm kinda disappointed.1. My ""smallest"" problem is with the creativity, more specifically the rooms:
The whole thing was poorly written, the rooms weren't as interesting and complex as in the last movie.2. A bit bigger problem was the characters: in the first movie, it was extremely exciting to see the rooms connecting to each character's backstory in some way, we slowly figured everything out and we could actually root for them in the rooms.In this one, we barely knew them, except for Ben and Zoey, so I, personally could never experience this ""Oh no, he/she dies, what a pity"" feeling - and I wish I could've.3. WHERE IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE MOVIE??That's my biggest problem of all. This movie should've been about Zoey and Ben finding a solution, realizing what's this all about and escaping finally. Instead of this, we basically got the exact same ending that we did in the last movie. It ends on a plane with a robot-sound saying ""it's not over until we say it is"" or something like that. Why did we need escape rooms again anyway? Or if the creators really can't let those go, why the hell did we have to spend to much time in them? They were definitely not that interesting, so I couldn't say it was worth it.It was almost the same as the last one with less creative rooms and way less interesting characters.I still gave it a 6 tho, cause despite its many faults, I couldn't say I didn't enjoy it.I'm truly intrigued what the third movie will bring us.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
331,keelanboycewyr,Fun for 30 minutes,1,26 September 2021,"Overall the movie was a waste of time the acting was sub par and the story felt meaningless with characters with no motivation other than ""lets end the games, just to never actually advance towards that goal, the main lady zoey who seemingly was more of a side character put there to scream every 3 seconds felt 1 dimensional at best.I know IMDB already lists this as a goof but the padlock on the phonebooth a moron with 1 braincell could see how obviously poorly thought out that part of the movie was ITS LITERALLY BEING RAINED ON BUT YEAH SURE A KETCHUP BOTTLE WILL HELP!.Zoey's reaction to bens deathwas priceless amounted to a gasp and her just saying his name bland as cardboard, the other actors felt pointless for instance the moment in the bank when the woman seemingly has a reaction to the safety deposit box but is never fleshed out as to why and we move on.If you want something that feels fast pace with some popcorn check this out but its nothing to write home about.",Escape Room - Tournament of Champions
