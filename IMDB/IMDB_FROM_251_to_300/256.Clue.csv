0,MartinHafer,It's a movie based on a board game....so are you expecting Ingmar Bergman?!,5,10 August 2010,"Considering that this movie is based on a board game, it's best not to expect an Oscar-winning film. This is NOT a negative statement as the film makes no pretense. Yet, oddly, the featured review currently appearing on IMDb gives this film a 10! Now I am happy that they liked the film...but it's a freakin' board game! Have some perspective, folks.The movie is not the least bit subtle...and it's pretty clear it's not meant to be. The humor is often very, very broad and the characterizations are the same. It's best that you know this going into the film. In many ways, it really reminded me of the wacky ""Murder By Death""--though I think I liked ""Murder By Death"" a bit more--mostly because it made me laugh. ""Clue"" only made me smirk...a bit.I could try to explain the film, but there are already quite a few reviews that do this. The story IS Clue---with the same characters (with new back stories) and a murder. Nothing more, nothing less. Provided you just want a nice time-passer and don't expect more, you'll enjoy it.",Clue
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of my absolute favourites!,10,5 February 2009,"I mean, this movie is just fantastic, marginally better than Murder By death, which I didn't understand at the end, though that is a good film. With the costumes, the actors and a gem of a script, what could possibly go wrong? The script was hilarious. Every line was enough to make you fall off the chair. The Kingdom of Heaven bit was sidesplittingly funny, because it was just so random. True, it is nothing like the Board Game, but the way they revolve it around the Board Game, was so clever. Some of it was extremely silly, but have a heart, it's a comedy, it's supposed to be. The casting was just ingenious. Eileen Brennan was just flawless, giving Mrs Peacock a much needed bit of edge. Tim Cury stole every scene he was in, and he looked , as always, as though he was having the time of his life. Madeline Kahn was just hilarious, especially with her line ""Husbands should be like Kleenex, soft, strong and disposable"" and the iconic ""Life before death is as improbable as sex after marriage"". Christopher Lloyd seemed restrained, but his dry humour made Professor Plum an unforgettable character. Michael McKean was a bit whiny, but I don't care, it's called acting, plus Mr Green is supposed to be timid. Martin Mull has great comedic timing, and brought a bit a stupidity to his role of Colonel Mustard. My favourite characterisation was that of Miss Scarlet, played by Lesley Ann Warren, looking gorgeous in that emerald green dress. (Miss Scarlet was the closest characterisation to the board Game). Colleen Camp looked lovely and I liked the jokes about her boobs, and Lee Ving (part of a joke, Leaving soon) was very good too. The three endings were so funny, very silly, but it is like the Pink panther franchise, it is all about the comedy. You would've never guessed the final solution in a million years, because the third ending had me completely by surprise, and I am not kidding. This movie is a must-see for all Tim Curry fans, like me. If you want to see more of this talented man, check out Legend, Rocky Horror(obviously) and Stephen King's It(his career-best)10/10.

2,Leofwine_draca,"A spoof full of manic, madcap energy",7,4 November 2016,"CLUE is one in a spate of 1970s/1980s comedies that mercilessly spoofed the old dark house murder mystery genre popular in the 1930s. It shares much in common with the all-star MURDER BY DEATH, for example. However, I think CLUE has the edge when it comes to entertainment, as this film's always been a favourite of mine ever since I was a kid. It has a manic, madcap energy going on that makes it an often delight to watch.Much of the humour and quirkiness comes from the presence of Tim Curry playing the butler in the story. Curry takes centre stage in the story and runs away with part, reminding me of Lee Evans with his sweaty, running-about-a-lot performance. It's my personal favourite performance of his, and it takes some beating. Thankfully, an ensemble cast of seasoned professionals don't disappoint either. Michael McKean is the stand-offish Mr. Green, Martin Mull the blustering Colonel Mustard, and Eileen Brennan the eccentric Mrs. Peacock. Colleen Camp has an eye-poppingly voluptuous turn as the French maid but my personal favourite of the ladies is Lesley Ann Warren as femme fatale Miss Scarlet, whose dress seems to have some magical anti-gravity device.CLUE tells a fast-paced story in which the gags come thick and fast and rarely disappoint. The level of ghoulish humour is second to none and certainly superior to that seen in contemporary fare like HIGH SPIRITS or HAUNTED HONEYMOON. I also liked the way that the film has multiple shot endings which gives it an odd and unique feel. Films based on board games are few and far between and rarely successful (BATTLESHIP anyone?) but this one's the exception to that rule.",Clue
3,SnoopyStyle,3 endings useless to guess whodunnit,5,22 December 2013,"Based on the board game, a group of people are invited to Hill House where Mr Boddy is blackmailing each one of them. The butler (Tim Curry) tries to out Mr Boddy to the police, but Mr Boddy instructs them all to kill the Butler instead. Only when the lights go out, Mr Boddy is killed.As a comedy, this movie rarely hits the mark even though it has some great comedic actors. Colleen Camp shoving her boobs around is probably the only marginally funny thing in this movie. The dialog and the slapstick is more random than funny. It's all too frantic. The characters are too one dimensional.Then there is the most compelling part of this type of movie. It is to guess who the killer is. It's the bread and butter of all murder mysteries. However this movie has 3 different endings. It shows the pointlessness of guessing because it's all very random. Any incentive to guess is gone.",Clue
4,mark.waltz,Murder does cause death.,7,25 April 2016,"With butler Tim Curry greeting a series of guests coming to a secluded mansion, you know from his first scene (stepping into a pile of dog doo left by some fierce dobermans) that this is going to be a farce of the highest sort. Comparisons to Neil Simon's 1976 masterpiece ""Murder By Death"" are obvious, especially with the presence of Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Peacock, a senator's wife who has her own share of secrets. Joining her and Curry are Madeline Kahn as a very black widow, Lesley Ann Warren as a prostitute who uses sex for more than just the money she gets from it, Peter Boyle as a perverted scientist, Martin Mull as an aggressive Army colonel, and Michael McKean as a gay FBI employee. Murder takes a while to begin, but the bodies slowly pile up in this locked old dark house where gifts of the lethal weapons are passed out to allegedly knock off Curry who has the only key to let everybody out.There are three endings to this if you want to see them all, and after the second one, I was ready for it to be wrapped up. This isn't as consistently funny as ""Murder By Death"", and to be honest, I enjoyed the Gene Wilder/Gilda Radner flop comedy ""Haunted Honeymoon"" slightly more than this. Still, it has many amusing moments. ""Mrs. Peacock is a man?"" (Slap, slap....), and Curry's energetic performance running all over the house, while Kahn gets some tongue-twisting lines that proves almost 20 years after her sad early death that she remains one of the funniest women in the movies. Hiding her subtle beauty in a Chita Rivera Spider Woman wig, she delivers each line as if she was one of the dobermans devouring the bone that Curry threw at them before stepping into the unseen poop. The three men aren't as funny as the women, with Brennan going overboard delightfully as a matronly woman who is obviously a nervous wreck, and gets more and more frantic. Bit parts of the French accented maid and Asian cook are well cast, and while the film has mainly the house as its set, it is never claustrophobic. Far from a perfect comedy, this is still old fashioned fun with only a touch of modern sexual sensibilities added to give it a non ""G"" rating.",Clue
5,kosmasp,Got a clue,9,8 January 2021,"Crime movies are my thing - and this is a really good one. Great actors a story that keeps you guessing and an ending that I didn't expect ... then again that is what makes this refreshing, doesn't it? The answer obviously is yes! I was guessing from start to finish, what actually was going on ... I think you will too.The plot is quite easy to follow, though the revelation towards the end may be a bit too quick for some (I assume). But that only makes it rewatchable I reckon. I won't say too much about it and you shouldn't mind any political correctness (like a characters clothing or cleavage) if you can ... focus on the story and the characters ... and the slapstick occasionally",Clue
6,Sleepin_Dragon,A classic,10,13 August 2015,"Nothing else needs to be said, other then this is a true classic film, brilliant conceived and hilariously acted. It's fast paced, side splittingly funny and beautifully acted. It's my favourite role of Tim Curry's, he's had thus far a wonderful career, but he's extraordinarily charming and energetic, he does not stop. Tim Curry apart it's the three female characters of Peacock, Scarlet and White that make the film. Madeline Kahn is so sexy as femme fatale Mrs White, Lesley Anne Warren has the most sensational figure (although Dr who fans may agree, when we first see her she looks like a vervoid.) However it's Eileen Brennan's Mrs Peacock that I enjoy most, she delivers some hilarious lines with a slick and easy manner. How cool is it to have a film with 3 different endings, each is so good. 10/10 a classic I never tire of, i'd put it up there with Murder by Death, it's that good.",Clue
7,gavin6942,Who Knew a Board Game Could Become a Movie So Well?,7,13 April 2010,"A group of people are invited to the home of Mr. Boddy, for reasons unknown. They soon discover they have all been blackmailed, and almost immediately after the revelation, Boddy is found dead. They all had a motive: but which one of them was it? This film has an excellent cast, especially the men. Tim Curry as Wadsworth the Butler, Christopher Lloyd as the smooth womanizer Professor Plum, Michael McKean as homosexual Mr. Green and Martin Mull as Colonel Mustard. The women's roles are much less star-studded, but all played very well, indeed. Some have said that the women's roles are better-written. Perhaps.The beauty of this film is that it takes a board game about murder and makes the story both believable and incredibly humorous. Yes, kids, murder can be fun, as long as you have Tim Curry running the show. And there is a hint of a political message: ""Communism was just a red herring."" This is repeated three times -- does it have a grand significance, or is it just a joke about the word ""red""? Did the film need to be set in 1954?Following in the footsteps of such great comedic mysteries as ""The Private Eyes"", if you have not seen ""Clue"" (and cable television used to re-run the heck out of it) you should give it a shot. If nothing else, you cannot say no to Tim Curry.",Clue
8,lee_eisenberg,house of game(s),7,7 February 2006,"As the first movie ever based on a board game, ""Clue"" is pretty silly - mostly a series of gags - but it is pretty funny. Basically featuring the famous color-named detectives getting invited to a mansion and having to solve a murder, one has to wonder how they get these ideas for movies.So who's guilty? I'll let you find out. But I will say that the cast does a really good job. Tim Curry plays a satirical butler, while Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn, Lesley Ann Warren, Michael McKean, and Martin Mull play the detectives. Not the funniest movie ever made, but a comedy classic nonetheless.",Clue
9,jboothmillard,Clue,3,20 December 2010,"Based on the popular murder/mystery themed deduction board game, which we the British know as Cluedo, and made with the help of writer John Landis (An American Werewolf in London) and director Jonathan Lynn (The Whole Nine Yards), this film saved me playing it. Basically, set in 1954, six guests have been invited by an anonymous person to the secluded New England mansion Hill House for a party with no explanation, and possibly some connection to each other. Serving in the house is butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry), who also knows nothing, and the guests include scandalous Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), psychiatrist Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Senator's wife Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), illegal brothel owner Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), Pentagon worker Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), and ex-State Department worker and homosexual Mr. Green (Michael McKean). After dinner, that is when Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) reveals himself to be the one who invited them all, and he also tells them that he has been blackmailing all of them because they all have secrets they don't want spreading. He offers them all the chance to silence by giving them a variety of weapons to kill him with, these being a candlestick, a rope, a lead pipe, a wrench (or spanner), a dagger and a revolver (pistol/gun). When the lights suddenly go off we hear a shot and some clanging, and Mr. Boddy is lying supposedly dead on the floor, and there is no way of telling which of the guests did it, all are denying it. To determine the guilty person they explore the house to find clues or maybe find someone hiding, and along the way, Mrs. Ho the Cook (Kellye Nakahara), maid Yvette (Colleen Camp), a stranded Motorist (Jeffrey Kramer), a Cop (Bill Henderson) and a Singing Telegram Girl (Jane Wiedlin) are victims too. Finding hidden passage ways going to the lounge, the library, the kitchen, the dining room and hall, Wadsworth thinks he has cracked the identity of the murderer, and frantically runs all the facts from beginning to end. This is the point when three different endings are played, the third apparently being the real one, but in certain places there would only be one of these endings played. Ending one sees Miss Scarlet as the culprit and Wadsworth working for the FBI,and ending two sees Mrs. Peacock as the culprit and Wadsworth again with the FBI. The third ending sees everyone committed one murder, Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy, Mrs. Peacock killed the cook, Colonel Mustard killed the motorist, Miss Scarlet killed the cop, Mrs. White killed Yvette, and Wadsworth shot the singing telegram girl, Mr. Green is FBI agent and shoots Wadsworth. The script is most of the time is too overcomplicated to keep track of, it is after all using all the clichés from Agatha Christie mysteries, and is isn't all that funny as a period comedy, overall, a pretty terrible crime spoof. Cluedo the board game was number 15 on 100 Greatest Toys. Adequate!",Clue

The popular board game's roles must uncover a night of murder at a creepy mansion . It is in fact an amusing imitation of Crime Story including enjoyable and sympathetic performances by the entire cast . Well-known actors at large in a sinister Victorian mansion , then appears amusement and entertainment , as all of them running around and taking place murders , who's the killer? . This popular charade deals with a fistful of famed stars (Lesley Ann Warren , Christopher Lloyd , Michael Mckean , Madeline Kahn , Martin Mull , Eileen Brennan) incarnating suspect criminals , as six guests are invited and must cooperate with the staff to solve a murder mystery . The film takes place in ""New England,"" 1954 as revealed in the opening scenes , as various characters are invited to a spooky mansion full of secret passages and spinning rooms , there they are received by an eccentric butler (amusingly played by Tim Curry who had previously starred in another comedy set in a gigantic mansion, that was The Rocky Horror Picture Show ,1975) and the buxom French maid Yvette (Colleen Camp though Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demi Moore and Madonna were considered for the role) . This is a very entertaining movie full of frolics , killings , antics , capers and suspects . As the popular characters must unravel a night of murder at an eerie country house . This film featured three endings, five bodies, six weapons and seven suspects . This is featured in one of the tag-lines for the film but as there are six murders, one for each weapon, there are actually six bodies not five. This is a fun rendition of a famous board game called Cluedo , known in the USA as Clue , in fact , the color of each character's car is the same color as their playing piece in the game . It results to be an entertaining and bemusing spoof of Agatha Christie novels , though it is in fact a pale imitation of the earlier , much better and more satisfying sleuthing spoof ¨Murder by death¨ by Robert Moore with Alec Guinness , Truman Capote , Elsa Lanchester , David Niven , Nancy Walker , James Cromwell and Eileen Brennan too ; as this movie was followed by hammy spoof ¨Clue¨(1985) an inferior but enjoyable imitation of the previous parody . It is an entertaining and fun comedy of murders in which the laughs pile up before your eyes , director has got success in keeping the bizarre and grotesque appearances of the actors in hyperactive movement , shouting and frantic running around , principally from Tim Curry . Despite the ridiculous and unnecessary camera movements , Jonathan Lynn manages to maintain a coherent and compelling plot plenty of twists and turns . The screenplay is funny and high quality in which it's not difficult to work out on which murder-solvers each of them is modeled ; furthermore , stand up Tim Curry as a botcher as well as hyperactive butler and a suitably eccentric Lesley Ann Warren , of course , Christopher Lloyd is appealing too . The entire cast seems to be subsisting on sugar with wild eyes and frenetic movements the order of the day . You'll enjoy enormously the impersonations of the strange characters . The film was one of a number of pictures, mostly comedies, made and released between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s, that revived the old dark house mansion movie . Three endings were shot, and a different one shown at each theater . All three are included on video . The DVD, however, aside from all three endings, also offers the option to play the movie with one randomly selected ending. In some cities, the newspaper print ads indicated which version was being shown at each theater . Lively and fun musical score by John Morris . Evocative and colorful cinematography by Victor J. Kemper . This whodunit mystery picture was uneven but professionally directed by Jonathan Lynn . Lynn is an expert on comedies as he has demonstrated in My cousin Vinny , The Distinguished Gentleman , Greedy , Nuns on the run , The Whole Nine Yards , among others . Lynn has also enjoyed notable success on the British stage and television with series as Yes Prime Minister , My Brother's Keeper , Doctor on the go , and Doctor at sea .

11,moonspinner55,"Campy black humor with slapstick, but a pall of desperation hangs over it",3,12 April 2017,"In 1950s New England, six total strangers are invited for dinner at a grand manor using pseudonyms to hide their identities (Mr. Green, Mrs. White, et al.). As it turns out, they're all being blackmailed by the same man, the seventh guest, who quickly ends up dead. Jonathan Lynn directed this adaptation of the Parker Bros. crime-solving board game from his own screenplay, from a story he originated with John Landis, who also co-produced (and whose style is prevalent throughout). The performances are assured and polished without ever being truly funny, and only a few of the set-pieces (such as an unraveling chandelier) have any visual energy. The film--released theatrically with three different endings--did a quick fade in 1985, but has since garnered a loyal fan-base. It isn't really very good--and reminds one of 1976's ""Murder by Death"" besides, beginning with the shots of cars arriving up the hill accompanied by John Morris' derivative score. *1/2 from ****",Clue

13,Coventry,A brand new personal favorite of mine!,9,23 February 2010,"I have no real excuse for not ever having seen ""Clue"" before. It wasn't intentional, it wasn't because of personal grudges; the opportunity simply never presented itself any sooner! Well, that's certainly something I regret now, damned! If I had discovered this film ten years ago, for example, it would have been a personal favorite ten years ago already and I would undoubtedly have re-watched it numerous times and introduced it to many friends by now. Oh well, it's never too late for that. ""Clue"" is fantastic entertainment, with an ultimately ingenious basic premise (the first film ever to be based on a board game), copious amounts of hilarious dialogs & one-liners, stellar performances from ideally cast actors and actresses and a uniquely structured narrative with no less than three different endings. Who doesn't know the game of Cluedo (Clue in America)? In case you grew up in an era where portable video games and similar rubbish hadn't been invented yet, chances are high that you played this game at one point during your childhood and/or adolescence. I know for a fact that it saved me from numerous otherwise boring afternoons with distant relatives and the offspring of my parents' friends. The set-up of the game is utterly simple: who committed the murder, in what room of the house and by using which murder weapon? There are multiple potential murderers, each hiding behind a suspicious facade and a color pseudonym, a large house full of rooms and secret passageways and a wide variety of murderers. Naturally there has to be a bit more background and introduction in a long-feature movie, but writers Jonathan Lynn (in his debut) and all-around genius John Landis (""American Werewolf in London"") came up with a pretty tight and clever wraparound story. Six mystery guests, all living and/or working in Washington D.C, are lured to the secluded Hill House for a night of humiliating revelations and unexpected confrontations. They're all being blackmailed by one and the same person, but when that person is lying dead on the library floor after a moment of lights-out, they suddenly all become murder suspects. Together with the peculiar house personnel, like the hyperactive butler Wadsworth and the voluptuous French maid Yvette, they try to unmask the culprit (but mostly clear their own names) before the police arrives. Instead of finding the killer, more bodies start to pile up ""Clue"" is a genuinely hilarious comedy AND a truly compelling murder- mystery at the same time. How seldom do run into one of those? The film is funny without having to revert to vulgarity or black humor. The script is funny in an old-fashioned way, through cunning one-liners and subtle little details in the set-pieces. The film is also dazzlingly fast-paced and literally chock-full of obvious tributes to classic horror films (like ""House on Haunted Hill""), classic whodunit (Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"") and classic fellow parodies (""Murder by Death""). All cast members give away tremendous performances and it's simply impossible to pick out any favorites. Tim Curry is sublime as the eloquent butler, Madeline Kahn is stupendous as the frigid widow, etc, etc. This is definitely a brand new personal favorite of mine, and I hope to recommend it to many more fans of original and creative cult cinema.",Clue
14,hitchcockthelegend,Cluedo Chaos.,7,20 September 2019,"Clue is directed by Jonathan Lynn and he co-writes with John Landis and Anthony E. Pratt. It stars Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren, Colleen Camp and Lee Ving. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper.Based on the board game Cluedo, plot finds six guests anonymously invited to a large mansion for dinner. All of them have something in common and when their host is killed, they must work with the household staff to identify the murderer because the bodies are starting to pile up.A sort of madcap ""And Then There Were None"", Clue has ebullience in spades and a cast revelling in the nutty play. The mystery element is actually secondary to the interactions of this splendid array of characters, where physical and vocal humour is the twin driving force. The shifts between pure mania and deadpannery ensure the pace, even during close quarter chattings in the group, never sags.It's on the surface silly but taking a closer look it's rejoicing in its own humility, the class distinctions shredded for comedic worth. It's definitely a mood piece, I mean you have to be in a good move to go with its flow. For to be down and blue it's more likely to irritate than to cheer one up. The makers are on form, in front of and behind the camera, while Morris' musical score is proper perky.A flop on release, and mauled in serious critic circles, Clue has garnered a cult fanbase over the decades. So much so it sits with a healthy rating on the main movie data base. It's hard to recommend with great confidence, for it is an acquired taste.

The six are each greeted by a butler named Wdasworth (Tim Curry) & show to the study to relax before dinner. During dinner the six guest's question each other to try & discover the reasons behind the mysterious invitations, then Wadsworth reveals that they all have something in common. All six of them are being blackmailed by a seventh guest Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), soon after Mr. Boddy is found murdered as someone wants to keep their indiscretion secret. Then more people turn up at the house & more people begin to get murdered, the only questions left is who did it & why?Written & directed by Jonathan Lynn & based on the popular board game Cluedo (the first time a film was based on a board game in fact) this is an extremely likable & often quite funny murder mystery that also boasts three separate endings, I must admit to not having this much fun watching a film in quite some time actually. I love a good murder mystery, I love eccentric character's, clever red herrings that keep you guessing, inventive murders & clever twist endings which I felt Clue had in abundance. The cast of offbeat character's & funny one-liners really help give the film personality & helps you follow who is who very easily, while there is a definite comedic style it never seems to degenerate into dumb slapstick (OK, maybe the bit at the top of the stairs when four people run into each other & end up on the floor but it doesn't happen often) & surprisingly the comedy & one-liners actually work & are actually fairly amusing. The murder mystery plot is good & obviously uses the character's, the setting & in particular the murder weapons from the board game & I really liked the triple barrelled ending as various scenarios of what could have happened are given by a zany hyperactive Tim Curry. A really energetic, funny & fairly clever murder mystery with great atmosphere too, a definite favourite & surprisingly overlooked little gem. What else can I say? I liked it, a lot.Besides the three endings shown in the finished film (although at the time of Clue's cinematic release only one ending was shown with the three being alternated between theatres) a fourth one was also shot but has never seen the light of day & which Wadsworth was the killer. The production design is excellent & really evokes a big stately home atmosphere full of dark corners & secret passages, it just looks great. The music is also well chosen & used.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this had a fair bit spent on it & it shows with great looking 50's period production design. The acting is good from a solid cast, Tim Curry is great, Christopher Lloyd pops up as a womanising doctor Go-Go's guitarist Jane Wieldin has a cameo as the singing telegram.Clue is a great murder mystery with a large dose of humour thrown in, it all works really well & I think it's a great film.

Maybe there's a reason. Then again, this could have been everything that Murder By Death is, a hilarious spoof of detective mysteries. There are a number of reasons why it isn't. The script is paperthin(you find yourself wondering what people are doing, and why), and you are given absolutely no reason to care about anyone or anything, so, well, you don't. These great talents are assembled and made to ham it up and offer no substance to their cardboard cutout characters. They have nothing to work with. This has them running around, yelling, falling over each other, being in hysterics, doing weird stuff to get cheap laughs. Oh, and one of them is fat. Another is gay. A third(the hot French maid, a great-looking Colleen Camp) shows cleavage(I appreciate it... it didn't make me laugh). That's the level of most of the humor. This is one of those intolerable ones where they think that just because they say, are or do something that you wouldn't, it's automatically hilarious. No effort put into the delivery of the material(by the writers; again, these are skillful comedians... actually, looking at what else Lynn has directed, it's clear, what with Greed and to an extent Sgt. Bilko, that he can render funny people irritating... all The Whole Nine Yards tells me is that Perry is lame, and I knew that). It tries *way* too hard with the humor, much of the time. This has silliness, goofiness, slapstick, wordplay(some of it dumb), cleverness and tired gags. It seldom made me laugh. Among the best parts were the satirical, commenting jokes. This is excessively confusing(again, MBD wasn't). Half a dozen strangers meet at a house one evening for dinner. As it turns out, they're all being blackmailed. And the man behind it is their host. Suddenly, he is dead... moments after they've all been handed a weapon each. All have motive, as well. The dialog is fast. This has twists, obviously. They almost hold up. I mean, they don't make logical sense, if that's what you're hoping for. They could have happened, sort of. There is a little disturbing content, sexual suggestion and mild to moderate language in this. The DVD comes with all three endings(with only one, it seems like this would be only 70 minutes, not 90), and it can either play a random one or all three; it also comes with a trailer. I recommend this to those that find what I describe to sound appealing. 6/10",Clue

It combines movies like ""Ten Little Indians"" (1965) and ""The Beast Must Die"" (1974) with the goofiness of ""The Private Eyes"" (1980).I was skeptical at how Lynn & the cast could pull off the challenge of making such a confined story entertaining, but I have to admit that I busted out laughing several times (e.g. the scenes of making out with corpses). And the cast is a pleasure to behold with Colleen Camp a highlight as the stereotypical (hot) French maid. The climax with its several murder scenarios is kinda tedious, however.

23,The_Void,Lovely little murder mystery comedy!,8,30 January 2006,"Films based on videogames are commonplace nowadays, but one thing I've never seen before is a film based on a board game! Clue is a murder mystery that takes its ideas from the popular game of Cluedo. I cant say I'm a fan of that board game (although I sometimes play it on the quiz machine in pub), but I am a fan of murder mystery - and while this film is more of a joke than anything, it generally plays it's cards right and what we have here is a very entertaining little flick, that really does deserve your time! The film shows it's experimental edge by having three endings (which can be played at random on the DVD), and throughout we are treated to a film that has it's audience in mind. Tim Curry is the big name on the cast list, and he plays butler Wadsworth. He's in charge of a house whose master has invited six guests to his home. Naturally, those guests are given the names of the people in Cluedo, and include the likes of Colonel Mustard, Mrs White and Miss Scarlet etc. We are then treated to a night of mystery, as we try to uncover who murdered the host...and why! One criticism I could easily make of this film is that it doesn't really have a lot of plot. The mystery is very shallow, and is over very quickly. This is only a shame because of the fact that I would have liked to see this go on for longer, however, as the energy that the cast brings to the table is priceless, and really makes for a good time viewing. Tim Curry takes the lead role, and does what he does best. Curry is famous for campy performances in camp films like this, and his role as Wadsworth really does his reputation proud! The film does a very good job of keeping itself wide open, and by the end it really could have been any of the characters behind the murder. This is good because it allows writer-director Jonathon Lynn complete freedom over who committed the murder; but it harms the film, as the audience doesn't really get enough info to have a stab at it themselves. The style of the film suits the mood very well, with old-fashioned clothes and decor giving it that classic mystery feel. Now don't get me wrong; this isn't exactly a great film, but it's a lot of fun and I can't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it.",Clue
24,SimonJack,Mediocre comedy based on the familiar board game,5,2 June 2017,"""Clue,"" the movie is based on the board game of the same name, originally produced in 1950. The characters and settings follow the game with the addition of the staff. But it seems to me that the Paramount folks were trying to follow the plot design from a decade earlier film. Neil Simon's ""Murder by Death,"" was a 1976 blockbuster hit. Not so, this film. The acting is OK by most of the cast in ""Clue."" Tim Curry carries the bulk of the humor with his frantic running around. But the screenplay is almost devoid of witty and hilarious lines. It has none of the snappy or wacky dialog that characterizes the 1976 film. Even people today who may not have read or known of the great characters parodied in ""Murder by Death"" would find many laughs in that film. Simon's many plays on words and phrases – ""Lionel Twain,"" ""Two, two Twain,"" and similar lines are sure to get laughs yet today. Unfortunately, ""Clue"" doesn't have such a witty script. The movie failed to recover its budget when it came out, and in spite of something of a cult following that developed later, it's still just a fair comedy-mystery. Even with its gimmickry of three different endings in theaters, ""Clue"" couldn't rise above a mediocre film.",Clue

As said before it is a slow film which won't be liked by people who are not aware of the famous broad game.Performances by all the actors are commendable: Tim Curry is impressive as the butler, who takes a summer salt in the end.

But it's all good, I really loved the movie, my sister lent it to me and I have heard good things about it, so I figured that I should give it a shot. This was not only a cast to be remembered but the story was so much fun as well. I have seen every sit com that has just had fun with murder mystery stories, but Clue is on a pedestal of it's own. The cast looked like they enjoyed each other's company and made the story work.Basically a group of people have been brought together by a butler, they have no idea of what they have in common, that is until they meet their host, Mr. Boody, who happens to be blackmailing them for different situations which could be leaked out to the press and ruin their lives. But when Mr. Boody is mysteriously murdered, soon among others who come to the house are murdered as well, one by one the group tries to find out who the true killer really is.I loved the references here and there, it was very cliché, but it worked so well for the movie.

The host later reveals they are all being blackmailed and wanted to get everybody together to confront the perpetrator, the alleged Mr. Boddy, who later is murdered by one of the guests. What follows is an exciting and intriguing series of events of finger-pointing, revealing secrets, and motives - all leading to the thrilling investigation of the entire house for clues and Butler Wadsworth's reenactment of the night's events. All the characters gave a memorable performance, each in his/her own unique flavor. The plot and story by Jonathan Lynn and John Landis, with solid direction by Lynn, are fast-paced and exciting, as this movie constantly reminds you that there is a murderer on the loose and there are obvious suspects on screen for you to decipher! In addition, I think John Morris' terrific music score enhances the mysterious feel of a murder mystery movie. The humor is great, with Miss Scarlet's acid wit being my favorite. This is also one of those movies that you will find something new every time you watch it. Some downsides, I believe, were that some of the rooms like the Conservatory, Ball Room and Billiard Rooms weren't used enough and Mr. Green's character was a little too melodramatic.

I mean, there's no ""Monopoly: The Movie,"" or ""Life: The Movie,"" or ""Operation: The Movie."" But there's ""Clue: The Movie."" I've played the game a few times myself. It's fun, but I have no real love for it. All the characters from the game are present in this, and - I guess to make this a good movie - lots of characters are added into the mix, like Yvette and the Cook, along with the police officer, the singing telegram girl and the man whose car breaks down. It all adds up to a very confusing plot (which, in fairness, the movie pokes fun at itself over) and ultimately the movie offers three scenarios as to who the killer is and why the murders took place.There's a lot of energy involved with this, but for me the absolute impossibility of piecing together the story and guessing what had happened took away some of the enjoyment.

Some of the scenes and dialogue are laugh-out-loud funny. There are far too many moments that stand out in my mind to narrow it down to one favorite, but I'll include this one as an example:Mrs. White: He was deranged, he was... lunatic. He didn't seem to like me very much. He had threatened to kill me in public. Miss Scarlet: Why would he want to kill you in public? Wadsworth: I think she meant he threatened, in public, to kill her.The characters may lack depth and dimension, but all are very well played by a talented ensemble cast.

If you're so busy noticing each time a candlestick changes places in a scene or who's holding what weapon, I think you're missing the point.

34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Whodunnit?,6,7 October 2020,"This adaptation of the popular family board game skews heavily towards farcical comedy, with most of its detective work done on the sly. 'Clue (1985)' isn't a picture that can be puzzled out as it progresses, primarily because it was designed so that any of its core characters could have committed the inevitable murder. Indeed, it originally included endings in which every cast member was the killer, before it was pared down to include the three 'what-if?' scenarios it does in its final state. This means that you don't so much engage with the mystery as tag along behind it. However, the fun of the flick lies in its almost satirical humour. It's similar to 'Murder By Death (1976)', both in its tone and in the way that it plays with Christie-esque murder-mystery tropes. After its somewhat strained set-up, it becomes relatively entertaining in a 'just go with it' sort of way. Though it's never particularly funny, it has its own charm to it and is bolstered by some memorable performances. The board game elements are a little strained, but there's a definite attention to detail that fans of it should appreciate. The flick isn't hugely engaging and, on occasion, it can be a little slow, but it's decently enjoyable when it gets going and never takes itself too seriously. 6/10",Clue
35,Cineanalyst,Clueless Whodunnit,5,2 February 2021,"This is probably as amusing as a film adaptation of a board game can get. Appropriately enough, I revisited the cult classic after playing the tabletop version. The process-of-elimination game doesn't really make for a genuinely good filmic detective murder mystery despite seeming on the surface to be designed for such. Wisely, then, this ""Clue"" doesn't try to be. Contrary to its title, it hardly bothers with leaving the spectator any clues. Instead, it's an old-dark-house entry, a genre that has been a parody of itself almost from the beginning. Paul Leni's ""The Cat and the Canary"" (1927) and ""The Last Warning"" (1929), for instance, are more goofy than creepy. Silent film clown Harold Lloyd made a short one with ""Haunted Spooks"" (1920). James Whale, the director behind the namesake ""The Old Dark House"" (1932), was no stranger to camp, either. As has been pointed out by others, ""Clue"" especially takes from ""Murder by Death"" (1976).The tropes are all here: stormy night, car trouble, old mansion full of secrets, money-motivated murder, panicking guests, hidden passageways, everyone disguised from the get go by their pseudonyms, and the inevitable elaborate reveal. As far as this one works at all, I think it's largely due to how silly it is and that a cast headed by Tim Curry and including the likes of Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean and Martin Mull is full of veteran comedic talent. Some of the gags may be recycled and even butchered in their delivery, the homophobic ones dated, and a lot else relying on nothing more sophisticated than dog poop and bouncy breasts, but it's all so rapid that if a joke doesn't land or is overly broad there isn't much wait before another one is tossed out.I'm not sure I would've cared much for this had I seen it in theatres, either, with only one of the three alternate endings, but viewing them together in my own confined space on a stormy night, it works well. As there are hardly any actual clues for the spectator to follow along as a detective in the first place, it doesn't really matter who the murderer is. As with the game, it could randomly be anyone. It's the comedic excess of revealing that identity that matters.",Clue

But, soon several murders occur and the rest of the crew tries to stay alive and to figure out the identity of the killer or killers. How will it all end? The makers of this film, recognizing the popularity of the board game, have attempted to create a movie out of the slimmest of clues. While everyone knows the names of the characters, the weapons, and the rooms of the mansion, there is no further information provided by the game's creators. The result is a fair flick but one that is rather uneven. Certainly, the cast is terrific, and they try to make the most of the premise. The costumes, sets, and production values are also quite fine. However, the plot and script are of the thinnest varieties. Yes, there are some clever lines but, in truth, there is quite a bit of repetitive action, especially at the finale, where ""alternate"" endings are provided and details are hashed and rehashed. So, if you love the board game or any of the cast members, you will probably want to see this film and most likely will enjoy it, too.

It's wasn't a bored game.",7,15 August 2013,"If you ever want to make a movie based on a board game, look at 1985's mystery comedy 'Clue' rather than 2012's 'Battleship"". The film is a murder mystery set in a Gothic Revival mansion, and is styled after 1976's Murder by Death and other various murder/dinner parties of mystery. The film was directed by Jonathan Lynn, who collaborated on the script with John Landis. If you seem any John Landis film, you know it will be kinda funny. With the movie came a novelization by Michael McDowell and also a children's adaptation. Clue was Paramount's first adaptation of a now current Hasbro property, though at that time Cluedo was owned by Waddingtons and licensed in the U.S. as Clue to Parker Brothers; Hasbro later bought both Waddingtons and Parker Brothers. This predated by 19 years Paramount's deal to distribute other films and television series based on Hasbro properties. The film starts in 1954, against a backdrop of McCarthyism, six strangers are invited to a party in a secluded New England mansion host by house butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry). The guest are all given pseudonyms to protect their true identity from each other. During dinner, Wadsworth reveals the true reason for the dinner: all of the guests are being blackmailed to hide their secrets by Wadsworth's house owner, Mr. Body (Lee Ving). Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) is a psychiatrist who lost his license because he had an affair with a female patient. Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan) is the wife of a Senator who has accepted bribes to deliver her husband's vote. Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) is a suspect regarding the mysterious death of her nuclear physicist husband. Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren) is a madam who operates an illegal brothel in Washington. Then Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) is being blackmailed for scandalous pictures. Mr. Green (Michael McKean) is a homosexual, a secret that would cost him his job with the State Department if it were widely known. Some of the characters portray in the film is different from the game. Wasn't Mrs. White supposed to be a maid? Why isn't Professor Plum wearing something purple? Colonel Mustard is almost the only character that fits the board game description. Then the movie add a lot of new supporting characters. Now, why is Wadsworth in the movie? Wadsworth wants to turn Mr. Body in, but Mr. Body comes to the dinner, and reminds the guests that he can reveal their secrets in police custody and offers them an different proposition: by using weapons that he has provided to each of them, they can kill Wadsworth and destroy the evidence, keeping their secrets safe. Escape isn't an option as Wadsworth holds the only key to the locked doors, and vicious dogs patrol the perimeter, thus Mr. Body turns out the lights in the room, creating a moment of chaos in which someone shoots the gun. When they are brought back up, Mr. Body is dead, seemingly murdered by an unknown cause in the study. Who done it? Watch the movie to find out. The movie in keeping with the nature of the board game, release the movie at theater with one of three possible endings, with different theaters receiving each ending. If you get the DVD release, you have all three endings. Without spoiling it, only one of the three makes the most sense, while the other two, don't with all the plot holes A fourth ending was filmed, but supposedly it really wasn't very good so it was delete. I would love to see that fourth ending. I hope somebody find it one day. The explaining of the murder can be a bit annoying since you have to remember a lot of information and scenes. Is there any way, they can simple it. It can be campy, and seem not a family friendly film with all the dark death humor and sexual content references. It's rated PG. In my opinion, it should be rated PG-13. I doubt anybody 12 or under is going to get the sexual humor dialogue. The slapstick humor was funny, as well as smart comedy dialogue. Plus, all the scenes was film in nearly one location. That's pretty awesome to say. The exterior shots of the mansion were enhanced with matte paintings by matte artist Syd Dutton, as it was looks really real landscape. Overall: if you don't like the movie, you can always play the game, but if you do like the movie like me. You have something else to play one night.",Clue

41,tomgillespie2002,A solid cast saves it from total disaster,5,11 August 2012,"When movies start turning to board games for inspiration, it's time to start worrying. Although to state that this is now the case is a massive exaggeration, this year saw the release of Battleship, obviously based on the classic 'hit' or 'miss' two-player game. It reminded me of this 1985 oddity, which I had recorded from TV as a child and naturally watched it to death, though I remembered little to nothing about it, other than it starred Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. Based on the board game Clue (or Cluedo to us Brits and probably everyone else outside of America), it tells the story of a group of misfits with a lot to hide arriving at a remote mansion, with butler Wadsworth (Curry) playing the host and guide.The group consists of Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Professor Plum (Lloyd), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) and Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), who after eating dinner are ushered into the rest area to meet their blackmailer, Mr Boddy (Lee Ving). They are each handed one of the trademark weapons (revolver, wrench, rope et al), but when the lights go out, a gunshot rings out and Mr. Boddy (get it now? Har har!) lies apparently dead but with no bullet wound. Soon, the group of dashing about the house as bodies pile up and more questions are raised.Yes, this is admittedly a slim plot, with very little going on to justify 90 minute running time, but it remains amusing enough throughout to avoid being a total disaster. The climax sees three different endings played out with Wadsworth offering three explanations and offering three different murderers. During its theatrical run, the film offered one of these three different endings depending on which cinema who would unfortunate enough to be in. This is a nice idea, which makes it a slight shame it tanked and failed to earn back its budget.

42,eddie_baggins,A fun and over the top board game come to life,6,18 May 2020,"If you like me are inspired to go back and check out another bout of whodunit goodness after the roaring success of Knives Out last year, you could do worse than board game adaptation Clue, a silly affair that never tries to be anything but an over the top good time.Arguably one of the most faithful board game cinematic creations yet and the very first such adaptation to take place, Jonathan Lynn's ensemble comedy features all the staples of the famed Hasbro creation with Tim Curry's enthusiastic butler Wadsworth acting as the audiences main source of reliability, as a group of dinner guests find their mysterious invitation to a dinner party anything but a typical night in.Set in the height of the paranoid period of American history in the mid-50's, Clue sees government workers, rich socialites, humble maids and professors all become suspects in a series of murders where everyone, locked in a mansion, becomes a suspect.Never once trying to take itself seriously, with Curry's seriously energised central turn and a large portion of the films runtime devoted to cast members yelling at each other proof of this, Lynn collates a serious of sight gags and twists and turns that culminate in the films famed series of endings that give us not one finale but three, a choice that in its original disappointing cinema run provided just the one ending, different for each screening.There's little nuance to what takes place throughout, every actor of which includes Christopher Lloyd as Professor Plum, Madeline Kahn as Mrs. White and Eileen Breenan as Mrs. Peacock all go full steam ahead with highly colourful and over the top performances that would be hard to produce in today's climate but feel perfectly suited to the comedic stylings of 80 cinema of which this is a product of.It's interesting to note that despite its mostly ridiculed critical reception and poor box office performance, Lynn's film has grown in favouritism over the years with a strong cult following, leading to the recent announcement that Deadpool creators Rheet Reese and Paul Wernick and their leading man Ryan Reynolds would be joining forces to re-imagine this long-standing set-up for modern day audiences.Final Say -Silly from the moment it begins until the moment it ends (three times!), Clue is not high-class movie going but backed in by a memorable Tim Curry performance and a fun take on a board game come to life, Clue is still a lot of fun these 35 plus years on.3 chandeliers out of 5",Clue

There are some jokes about a homosexual character that really haven't aged well but mostly there's just lots of running up and down, which I think the makers have confused with humour. It's tiresome both mentally and physically. It doesn't even hold the interest as a murder mystery, as there are no genuine clues that you can gather towards any of the three conclusions.

48,hellraiser7,Getting a Clue,10,21 March 2014,"The fascinating thing about mysteries isn't so much the matter of finding the solutions but the different possibilities that are drawn up, it's true most of the theories are incorrect but due to their plausibility who's to say things couldn't of gone this or that way.This is one of my favorite comedies but also one of my favorite mystery films and films in general. Believe or not this film is also another childhood relic of mine, I saw this film when I was about 8, I was fascinated with the mystery/detective and noir genre since I was into the TV show ""Magnum P.I"" even the film ""The Great Mouse Detective"" but I never saw a live action movie mystery/suspense thriller in my life, when I bumped into this film I was blown away, so this was literally the first one I saw and it's still one of the best.What makes it even more interesting was the fact it was based on my favorite board game ""Clue"". It was to me a really cool if daft concept making a film based on a simple game, this was way before video game movie adaptations were conceived. But surprisingly it worked because not just was the film true to the spirit of the game but it was it's own thing.I do like the who dunnit mystery, it really is intriguing and just like the game it keeps you thinking. From the actual weapons and locations of the mancion to keep track of. I love the fact that despite likely suspect it's not obvious, most mysteries now unfortunately have this bad habbit of waving the answer right in front of us which really I feel nullifies the intrigue, not giving us enough of a chance to figure some things out ourselves. But this film really does give you that chance, because just like the characters figuring things out we're just as much in the dark; from the fact we don't really know any of the characters fully from certain things we discover about them we don't have a reason to. But also on simply the when, where, why, and how each incident occurs. We always get a new piece of the puzzle and it would cause us to think back on how it fits. However, it's the comedy and the ensemble cast that really powers it. The comedy is just great the verbal humor is just fantastic there is some sharp, hilarious, and clever dialog that it might take more than one watch to get it all. Each of the cast members play the mixed and colorful characters from the board game well, their not exactly characters but more the typical character archetypes from any of the old murder mystery mancion stories.The late great Madeline Kahn is great as Ms. White, whom is pretty much the Black Widow whom has a heart of ice. It's funny how dryly funny she really is, my favorite moment was when she tells the story about a couple of her dead husbands, I find it blackly humorous not just from how bizarre the deaths were but how it makes her obviously suspicious. Martin Mull is also great as Colonel Mustard whom is hardly true to his rank since in reality he's really a complete wuss. Lesley Ann Warren whom at the time was kinda hot really fits the role of Ms. Scarlett well, she has a sort of crackling charisma.Though my favorite character is Wadsworth played by one of my favorite actors ""Tim Curry"" he is just fraking hilarious, this is probably my favorite role from him. He just has some of the best lines and dialog, I love how energetic he is as well as really smart and in control, really does work well under pressure in an uncontrollable situation and looks like any moment he could lose his composure. He's probably the only sympathetic one of the bunch (or it seems that way) since his motive in things seem more genuine. My favorite moment with him was no doubt when he explains how he solves the case by going step by step, which really involved him doing a lot of physical comedy and talking quickly which all admit was both hilarious and exhausting.The parody in this film works, there are all of the clichés and elements from those murder mansion mysteries, some obvious but others are suttle or addressed. One favorite quote of mine is ""Comunism is a red herring."" it's funny because it's true it was a common cliché in most suspense thrillers at the time where the perpetrator was usual a spy for the Russans.I really love the three scenario ending which I thought was brilliant, and makes sense since the board game ""Clue"" was also about a single player constructing any mystery scenario they want, to set up anyone to be the guilty culprit. In the theaters these ending shown randomly depending on which showing you came to. It's was a risky but great move, it would be awesome if may'be a comic book movie thought of doing that if they wanted to go the what if direction.This film like any great mystery is a great find.Rating: 4 stars",Clue

When a few of the guests in the house end up murdered, the other guests must work together to figure out the identity of the killer...Based on the popular board game Cluedo, Clue is a wonderful idea for a film and it certainly had bags of potential (and indeed a lot of this potential is highlighted at the start of the film when the mysterious guests first become acquainted), but once all the introductions are out of the way the film, for me, sadly went downhill very fast...There is far too much exposition and not enough action in the first half of the film; I get that some exposition is necessary to establish the characters and how each of them slots into the story, but I do think that this aspect of the film could have been trimmed down somewhat to prevent audiences from nodding off. In fact, the only thing that prevented me from taking my eyes off the screen was Colleen Camp's wonderful assets!!Things do liven up slightly when 'The Body' is introduced, but unfortunately from this point forward the film goes from being practically sedate to being overbearing, loud and irritating. The cast just seem to be running round, crashing into each other and yelling at one another for most of the second half of the film which is fun for a while but wears thin when it seems to just be chaotic for the sake of being chaotic (sometimes it reminded me of The Benny Hill show). A lot of the cast are guilty of overacting (particularly Tim Curry whose hammy performance actually started to annoy me towards the end of the film).Things get worse towards the end when the film tries to be too clever by getting bogged down in misdirection and a ridiculous 3 twist ending which was pointlessly confounding and it seemed evident that both director and screenwriter didn't know when to wrap this mess up!! In fact it's hard to believe that John Landis was involved in this crap as he has shown both before and after this film that he's capable of much better.I certainly liked the idea of making a film based on the popular board game of Cluedo, but sadly like a lot of the murders depicted in the film Clue is badly executed...",Clue

It transpires they are all being blackmailed by their host, Mr Boddy, who promptly ends up dead. Since everyone has a motive, it's up to Wadsworth the butler to try and figure out the identity of the killer.This movie is based on the board game Clue (or Cluedo if you're British like me), which may not sound like a promising idea, and the story is more than a little derivative of Murder By Death and The Cheap Detective (both of which also star Brennan), but it keeps coming up with dumb-but-funny lines and moves along at such a breakneck pace that you haven't finished grinning by the time the next chuckle comes. The terrific cast have a great comic/dramatic pedigree, with Curry stealing the honours as the officious, pedantic, fast-talking butler, but I also like McKean, Warren and Camp very much. There is a great score by John Morris, terrific sets by John Lloyd and an inventive triple-ending gag (they shot three endings and varied them on theatrical prints, but then threw them all together later). I like this movie primarily because it's so nutty, but it's also such an oddball group of people who made it; Lynn was the co-creator of the British political satire Yes Minister, producer Debra Hill came from low-budget indie movies like Halloween and writer/exec John Landis was a Hollywood infant terrible - how did these three get together ? At any rate, make sure you catch this flick; it's the sort of movie the critics fall over themselves to belittle but that people who actually enjoy cinema have a great time watching.

So when I was a kid, I jumped at the chance to see the movie, although I never really appreciated it much till I was a bit older.Clue is based on the background story to the board game. The evasive Mr. Body (Lee Ving) invites six guests to his mansion for dinner and blackmail. His six guests, Mr. Green (Michael McKeon), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull), and Mrs. Scarlet (Leslie Ann Warren) all have something in common, although they don't initially know this, some dark secret in their background that they'd rather not have out in the open. But if Mr. Body doesn't expose them, they'll have to spill the beans anyways in order to clear themselves. Although, this is really inconsequential to the story in the end, anyway. That is, when Mr. Body suddenly drops dead before his guests, followed by the cook and the butler. Before anymore wind up dead, and in order to catch the culprit and solve the whodunnit, the six guests lock themselves inside the mansion to figure out who killed them, in what room, and with what weapon. Hence, the connection to the board game.You have a great comedic cast, even if there is not much of a story and the entire film is focused on the characters really doing nothing more than running all around the creepy mansion, engaging in a few amusing miscalculations. I suppose because they weren't sure how to end such a simple story (and given all of the possibilities you're offered in the game), they have this is a movie with three different endings, each starting with...""if it happened that way."" But, this comedy is particularly saved by a tremendous cast, especially Madeline Kahn (I love the ""flames"" routine she does) as the scheming Mrs. White.The story is quite similar to the 1945 mystery drama, ""...And Then There Were None,"" based on the Agatha Christie novel. If you like Clue, I would highly recommend this older version of the novel adaptation (I have not yet seen any of the remakes). There, ten guests are invited to an isolated mansion and, one by one, each is killed off according to the old poem, Ten Little Indians. A much funnier version of this latter film, and one closer to Clue (but still funnier yet) is the Neil Simon comedy, ""Murder By Death,"" which involves a highly eccentric mansion resident who invites famous private detectives to his mansion for a game. He informs them that each will be killed off and the person who figures out who the culprit is wins the game. So if you like Clue, you might enjoy those two movies, too.",Clue

While the film wasn't a success, Clue (1985) has gained a reputation among its fans and is considered to be one of the best. It's quite intriguing to say the least considering making a board game into a full motion picture is not the easiest sounding thing to do. However, with the help of some entertaining performances and unique direction, any viewer who watches it probably won't come across anything else like it. In order to come up with such ideas, one would really have to sit down and think creatively.The story follows very close to the game by having the audience introduced to group of individuals all under pseudonyms. Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), Yvette (Colleen Camp), Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) are all the guests, served by Wadsworth (Tim Curry) the butler.

This is the directorial debut of Jonathan Lynn, who would later direct My Cousin Vinny (1992), The Distinguished Gentleman (1992) and The Whole Nine Yards (2000).The screenplay was also penned by Lynn and director John Landis (The Blues Brothers (1980)) would help in the story prior to the screenplay. For what's shown, the way the mystery plays out is pretty rare for its time, even by today's films. Even the film crew made three different endings and had them played at different theaters. No one does that anymore! How the characters interact with each other is mostly how one would expect them to behave. Each scene leads to a new discovery, which drives more verbals spats and relinquishment of secretive information. All of this is believable because anyone in such a situation would feel the same way. Panic and frustration can cause people to make irrational decisions. That doesn't mean the execution doesn't have its flaws. Was it due to it being Lynn's first directorial outing? Maybe.The biggest thing that perhaps doesn't translate well to the film medium is time. Unlike a board game that immerses a player in the story. The film doesn't actively have the viewer participate in the story other than watching. And with that, the runtime is an issue. There are parts in the movie that go about explaining how things are done. Yet, due to the run time, that exposition can feel rushed. Contrary to a board game where players can sit, discuss and explain to each other what's happening for as long as they want without a time limit. If a viewer misses a piece of information here though, forget trying to catch up. This can be confusing. The only other minor tidbit is that the comedy isn't laugh out loud funny. It has some good chuckles and moments that'll make a viewer laugh, but nothing that's fall over laugh inducing.The visuals to the movie are well crafted for 1985. The set of the mansion provides a great atmosphere with the setting. The camerawork was handled by Victor J. Kemper and it was competent enough for the movie. Kemper was also the cinematographer for The Gambler (1974), Magic (1978), National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Tommy Boy (1995). The music was another plus to this film experience. Composed by John Morris, the score to this picture captures the goofy frenetic nature and mysteriousness of the setting at hand. There's a mix of synthesizers, organic horn orchestra and even a calliope. Morris would also lend his talents to The Producers (1967), Blazing Saddles (1974), Young Frankenstein (1974), The Elephant Man (1980) and Spaceballs (1987). Well done!Due to the translation of board game to movie, viewers need to be quick to pick up on hints and explanations. Otherwise, they may get lost. Aside from the comedy not being gut busting, the actors do a great job, the story is a fascinating watch and the music compliments the style of the film well.",Clue

As a film, its success is the machine gunning of throwaway gags and one liners, and spoofing of the McCarthyite era and 1950s idealism which is amusing. Structurally there are some flaws, mainly in the second act when it invoke dispirit due to its less credible characters.
However, if you're going to do screwball or farce then you need to do it well. What better cast could you hope for than a bunch of very talented comedy actors who can produce good comic timing without one overshadowing the other. That said, it is a pity one or two of the ensemble didn't produce a little more impressive style because we were left with dear Tim Curry, Leslie Anne Warren and Eileen Brennan to work harder while the plot uncoiled so frenetically.

70,Sergeant_Tibbs,Disjointed but fun to keep guessing.,6,2 September 2013,"There's a big trouble with adapting movies from board games. There's few if any developed characters and there's almost too many alternative routes to take the story. That's why the board games is fun. To take that idea to a movie and even try to capture the essence of the game is a challenge and one that I don't feel is really worth taking. Clue, based on the game Cluedo which I've played but don't really remember the rules, is an interesting and entertaining attempt for the most part. However, it would be significantly better if it was more consistent. It's always trying to have to have it both ways. It can't decide if it wants to be a tongue-in- cheek mystery film with cringe-worthy puns and misunderstandings or an all out parody with slapstick humour. The two don't mould together very well. It's a shame that it's shot like it's on a stage with bland direction and photography. It means a lot of what it wants in focus is lazily placed in the frame. But this wasn't what the film was concerned about anyway. Some of the humour lands and it's great fun to keep guessing. I guess that's the main thing it carries from the game. Tim Curry is absolutely brilliant as Wadsworth, especially his energetic performance in the third act and Spinal Tap's Michael McKean and Lesley Ann Warren were other highlights. I wish they made up their mind and went for the final of the three alternative endings because that really stunts the film's momentum and kinda made the most sense.6/10",Clue

An interesting gimmick. Sadly, that gimmick is about the only interesting thing the movie has to offer. When you're making a movie out of a board game you can't expect to produce a cinema classic. All you're looking to do is make a movie that's fun. And this movie just isn't fun enough. The performers have a good go at it, most notably a deliriously over the top Tim Curry, but the material lets them down. Jokes fall flat, the movie drags and by the end you really don't care who did it. And finding out who did it is the whole point of the movie so that's a problem.The movie sets itself up the way anyone who's ever played the game knows it would. All the famous characters are brought together in a secluded mansion. Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard. Somebody ends up lying dead on the floor. Who did it? And where? And with what? Well the where part is no great mystery. Or is it? There may be surprises to come. Anyhow our six suspects must figure out which of them is the killer. They are assisted by the butler Wadsworth, who serves as a sort of master of ceremonies for the bizarre evening, and the French maid Yvette. Along the way more bodies pile up. Attempted jokes pile up too but so many of them miss the mark. The comedy falls flat and the movie does too. None of the six suspects really stands out. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to point your suspicions in any one direction. But the effect is that bland characters make a bland movie. Michael McKean's Mr. Green and Madeline Kahn's Mrs. White are particularly dull. No fault of the performers, they really have nothing to work with. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing Professor Plum, is rather dry and boring. If you can make Christopher Lloyd boring you've really done something. Not something good though. Lesley Ann Warren does make a ravishing Miss Scarlett, always my prime suspect when I played the game. But she's upstaged in the va-va-va-voom department by Colleen Camp's wonderfully bouncy Yvette. Martin Mull makes no real impression as Colonel Mustard. Eileen Brennan's Mrs. Peacock does have some personality but she's more annoying than anything else. It's really left to Curry, playing Wadsworth, to inject some life into the movie. And he tries. Boy does he try, never more so than near the end with his madcap recap of events. But game as Curry is he can't perform a total salvage job on this largely disappointing movie. It's a whodunit where the answer is ""who cares?""",Clue

It's hard to remember anymore that the world was ever this innocent, so that's worth something to me all by itself. A brief summary is that it's a short, quick-witted, comedy loosely based on Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" I think, and I can't see how it could offend anyone (except that nowadays someone is always offended). Unfortunately, my guess is that today's kids will probably be on their iphones after about 5 minutes due to a lack of explicit sex or violence and a mostly verbal plot.

79,gab-14712,The Sense of Fun and Tim Curry Overcomes A Weak Script...Barely!,8,4 July 2020,"I have seen 1985's Clue several times now. Prior to watching it, my friends boasted how it is one of the greatest comedies and mystery films ever made? My initial reaction when the credits rolled was, ""Uhhhhhhh.....seriously!?!"" I have a blasted headache no thanks to the film. But on subsequent rewatching, while still holding true to my initial thought, I did think the film is a fun if not forgettable 80's flick. Jonathan Lynn's script is super-thin and barely holds together, but the excellent cast is the glue that holds the film together. Tim Curry absolutely knocks it out of the park, and I would not hesitate to say this is his finest role despite being in better movies.I remember playing the hit Hasbro board game as a kid. Yay for family nights! It is nuts to think that a feature film, a watchable film that is, was made from the board game. Paramount somehow succeeded! The script eventually came together from producer John Landis when he got the likes of Anthony Perkins and Stephen Sondheim to work on the script, but it was ultimately finished by Jonathan Lynn. Yeah, the script could have used much more work. The film received attention because of its three endings. In 1985, Paramount released the film in theaters with a third of each theater population playing the different endings. People definitely saw this as a gimmick due to the mixed reviews upon initial release. The ending definitely can be confusing to follow as the whole bag of tricks becomes unveiled.The film's plot is your standard, typical whodunit story. There are seven guests, a butler, and a maid being involved with a series of murders. All of the guests meet up at the Hill House, where they find themselves being blackmailed. Most of these characters, in some shape of form, have relations with one another. There is Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) who works as a psychiatrist in Washington D.C. Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) works for Miss Scarlett (Lesley Anne Warren) who used to be the employer of the maid, Yvette (Colleen Camp) who slept with Mrs. White's (Madeleine Kahn) husband. The lights go off and murder weapons are handed out. In addition, we have the crazy Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan) and the incredibly clumsy Mr. Green (Michael McKean). All of these characters also interact with the butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry). Who are the murderers and who are the victims?The story is simple and mundane with no thanks to the bare-thin script. Thankfully, the cast comes to the rescue. Each character finds their moment to shine. In Tim Curry's case, he was the bright light for the entire movie. He really hammed it up and I was there for every second. Christopher Lloyd, in all his fast-talking brilliantness, looked unrecognizable but did have some memorable scenes. Madeleine Kahn is excellent herself. The film puts its cast to good use using many of the comedy stars from back in the day. Michael McKean, also excellent!I get what Jonathan Lynn and John Landis intended the movie to be. It didn't quite hit the sweet spot as the ultimate mystery spoof. If anything, I would prefer an Agatha Christie tale like Murder on the Orient Express. I do think it was a neat idea to bring comedy into the proceedings. Like most comedies, some jokes worked, and others did not. It is the thought that counts! Ultimately, Clue is a fun movie even for all the gimmicks and script issues it has. It's a good excuse to pop in on a Halloween night or something, but do not expect anything with Agatha Christie's quality.My Grade: B",Clue

Its cast and vocabulary is taken from the familiar children's board game.The best humour is the subtle, many throw away lines you could easily miss if you don't pay attention, many based on people misinterpreting less than perfectly unambiguous statements. This dialog roars along at breakneck speed. There are no ponderous pauses for laughs or to give you time to figure out the joke. The director wants to make sure there is more there than even the sharpest minds can grab in the first viewing. There are subtle references to Curry's famous role of Dr. Frankenfurter in Rocky Horror Picture Show. That is the undertone. There is also a layer of more overt corny humour.What bothered me about the show was the stellar cast spent much of its time just standing around, running from room to room or screaming.I'd love to see this movie again just for the few scenes where Madelaine Kahn got to do her thing.

It must have taken a great deal of energy to make the total outrageous scenes at the end where he runs from one room to the next and deliver lines with rapid speed.Besides Curry, there isn't really any of the other actors who stand out and it was probably intended. Even the great Christopher Lloyd is rather sedated and everybody screams on cue every 2 minutes, like it was some kind of contest to see who could do it most.The atmosphere has an Airplane type mood to it, with flashing lightning and rain that doesn't come down but pours. Everybody was probably amused and they seem to have a rather good time, except maybe Colleen Camp who was typecast through most of the 80's as the character she plays here.Jonathan Lynn, the director, would go on to better things like ""My cousin Vinny"" but this is an impressive early effort from a TV-writer (he was one of the creators of Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister).

93,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Clue (1985),8,22 April 2005,"The classic board game comes to life in this delightful movie adaptation. It is a dark and stormy night at ""Hill House"" and we've got guests. Wadsworth (Tim Curry) is the butler and the guests go by aliases. All the guests are powerful types who are being blackmailed by Mr. Boddy. All the guests soon have to figure out who is the murderer amongst them or they might be next.All the people, places and things are replicated in this live-action comedy. The cast is perfect (which includes: Eileen Brennan, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull and Lesley Ann Warren) and a couple new ones to mix it up. The comedy hijinks never let up as the cast mix it up in such deliciously devious ways. I'm not big on comedies but this one is top notch.",Clue
94,elicopperman,The Best Board Game Movie,6,30 June 2019,"Whether you want to believe it or not, Hollywood as always had a knack of adapting any given form of media into a film, including board games. Although most have been infamous misfires like Ouija and Battleship, arguably the best one to be adapted from one has to be Clue. Based on the Cluedo game by Anthony E. Pratt, the film did not do so well upon its original release and received mixed reviews, but went on to garnish a cult following for how subversive of a feature it was, even by any given comedic standards. Despite having an appropriate three act structure, the whole movie happens to have three different endings.As the film is a parody of the murder mystery genre flicks from the 1930s to the 1950s, the essential plot is that six guests are invited to a dinner party hosted by Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), whom admits to be blackmailing all of them. These guests, the aliases Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) and Col. Mustard (Martin Mull) all become suspects when Boddy is murdered, and they all try to figure out who is the killer. Admittedly, the mystery itself sounds predictable at first, but the film pulls so many punches in its execution that you never know what to expect. While there are plenty of stakes, they're also played up for laughs, as the film appropriately unwinds every given hint needed for the case to crack.In addition to all the chaos roaming about, the performances are phenomenal. Each character has their own distinct personalities, and the actors nail their quirks on a silver platter. Tim Curry pulls off the necessary suave casualness for the butler Wadsworth, but when given the moment to snap, he lets it all out wonderfully. Martin Mull is appropriately irritated and concerned as Colonel Mustard, Michael McKeen overly plays up the paranoid hysteria for Mr. Green, and Christopher Lloyd practically is creepy enough as the perverted Prof. Plum. Leslie Ann Warren gives off the necessary sassy vibe as Mrs. Scarlet, Madeline Kahn is mostly subdued as Mrs. White yet can still come off as hysterically narcotic, and Eileen Brennan makes Mrs. Peacock the most emotionally unstable of all the guests. All these different performances play off one another beautifully, as the contrast makes for a wonderful character driven mystery.Now as for all the different endings, without giving them away, let's dissect how they play out. When the film was originally released, different movie theaters played one of the multiple endings. This was in order to keep up with the spirit of the game to keep viewers wondering which ending they would get to see. Well, after the film failed to attract enough audience members, the home video release pieced to just cram all the different endings together at the end. In my opinion, I'm glad they went with that choice for the latter, because the tone is so bizarrely laughable in the first place that having every single conclusion come up one by one fits very well. Granted, the theatrical release was pretty clever for the sake of wanting to go see the film differently each time, but not as much as having different scenarios play out one after the other, like a guessing game.So even though the film had good intentions, it didn't seem to grab enough people to want to see it over and over again. But hey, that's what cult followings are for, and I feel this is the type of film to introduce to those wanting more out of a board game movie. In my opinion, if you're going to adapt a board game into a feature length film, it should feel like the actual game and be embraced for all its fun potential. Of course, a three act narrative does need to come in order first, but you should still make it feel like the audience is within the experience of a game, and this film pulls that off pretty damn well. If you're a fan of cult classics, 80s comedies or movies that are strutted differently than most mainstream fodder, then this is a definite watch for you. And remember, it's not stopping you from playing the real game and gaining the raw feel yourself.",Clue
95,Rickting,One of the most purely enjoyable comedies ever made,8,26 October 2014,"Whenever I hear of a film based on a board game, I almost always think it's going to suck. Battleship certainly wasn't amazing. Cluedo is a very fun and clever board game. Yet this film, based on the board game, is 10 times more fun. Clue has various guests at a house trying to solve a series of murders, all of them played by fun actors in full on hilarious camp mode. This has 3 endings which are shown back to back on the Netflix version. Clue is simply one of the most fun comedies you'll ever watch. It's not for everyone as the camp tone and lack of seriousness may start to get on people's nerves after a while. Also, I think one ending was enough. In terms of quality it's an 8, but in terms of enjoyment it's pretty much a 10. The script is so energetic you can almost see the sparks fly and it crackles with energy, delivering hilarious joke after hilarious joke like a ballistic missile launcher, while the direction is also well done. Although the 3 solutions do pile up, all of them make sense and the mystery is rather difficult to solve.All of the actors, especially Tim Curry, are great and the sets are fun as well, creating a campy sense of Gothic. Thankfully, it doesn't stick entirely to the formula of the board game and allows itself to be its own movie. Because of the endlessly silly tone it is at the expense of actual tension, but this adds to the movie a little at the same time. It's an acquired taste and if you want to see anyone take anything seriously look else where but this is without a doubt the most under appreciated comedy of all time. It gets a lot of bad reviews, but it's incredibly funny, it has loads of entertaining set pieces and the cast are awesome. Thankfully viewers have been less harsh on the film and it is a cult classic but it deserves to be more than that. Clue was a hugely pleasant surprise as I wasn't expecting much yet I was in full on maniacal laughter mode for the whole film. Campy, silly, clever and endlessly witty, it is one of the most entertaining comedy films of all time. As for the critical critics.... get a clue! 8/10",Clue
96,CinematicInceptions,Complicated without detracting from the laughs that will hit you with a different kind of weapon each time.,8,19 October 2014,"This is probably the most complicated comedy out there. The whole basis of the plot is a political, social, and convoluted network of double-crossings and connections. The six guests from the board game are all a part of the other's predicament of blackmail by Mr. Boddy, even though none of them have met each other until they all arrive at the mansion. But you don't need to keep track of all of the background blackmailing information to enjoy it because it's a comedy, not a drama or spy movie where you're trying to predict the ending the whole way through. The guests are primarily connected by other characters, some that are not in the film, and some that are servants of the mansion (Yvette has a prior connection to about three of the guests). I would say that it's better just to let the characters develop in your mind during their brief revelations of why they are blackmailed instead of trying to remember all of it. Besides, Wadsworth the butler, played by Tim Curry, runs through the entire night in five minutes at the end and makes it all clear-ish to the audience. In some ways, Wadsworth is the main character because he sort of runs the show and knows what's going on. He is rather proper and butlery, but has a distinct personality. The other six guests have equal parts to Wadsworth, but are set apart from him because they are all rather in the dark on several points and are all suspected of murdering Mr. Boddy. They all have well developed personalities and individualized styles of humor. Mrs. White is cold and very defensive in a way that kind of says ""I'm guilty but you can't really prove it"". She makes a number of snide remarks about people, particularly towards Yvette and her late husbands, but she doesn't always deliver them in ways that automatically tell you that it's supposed to be funny. This is true of many of the funny lines of this movie, though certainly not all. There are several quick remarks that don't seem like they will produce any kind of humor, but when you take it together and figure out what they mean, you find the funny side of it. Mr. Green is an incredibly clumsy and nervous man who seems to make a fool of himself in some way whatever he is doing, and the humor he creates is a bit more blatant. Mrs. Peacock is a rather shrill older lady that looks like she jumped in a pile of leaves before coming to the dinner. She tries to create the impression that she is innocent by being excessively flaky and flustered. Professor Plum is rather excitable and wide-eyed throughout and pleads innocence by acting rather frightened the whole time. Miss Scarlet is the one that seems most guilty because she creates the impression that she is proud of what she is being blackmailed for and almost looks for approval from the others. Lastly, Colonel Mustard is the accusatory one of the bunch, trying to point the blame away from himself and often embarrassing himself as he does. Each guest murders one person, and these six victims play small parts, some smaller than others depending on how quickly they get killed off. The two most developed of these, apart from Wadsworth, are Yvette and the cop. Yvette assists in the investigation of the murders and is very scared of both the guests that she is associated with and the situation they are caught in. She adds to the slight air of suspense that floats through the proceedings. The cop makes the whole group nervous with his suspicion, and sort of embodies the audience's feelings with his confused reactions to the guests' antics. All of the character are well cast and well played by their actors. The three endings are kind of fun, and they collectively embody the three ways one would expect the film to end. The first one has the crook that you don't expect (Mrs. Peacock) as the murderer. The second has the one you would expect (Miss Scarlet). The third and ""real"" ending has the impartial one where everyone did it and Wadsworth is the truly guilty one. I found the whole thing to be fairly interesting and very funny throughout. Whether you like this movie or not really depends on whether you like the jokes and how much you care about how the blackmail plot plays into it. There isn't much to criticize with the execution, though I guess you could poke holes in the way that the victims are incorporated. Regardless of whether you enjoy it or not, it is well done, and there aren't many examples supporting the theory that it isn't. So I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy. For me, it's hard to say what other movies it is similar to, so I don't know what kind of cinematic tastes it appeals to, though it has a lot of memorable quotes if you like that. I rather think they could make a reboot of this with Benedict Cumberpatch as Wadsworth, Anne Hathaway as Miss Scarlet, Jim Carrey as Professor Plum, Uma Thurman as Mrs. White, Bruce Willis as Colonel Mustard, Will Ferrel as Mr. Green, Una Stubbs as Mrs. Peacock, Luke Evans as Mr. Boddy, and Emma Stone as Yvette. But, somehow, I feel like it might not have the same elements that people like about the original. Overall Rating: 8.6/10.",Clue

Then and now, Clue is in many ways an extraordinary movie.The fact the casting is deadly accurate doesn't hurt: Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Lesley Ann Warren...it's an onslaught of highly gifted actors delivering elevated, knowing slapstick at a rarified, elite level. They play it as straight as it gets, and with a chemistry not often realized in any genre.Like the board game itself, Clue is a whodunnit, but also a repository for gleefully quotable one-liners. In generating the story and script, John Landis and Jonathan Lynn clearly treated the process with holiness, as the layering here is deep enough to warrant showing after showing.

But how about this?Though noticeably flawed behind frequent microscopic analysis, 1985's ""Clue"" is well-deserving of its cult status as an under-appreciated comedy as well as for its amazing repeat value on par with, perhaps, Monty Python.Using the famous board game favorite as a springboard, the film mixes the game's familiar characters with a horror movie set, 1950's paranoia, and a preposterous scenario suitable for use by either a dinner theater or Agatha Christie. Each of the game pieces from the game are present, in wonderfully over the top fashion. They all gather for a mysterious dinner party. One that ever so leisurely leads to MURDER!

The thought of someone actually going to see all three makes me feel sad and disturbed.The only, and I mean ONLY, reason I can see for watching this movie is Colleen Camp's prodigious bosom in her French maid's outfit. Lesley Ann Warren must be secure in her ability as an actress to have been able to give a professional performance while being upstaged this way. Why did I watch the film?

It has that same dry, sarcastic, and literal delivery to the dialogue that Airplane or Naked Gun does. The difference between those films and Clue is that Airplane is funny. That's not to say that this doesn't have its moments, it does. There are a few great gags but the comedic timing is off more times then not. You'll have a character go sit at a table, then a monologue begins, halfway through the monologue the table collapses under the first guy. Funny slapstick gag but it comes well after when it would actually be funny. There are a number of other gags like this that fall on their face do to sloppy, awkward execution. One of the first things you see is Tim Curry stepping in dog crap but you don't actually see him step in anything. It's below frame. You get a series of awkward cuts to a close up of him followed by a close up of the dog. The editing generally plagues this movie, holding it back from being clever or even entertaining. Tim Curry is pretty good and has a good sense of timing but most of the other actors stumble through their dialgoue. Everything comes off clunky or disjointed in one way or another. In the hands of the Zucker Brothers or an equally talented director this could've been a classic. Of course, I realize people love it and it has reached cult status but I don't get it. The film was so unsure of itself it even sent 3 different endings to theaters. To me that is gimmicky and stupid.",Clue

This is one of the most fun movies that I have ever watched in my whole entire life. Now, I have never played Clue, but I know a good movie when I see it one a shelf at some store.Here is the plot of this movie. Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlet, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, and Professor Plum are blackmailed by a man named Mr. Boddy. Everyone is invited by Wadsworth the butler to go to a house and have dinner. Yvette the maid and the cook for the house are involved in the blackmail too. Then, Mr. Boddy is mysteriously murdered. Anyone could have done it. Then the cook is killed. The people split up to look for the killer. Then, a motorist comes to the house. He is killed. Then an officer. Then Yvette. Then a singing telegram girl. People are dropping dead left and right. Then Wadsworth figures out who did it. Now, there are three different endings to this. The first is when Yvette and Miss Scarlet are the killers. The second is Mrs. Peacock. The third is everyone.Overall, this is a very fun movie to watch. Like I said before, there are three totally different endings. Each one has at least one good thing. The first has one plus two plus one plus one, the second has Mr, Green saying that Mrs. Peacock was a man and Colonel Mustard and Wadsworth slapping him, and the third has Mrs. White's flame speech and the infamous last lines. Now, the only thing wrong with the third ending is the fact that Wadsworth is the killer. I do not think that anyone wanted him to be the killer. My favorite is the first one being as nobody was expecting Miss Scarlet. Anyway, this is a great movie that as to be a film to watch.9/10Recommended Films: Psycho.",Clue

His boss has been blackmailing all 6 of them for some time now and wishes to have a further discussion...To top it off, throughout the night the guests discover there is a murderer among them. But which one out of the six guests could it be?
Professor Plum?
Mrs. White?
Miss. Scarlet?
Mr Green?
Colonel Mustard?
Mrs. Peacock?Although this is a murder mystery, the film is also a comedy. The film is overloaded with witty, snappy dialogue and super corny jokes (80's style). The biggest stand out as an actor is Tim Curry who is full of energy and delivers a fun performance (not to mention basically stealing the show), in particular during the film's third act and final reveal of how the murders took place. The film's musical soundtrack is also fun as it tries to be spooky and scary. I also must comment on how awesome the mansion and set design looks for this film.As a murder mystery the film is rather honest in regards to its clues. When rewatching the film recently, if you pay close attention you can work it all out before the final reveal. However, as a fun fact for movie buffs, this film features three different endings. When making the film, three endings were shot, and when it went into cinemas back in 1995, one of the three different endings were shown at each theatre. Which means if your friend went to see the same film, the chances are they saw a different ending to what you saw (""Ending A"", ""Ending B"", or ""Ending C""). Thankfully the three endings are all now included no matter how you watch the film today (DVD or Apple iTunes etc). In my opinion, ending C is the true and final ending for the film...Overall, Clue succeeds in bringing the well known classic board game to the screen. With quirky, witty and fun dialogue, and a film that contains super random characters, this ""Who done it"" is lots of fun and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Actor Tim Curry steals the show with his energetic performance which will never be forgotten.8.0/10

It's true; the script is not actually that great. What makes it great is how everything is delivered. The cast is fantastic in playing each part as a cliché, even when the lines are far from it. Curry plays the role with so much ham that it's understood why the script is like this. This is a play, not a movie. I can understand not being in the mood for this film. But I can't understand not appreciating these fantastic performances. Another person pointed out that this film needs to be seen in widescreen.

The mystery aspect is fast-paced and engaging. The jokes complement the mystery very well and are highly amusing. Some mockery of McCarthy era Cold War hysteria is included in the film's jokes to great effect.

118,highwaytourist,"Great cast, clever idea, mediocre results",6,19 November 2009,"I was intrigued. I used to play the board game and enjoyed it, so when I learned of a film adaptation, I was looking forward to it. The star-studded comic cast added to the promise. During the 1950's, when the film is set, the characters from the board game show up for a dinner party, only to discover that the host is someone who has been blackmailing them. Chaos and murder follows. It could have been great, but it never was. It's not the actors' fault, as they try very hard and sometimes succeed. But they're given very little to do. For the most part, they go on some wild goose chases and stumble over each other, while looking for both a killer and the evidence the blackmailer was holding over them. The main problem is the script, which is even flatter than Clue's game board. There were a few amusing one-liners and a couple of decent sight gags, and little else. So I would recommend this only to those who are really interested in the premise of hard-core fans of the actors. It's easy to take and harmless, so if you must watch, catch it on television instead of paying money to rent it.",Clue

So far we have seen just one, but frankly I will have to see them all at least twice just to keep pace with Tim Curry's explanations of who was where doing what when the crimes were committed.The characters are ludicrous (but very well played), the situations are impossible, and it's all tremendous fun.

121,dtb,A Game Cast At Play,8,1 September 1999,"CLUE has been one of our family's favorites for years.

Despite a few groaners among the gags (how many times did they need to sniff for doggie-doo in the beginning?), there are enough witty lines (""Communism was just a red herring!"" and ""Flames...on the side of my face..."", among others, are frequently quoted in our home) delivered sparklingly by the top-notch cast amid enough madcap scampering about to make CLUE very watchable on a lazy afternoon, or even a not-so-lazy one, for that matter. Tim Curry (who deserves to be in more good movies) steals the show, particularly when he reenacts the entire movie in about 15 minutes during the climax, accompanied by John Morris's rollicking music.

122,FeverDog,BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COOK!!! *spoilers*,7,9 May 2002,"Well, this is it.  This is the movie that started it all.
Growing up, my family consisted of diehard 'Clue' addicts - 'Clue' the board game, that is.  I'll always remember playing it with my Aunts Sandy and Patti (who bear more than a superficial resemblance to ""The Simpsons""' Patty and Selma) constructing elaborate motives every time they'd make an accusation.  They were both local community actresses, and they put their heart and soul into every detailed scenario.  Truly a sight to behold, one of them would always keep detailed minutiae on their notebooks, and usually deduced ""Who, Where, and With What"" long before my pubescent self would have, well, a clue.Anyway, I remember CLUE opening at a local theatre (GCC Cherry Hill Mall 2, where I also remember seeing GUNG HO, TOP GUN, CROCODILE DUNDEE, ALIENS, and JUMPIN' JACK FLASH, and which is now, the last I heard, a labyrinthine Limited clothing shop).  Although my parents were never big movie buffs and were wary of dropping me off at the movies alone (I recall the previous year being denied the pleasure of EUROPEAN VACATION, but for some reason they okayed THE MONEY PIT), they understood my addiction to 'Clue,' and let me go.(Anyone who knows me knows that I love to drop random movie references in places they don't really belong.  So get used to it.)When CLUE played theatres, those detective notepads were handed out upon entrance, and I distinctly remember some loser usher scribbling ""Miss Scarlett did it"" on the one given to me.  I was, in hindsight, so p***ed; years of being challenged by my aunts prepared my eleven-year-old brain to solve the mystery, and some jerk ruined an aspect of the experience.  But despite being given that odious ""spoiler,"" I still had a great time.Since I was just a kid, I really didn't know any of the actors.  Of course I was familiar with Michael McKeon from ""Laverne and Shirley"" and Christopher Guest from BACK TO THE FUTURE.  But what child was privy to the delights of Madeline Kahn, or Eileen Brennan, or Tim Curry?  (My introduction to ROCKY HORROR wasn't until the next summer.)  I did, however, appreciate their fine comedic gifts, although I didn't realize it at the time.But, over time, I've been fortunate enough to see what makes them gods. Yeah, I love WHAT'S UP, DOC? in ways I can't go into right about now, but who knows if I would if I hadn't seen CLUE at a formative age?  (I am not ""a"" Eunice Burns, I am ""the"" Eunice Burns!)Where am I going with this?  Let's get back to CLUE, eh?  Back in the day a CLUE clique was formed, consisting of C.J., Jon, Chrissy & yours truly (Jen has always been a wannabe, but so has Allen - but he's worthy), and there's been many late nights when were gathered around the TV, thanking the techno gods for the VCR.  We'd pop in CLUE and each pick a role to own for the evening (I've been known to do a fierce Mrs. Peacock).  The four of us have bonded more than a few times over CLUE, and so let me take a moment to thank everyone involved.  (Thanks Mr. Lynn!  MY COUSIN VINNY is cool and all, but doesn't approach the bliss of ""I! Am! Your singing telegram!"").Long story short (too late), CLUE is a blast if you're zoned into its vibe. Never mind how ridiculously impossible its ""C"" ending really is (the one where ""they ALL did it"").  Just cherish it for its endless one-liners (""This is WAR, Peacock!), all the ""red herrings,"" and for all those in the ensemble at the top of their craft.One plus two plus two plus one,FeverDog",Clue
123,Svenstadt,Reminds me of 'Maniac Mansion',4,27 October 2020,"This was kind of a fun movie, in a trainwreck sort of way. The plot is very confusing and some of it doesn't make logical sense, yet, when you do figure it out, it seems overly simplified. There are parts of this which are very distracting, such as when the guests arrive, and Wadsworth stepped in doggy doo and every one of the guests grimaces in disgust, this part was unnecessary. Another part that doesn't seem to make sense is when Mr. Boddy tries to escape at the beginning, when he was the one doing the blackmailing and wanted everyone there???!!! Colleen Camp's acting as Yvette the maid is terribly annoying. The visuals are very captivating to the eye. I've found at least two dozen errors in this movie. It's a mansion with a basement, 2 stories, and an attic inside, but at the beginning, it is shown to be at least 5 stories high from the outside??!! It is best not to try and figure it out, because there's too much running around in this. That just makes it all the more confusing. Much like on Terminator 2, they pound you, consistently, with new characters the whole way through, and you aren't given a second to reflect or ponder what you've just seen.

128,mbhgkmsgg,Clue,8,25 January 2021,"Clue is a fantastic whodunnit that gets as much done with the mystery as it does with the comedy. While there are moments that are tantalizingly tense, it's the ridiculousness and the countless laugh out loud moments that make this film stand apart. As much as it mocks the genre and all its tropes, it also masterfully executes the things that make for a good murder mystery flick.I'll start with how this film began. Typically these whodunnit type films, or tv shows, start by showing the victim and giving some clues about how they died. They then go on to introducing the potential suspects and ultimately begin the investigation that reaches a satisfying conclusion. Clue, however, took a completely different approach. Indeed, at first, we are introduced to the group of people who seemingly are supposed to be the suspects. But, as quickly becomes evident, no crime or murder has yet taken place. So the mystery, then, isn't one of whodunnit, but one of why are they there. As such, there is a completely different atmosphere as the characters not only get to know each other but also try to piece together the reason they have been brought together. And as the film finally gets around to explaining why this particular group of people are together in that particular place, the first murder finally takes place.But, unlike the typical murder that needs to be solved, which is carefully executed without leaving any trace behind, this one seems to be accidental. And this is where the comedy ensues. The characters are all very different and somehow manage to form hilarious and wonderfully unique relationships with one another. As they start to solve the murder that took place right before their eyes, they quickly realize that things aren't as they seem. Indeed, it almost seems as if there is someone else in the house as well, when in fact, they were supposed to be alone. However, as they go on the search for the unknown mystery killer, they have to put trust in one another, despite not knowing who the killer might be.The thing that made Clue so great was its ability to do things differently. The whole whodunnit genre often feels like it's following a very strict predetermined formula. And while that formula can work wonders if done correctly, (e.g. Knives Out), it still feels familiar. It's easy to guess how the movie will progress and how it will ultimately end. While the identity of the killer is a mystery until the very end, or at least it should be, the structure and flow feel predictable. With Clue, however, I couldn't have guessed what was going to happen next. It is untraditional at its core, and it somehow manages to make the genre feel fresh and fun, and stupendously entertaining, while still capturing the tensions and mystery that make these films so good. Since it approaches the topic from a completely different standpoint, there was a lot of freedom in the execution. Instead of introducing an all-knowing detective who has never failed to crack a case, the suspects are the ones trying to solve the mystery. Instead of focusing on one masterfully done murder, bodies drop here and there and none of the murders seem to make any sense. And, instead of revealing it all in one final grandiose show of brilliant thinking from the detective (you know the kind of scene I'm talking about), there are three equally ridiculous and plausible conclusions. And although the film does say that one of them shows what really happened, due to the way they are presented, I can't help but feel that there was some conclusion that we didn't see, which very well might've been the actual chain of events. But ultimately, this film made it irrelevant what actually happened. The whodunnit genre typically relies on a satisfying conclusion that gives an answer to every question. But Clue, in its attempt to ridicule the rigidity and seriousness of the genre, makes the ending feel like the least important part.Having recently watched Knives Out and absolutely loving it, I was in need of another great whodunnit. Thankfully, Clue, which I had been eyeing for a while, delivered exactly what I needed and more. Despite being truly different in comparison to so many of the more serious entries in the genre, it still captured the essence that makes these films what they are. Usually, I have some sort of idea about who the murderer is, even if I'm ultimately wrong, but with this one, I have to admit, I was absolutely clueless (heh, see what I did there) until the very end. Clue isn't just a wonderful murder mystery flick, it's also a great comedy, and somehow, it makes those two genres mix perfectly.",Clue
129,no-skyline,Madcap Comedy,8,19 January 2006,"Comedy vehicle based on popular board game Cluedo (or Clue in the USA) staring Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn and Michael Mckean.I have to say this is a personal favourite of mine that I remember from when I was a kid and it's lost none of it's chaotic knock about sense of fun. Tim Curry is just a bundle of energy on his most manic form throughout literally throwing other characters around as Wadsworth the butler tries to solve the murder of the alarmingly named Mr Body. The humour is mainly sight gags, slapstick and the occasional one liner its the quality of the cast that really elevates this above what could have been a very dull concept. Christopher Lloyd is the perfect Profesor Plum and Madeline Kahn is creepy is the black widow Mrs White, the always reliable Michael McKean as the wimpy Mr Green adds to the mix.This film also has the added bonus that don't like the ending well there are two others to choose from!

130,manchester_england2004,One of my all-time favourite comedies!,10,24 August 2017,"CLUE is the only film that's based on a board game ever to be made. With this unusual concept in mind, you won't be sure of what to expect when seeing this film for the first time. I know I wasn't. But I do know that after seeing it for the first time, I would see it many more times over the years to come. And that's precisely what happened.The film plays out much like a stage farce in the sense that it's mostly on one set, with a simple concept that develops into something much more complex, with the characters losing control of the initial situation they find themselves in. Six people are invited to dinner at a manor house by an eccentric millionaire. When they arrive, they find things are not what they seem, especially the absence of their host. But it soon becomes apparent why they are there and a murder is committed. To say anything more would be to give too much away, suffice to say that the six people are based on the six suspects in the CLUE board game (Scarlett, Mustard, Green, White, Plum and Peacock). For anyone who's seen MURDER BY DEATH, this film is very similar in terms of plot and there are similarities in how it unfolds too.It's mainly the actors who make this film great and hold it together. Tim Curry is simply spellbinding as Wadsworth the butler. As far as I'm concerned, this is Curry at his best. I was honestly gripped by disbelief when I learned that his part was originally written for Leonard Rossiter. Great as though Rossiter was, this fast-paced running around farce-style comedy is really not his style. So I really don't think the film would have worked with him playing Wadsworth. It would have been a very different film that's for sure.So this is really Tim Curry's film and I always saw it that way right from the moment of the first viewing when I was 14. But as the years have gone on, I've come to appreciate the other actors more. Madeline Kahn is probably the best as Mrs White, who improvises her dialogue in a key scene towards the end of the film. The other actors all have fun with their roles, and Martin Mull's many exchanges with the others provide some of the finest and funniest moments in the film.Aside from the very spirited performances of the cast, one of the most enjoyable aspects of the film are the very funny one-liners. And it's hilarious watching the characters try to handle the many new situations they are thrown into as the film goes on. It's very much like a stage farce as I've said before. But since it's so difficult to translate this humour to the big screen, complete with the single set, then it's all the more reason for Jonathan Lynn and John Landis to be congratulated for pulling it off.The film also boasts a great soundtrack and the inclusion of some 1950s songs, particularly Shake, Rattle and Roll and Sh-boom, was a great choice. I for one prefer the use of Shake, Rattle and Roll for the end theme rather than the one originally intended.Overall, CLUE is a great farce-like film that boasts some great acting performances, a fast pace, lots of surprises and plenty of memorable one-liners. It's one of my all-time favourite comedies.",Clue

Do we really care though when we can sit back and watch this classic madcap comedy? Absolutely not!Jonathan Lynn has written and directed some of my favourite comedies over the years, but I still can't help wonder what this film may have been like if writer John Landis (American Werewolf in London, Trading Places) had directed it instead. Surely a lot darker with some of the humour perhaps? As it is he didn't, but it is still brilliantly directed and with a script from Landis the dialogue is top notch in its sharpness.Ok, so well all know the board game right? Good! Here, our unwitting guests have all been invited to a mystery house for a dinner party. One by one they turn up to be greeted by the deliciously manic butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry). This role was perhaps made for Curry, but then perhaps maybe that can be said of most of his roles over the years. He really is a class act. And he shines here and is certainly the star and highlight of the film.Madeline Kahn (Mrs. White), Eileen Brennan (Mrs. Peacock), Christopher Lloyd (Professor Plum), Lesley Ann Warren (Miss Scarlet) and the rest all play their parts wonderfully as per their descriptions from the game. My only personal gripe is with Michael McKean. He is a great actor indeed, he just never really won me over here. As great is Curry is though, I do think Yvette (Played perfectly by Colleen Camp) steals the show. We even get a small cameo from the marvelous Howard Hesseman.Anyway, once dinner has finished, Wadsworth reveals the real reason and connection they all share and why they have been invited. If you have not seen this classic gem, then I won't reveal anymore. The script is sharp, the lines are delivered impeccably from the cast and the directing is tight. The set location is simply perfect with a wonderfully accompanied score. The highlight of the whole film is undoubtedly when Wadsworth reveals how it was done. Or how it could have been done. Or who did it...or didn't do it...or well, just go and watch it. Solid, classic comedy. I hear the troubled remake has finally gained momentum again from Hasbro.

With the police on their way, the whole household must find out who is the murderer.My first impression of this film, hilarious! I give my props to Tim Curry who does an outstanding job as the butler. The cast is splendid from Martin Mull to Christopher Lloyd. The story is just the same with a few tiny tweaks like there's a butler, a maid, and a cook in the house, Miss. White is now a guest instead of the maid herself, and so on. You'll catch there are a lot of mistakes during the film like Mr. Body turns a rooms lights out and it's pitch black even though there was a fire burning, but you forget all about the goofs when one by one, bodies of strangers are all disappearing and reappearing dead, having to be stored in the study. You might wet your pants from the hilarious one liners said by all the characters. Examples: Green slaps Peacock and guest look at his like he's crazy. Green- "" I had to stop her from screaming."" Mustard- "" This is war Peacock! Like the cook says, we must stick together to fight!"" Peacock- "" But look what happened to the cook!"" White- "" So what if my husband vanished? Ounce he threatened to the public to kill me!"" Scarlet- "" Why did he say he wanted to let the public kill you?"" Butler- "" No I think she means he threatened in public to kill her."" Examples over. This film is perfect to sit back on a rainy day and eat popcorn with your family as you watch the hilarious tale of seven strangers locked up in a mansion with one of them as a killer. Highly recommended!",Clue
139,knucklebreather,Underrated zany whodunit,8,1 July 2010,"""Clue"" was a critical and commercial flop and its reputation has been dead in the water since its release. The IMDb rating is very accurate, though, as this movie is actually above average, if not quite an all-time classic even of its genre of comedy whodunits.The movie is of course based on the board game Clue (Cluedo in non-US markets). The very prospect of being a board game adaptation likely contributes to few people took this movie very seriously, but once you get over the silliness of that it is actually a decent adaptation. The basics of the game - the absurd character names and the basic concept of trying to figure out which character killed who, where, and with what deadly weapon is translated to film more accurately than I would have ever imagined possible without just filming people playing the actual game.The familiar characters, Colonial Mustard et al., are given goof-ball back-stories appropriate to the 1950s setting, the era when the board game first became popular, giving the movie a nostalgic feel that works well enough. They are all drawn to the signature mansion (an excellent matte art job) and learn from the Butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry in a great performance) that they are there to meet their mutual blackmailer, Mr. Boddy.As you would expect from his name and the basic premise of the movie, the murders start shortly after Mr. Boddy arrives. The movie is then a zany group investigation of who killed Mr. Boddy and the other supporting characters, who all are quickly knocked off by an unseen killer or killers. Much of the charm of the entire movie comes from Curry's amazing performance as he dashes around the house with all of the other characters in tow, energetically trying to determine who is behind all the murders (or perhaps draw attention away from himself?) This is definitely a high-energy whodunit, but unlike in _Sleuth_, a classic of the genre, it is run like a sprint with no interruptions. _Sleuth_ alternated between fast and slow sections, and I think the pacing contributed to its success. It's hard to imagine how _Clue_ could slow down, though, as the audience would have to think about how insane and unbelievable the characters and the overall plot are._Clue_ relies a lot on cheap gags and occasionally even on crude humor, which is amusing at times but sometimes falls flat. Its tendency toward groaner jokes is a real weakness, but there are some genuinely funny parts of the movie. The plot is, as I mentioned, completely unbelievable, but I think it's fun enough that you don't have to get too concerned with its lack of realism.In the end, the strong performances and the enjoyable, if silly, overall vibe of the movie make this one worth watching. It deserves a better reputation than it currently has!",Clue

142,EdYerkeRobins,A Movie Based on a Board Game?,6,24 August 2001,"Many movies are based on novels or TV/radio shows, but this has to be the first movie based on a board game.  While I can't say it sounds like a good idea on paper, this strange brew of tongue-in-cheek one-liners and plot holes almost works.The ""characters"" from the board game are pseudonyms given to the members of a party of aristocrats, who have been invited to a mansion by a Mr. Boddy. Mr. Boddy's butler, Mr. Wadsworth, reveals that Mr. Boddy has been blackmailing each individual.  Soon, Mr. Boddy turns up dead, along with the cook, and the remaining guests scramble to find out which of them is the killer, before the police arrive.  In between all this, several unexpected visitors arrive, lending more comic frenzy to the search for the killer.The main problem I have with this film is that there's nothing to the characters.  Films based on novels already have pre-set, pre-developed characters, but ""characters"" in a board game are all lifeless clones, the only difference being the name and appearance so the players can tell their pieces apart.  Likewise, with the exception of Tim Curry, who steals every scene as the eccentric butler Wadsworth, the characters in the film are wooden and undeveloped, with vague backgrounds and details that affect the story only through references in sarcastic remarks by other characters. Perhaps the only reason Wadsworth was written in to be such a memorable character is because he's not in the game, and the writers didn't have to worry about any backlash for ruining the game's ""reputation"".  The more likely reason for the lack of character development is that by trying to center on all 7 characters (probably to capture the ""feel"" of the board game), no character is given any chance to shine, not even Wadsworth. 
When first released in theatres, 1 of 3 endings was substituted in for each different showing of the film (my favorite is the ""real"" ending, the 3rd one).  While this is a good idea, if one was paying attention, the details of the endings totally contradict previous events in the movie (see the ""goofs"" section).  However, I didn't notice, because, frankly, there wasn't much in the film worth paying attention to.",Clue

148,RyanEberhart,STILL pretty funny.,8,29 August 2013,"Clue is one of my favorite movies of all time. Yeah, I know. I have a lot of favorite movies. What can I say, I love movies.This movie I like because it is a mystery and a comedy rolled into one. The cast that was assembled made this movie what it was. Tim Curry is great as Wadsworth, the Butler. Martin Mull is awesome as Colonel Mustard. Lesley Ann Warren is pretty darn good as Miss Scarlet, and beautiful too. So is Colleen Camp as Yvette. Christopher Lloyd is great as Professor Plum and Michael McKean is a convincing bumbling Mr. Green. I could go on, but I won't.Again as has become my custom I have several favorite scenes, which I will list.My first favorite scene is the three endings. The three endings are a series of endings in which the many different murders are explained. Wadsworth begins to explain how the cook, the motorist, Yvette, Mr. Boddy, the cop, and the singing telegram girl. All three endings are slightly different giving the viewer a ""murder mystery"" feel as they try to figure out who-done-it.The next like of mine really isn't about any one scene in particular. I like the awkwardness of each character interacting with the others. The script calls for several of the character, Wadsworth in particular, to utilize double talk, or using words that have double meaning. Some of it is confusing and the viewer almost gets lost in the conversation, but in a weird way it's funny.The last part of Clue that I like is the sexual innuendo, and the not so subtle sexual tension, aspect of the script. Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy all hit on either Miss Scarlet or Yvette. Mr. Boddy attempts to feel up Yvette while at dinner, but she steps away before he can get too far. Professor Plum did feel up Miss Scarlet by moving his hand to her rear-end while waiting for the front door to open.I give this 8 Stars out of 10, only because it is out of date. Yes, I know that it is period movie, set in the early 1950's. However, we are talking about a movie that hit the theaters nearly 30 years ago.",Clue
149,ConsistentlyFalconer,Hysterical in more than one way,7,2 August 2015,"There aren't any films that have been based on board games. This was a childhood favourite of mine (both the game and the film).There's something really satisfying about seeing good actors being silly. Tim Curry, of course, is a class act - a master in scenery-chewing who's right at home in this particularly manic role. Madeline Kahn always reminded me of Imelda Staunton with her perfectly- timed facial expressions; and Michael McKean is excellent as usual. This film is more manic than the similar - but more sophisticated - Murder By Death (1976), and from my wife's reaction when watching it, I'm sure a lot of my fondness of it comes from enjoying it as a child... but I still say if you can stand the rather hysterical performances you'll be in for a treat - lots of great one-liners and memorable moments (Jane Wiedlin with the briefest of cameos as a singing telegram in particular). The alternative endings, too, are an enjoyable gimmick. yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",Clue
150,octopusluke,"a fun frolic, but the boardgame is far more entertaining",5,1 December 2012,"One of the biggest critical flops of 2012 has to be the misjudged Peter Berg's action romp Battleship. With a hodgepodge cast, including Rihanna, Liam Neeson and Taylor Kitsch, it was pretty much unbearable from beginning to end. Has Hollywood become so stifled of good original storytelling that it has resulted in adapting boardgames? With Hungry Hippos and Monopoly on the way, I was stunned to discover that Jonathan Lynn (Yes Minister, Nuns on the Run) kickstarted the trend with Clue (Cluedo, in the UK), a goofy farce rework of the classic 'whodunnit?' game.Set in New England, 1954, it all kicks off with cackling thunder and torrential rain, as Tim Curry - playing totally to-type as the stuffy English butler Wadsworth - enters a huge Gothic mansion. From here, a series of invited guests, travelling under the pseudonyms of Col. Mustard, Mrs White, and the like, arrive for an evening's dinner of self-discovery, blackmail and murder. Whose their dinner host? This central question becomes all the more fatal when they each seem to be dropping off like flies. Murder weapons including lead pipe, candlestick and the classic revolver, there's a killer lurking in the study, billiard room and beyond, but who is it?Co-written by eighties movie monolith John Landis (The Blues Brothers, American Werewolf in London), there's a lot of flippant black humour in Clue's script, from bawdy sight gags, to wriggling corpses. It takes great influence not only from the Hasbro board game, but from the superior seventies comedy/mystery caper Murder By Death, starring Peter Falk. The ensemble cast try their hardest to emanate the same magic and momentum. Curry is great, putting in a sublime physical performance as the sleuthing butler keeping the guess-who game rolling. Whilst Michael McKean, directly following peerless mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, exhibits a great slapstick streak as the former state official-cum-timid homosexual Mr. Green. Never given enough clues to figure out to who the murderer could be, meaning that Lynn gives us three disparate ""here's how it could have happened"" endings. But by this point, we're exhausted, just waiting for the gambit to be up.Irregardless of some brilliantly thespian performances and welcomingly frenzied pacing, something doesn't quite stack up in the entertainment department with Clue.

Well, the filmmakers succeeded with flying colors.Despite what the naysayers have said, ""Clue"" has a fairly complex story intertwining the lives of the famous characters from the board game and throwing in blackmail, murder and a whole lot of stupid boob jokes. The cast is nothing short of perfect with some of the best comedic talent that ever delivered a good joke. With everyone from Michael McKean to Martin Mull to Madeline Kahn, the cast is simply perfect although I gotta admit that both Tim Curry and Bill Henderson really stand-out as the fastidious butler and a cop who looks like he was trained by Elmer Fudd.The set design is really appropriate for the genre with a spooky Victorian house set against a dark and stormy night. The time period also adds to the sense of foreboding and mystery (the movie is set in 1954).

Not for any particular reason, except maybe I had burnt myself out of it. Still, Clue remains a somewhat non-nonsensical quip-filled, fast-paced romp that can entertain at any time.For those who have not seen it yet, Clue is a comedy whodunnit based on the classic board game of the same name. A group of strangers who may be more connected than you think come to a secluded mansion for a dinner party where their host is murdered by one of them. Using deduction, comedy and general haphazard running around, the guests must try to solve the murder while also evading being murdered themselves. Even after numerous watches, I feel like the writers went for fast-paced and confusing on purpose. It works for me, as even all these years later I find myself smiling and being entertained, yet still a bit confused as who the killer could be. It could also be because I am enjoying watching a fantastic cast in the middle of their time just killing it on screen. Tim Curry, Martin Mull, Michael Mckean and of course the amazing Madeline Kahn are just gold to watch. They sprint through this movie dropping one-liners, and quips, never leaving time for our brains to do anything else but be entertained.Clue is just plain fun.

The concept is of course taken from the board game 'Clue' (or 'Cluedo', depending on where you live) and the publicity for the movie claims that ""the suspicious characters and sinister rooms made famous by the popular board game have come to life"".  The characters however, aside from their nomenclature, bear very little resemblance to those of the Waddingtons game (the Reverend Green has been de-frocked, Mrs. White has transformed from a frumpy cook into a black-widow, and none of them wear the colour of their name).But the real attraction of the movie is its legendary alternative endings. Six unlikely guests - all of whom have secrets to hide - are invited to dine at a spooky old manor.  The aptly named Mr. Boddy is the first to be murdered during the course of the evening, and, as the corpses begin to pile up, the race is on to find out who did it, with what, and where.  The film offers three possible solutions to the crimes for the viewer to mull over. .. . . . . . . .There is no doubt that the plotting is (by necessity) very clever, but it is also far too complex to make sense of in a single viewing.  Astute viewers will also pick up on several storyline holes that make all three endings unlikely, if not impossible.  The movie is presented (quite rightly) as a farce, and while the pell-mell rush of the end sequences is excellent, it fails to fire for the first 30 minutes, by which time its audience will probably have tired of the stale old campy word-play.

172,greg-e-porter,Clue is one of the best movies based on a board game...,6,22 September 2016,"For those who have not had the pleasure of playing the board game Clue, let me give a brief overview. A body was found in a mansion. The players have to explore the mansion, picking up clues along the way, and determine the identity of the murderer (Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, etc.), the murder weapon (gun, knife, candlestick, etc.) and where the murder took place (library, study, kitchen, etc.).We open to a dark night, as a car approaches a mansion. A butler named Wadsworth (Curry) steps out of the car and throws some bones to two large guard dogs. He starts to head inside but then stops, slowly looks down towards his shoe and then to the dogs with irritation. He stepped in dog poop. That's comedy gold, am-I-right? Now, we slowly but surely meet the rest of the cast who are given aliases to protect their identity. Wadsworth had summoned the group together to confront Mr. Body, who had been blackmailing each of the characters. Mr. Body responds by giving each character a weapon (the same ones from the game) and states that unless someone kills Wadsworth, their secrets will be exposed. Someone is murdered and the characters have to find out who did it, where and with what. The movie is a perfectly adequate adaptation of the elements of the game.Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of silly humor and Clue is pretty darn silly. Like having Wadsworth step in dog poop and then having each of the characters smell the air and check their shoes when he is around. But, for some reason, I don't mind it here. That is, I don't mind it as much as I normally would. Maybe I give it some slack because it's based off of a board game. It doesn't take itself too seriously like some board game-based movies- I'm lookin' at you, Battleship. Maybe it fills my goofy comedy quota. In any case, because of the type of humor (even though I let it slide) Clue is one of those movies that I can only really see once every couple years.I do find some of the 80's centered jokes amusing though. At some point, someone says, ""It's Hoover on the phone for you."" ""Why would the FBI director be on your phone?"" ""He's on everyone else's, why should mine be any different?"" Zing! Now, I don't really know anything about Hoover but I get the idea and it's kinda funny. You know, as far as it goes.One of the neat parts about the movie is that when it appeared, one of three endings was played at the theaters. When you watch it now, at the end of the movie, comes a card that reads, ""That's how it could've happened. But how about this?"" That gives a good indication of the light tone of the movie.Overall, I'd recommend Clue if you're in the mood for something silly. I kinda put it in the same family as Austin Powers and I'm sure just about everyone has seen Austin Powers a dozen times. So, if you want that sort of experience but something a little new, check out Clue. Oh and it has Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd which is pretty cool, you know?",Clue
173,ahmedn32004,Amazing Idea,8,22 January 2012,"I loved the idea of making a movie based on a board game. It is new and interesting. I loved the characters and the comedy situations. The movie is pretty good compared to movies in that period of time. The crime is complicated, you cannot reach the killer easily and the solving technique is interesting. What I didn't like about this movie is the multi-ending. It is not cool and it made me some kind of confused. I mean you find the crime has been done by a certain killer in some way then it tells you no no no wait it could be done that way either and after you see it and convinced that this is what happened it tells you hay it didn't happen with any way of them both it actually happened that way. It is a little bit confusing, I mean it could be done in another way if they wanted multi-ending. But anyway the movie is very good to watch.",Clue

As a previous reviewer of this movie stated, you could watch this movie every day and not get tired of it. For a point in my life, I did!I first saw this movie when it came out to rent on BETA (Yes, BETA :-).  It was based on my favorite board game, so I decided to give it a try.  I was instantly hooked.  I was so hooked, I even bought the promotional mobile from a local rental store, which to this day I've never seen anywhere else.The story, characters, and lines are wonderful.  None of the cast members disappoint, and all play their parts to a T.  Some may think transferring a board game to film would take out every aspect of the game.  Not so.  The rooms are identical to their placement on the Clue board.  Lines such as ""If you want to know who killed Mr. Boddy, I did, in the hall, with the revolver"" and ""We're trying to figure out who killed him, where, and with what!"" as well as the movies' use of ""Shake, Rattle, and Roll"" during the film as well as during the credits make hilarious references to the board game.The film sadly didn't do so well with critics or at the box office, however that may have been different had the film been released today.  I've shown the film to many visitors and friends since it's release on video, and every single one has gone out to buy a copy for themselves.There is much more to say about this movie, however I'll let you discover it for yourselves.  The video contains the three released endings, however I've seen various pictures in books and publicity shots which strongly suggest other endings were filmed as well.  No doubt this is true, and hopefully someday, especially with the advent of DVD, these will be released.",Clue

In fact, I remember watching this movie as a child and enjoying it quite a bit as well. Unfortunately I can't say the same now. This is a silly, boring and corny movie.The main problems are a boring plot, lame acting, and corny humor. Most of the jokes are groaners of the eye-rolling variety, there's definitely nothing actually funny occurring. As for the plot, it's uninteresting and ultimately pointless. The acting is lame across the board, and does nothing to draw the viewer into the lame-ass story.

Even though there are several murders and lots of blackmail, instead of feeling sorry for the victims, one gets a sense that justice was served.

Each character is cleverly crafted and played with obvious enjoyment.The several possible ending scenarios was inspired. I watched it on television once with one person guilty.

The movie has some people in it that I really don't exactly follow the careers of, or even like that much (Madeline Kahn and Martin Mull), but they're pretty funny in this one. For those of you who don't know the plot, it's about this party where people are invited, and the host of the party ends up dead.. more people die, blah blah blah. So they have to figure out whodunnit.  Just like in the game.  In the game of course there isn't much more to it, so the movie adds a little bit of dark comedy to it.

There's too much explanation of things you don't care about. You don't care who dies or why. You don't care who did it, or why.

The dialogue is hysterical and wonderfully quotable. Sure, if you've seen the movie as many times as I have, you can see the many plot holes (when the murderer(s) are revealed, it is not always possible for these results to exist. If you go back and watch the movie again, the outcome would require many people to be in two different places at once), but that does not matter. The movie is an absolute delight to watch.I cannot say enough good things about Madeline Kahn. She is so perfect in this movie (she was perfect in everything, actually) and her character of Mrs. White is deliciously cynical, especially when discussing her dead husband (""It's a matter of life after death. Now that he's dead, I have a life""). Other standouts in the cast include Eileen Brennan as the loud, neurotic Mrs. Peacock, Tim Curry as Wadsworth the butler (with the exception of a few moments, he steals the entire last act of the movie), and Leslie Ann Warren as the mysterious sexpot Miss Scarlet.Overall, this movie is a lot more fun than playing the board game, and oh so clever.

I may have seen it in my early teens (1980's) somewhere on some channel at some point and forgot about it but I really discovered it in 2015.It has two of my favourite actors in it, Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. I can't think of two more apt actors to play the parts they have in this movie, especially Tim Curry. This type of character is right up his alley. With that said, the rest of the main cast does an excellent job with theirs.This is based off the well known Clue board game. I played it A LOT on every break when going through early school (1980-85). I think this is as good as you can adapt this game to a movie and with a stellar cast to boot.The humour is quirky, zany, slapsticky and at points somewhat Python-esque. Lines delivered with serious cheekyness and physical excercises to go with some of them. You don't really find out who's actually the murderer but you have such a good time in between that it really doesn't matter. I find the travel to the conclusion to be the fun part.The set is on spot with what you could expect from a whodunnit. Set in the 1950's in a big old mansion with all the contemporary do's and dont's of that era. Camerawork is surprisingly efficient and as said, the acting is everything you could wish for with humour aplenty. Everything is delivered with energy and I find it quite satisfying. Sure, the script is thin but if you like this kind of mix of setting, humour and delivery you are in for a good time.

Yes, please, you can praise Madeline Kahn all the day long, as far as I'm concerned; she was a gargantuan talent and I still weep for her loss. But they are all 2-dimensional characters in Clue. They are uniformly uninteresting and unsympathetic. They are terse and suspicious and rude to each other from the start, and not in the amusing way that I'm sure was the author's intent. And the sources of their supposed funniness—Leslie Ann Warren's seeming turpitude, Christopher Lloyd's repugnant lechery, Martin Mull's ... military buffoonery, I guess?— none of them are inherently funny; it would take a skilled satirist to make them work, and Johnathan Lynn seems to me *singularly* unskilled. I am personally, unconsolably affronted by this unpleasant little man having tarnished my otherwise pristine love for Ms. Kahn, Mr. Mull, Michael McKean, and—most fiendishly ill-used—Eileen Brennan.Lynn's script is not sharp; it's pointy-headed.

Clue is the exception, and it is exceptional. Everyone knows the story, whether they actually know how to play the game or not. Six strangers -- Prof. Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull, of TV's Sabrina...), Mr. Green (Spinal Tap's Mike McKean), and the rest of the usual suspects -- are called to the hill-top mansion of the strange and sinister Mr. Boddy.Set against the treacherous backdrop of the Cold War, each of the six has some deep dark secret, and Mr. Boddy has the means to expose them all. But who is Mr. Boddy, and what does he want? There isn't long to ponder such things, as before too long, one of the guests has killed Mr. Boddy and put a stop to his deadly blackmail scheme. But who? Led through it all by Mr. Boddy's faithful butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry), the group must uncover the murderer's identity before the police arrive, and before they can strike again! Loaded to the brim with clichés, Clue is over-the-top fun. Director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny, Sgt. Bilko) does a good job with a talented cast. But really, this is Tim Curry's movie and he is absolutely brilliant in it. While many films suffer from a poor endings, Clue has endings flying out the wazoo. It is the first (only?) movie to ever show a different ending depending on which theater you attended, and what night you saw it on. All three work well (though one is clearly best), and you can choose to watch each consecutively on the DVD.OVERALL SCORE: 8.9/10 = AQuotable and infectiously fun, you can't not have a good time watching this movie.

When the man is confronted by evidence from the butler, he turns out the lights hoping that the people will kill the butler and carry on business as usual. But when the lights are turned back on, the man is dead. The group (including the butler) go to the kitchen and discover that the cook is dead also. They return to the study where they then discover the dead man is not actually dead at all - he's got up and moved. One of the women goes to the bathroom and finds the undead man in the bathroom - dead! So who was it? Was it: Wadsworth (the butler), Mrs Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mrs White, Col. Mustard, Prof. Plum or Mr Green? In a similar way to 'Murder By Death' the film thrives on comedy and confusion and, although you may find it confusing at times, everything makes sense when compiled at the end as it leads towards (on the DVD) one of three surprise endings. 'Clue' is funny from start to finish with some gags I can honestly say I didn't see coming. But this film would not have been as good were it not for the 3 C's: comedy, confusion and Curry.Tim Curry was excellent in his role as Wadsworth the butler, stealing the show from all of the others with charisma which is present in all of his roles. The other actors were brilliant as well, just adding to the quality of an already great film. I preferred this to the aforementioned 'Murder By Death' and I think the reason was the comedy - I found 'Clue' more amusing than 'Murder By Death' though both are really good films.I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, definitely worth the money.

I wish I could go higher than 10 out of 10, because thats how good the movie is, literally in my top 5 favorites. I love how Johnathan Lynn wrote it, not using basic old slapstick comedy, and using original fresh comedy. It is very underrated and I absolutely love the film, and like i said, could watch it over and over again. i highly recommend it, 10/10.",Clue

The scary part is that whenever its on TV no matter what point in the movie, i can start quoting lines by heart! LOL!This is based on the extreamly popular Parker Brothers Board game of the same name featuring an extreamly talented All Star Cast as the notorious characters. The best part about this movie is that its half serious while being extreamly funny with dry wit and dry humor all the while people are droping like flies. but this is what makes it work.The plot is Clue is set on the backdrop of the J Edgar hoover/Mcarthy era. The famous 6 characters get invitations for a dinner parter all concering black mail matters from the infamous Mr. Boddy. They all introduce each other,then discuss the blackmail matters then this is when things get interesting. its just something about the talented cast,the terrific direction from Jonathan Lynn and one of the best scenes is the late Madaline Khan Talking about how much she hated Yvette the maid :) A must See.

Based on the board game Clue (Cluedo in Australia and Europe) the story tells of six people being summoned to an American Gothic mansion for an evening of revealed secrets and murder. While the script has some hilarious lines (""Life after death is as improbable as sex after marriage"") the core of the film is in the casting. Eileen Brennan is excellent as the disapproving, addle-brained Mrs Peacock, Christopher Lloyd inspiredly cast as the sex-mad Professor Plum, Madeleine Kahn is gorgeously mysterious Mrs White and Colleen Camp is pure delight as the sexy maid Yvette whom all the male guests leer after.

Wadsworth, the butler, greets them as they arrive, Yette, the maid, serves them champagne, Mrs. Ho cooks the dinner, and it's soon apparent that everything is not as it seems. Everyone has a story, a secret, and a motive. The end result? Murder! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS There are three alternate endings for the film - the third being the best, in my opinion. On close inspection, it seems to be the one originally intended, as all the story lines are tied up. Try all three - each have very funny bits, even the weakest of them - ""Mrs. Peacock was A MAN?!""

The ensemble cast is very good. The three endings are certainly stupid and Howard Hessman is awful in his minor role. The dialog is quite funny the story is lame, but it is a better than average movie thanks largely to Tim Curry's brilliant performance. The transition from board game to movie is shaky and I hope they never do it again. Monopoly the Movie not a good idea.

218,powderblue,Classic comedy,10,24 May 2007,"Directed by Jonathan Lynn, CLUE is based on the board game of the same name ( called Cluedo here in the U.K ). An assortment of guests arrive for a dinner party, each given a pseudonym, and it soon becomes apparent that they are there on matters a bit more serious than a simple dinner and a brandy. During the evening, secrets are revealed, people are murdered, lights go on and off and the lines come thick and fast "" well it's a matter of life after death. Now that he's dead i have a life."" The cast are clearly having a complete riot with Tim Curry, Eileen Brennan and the late, great Madeline Kahn coming off with particular sparks. The look of the film is wonderful. Set in 1954, the attention to detail in the set design and costumes are spot-on. The lighting and feel is not too dis-similar to the 1976 murder-spoof Murder by Death, incidentally also starring Eileen Brennan. Despite being a minor hit on it's initial theatrical release Clue has since become something of a cult hit, and for good reason, as its great fun and whilst certain plot-holes may have you scratching your head, it's best that you leave your brain at the door and enjoy it for what it is. Great fun. The home-DVD/video version comes with all three endings. A fourth was filmed but edited out of the final film. Stills from it can be found in a hard to find book "" Clue: The Storybook"".

221,stejujo,Communism is just a red herring....,10,3 July 2007,"What a great movie! Clue is one of my favorite movies, and the board game is my favorite game. This film is great to watch on a stormy afternoon or night, which would fit right in with the movie, and even give it a scarier feel. The filmmakers did go a little bit far from the board game, but it was probably to make the plot better, and to make more sense. In the movie, Mrs. White was a guest, but in the game, she was the maid. Tim Curry is a riot as Wadsworth, the butler, but really Mr. Boddy. He looked hilarious when he was imitating Mrs. Peacock's screaming about the supposedly poisoned brandy. Professor Plum was funny when he kept trying to get Miss Scarlet's attention, even though she became annoyed. My favorite part is when Mrs. White, Col. Mustard, and Mrs. Peacock are making out with the corpses of Mr. Boddy and the cook, playing to ""Sh-boom."" All in all, this movie is a masterpiece, and perfect for family viewing on Halloween or a stormy night, but is also perfect to watch any day.

The pace is breakneck, there are gags aplenty and the score is totally spot on.  What I believe make this film so great is the fact that very few people have actually seen it - there's no hype or pretension about this film whatsoever, it's just a switch-your-brain-off-and-enjoy-it type of film.Excellent fayre for a Friday night in with a curry and a couple of vodkas.",Clue
223,Dmagic5000,One of the best comedies of all time!,9,13 September 2007,"in 1985 ""Clue"" the movie, which was based on the game by Parker Brothers, was released. I happened to fall upon it about 5 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. Since then I have seen it many times and it is now one of my favourite movies.It's 1955, and a Butler, a Maid, and 6 guests, are invited to Hill House where they quickly get involved in 6 murders! We are introduced to Wadsworth (Tim Curry) the butler who arrives first and Yvette (Colleen Camp) the French maid. Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull) arrives next followed by Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael Mckean), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), and Ms. Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren). At the mansion they are all introduced to Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving) who they discover has been blackmailing them all. In order to keep things quiet Mr. Boddy gives each guest a lethal weapon; the lethal weapons are of course, the revolver (to Professor Plum), the lead pipe (to Mr. Green), the rope (to Mrs White), the knife (to Mrs Peacock), the Candle Stick (to Ms. Scarlet.), and the Wrench (to Colonel Mustard). He states that if they expose him to the police they will also be exposed and humiliated. When Mr. Boddy suddenly dies after being shot the group suddenly finds themselves tangled up in a web of lies, murder and hilarity as they try to find out who did it. . Clue has everything a good movie needs. It has all kinds of comedy, from slapstick to just plain funny statements. It has an intriguing mystery, with many twists and turns along the way. Tim Curry is amazing as always, Christopher Lloyd gives a solid performance as Professor Plum who lost his licence for doing the thing that male doctors aren't allowed to do with their female patients. Martin Mull, who some may recognize from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, also gives a solid performance. The acting in fact is solid all around; everyone in the cast gives a great performance.At the end of the movie they show three alternate endings each one more insane and hilarious then the other; even though some endings may not make sense or may even seem impossible it is still great because it is so insane and funny.Fans of the board game will definitely like the movie. The movie certainly has the feel of the game and the house even looks like the board. They of course did not forget the secret passageways. They do come up and later have a very big impact on the plot. Fans of Tim Curry will no doubt enjoy the movie because Tim Curry is, well Tim Curry! When all the murders have been committed he states, ""Alright, I know who did it,"" and then immediately does a whole recap of the entire movie starting from when Colonel Mustard first arrives, all the way to the point where he reveals who the murderer is. This clearly is the best scene in the whole movie because Tim Curry shows just how brilliant he is, he explains what happened, how it happened, all in about 5 breaths and while acting it all out. This scene alone will make anyone who isn't a Tim Curry fan into a Tim Curry fan; this scene illustrates perfectly why he is so respected.So this weekend, go out and rent Clue because with extremely solid performances and a great story and intriguing mystery, Clue rates at 9/10 and is clearly an 80's classic.",Clue
224,DomCom1957,Flames on the side of my face!,8,27 October 2005,"Clue as we all know is one of the most famous board games ever created. So when it came time to finally do a screen version of it, they decided to make it a comedy/mystery. Half screwball comedy and half spoof. When released in 1985 it was met with mixed reviews and a mild box office. I went to see it three times just to see all of the different endings. I was young and also in love with Madeline Kahn. Director Jonathan Lynn got a great cast of comedy actors for this film. Tim Curry as the Butler and Colleen Camp as the maid are not in the board game but are a great to have aboard. The famous characters are fleshed out by these comedy greats. Martin MUll as Colonel Mustard, Christopher Lloyd as Proferssor Plum, Michael McKean as Mr. Greene, Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Peacock, Lesley-Ann Warren as Miss Scarlett and Madeline Kahn as Mrs. White. The lines are fast and funny and though it is very silly, it is most enjoyable. It stands the test of time along side of the comedies of the 80's. In fact 20 years after its release people on this site love and cherish the film. They keep saying it may get remade, that may or not be true. If they do another version of Clue the script would be far from this one. I am sure it would be more of a thriller mystery with comedy in it. Madeline Kahn steals the film as always she has some of the funniest lines I ever heard. They should re-release it on DVD for a 20th anniversary but haven't so far. Maybe for its 25th anniversary they will gives us deleted scenes and outtakes. They must have plenty from this movie.

Sure it has a bit of mystery in there but that really takes a backseat as this is mainly a comedy.  I rated this a nine because it's REALLY funny (if you don't mind a sometimes dry sense of humor) and it has some sentimental value.

All the main characters are well developed and most are hilarious.  Ms White, Ms Scarlet, and Ms Peacock are a hoot. Mr Green is excellent as your typical closeted homosexual.

I don't mean its badly done or a disaster. I mean in the great tradition of British theatre its a farce. Its a Donald McGill postcard. Its pantomime. Its got everything but a priest with his trousers round his ankles and Mr Punch and a Harlequin. Its pure theatre.Once you understand that you'll enjoy this film. If you never understand that you'll never enjoy this film. That might be why they chose Tim Curry to anchor this whole thing. I couldn't imagine anyone else to do it. There are few actors as versatile, as great or as underused as Curry. I mean think about it. What do you most remember him for? As a crazed transvestite in Rocky Horror. As Long John Silver in Muppet Treasure Island and this and he's pure gold in this. Camp, hammy, energetic, mercurial and fun. He is what holds everything together and the rest of the talented cast work around him. Even Christopher Lloyd turns in a subdued performance and allows Curry to run around and sweat and break the fourth wall and do that fabulous cocked eyebrow thing he does. Thats not to say the rest of the ensemble do nothing. Everyone gets some good one liners and everyone contributes. Michael Mckean is especially good as the clumsy Mr Green and Madeline Kahn has never turned in a bad performance.The real trick with this film is you just have to go with it. Its based on a board game, the plot is tissue paper thin. Its barely there,the continuity is all over as well but the energy is faultless and you'll have a few chuckles which sometimes is good enough.Of course you can pick fault with this all day long if you want to.

For me this has stood the test of time - it's setting in the 50's was genius - so I can enjoy it now as I did the first time.I know there will always be people wanting to do their own version and I'll probably see it, but it will never live up to this cast, crew and production.Thankyou so much!!",Clue

The film makers certainly solved that problem by having the three different endings.I enjoyed this film because of its intricacies, all the nooks and crannies that you can find. Also, after I'd seen it a few times, I decided that I would love to have a house built that is exactly like the one in the film.I found the performances to be entirely convincing. The casting was a triumph in itself. I can't say which is my favorite character simply because I like them all at different times. Michael McKean as Mr. Green is my favorite when he's taking the cop for a tour of the house. Tim Curry as Wadsworth is my favorite when he's revealing who did it and how. Each character has his or her own best moment on the screen that makes them memorable.One of the things that I took out of this film when I saw it was the names of the actors. I wanted to find other films that these particular actors had done. I followed most of them as well. I believe that Christopher Lloyd had another triumphant movie in the same year and that was ""Back to the Future"".

Definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (it's up there with ""Airplane!"" and ""Better Off Dead).I've always loved the board game clue, and I think that just the fact that they made a movie out of a game is funny enough, even if the movie sucked- which it doesn't.The acting is good and everything is so well done. I love how they have the different endings too. Of course, the last one, where it turns out they all did it, is the best, but they're all good. I only wish I had been alive when it came out so I could go watch it in the theaters with one surprise ending. I would totally have gone to see it as many times as I had to to get all of the endings, which I guess is probably what they were going for.I think, other than ""Rooster"" in Annie, this is probably the best role Time Curry has ever had, and he really does an awesome job in it.

A satire of the mystery genre, it really pays no respect to the game but is a fun film in and of itself.Christopher Lloyd could've done better as Plum, and Lee Ving (although he has a great name, i. e.

And recognizing Tim Curry as the slimy concierge in ""Home Alone 2"", I think he played the butler admirably.Unfortunately, there are downsides to the movie. One major beef I have with the movie is its political message. The movie obviously makes fun of American patriots concerned about Communism -- the repeated line ""Communism is just a red herring"" was particularly annoying. That kind of shameless politicizing should be kept out of the movies. Another problem was the pace. Overall, it was a bit too fast to follow, and unfortunately while it was fast, there were large parts of the movie that were, quite frankly, boring. Watching panicky people sneak and tear around a house gets quite old after a while, especially without even bad slapstick to spice it up a bit.One thumb up, one thumb down.",Clue

They each have strong, but very different and complimentary personalities, of which the viewer gleans from to investigate the murders, that keep happening. The set is dark, but definitely engaging as it seems that the viewer is literally watching this chaos in a live theater or perhaps engaged in the activity on a personal level.   We get a tour of the mansion, from the ballroom, to the study, library, kitchen, and so on and so forth.  We even get to experience the secret passageways between rooms.

Just how it blends both dark mystery and hilarious comedy together is just classic and golden filming.I'm a large fan of the original Parker Brothers' board game, and I was very enthusiastic to see the film when I learned of it (keep in mind that I wasn't born when it was released). When I finally did see the movie, I wasn't disappointed whatsoever (except that they exchanged the role of the housekeeper Mrs. White into a shadowy widower and replaced her with a butler instead (not really surprised by that one since in most murder cases, either the butler or the maid is the killer).One of my favorite scenes would have to be when the Telegram Girl is shot after the lights in the mansion have gone out. The way that they just end her gingerly voice and pep is hilarious. I also liked when the butler spends almost the last hour or so explaining the deaths of all of the house employees (the several alternate endings were funny, and they only built my suspense greater and greater until the end when the real killer was announced).In the end, ""Clue"" lives up to its board game charm, and takes it to comically new heights.",Clue

He's never turned in a performance that I've disliked. And this movie isn't much different. Spoilers, by the way. This movie is basically about a bunch of people who are trapped in a house with a psychotic killer. Only, they don't quite know who it is. Now just from the premise this sounds like a suspense-filled whodunnit, but I assure you this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen in my life. With it's deliberate datedness and cheese, this film mocks other films like House on Haunted Hill and whatnot, and manages to achieve an absolute zen when it comes to comedy. I fully recommend this film. The only reason why it's 9/10 instead of 10/10 is that the look and tone of the film might turn some people off. It's very far from the modern blockbusters that pave the local outhouse.

Tim Curry and Lesley Ann Warren also performed well. The humor is also excellent; some jokes are very obvious, and others are very subtle (for example, Mr. Green asks Wadsworth if ""the FBI is in the habit of cleaning up after multiple murder"" and Wadsworth answers ""Yes.

Tim Curry is great as Wadsworth the Butler, and his explanation of the events they faced that evening is downright hilarious. Such scenes as the Singing Telegram Girl, the Poisoned Brandy, No Meaning Yes, the Kingdom of Heaven and the Cop's Tour Around The Mansion are classics.This is a great movie, brilliantly produced, acted, directed, mixed with an engaging Whodunnit. Was it the Butler? Or Col. Mustard who recently came into a lot of money? Or Mrs White, who is accused of having already bumped off her husbands? Or the lecherous doctor, Prof. Plum? Could it have been Miss. Scarlett, who runs an escort service? Or maybe it was Mrs. Peacock, the wife of a senator? Or possibly Mr. Green, who would lose his job on security grounds if his secret is unmasked? Or maybe, just maybe, it was the Cook? So Whodunnit?If you are interested in seeing it, I'd recommend the DVD version, as the VHS version (at least the ones I've seen) have been a bit out of sync in a few scenes.I'll just leave you with this comment, ""Is there anyone else in this house?""",Clue

I am going to be the movie man for basementbanter, giving you people reviews of new movies, and recommendations of some of my favorites. I love horror movies so I will be giving you guys a healthy dose of horror recommendations, but I will constantly mix it up and will suggest a few movies a week. While I am a film student don't expect random art-house movies that no one actually gives a sh*t about popping up here. Raiders of the lost Ark, Wolf of Wall Street and The Exorcist are some of my favorite movies, so except guns, girls, laughs and scares from my recommendations. With that being said, I will try and recommend movies not everyone has seen that I think most people will enjoy. Without further ado here is my first recommendation:Clue (1985): You remember that murder mystery board game that you probably used to play with your family back in the day? Yeah they made a movie out of that, and unlike Battleship with Rihanna it wasn't a complete croc of sh*t. In fact it is f**king hysterical. From the slutty maid showing all of the cleavage, to the very clearly closeted homosexual Mr. Green all of the characters impress with quick, funny, razor sharp dialogue.However, the real scene stealer is Tim Curry (of IT and Rocky Horror Picture Show fame) as Wadsworth the butler. He is funny in every single scene he is in especially his frantic speech summing everything up at the end. He is classy, clever and hysterical. It's a comedy with the setting of a classic horror movie, and a mystery like the best thrillers. All while not wasting an opportunity to make a joke.Clue is one of those rare movies that never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. Each time you find yourself laughing at jokes you hadn't noticed before, and new clues that make repeated viewings just as enjoyable as the first. This movie will have you rolling on your ass laughing and trying your hardest to count to 6 (1+1+2+1?).So if you enjoyed comedies like Airplane or Tropic Thunder with clever writing and non-stop jokes from start to finish; or if you just like smiling, happiness, cleavage and having a good time then this is a comedy for you.Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. I will keep the recommendations coming and other movie related articles out daily.",Clue

It also makes me laugh my ass off. :)Every single person I know who has seen 'Clue' loves it! I think it's got something to do with the fact that Tim Curry has all those quick lines at the end and how perverted Plum is throughout with all the women, including Mrs. Peacock at one point!

I can't say enough great things about this forgotten classic. It's great for any audience at any time. Each character is very well developed they show their backstory through dialogue but it doesn't get too complex that it becomes hard to follow.

283,mneely-49598,One of my favourite comedies,10,22 June 2015,It's very difficult (probably impossible) for me to review this movie in any kind of objective way because growing up I loved it so much and watched it so many times I can likely recite the dialogue from start to finish. That being said I will try to discuss the virtues of this movie which seemingly is not popular with critics and did not do well financially when first released. Clue is my favourite board game and I think everyone is familiar with it. Players have to solve the murder of Mr Boddy including who killed him and where and with what (this is also a line of dialogue in the film). In order to sustain a movie the writer/director Jonathan Lynn added several other murders and 3 different endings. The dialogue is very fast paced and incredibly witty. I would suggest watching the movie more than once just to catch all the lines. The acting is excellent all around. Tim Curry is amazing as Wadsworth (the butler); other favourites are Eileen Brennan as Mrs Peacock and the hilarious Madeline Kahn as Mrs White. And just as a murder mystery this works really well too and keeps you guessing. Anyone who enjoys murder mysteries and also black comedy should get a real kick out of this film.,Clue

The all-star cast has a great chemistry (and the most important thing in comedy - timing) as led by Tim Curry.  Some great writing, both dialogues as well as one liners. The mystery will keep you engaged, since you really can't figure out the solution (really.  Go ahead.  Try).  All in all, a thoroughly entertaining film.",Clue

So, I settled back today to have a bit of fun in watching this talented cast ""work over"" the old board game.Tim Curry set the situation up well in the opening sequences.  I found the first half of the film amusing and fun.  However, it did bear an uncanny resemblance to another film, ""Murder by Death"" (that starred Truman Capote).About half way thru the film (45 minutes), I felt it begin to fall apart. The film really got out of hand when Tim Curry began to drag the group thru the house on the ""reenactment tour"".  At that point, the film degenerated completely into a vehicle for Tim Curry to show off his talent for physical comedy.  Which wore thin very quickly in this role.I don't think the ending was done right, and some parts weren't necessary. I think ""Murder by Death"" was a much better vehicle for this plot.  This bombshell cast could have easily carried a well-written script.  I just don't think this was the script.",Clue

Well i went to blockbuster, saw it was there and thought hey- i'll check it out! Im soooooooo glad i did! It is one of the funniest movies of all time. I laughed my head off.That cast is to perfect. Madeline Kahn is great, Tim Curry is hilarious, and Mike McKean is even better than he was in ""This Is Spinal Tap"". Did I mention that Martin Maul is awesome as well. So is the rest of them. Yes there were a few, ok many errors but it was still funny.I think one of the best things is how its good for all ages. There is a little violence and some sexual references but the younger kids wont really get it and it isn't that bad. Yes it may not have been a smash in the box office but i think its awsome.If you ever think of buying it- get it on DVD (if you have a DVD player) Not only does it include all 3 endings (did i mention there were 3 endings) you can watch it like in the theatre so the endings are random and you'll never know which one you get! Pretty neat 'eh?All and all i say this is the 2nd funniest movie of all time (#1 being Monty Python and the Holy Grail)and really worth watchin/renting/buyingHope you go see it!Disco Bob Dude",Clue

It makes an awful form of government but in the case of Clue, makes for an interesting story of murder, corruption and blackmail.  Who would have thought Communism could be so funny?The film, which features an impressive array of comedic talent (Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Michael McKean, and the late Madeline Kahn) does not seem too ""dark"" despite the fact that its plot foundation is murder.The actors are incredible at bringing their characters to life, and the experience of the film leads to a new depth when playing the classic Parker Brothers game of the same name. The ending(s) are the best part.  Since each game of Clue ends differently, I find it quite clever that the brains behind Clue decided to release the film in theaters with separate endings.  And, as an added bonus, if you invest in the D.V.D, you are given the option of viewing the movie with all three endings or with one ending taken from the disk at random.For fans of the game or fans of any of the aforementioned comedic stars, Clue is a sure-bet for a good time.",Clue

First of all, the whole Yvette-cleavage thing is hilarious. Then towards the end, when Wadsworth/Mr. Boddy is doing his whole ""explanation"" thing, I could not stop laughing. Especially when he mentions the cook, and everyone runs to the kitchen, and he runs through the secret passage into the meat cooler. Everybody is like, ""Where did he go?"" and then he falls out of the meat cooler exactly like the cook did at the beginning of the movie. Then, back in the study, he turns off the lights to recreate the scene in the beginning. Mrs. Peacock turns the lights back on and he's on the floor exactly like Mr. Boddy/the real butler. Everybody gasps, and then he hops up and says, ""Mr. Boddy was lying here, and everybody thought he was dead."" Those two parts had me laughging so hard I couldn't breathe!

While it only grossed a little less than $15 million when it debuted in 1985, it supposedly has become a hit in video sales and rentals. Based on the popular board game of the same name, Clue has a bright ensemble cast. The three main actresses are especially wonderful: Brennan for her overtly anxious Mrs. Peacock, Kahn for her delightfully tragic Mrs. White, and Warren for her sassy and sexy portrayal of Miss Scarlet. Curry also comes off well as the butler, Wadsworth, as does Martin Mull as the dumb-as-he-looks Colonel Mustard. The three endings is a bit much, but all three are good fun. The jokes are always flying, often subtly. The only disappointment I have is that the DVD has only the barest essentials, although the picture and sound is greatly improved. Deleted scenes and commentary would have been exceptional. 4.9 out of 5 stars",Clue

A great comedy that still makes me laugh. Too early in 1985 to be appreciated, Clue's status as a cult favorite is due partly to its VHS success. Arriving to VHS when VCRs were somewhat new, hit movies commanded retail prices of $75 and above. Even if you did afford a VCR back then (ours was large, metal and weighed about 40 pounds) acquiring movies was difficult for the family budget. Since Clue performed poorly at the box office it was sold on VHS for $20 and I still have that copy plus a DVD copy I got for $5 a few years ago. Everyone seemed to have a copy of Clue on VHS because they could afford it. I wonder how much money it made on video since its release?",Clue

Every line in the film is a classic, and the actors give the performances of their lifetimes. Curry, Brennan and Kahn are exceptional in their roles of Wadsworth, Mrs. Peacock, and Mrs. White, respectively. Lynn's direction is lively and the pacing of the film is wonderfully taught.

The plot line was so well-developed and intriguing, which is not something I expected to be derived from a kid's board game! I loved how they included the humorous aspects of the film (sexual gags, slapstick comedy) because they allowed for some release of tension from the more serious ones (suicide, extortion, blackmail). The fact that the filmmakers were able to accommodate the two different types of subject matter is truly outstanding. I have to admit, this is one of those movies that you have to watch 3 or 4 times to understand what is going on. Fortunately, you can watch this movie over and over again and it never gets old!

The subtle and sometimes slapstick comedy proves that even if there is a somewhat tacky script (hang on I'm not bagging it) if it is delivered by an incredibly talented group of actors, it can truly hit the spot.

My cousins and I used to rent it multiple times a year when we were kids and I bought a copy on video in high school. I college, I would often put it on as I went to sleep at night. I now have it on DVD, and probably watch it every couple of months. I estimate I have probably seen Clue over 150 times, and I never get tired of it. All the puns, the sight gags and the over-the-top performances somehow get better with age. I seemingly always find some small detail I hadn't noticed before, even after hundreds of viewings, that enhances my enjoyment of this movie. Not only is this one of the all-time great ensemble casts for a comedy, but all of the actors hit their roles out of the park. Tim Curry's turn as Wadsworth is easily one of his best roles ever, Christopher Lloyd is the perfect sleazeball doctor... Martin Mull's endearingly moronic Col. Mustard, Madeline Kahn's fantastic take on the ""black widow""... every major character in this movie is played perfectly. They've all got secrets, they're all horrible people, and yet the viewer can't help but be intrigued by and even grow to like them. The quips, wordplay and one-liners are executed by this perfect cast so well that all of this movie's inherent flaws (there's really not much of a plot, Lee Ving as Mr. Boddy is pretty forgettable, some details of the multiple endings don't make sense, etc.) are easily forgiven if only because the movie as a whole is just so much fun. All in all, even though the math may not seem right, the whole package adds up to my favorite movie ever. I can't wait to watch it with my kids someday.",Clue
310,tfrizz7,Clue=Brilliance,9,17 January 2005,"""Clue"" is perhaps one of the finest comedies ever produced. I say produced, because if any of the aspects of this movie had been different, it would certainly not be as ingenious as it is.The writing is well-done. The dialogue is sharp and hilarious. The direction is excellent, never once betraying the period and atmosphere, which most '80's period pieces did. The acting is superb- as each and every actor delivers a pitch-perfect and well-crafted performance. Without the above, ""Clue"" would have become another forgotten comedy. As it turns out, ""Clue"" is now more popular today than it was upon release. The only explanation I can think of that it was not more successful is that Hollywood does not tend to back movies that do not have HUGE stars in them as fiercely as they do the summer blockbusters and star-couplings (which does not actually make full sense). Eileen Brennan's 'Mrs. Peacock' is flawless, as is Madeline Kahn's 'Ms. White,' Tim Curry's 'Wadsworth' and Michael McKean's 'Mr. Green.' If Hollywood made more movies with ensembles as competent across the board as this ( a la Eastwood with ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""), cinema would be a lot more satisfying.",Clue

This movie is so ridiculously silly and over-the-top that the hammy acting and the sometimes easy-to-miss jokes are all part of the fun instead of a detriment.When I finished watching, I couldn't believe that it was from the '80s. Not to say I look down at old movies, but...my impression of the movie, and the way that the sets, cinematography, and actors looked, had me convinced it was at least around the 2000s.

My family of ten--from parents to teenagers to young children love it. Of course we have all played the game, but the movie is far more fun. Each character is so uniquely interesting and the dialog is wonderful. The choreography that goes with the witty lines works so well. Madeline Kahn is my favorite especially when she is trying to describe the sound in her head at the end of the show. We all love the counting scene when they are trying to decide if the gun still has a bullet in it. The make-out scene is hilarious (the one person with the corpse).

315,mattnazz123,BEST movie in the comedic world,10,29 August 2005,"THIS movie is by far, the funniest movie I have ever seen. The comedic timing is definitely something that is so difficult to find in today's comedies. Not to mention, that all actors (with the exception of Lee Ving and the motorist) can be recognized from other movies as ACTORS, not comedians. I echo my friend from the UK that this movie can be watched by die-hards approximately 3-5 times a day. I recently pulled my copy out of the DVD tower and began to watch it after work. It shames the comedies of today, and sets quite a standard common with the works of Mel Brooks. The witty humor and one-liner's truly are quick, direct, yet subtle. Amazingly, after watching the movie so many times, I'm astonished how many goof's I've been missing. I found a few minor continuity goof's in addition to those listed, including the continuity of Mrs. Peacock's reaction upon being slapped from one shot to another (completely different positioning). I recommend this movie to any person who has the ability to throw and catch subtle sarcasm and hidden jokes on a daily basis. I started watching the movie 12 years ago, and to this day, I find something new and funny every time I watch it again. RENT, BUY OR BORROW CLUE THE MOVIE!

Of course, Tim Curry is a stand out, but he always steals the show no matter what, but the whole cast did an amazing job. They play off each other and it feels natural. The deadpan delivery of the lines, the physical comedy, The expressions, the dirty jokes, the wit and the energy. The set is amazing and designed to be exactly like the game board.

333,LeyaJoel,Surprisingly good,8,10 May 2021,"Before watching, I didn't think it was going to be anything other than another (failed) attempt at a game adaptation - predictable, badly acted and very liberal with its source material. And then it's Clue of all things, which really isn't all that ""complex"" to begin with.But then I watched it, and it was great.The setting is pretty similar to that of the board game and isn't really all that exciting in and of itself. Six guests arrive at a mansion, each greeted by the butler, Wadsworth, with an alias straight from the game, then a murder happens and now they have to solve it before the police arrives. From here the plot gets a little more interesting with the introduction of blackmail. Each character has been blackmailed by a mysterious person and at the start of the night they are given the option to tell the police everything. If doing so, the blackmailer, a Mr. Boddy, goes to prison, while all of their secrets come to light and so the consequences would be devastating. Of course, it should be obvious that each character now has a good reason to murder Mr. Boddy, who does indeed drop to the floor when the lights turn off (who'd have thunk it).It's what happens during the rest of the film that makes this story outright ridiculous and, consequently, far more entertaining than the premise initially allows. The group runs around the mansion with a zany intensity, each member trying not to get killed as well as keeping the police oblivious before they know whodunit. They end up frantically searching the mansion for a potentially unknown killer, while also suspecting the other members to be the murderer. A lot of the comedy in this film parallels the more serious detective and crime stories, where death could be lurking at every corner. This contrast emphasizes just how silly these scary situations can look like. It's terrifying to be stuck in a house with a murderer and searching every room by splitting up with another member (who could very easily be said murderer), especially if you have to go up into a very dark, creaking attic.However, it's not very scary when you're watching characters be so paranoid they try to get a jump on the murderer or put themselves in easily avoidable, barmy situations. In one case, two members worm their way up a narrow staircase while squashed against each other, because none of them wants go first; in another case, one member panics in a small, dark room, searching for a door handle only to discover the room is actually a shower when mistakenly turning the faucet.And the insanity that is Jim Curry really completes the story. Playing Wadsworth he makes a complete detour with what you'd normally expect from a butler-type. While he starts as a calm, stoic, authoritative figure, he drastically changes into an odd and eccentric faux-detective. At some point he's even running from room to room yelling back the events of the mystery, giving a hilarious spin to the classic 'detective's reveal', especially as he drags out ALL the events complete with full-on imitations and line recital from the other characters.Some things are definitely not in the films favour - most of them are minor, but a few are due to some fairly old-fashioned comedic topics. On the first viewing, I personally didn't think too much of it, but I can see how some people might think it's just a little too ""old"". Looking past that, I still think it's a pretty solid comedy, and one I'd gladly rewatch just for the performances alone.",Clue
334,Benedictus13,Excellent Mystery Comedy,9,21 July 2001,"A great murder mystery based on the classic board game.

339,j-web,my all-time FAVORITE movie,10,9 February 2007,"Ever since I saw this film years ago, it instantly became my favorite and it only got better the more I saw it. You know how you can like a movie, but after a while it just gets old and the jokes aren't funny anymore? Well, in my case, I've seen it so many times I have almost all the lines committed to memory - and I never get tired of it.There couldn't be a better cast of characters, although they do appear different than the traditional style of the classic board-game of which this movie was based. Tim Curry, Eileen Brennan, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, to name only a few, are HILARIOUS and play off each other with such wit and fast-paced dialogue there are no slow parts and no time to get bored.",Clue
340,Mister_Maggot,A Death by Laughter,8,26 March 2007,"The butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry), arrives after dark and checks that everything is prepared for the guests who will also soon be arriving. First to show up is Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), as he will be known, one of six people who have been summoned to the mansion by a mysterious letter. The others; Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn) Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd) and Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), who arrive together after a car breakdown, turn up soon enough, but don't appear to know one another. Wadsworth invites them into the dining room, where they settle down for dinner, and the secrets begin to come out - they're all connected in some ways, and one of those ways just happens to be blackmail...Written by the director Jonathan Lynn from a story by him and John Landis, Clue was obviously based on the board game Cluedo, known more basically as Clue in America. The list of films based on board games is a short one, there was a musical of Chess but so far there's no sign of Monopoly: The Movie or Scrabble: The Motion Picture, although I hold out a little hope for an adaptation of Kerplunk. Anyway, true to the game, Clue presents a large mansion with various rooms, the Library, Dining Room, Study, Conservatory, Kitchen, and so on, and six weapons (knife, revolver, rope, lead piping, etc) to match up with the six main characters.Once seated around the dinner table, the guests learn about each other and the fact they are all connected to Washington D.C. in various ways. Then the seventh guest shows up at the house, the none-too-subtly named Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), an obnoxious fellow who they all should know. Retiring to the lounge, they discover that they are all being blackmailed and who should the blackmailer be but Mr. Boddy? He gives them all gift wrapped presents, which when opened are revealed to be potential murder weapons. The lights go out unexpectedly and there is a commotion and when the lights go back on when Mr. Boddy is lying dead on the carpet.This film is outstandingly brilliant with a hint of stage-show comedy. The plot line is a little bland but it makes up for it with a great cast and childish humour. I would give this movie 8/10 mainly for the reason it could improve its storyline for the better.",Clue

342,luana66,The rhythm is fast and the actors are in good form!,9,15 April 2007,"The movie is really interesting. The environment is very realistic (in some moments it seemed to see the castle of Frank 'N'Furter), the rhythm is fast and the actors are in good form. To invent such a nice intrigue founding only itself on a game surely is not easy. Instead the gags are exhilarating and unbelievable. The originality of this movie is in the three endings (the quarter has disappeared with the first husband of Mrs White, the illusionist!) maybe very obvious but genial in their normalcy. The actors, already famous in the 80's, surely promised a fable future. As to forget Madeline Kahn (unfortunately dead of cancer in 1999), 4 nominations to the Golden Globes, wife of the great Mel Brooks, extraordinary in her acting full of irony and of sense of humor, testified by the cult movie ""Young Frankestein."" And as to forget Christhoper Lloyd, winning of 3 Emmy Awards, with that always problematic characters as the extraordinary crazy scientist of ""Back to the Future"". All these great actors reunited in a movie that could not pass unnoticed. But there is another great actor that seems us fundamental to name: Mr. Tm Curry. Practically the whole movie is on his shoulders. He has supported the weight of his acting and that of the others: he has been the pivot of the game, the satellite gone crazy that governed that small universe made of assassins and blackmails. And he has brightly passed the examination. It's amazing to see him to his ease with the actors of that talent: his bravura has surely emerged and his identity has been built definitively. With this movie Tim Curry has still underlined the word ""talent"" already writing in the movie ""RHPS"".",Clue

Clue takes place in the early 50's when the actual game first came out! Is is one of those movies to pop in when it is in fact a dark and stormy night While in the board game Mrs. White is the cook the movie gives more of a fleshed out characterization, Hilariously played by Madeline kaun!! who's husband wasn't a very good illusionist minus his...you knowww! the entire cast is perfectly matched to their characters!

I was so excited to see good OL' Lavern & Shirley's ""Lenny"" in something on the big screen, Michael McKean did a very good job with Mr Green. The ensemble cast did a one of a kind job, I could not imagine anyone else in one of those roles and making this movie better. The innuendo's are perfect.

I'd say it's most like a cross between an elementary school play being put on by modestly paid adults actors with additional satirical social commentary, and a higher class but lower budget version of the Saw series but with slightly less gore and much more politics. It's really a remarkable blend of horror, satire, mystery, and above all, brilliant comedy.

I'm wondering why did people rate it at 7+ is it like a classic that was a hit when it came out then? or may be because people associate it with youth/childhood memories?

The beginning of the story begins slow and exponentially increases til the very end. The speed at which the actors are delivering their lines is staggering at some points, and goes to the technical grace of the actors like Christopher Lloyd and Leslie Ann Warren. Also, the late great Madeline Kahn produces a hilarious Ms. White who shall be remembered as her second greatest role (under Young Frankenstein). I cannot say enough about this movie, the script and its wonderful actors.",Clue
357,aj81096,A personal comedic classic,10,25 July 2013,"This movie is without a doubt one if not my favorite comedy movies. The acting is well done –I especially enjoy the performances of Tim Curry as the butler Wadsworth, Christopher Lloyd (great Scott!) as the humorous and somewhat naughty Professor Plum, Martin Mull as the not so bright Colonel Mustard, and the late Madeline Khan as Mrs. White. What I love most about this movie is they took something which was basically nothing- that being the murder mystery game Clue, and made it a memorable and hilarious comedy. The basic plot is six guests are invited to a dinner party at the house of one Mr. Body. The guests all attend the New England mansion under Aliases. Mr. Green, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Colonel Mustard all attend. At dinner after meeting the butler Wadsworth, the Maid Yvette, and Mr. Body himself the guests learn they are all being blackmailed by Body. After one thing led to another and Body is murdered in the Study. Everyone is suspect as Body had given each guest a weapon. As the night goes on the mystery deepens as more staff such as the cook and others turn up murdered, the discovery of secret passages and the knowledge of what the guests are being blackmailed about do not fail to intrigue the mind. Though for all the mystery (there being three alternate endings) this movie shines in its comedy. The dialogue is banter, banter, and more banter, and I eat it up. Practically every exchange between characters left me either in hysterics or the small chuckle. Needless to say I spent most of my time viewing it laughing. The dialogue ranges from fast talking jokes, double meanings, to even faster talking confusing guests. Wadsworth provides much of the banter and one can see how much the actors are having fun. It is a shame some do not know this film even exists but I am glad every time I meet someone who shares a laugh at phrases such as ""flames on the side of my face"", ""two corpses everything's fine ,"" and the ever favorite"" one plus two plus two plus one"".

The movie puts to use the all star cast, using their skills to paint a tableau of characters deeply disturbed, yet perfectly matched to teach a message subtly, steering away from didactic ism. In its effective combination of satire, social issues of the time, nutty characters and an outrageous setting, a brilliant message shines through.

371,wazzup550,Clue: The Movie,8,12 March 2006,"Very very very funny, but kinda pointless. I like the ending when all of them kill someone except for Mr. Green. My favorite character is Pro. Plum. It's an awesome movie for all mystery lovers who like humor, cause thats what i am and the movie was great. But Mrs. White does not look like Mrs. White, and Mrs. Scarlet does not look like Mrs. Scarlet. They all look very different from the books and the game. I don't know if you would want to own the movie, but i rented from Blockbuster and so maybe you would want to do that too. There are three alternate endings just to let you know and its kinda confusing too. If you watch this movie and don't like it, then you have problems, no offense.",Clue
