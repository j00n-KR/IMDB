0,claudio_carvalho,Surprisingly a Great Horror Film,8,24 June 2018,"When the aunt of Pauline (Mylène Farmer) dies, she inherits the lonely house in the countryside and travels with her two teenage daughters to the place. While driving to the house, her daughter and aspirant writer of horror genre Beth (Emilia Jones) reads her last novel to her mother and the rebel Vera (Taylor Hickson) criticizes her sister, and a candy truck driver overtakes their car. When they stop at a convenience store in a gas station, Beth learns that the police is hunting down criminals that kill the parents and abuse their daughters. They arrive at the house that looks like an old bazar with many dolls. Vera does not close the front door and soon they are assaulted by driver and a fat man that were in the candy truck. Years later, Beth is a famous writer married with a baby boy and has just released a novel about their attack. Out of the blue, she receives a phone call from Vera asking for help and she leaves her husband and son to visit her mother and her sister. Soon she learns that weird and mysterious things are happening in the old house. What could it be?""Ghostland"" is one of the best horror films recently released. Despite the title, it is not a ghost story but a dramatic, violent, melancholic and highly disturbing horror film with many unexpected plot points. While watching the film, the viewer sees scenes that seem to be plot holes, like for example, why Pauline stays with Vera in a house with so bad recollections. Or why Beth did not send Vera to a clinic for recovering her trauma since she can afford as a famous novelist. But there are explanations for every apparently flaws with surprising twists. Taylor Hickson was facially disfigured while shooting a scene for the film and received seventy (70) stitches on her face and is scarred. She is suing the film´s production company. Hoping this talented actress can recover her beautiful young face is the wish of every fan of cinema and the end of this simple review. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Incident in a Ghostland
1,nogodnomasters,I like to write stories,7,10 September 2018,"When Aunt Clarissa passes, she wills her home to Colleen (Mylène Farmer) and her two polar opposite daughters. Beth (Crystal Reed/Emilia Jones) likes to write horror stories and read HP Lovecraft. Mom encourages her and she is clearly the favorite. Vera (Anastasia Phillips /Taylor Hickson) rebels against everything. On the way there, they discover there is a family serial killer in the area. Not hard to figure out the next scene. Years later Beth is a successful writer and returns to the home to visit her mother and Vera, who relives the event over and over. A wicked twist comes at about 50 minutes into the film. Interesting writing. Guide: F-word. Off screen rape. nudity (Anastasia Phillips )",Incident in a Ghostland
2,kosmasp,How to get by,9,22 December 2018,"I did not read about the - well let's call them difficulties the movie had while filming it. Especially the main actress had quite some stuff she had to go through (no pun intended, you'll understand if or when you read about the ""real"" incident during filming a stunt for the movie). Now with that not in mind, I really could enjoy the movie.I do get it, if you know about this beforehand, that it might influence your viewing of the movie. It might feel like the movie should not have been made, you might have certain feelings against the director too. Whatever the case, if you do have to read about those before watching the movie, try to seperate what happened with what you are watching. I know it won't be easy, but you'll likely won't be able to enjoy the thrill ride otherwise ... and it's quite something! The story is really good, not matter what you know or what you guess about it while you watch it ...",Incident in a Ghostland
3,Woodyanders,A horror film that means business,8,8 July 2020,"Pauline (superbly played by Mylene Farmer) and her two teenage daughters survive a home invasion attack by two vicious psychos. 16 years later the trio are all forced to confront the long-term trauma wrought by said attack. Moreover, things are not really what they seem.Writer/director Pascal Laugier relates the tricky and involving story at a steady pace, ably crafts a supremely creepy gloom-doom mood, takes time to develop the characters, astutely pegs the severe lasting emotional and psychological damage beget by being exposed to savage violence as well as makes a poignant point about the need to get go, and tosses in a few neat twists and turns. Crystal Reed as the resilient Beth and Anastasia Phillips as the vulnerable Vera both do sterling work in their demanding roles. Rob Archer makes a strong and terrifying impression as a monstrous obese wacko. Kevin Power is likewise quite chilling as an equally scary and unhinged lady nutcase. Best of all, all the terrible events that occur within this film fall into the unsettling category of stuff that could actually happen, which in turn gives this picture an extra potent and unsettling punch. A superior fright film.",Incident in a Ghostland
4,paul_haakonsen,This was an amazing surprise of a horror movie...,8,14 August 2020,"I hadn't heard about this 2018 horror movie titled ""Incident in a Ghostland"" or ""Ghostland"" before now in 2020, when I happened to get a chance to sit down and watch it. And with it being a horror movie, of course I managed to find the time to sit down to watch it.First of all I must say that writer and director Pascal Laugier really had something amazing here, because this was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Sure, it was a disturbing movie as well, but it was genuinely great entertainment in terms of it being a horror movie.The storyline was very, very well-constructed and written by Pascal Laugier, and equally so brought to life on the screen. And the skipping between reality and the imaginary world was just a stroke of brilliance. And that was something that really added a very dynamic and realistic layer to the movie. I definitely enjoyed that quite a lot.And the movie had some really good acting performances by Emilia Jones (playing Young Beth), Crystal Reed (playing adult Beth), Taylor Hickson (playing young Vera) and Anastasia Phillips (playing adult Vera). These actresses really carried the movie phenomenally.There is a good amount of suspense and dread throughout the course of the movie. And that was something that most certainly spruced up the overall enjoyment of the movie. Not to mention the pacing of the storyline, which was a great continuous flow without any dull moments.It was interesting to have H. P. Lovecraft as part of the storyline, just a darned shame that the actor, Paul Titley, who portrayed Lovecraft looked absolutely nothing alike the writer, not even remotely. That was just a bit annoying actually.Much can be said for the tormentors of the girls. The big fella was a bit stereotypical, I mean there was just a little bit too much of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Wrong Turn"" going on there. The other tormentor, the ""woman"" though, was actually a nice touch to the movie.And of course something should be said about the house and the atmosphere of the sets and settings. I loved that, there was a very unique feel to the house, its décor and the way it was built. There was a lot of character to the house and the environment, which really enriched the overall movie in a great way.I must say that I was more than genuinely entertained from start to end by the storyline and the events in this movie, and it has been some time since last there was a proper horror movie with this much entertainment value to it.My rating of ""Incident in a Ghostland"" is an eight out of ten stars. If you enjoy horror movies, and if you haven't already had the pleasure of sitting down to watch Pascal Laugier's movie, then you should do so if you get the chance. It is well-worth the time, money and effort.",Incident in a Ghostland

Returns to the home where her mother and sister was viciously terrorized and attacked. Her sister (Anastasia Phillips) is still living in the home...but as a captive of her own fear.

6,trashgang,dark psychological flick from the Martyr director,8,22 August 2020,"Without saying anything my best friend gave me this flick, saying nothing so I went in blind. Not attracted to the cover I still didn't know what to expect only seeing the warning 18+.When I saw Crystal Reed as lead I thought, okay, i new her as a kid from Teen Wolf and I have seen her in the lead of the underrated Swamp Thing series so that's okay.Once the home invasion starts this flick turns into a psychological, brutal and dark movie with a lot of twist. Brutal due the fact the what is happenng with the kids, dark movie, because this isn't going to be for everybody. So it made me think, this isn't a US release and at the end credits it came clear, the director of the French movie Martyrs.It isn't a Martyrs but still it do has a bit of the same feeling, nothing is really explained, in your face horror. Did I like it, yes I did, and from now on I surely will follow Crystal.A nice surprise but to be honest, 3 years old never seen anything about it on specialized sites or mags, weird as is the movie.Gore 1/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 0/5",Incident in a Ghostland
7,Edvis-1997,The best what I've seen this year,8,27 March 2018,The movie wasn't typical horror film with serial killer that kills many victims. This film was more psychology and mysterious which was very good. I didn't expect that the main actor of the movie is living in a dream I thought that was her regular life when I saw all of that was only dream I was shocked. This film totally deserves allot of respect. I really enjoyed listening to that song about teddy bears that was hilarious. So don't be afraid this movie really worth your attention and will attract your attention from the first minutes.,Incident in a Ghostland
8,CuriosityKilledShawn,Nonsense in a title,4,2 July 2020,"It seems that Pascal Laugier may be a one-trick-pony, as this movie doesn't differ too much from his brutal 2008 shocker Martyrs (which itself veered-off into a cryptic, nonsense ending). The story has two sulky teenagers and their mother (played by Mylene Farmer, of all people) move into their aunt's old house after her passing. Exactly why they're moving out into the middle of nowhere (is this the ghostland in question?) and MUST live in this archaic funhouse of nightmare dolls and puppets is never made clear, though there seems to be some sort of vague rumor circulating among the other townsfolk.When the ""ice-cream truck killers"" (or whatever they are) invade their new creepy home it seems that we're in for a bloody home invasion flick, but then it switches to alternate timelines and universes, which would be interesting if Pascal Laugier knew to use it effectively. Sadly, it just feels like pretentious padding. If you're a fan of 2002-era trash horror flicks you are sure to enjoy the endless stingers, stingers, stingers, yet more effing stingers. You'll end up with anxiety at the overuse of this frustrating and lazy technique, which is so far overused in general, nevermind in just this movie, that after a while you'll begin to question if they are attempting to make this movie a lampoon of the tired genre.Make-up effects range from laughable, to somewhat unique and disturbing. Far too much of the blood is CGI and it looks terrible. Some of the acting is just downright awful too. It's shot in Canada, doubling as Illinois, and there's a cold, empty look to the photography. The score can be quite atmospheric in places but it is overall a forgettable effort.The movie is notable for the horrible accident on-set in which Taylor Hickson had her face almost sliced off her skull when she fell through a candy-glass window. She was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery and eventually sued the production company for damages. She may regret the permanent damage to her face for such a trashy movie but...honestly...I think it makes her look really cool now. She's got a defining, stand-out look to her and she could take full advantage of that.I wanted this to be a nice, little atmospheric chiller and what I got something that would have been lazy and dated over fifteen years ago. You might say I was...disenchanted.(Thank you, I'm here all week)",Incident in a Ghostland
9,TheMovieDiorama,Incident in a Ghostland swiftly shows cracks within its porcelain psychological shell.,5,3 September 2019,"Well, that was frustrating. Y'know when you sit down, watch a film, become absorbed by the world it lures you into, only to ascertain that precious time has been wasted for such a convoluted story that really didn't need to be. Yeah, that. Well I've got the perfect example here! A family inherit a creaky house, but whilst moving in are confronted by a gang of murderers which alters the lives of the daughters forever.Yet again, another film commencing with a Lovecraft quote, mistaking labyrinthine horror for surrealism. Ghostland, for all its slashing wholesomeness, is a horror of two halves. The dreadful reality-bending psychologically draining first half that was abhorrently misdirected by Laugier, rushed with such extremities and thematically empty. And of course the second half, a taut home invasion slasher that stylistically ramps up tension by intently focusing on the mental deterioration of its antagonists (whom I have named ""Man Child"" and ""Weird Mom""), whilst maintaining the desperation for escape.The issue that segregates these two halves? A certain plot reveal that is absolutely so unnecessary, that it yields no literary substance whatsoever. In fact, its purpose is just to convolute a plot that needs no convolution. The route Laugier chooses doesn't explore the human psyche, nor does it embellish imagination. Just a carbon copy of an infamous plot detail found in an incredibly popular 90s thriller (I shan't name it...), for the sake of extending the film's runtime. If Laugier removed this infuriating corkscrew, the narrative would've be more engaging without a doubt. Urgh.It's a dire shame considering the decent performances, exquisite production design and gloriously enticing second half that had me shouting ""Flee my daughters! Devour his neck!!"". The absence of backstory for the murderous Weird Mom and the juvenile doll-fondling Man Child did leave a gaping hole narratively speaking, however the plot is told through Beth's perspective so made sense to maintain a minuscule amount of mysticism. There were a handful of jump scares that were obnoxiously predictable and piercingly loud, to which its inclusion was solely to forcibly quantify its horror tropes. Yet the uneasy strange behaviour of its murderers, most notably the inhaling of certain private areas found on dolls and the tantalising oddities that surround the silent but deadly Weird Mom, actually created enough tension and dread to momentarily captivate.However the unfortunate first half believing to be an ingenious use of escapism, tainted the film's entirety by rendering it obsolete. If only Laugier chose the simplistic path, we may have had ourselves a decent straightforward slasher. Shame.",Incident in a Ghostland
10,Tweetienator,Intense,7,15 June 2018,"Well photographed and very good acting (compared to the average horror movie acting). What you get are some crazies torturing a family, in this sense this movie belongs to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 1.000 Corpses etc. ""type"".
Amidst all those bad and mediocre flicks published under the label ""horror"", this is imo a jewel and it got some real horror - not one of those movies where the crowd just cheers if some unlucky kid gets killed, because, you know, the kid is just too dumb to bear any longer ;) Good, with some intense and strong scenes..",Incident in a Ghostland
11,Fella_shibby,"A grim n intense psychological home invasion thriller filled with jump scares, tension n a twist but a lil unpleasant at times but better than Martyrs n Tall Man.",8,15 July 2018,"A single mother with her two teen daughters are on their way to relocate into an inherited house. On the way they see a big truck a la Jeepers Creepers, to which the elder daughter shows the middle finger. While they r at a rest stop, the same truck is parked nearby. The younger one notices an article from the newspaper about a serial killer murdering parents n sparing daughters.Because of the ominous newspaper story n the sinister truck, we come to know something bad is about to happen but the moment they land in the house they r invaded by a witch and an ogre.All this happens in the first 12 mins and to reveal more would be spoiling the film.This film has its twists and turns, solid tension, lots of jump scares, good direction n cinematography.I had disliked Laugier's Martyrs (too unpleasant ) n Tall Man (too slow) but this film is claustrophobic n taut but at times very heavy n unpleasant.It has a lil similar vibe of High Tension, Martyrs n Inside.",Incident in a Ghostland
12,Stevieboy666,"Great title, great film.",8,21 January 2019,"Martyrs blew me away. The Tall Man didn't. So what did I think of director Pascal Laugier's latest effort? I loved t! Very impressed.
It starts off with a family, an ice cream van and an incredibly creepy house. Looked to me like it could be a Rob Zombie movie, and funnily enough within minutes one of the characters remarks that the house looks like it could belong to Mr Z! Now I am a fan of Rob Z but Incident was more polished than any of his movies. If found Incident to be visually superb, the creepy house in question, crammed with dolls, is amazing. The film is genuinely frightening with some good jump scares. It's brutal, twisted and dark. There are some great twists and the plot never slows down, it held my attention throughout. Camera work, musical score and acting are all excellent. The only two things that I didn't like was the use of some CGI and, without giving away spoilers, I felt that the end was a bit too easy and slightly unsatisfying. After such a thrilling ride I felt that it could have been better.
Overall, another class effort from Monsieur Laugier. I shall look forward to watching this again, best film that I have seen so far this year.",Incident in a Ghostland

14,r96sk,Definitely worth watching,7,9 June 2020,"Not exactly scary, but 'Ghostland' certainly does reach some dark levels to produce a creepy and uncomfortable horror film.It starts off pretty cliché but it quickly finds its own footing. I enjoy the way the storyline is portrayed, it never gets predictable which is always a positive in this genre. Most of the scares are the cheap, cop-out type, which stops the film being frightening. However, it makes up for it by creating tense, uneasy scenarios for the characters.Crystal Reed and Emilia Jones produce what's necessary in the lead role of Beth, those two do rather carry proceedings but the other members of the (small) cast aren't a hindrance in any way; the premise focuses on Beth, so you'd expect Reed and Jones to stand out most.I was locked in for it all, despite the fact I would've liked improved scare elements as opposed to average jump scares. Still, definitely worth watching.",Incident in a Ghostland

17,Pairic,Dark Horror,8,11 June 2020,"Incident in a Ghostland: Multi-layered horror where realities mesh with dreams and the imaginary; we even get an appearance from H.P. Lovecraft (""call me Howard""). A mother and her two teen daughters head to a secluded house which she has inherited. On the way they are passed by a creepy candy van and read about a series of home invasions/murders. That night they are attacked by a giant simple-minded man who is accompanied by a woman, the van's driver. The mother and daughter undergo a horrific ordeal but fight back, killing their attackers. Sixteen years later one of the girls, Beth, has become a successful horror author. She gets a disturbing call from her sister Vera who never really recovered from the attack. Returning home her mother informs her that Vera locks herself in her room and in the basement. But much worse is going on, Vera is found chained to a radiator and seems to be under attack from invisible entities. Scenes of horror, nay, terror infuse this film from the very beginning, the home invasion is truly disconcerting as the man-monster throws the girls around like rag dolls and abuses them. Dolls feature strongly, popping out of cupboards (quotidian horror) and proving a distraction to the monster who likes to burn/break dolls. Trouble is - he regards the girls as dolls. Not a film you will easily forget though there are a few clues strewn through the early parts of the film as to what is really going on. Written and Directed by Pascal Laugier (Martyrs). 8/10.",Incident in a Ghostland
18,TdSmth5,"Yes, Pascal Laugier is back!",10,5 October 2018,"A mother and her two teen daughters travel out in the country to the house they inherited after the sister's death. The older daughter Vera is your typical teen, the other one, Beth, is withdrawn, socially awkward, introverted. She focuses mainly on writing Lovecraft-inspired horror stories. On the road some guys in a candy truck give them trouble and the older daughter gives them the finger. They arrive at the house which is filled with dolls, some creepier than others.Then the candy truck arrives and the two creeps get inside the house and attack the ladies. Things get pretty brutal but the mom manages to save the day. Then Beth wakes up. She keeps having these horrific nightmares related to that night, which did in fact take place. By now she's a world-famous horror writer, happily married and with a kid. Her latest best-seller is called Incident in a Ghostland and is to some extent autobiographical. After getting a troubling call from Vera, she decides to visit her mom and sister, but things aren't too well there. Vera is in bad mental shape and is kept in a padded room in the basement. She hurts herself thinking she deserves some punishment. The mom seems to be doing relatively well. But being back at the place also brings back memories/visions/nightmares. One night Vera is handcuffed and seriously beaten and when Beth intervenes, it does actually look like someone or something is in the house attacking Vera. There is a twist which I won't reveal. But it's a good one, one that I didn't expect. People here of course like to brag how they saw it coming it from the movie's first minute. I didn't expect it, I wasn't looking out for it, so it did surprise me. And it's a well-thought-out twist, too, it's not some cheap device. What follows is some more violence and the resolution. Incident in a Ghostland is a strange title and the movie poster is rather uninspired. But it's a a Pascal Laugier film so it's good. Very good. I connected with the characters and cared for the outcome. Fans of Martyrs, like myself, will recognize some familiar elements--two girls facing a similar fate, brutal violence, normal relatable characters. Usually, psychological horror doesn't work for me at all but this movie did, it's probably the best movie of that genre because it offers more than madness or imagined horror. Here's it's real and visceral. Of course it's not a perfect movie; I could have done with less orchestrated music and would have preferred a brighter cinematography. Like many movies these days it doesn't feature a whole lot of males. Crystal Reed is cute though. Still I'm giving a this movie a 10. It simply works and is an excellent horror movie in its own right. Hopefully we won't have to wait so long for Laugier's next masterpiece.",Incident in a Ghostland
19,peterp-450-298716,More disturbing than Hereditary? I'm sure it is.,7,21 February 2019,"Jesus Christ.
It's Rob Zombie's house.They came up with the following slogans for ""Hereditary"": ""The scariest film ever"" and ""A highlight in horror in the last 50 years"". Well, I wonder what they would say about ""Incident in a Ghostland""? I won't say this is the most masterful horror of all time. And no, it's not as frightening as ""The Exorcist"". That one scared me to death in those days. ""Incident in a Ghostland"" uses the same concept as in ""The seasoning house"" and ""I spit on your grave"". The sexual abuse of innocent girls and the psychological damage these desperate victims suffer from. It's not trembling and shaking all the time, but the whole movie you'll have that uncomfortable feeling.Now, the concept of such movies is actually quite simple. In the first instance, they try to shock you with confrontational images so you'll feel sick with disgust and anger. In such a way that the second part feels like a relief. Just like Jean-Claude Van Damme in his old movies where he fights back and wins, after being beaten up real bad. Or when an almost defeated underdog in a football match can turn the tide. That's how the second part feels. You are a member of a fan club for the victims who fight back and avenge the injustice done to them. As in ""I spit on your grave"" where I couldn't suppress a heartfelt, loud ""Yes"" with every execution of one of the perpetrators. And the way the victims take revenge should be ruthless and merciless. The more pain, the better. In short, a film that contrasts two opposing feelings frontally. The feeling of destruction, despair and physical pain, versus relief, liberation and a victory.In a way, ""Incident in a Ghostland"" tries to break this pattern. Yes, there's that moment of extreme violence and that moment the situation looks desperate. And just when you think it's going smooth, the film takes a completely new path and the struggle for survival begins again. Further revealing only leads to spoiling the fun for those who haven't seen the film yet. But the twist in the story also surprised me. To be honest, it's not often that a film does this to me. Usually, I see it coming a mile away. But not now.The film was directed by Pascal Laugier who's best known for his controversial film ""Martyrs"". A film that was proclaimed as the mother of all ""torture-porn"" and apparently rolls over you like a steamroller. An extremely brutal film many found disgusting. I never watched it myself. Deep inside I would like to see this movie but something tells me that the extreme violence will hit me too deeply. That's why I avoid it. Had I known that Laugier directed this movie as well, I might have ignored it too. And now I'm on the horns of a dilemma. Is this a film where Laugier went soft? Or should I try to watch ""Martyrs"" anyway?Is it worth to watch this movie? Actually yes. And that because it's beyond simply a brutal ""home-invasion movie"" with the torture, abuse, and humiliation of young girls. Here Laugier also brings the psychological impact of such a traumatic experience in the picture. He shows how the human psyche works from an individual who experiences something such as this barbaric invasion by two murderous maniacs. It's not a film for sensitive souls even though the violence isn't explicitly shown. However, the consequences of these brutal assaults are clearly visible. That's why I give a thumbs-up for the make-up department.The set-up as a whole is very successful. The house where Pauline (Mylène Farmer) and her two daughters Beth (Emilia Jones \ Crystal Reed) and Vera (Taylor Hickson \ Anastasia Phillips) move in, is a real junk house full of rarities and old dolls. Not that it plays a prominent role in the film, but it contributes to the entire oppressive and dark atmosphere. The acting of the two girls is mainly limited to screaming and anxiously waiting for the two halfwits to show up again. Except for Beth who became a successful writer of horror stories. Until she returns to the hell-house and is being confronted with the suffering. Mother Pauline behaves as a soothing and encouraging character. And then finally you have the two assailants. One crazier than the other, in terms of appearance. One is a goth-like person who you'll only get to see briefly most of the time. The second a colossal, moronic monster who's inhumanly strong. A drooling and groaning primate who prefers to play with dolls. And he likes it even better when those dolls are alive.All in all, ""Incident in a Ghostland"" is fascinating in a way. Even though the level of sadism is quite high and you can't shake off the feeling of fear and panic during the whole movie. The entire film is an avalanche of hysteria with that constant sense of helplessness. It's not a horror movie about possessed houses or paranormal phenomena with the familiar jump scares and creepy moments. This is a frightening film about something that can happen in reality and that we see on the news on a regular basis. The story itself seems rather simple, but Beth's condition creates an extra dimension. In any case, it's a lot more frightening than ""Hereditary"", THE horror from 2018 (sarcastic tone).",Incident in a Ghostland
20,valleyjohn,This makes no sense whatsoever,3,30 May 2020,"I'm not a lover of horror films . Not because they scare me - they don't , but because the vast majority are just not very good and saying Ghostland is not very good is being kind to it .Sixteen years after a traumatic event, a mother and two daughters reunite at the house where it happened. But soon their reunion starts to take a bizarre turn.This film really annoyed me . I didn't know whether I was watching two girls dreaming , reminiscing or imagining what was happening. It made no sense whatsoever.
Why do film makers muddy the waters so the viewer hasn't got a clue what is going on ?
This isn't scary at all . It has the usual jump scares and some gratuitous violence but nothing that makes it stand out from the usual horror format .If you are remotely thinking about watching this - Don't.",Incident in a Ghostland
21,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Haunting Take on Dealing with Trauma,9,20 December 2018,"This film was one that I made sure to watch during my year-end round up of horror films released this year. I heard there was a really good twist and that quite a few people really liked it. The official synopsis is a mother of two who inherits a house is confronted with murderous intruders on the first night in their new home and fights for her daughters' lives. Sixteen years later when the daughters reunite at the house, things get really strange.We kick off with a quote on H.P. Lovecraft from the younger daughter of mother Pauline (Mylène Farmer). The daughter is Beth (Emilia Jones) who is a huge fan and she is reading her latest story that is in the vein of Lovecraftian fiction. The older daughter Vera (Taylor Hickson) doesn't think it is that good and tells her sister that she needs to live in the real world and not so much in her head. They then go to a local store where Beth reads a newspaper headline about someone attacking families where they kill the parents and torture the daughter. The trio is spooked by a large candy truck.Things take a turn that night when they're attacked by two individuals. The one is slender and is known as Candy Truck Woman (Kevin Power) while the other is Fat Man (Rob Archer). Pauline does what she can to save her daughters and Beth runs away.We then shift into the future where Beth is now Crystal Reed. She is a successful writer and her latest book is her best yet. It is recounting the events of what happened to her that night and it is titled Incidents in a Ghostland. Things take a turn when Vera calls her sister and she is in a panic. Beth decides to go home. Her mother is caring for Vera, who is now Anastasia Phillips, who is still reliving the events that happened all those years ago.Beth thinks it is all in her head, but something very strange happen and the truth is much more horrifying that she could ever imagine.Now I'm going to be spoiler free as possible with this review, mostly because this is one I think that you definitely need to experience. Something I didn't share earlier was that this film is written and directed by the same guy who did the original Martyrs, which is another film I'm a big fan of. This one isn't as brutal as that film, but it definitely has some of those elements for sure. There were times where it really made me cringe.What I really like though is there are so many call backs in this film. There are things that will be focused on and it has a place later in the film. This isn't necessarily even big things either. Really good writing like this is something that sucks me into a film and this one definitely did that.The pacing of the film I thought was really good as well. It never hit a lull where I was bored and the twist to the film blew me away. It does something where you don't know if the characters are crazy, which after what we see what they are going through, I definitely wouldn't blame them. It also has a nice section where it starts to let up and then it really just comes back down on you, which is something else that is really good for the pacing. It gives you time to breath, but you also don't feel completely comfortable.Acting for the film was really good as well. I thought Reed in her role was solid. I found her quite attractive as well, which never hurts. Farmer was solid as the mother and it is really heartbreaking trying to watch her take on this villains. Phillips I thought was solid in the role that she had as well. Jones was good as the younger version of Beth. She does have to exhibit quite a bit of strength, even though she is told by Vera she is weak. Hickson is solid in a different way that really works as well. Power and Archer I thought were solid as the two villains for sure. I really like the motives for Archer and it is quite sad actually. It is a solid move if you can feel bad for the villains, despite the atrocities they are committing.I came in expecting that the effects would be good after seeing who was in charge of the film. They seemed to go practical for pretty much everything and it looked brutally real. The effects of some of the blows to people on their faces looked quite realistic and it made me feel worse for them. There is also some interesting things that are done by looking through glass that I liked. It definitely helps with the twist of the film for sure.Now with that said, I know this review is a little bit shorter, but that is due to not wanting to spoil this film. I thought the story was absolutely amazing. It definitely has a great twist and the reasons the villains are doing this is quite interesting. I thought the acting for the most part was solid. The pacing of the film is good and it never gets boring. How the film ends I was all for as well. The effects were on point and looked pretty real. The score of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt it. This film isn't really one I would recommend to everyone, only because of the realistic violence. If you can handle that and want to see an interesting story, I'd definitely recommend this one. I found this to be a really good film.",Incident in a Ghostland
22,robertemerald,Nerve shredding guttural horror,10,9 June 2019,"I don't know about the other reviewers but I'd place bets that even if this doesn't become considered a classic horror film, it will, at the very least, become part of a well remembered and often referred to canon of similar horror movies. For me, it does everything right. The house is just plain creepy. A comedy shot in that house, narrow passages, creeping floors, and locked in a previous century, not to mention grandma was a serious collector of dolls, well, you might get a laugh. Even so, such a comedy would still give you nightmares. The movie wastes no time in citing danger. The first part was a piece of genius. It's the sort of movie where at times you are so wound up and tense you'd pay someone to interrupt. There were times in this movie when I would have welcomed a power cut. I've said enough. If this movie doesn't scare the wits out of you then, well, honestly, perhaps you watch too many horror movies.

24,begob,Top of the second division,7,21 May 2020,"As a mother and her two incompatible daughters take possession of the remote house of their late relative, they fail to realise someone has been following them ...This kicks off with a terse opening scene, full of character and plot and tension, so you know you're in the hands of a good storyteller who sows the seeds. The conflict soon arrives and it is full on, the violence harrowing, but alleviated by a Lynchian deception that throws up interesting possibilities.The performances are good, with unsettling makeup, and the music and set design are lavish and effective. The camerawork could have been more imaginative, and I found the metaphor laid on too heavy. Combine that with a far fetched story that needs cops to sort itself out, and we end up more in James Wan territory than David Lynch as the possibilities pan out in safe moralising. Also, some of the early threads aren't really tied up - we were given information on the late relative, but nothing came of it apart from the doll collection. So it does pack a punch, but not a horror of the first order.The Martyrs influence only occurred to me late on, and afterward I realised it's the same director. Also a Chainsaw influence.Overall, quality horror that is the sum of its parts, but no more. Definitely a good watch, and the dismissive early reviews are plain stoopid.",Incident in a Ghostland

I saw supposing it would be routine or an ordinary horror movie. But, surprisingly it has a lot of attractions and I did not stop myself to taking any break till the end of movie. There is much confusion in present story and past story. This led us in a mysterious situation. Line between reality and imagination is very thin. The scene where Beth was sitting between dolls is very scary and hair rising. Acting done by leading actresses is brilliant. Twists at starting and before the end are shocked.

The newspapers report on their crime spree. What the woman and her daughters don't know is that they will become the next targets. The two daughters suffer from severe PTSD from the incident. What happens next is a twisty narrative after the initial invasion of the home.The film is tense and unrelenting. It continues and continues to build up that I felt stressed just watching it.

All those films combined couldn't touch the incessant annoying screaming the two sisters exhibited in this otherwise interesting horror/thriller. This would've been a really good movie if the girls didn't scream so much.Did I mention the girls scream a lot in this movie? Yeah, and the brunette is weak and spineless, too. Also very annoying. Nice twist in the film, though, and it was worth the price of admission. I'd recommend this film if the director and/or editor revisited it and cut some of that continuous screaming down in half.

The movie is divided into two big sections, pre-twist and post-twist. If you are not new to the horror genre you will catch the ""twist"" pretty fast, but the movie doesn't emphasize on it a whole lot. Rather works with it and does its job well indeed. At first I felt like, come on, ""I've seen this already, you can't surprise me with this"". But then...
It is very atmospheric, it's brutal, it's hopeless, but what caught me is one emotional moment with the sisters, you will know it when you see it. It's unforgettable. 
It has it's flaws but is well crafted overall. This movie was able to share it's emotion with me and I enjoyed it.",Incident in a Ghostland

This movie packs a punch! It's wicked in the greatest sense of the word. If you're a true horror buff then this one will rock your world! This is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Martyrs of 2018 and I mean in how crazy/creepy it is. It's raw and gritty and very well done, with solid acting and the atmosphere is spot on.In terms of a flaw, I just wish there were more answers towards the end but even though, it's horror at its very best.I've never written a review here before but I created an account to give this one major kudos. I knew nothing about it when I watched it, so don't read about it, don't look it up, just go into it blind and if you love horror then you'll love this one. Without a doubt this movie has a place in my horror DVD collection and I predict a cult classic for sure.AND... might I add, I'm so tired of the tired-wannabe-horror-pseudo-intellectual to the genre who claim Martyrs is (for a lack of a better term) ""the man's man to horror movies"". Hey, news flash little ones, we get it, we love that movie too, we're just not stuck in a box with no place to go. Do we expect other movies to meet those expectations, maybe not but that does not mean our noses are so far stuck up our bums that we cannot enjoy other horror movies like this one.

They were all absolutely superb.The production was also excellent, with everything done to make this film look as good as the story and performances.

But there are many things that lost me: the excessive amount of jump-scares, the twist at the middle is more of a cheap trick rather than any actually organic step into the story and the whole third act is not that good to me. Althought its ending satisfyes me. I wanted to like this, but I found myself more disappointed than pleased.

40,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Chilling and unforgettable,7,10 December 2020,"It's been about a month since I watched ""Incident in a Ghostland"" and whenever I think about it a shiver runs down my spine. It is like nothing I have ever seen. I knew absolutely nothing about the film when I sat down to watch it but it is now up there as one of the most disturbing films that I've ever sat through. Very rare is it that you feel the trauma of the characters on screen. I'd like to add that I am by no means easily shocked, and I am a huge horror fan. ""Incident in a Ghostland"" sure took the wind from my sails, and from a cinematic perspective, I believe I could give Pascal Laugier no greater credit.The entire premise of the film is bizarre. It is difficult to describe, but on one hand it is a grim fairytale and on the other it leans towards exploitation. But director Pascal Laugier is such a master at the helm that he steers it through and comes out the other end strong. Two bickering sisters and their French mother travel to their late-aunt's house out in the countryside to live there. It is one big dollhouse, as there are hundreds of the things lying about the place. Here, they become the target of two creepy serial killers. Taylor Hickson, who plays one of the main characters, suffered a horrific accident on set and was left disfigured when her head went through a glass window. An awful thing to happen, and it has understandably shadowed the film. For me, it certainly adds to the bad feeling that the film leaves you with. It is an experience, as all great cinema is.

It is becoming more and more difficult to come up with anything new in movies, we had found footage which for a brief while had people thinking is this real, now the very mention of found footage makes me groan, no more headache inducing shaky camera work. Music is the same, looking at the 60s, 70s, 80s the well started to dry up in the 90s with the occasional oasis of originality. Now I can barely distinguish one song from another and have retreated to my old favourites. Anyway back to the movie, a woman with two children arrive at a house which must people would stop and then drive away, they are followed by two monsters who do not speak so have no clue to their motives.

It's not a pretty movie, the directing is messy (shakey-cam galore) and the film is very grim and bleak. It had its moments where it genuinely felt like a B/Student movie.

Sound design is pretty good.The house.. a horror movie set in a scary farmhouse, we've all seen it. But here its even worse, it's like they thought lets get every ''scary'' object and put it in the house, dolls, weird art, animal heads everywhere. Soo much to the point it made no sense. It might be nitpicky but it kind of put me off.The acting is decent all around, though not a fan of the screaming from Vera mostly, which imo is too much.

48,S_Soma,Scary and definitely horrifying.,8,16 June 2018,"I will have to be uncharacteristically vague in my review of INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND (a.k.a GHOSTLAND). There are a few plot twists and surprises within the movie that would be impossible to touch upon without ruining those elements of the movie and they are definitely a core part of this movie's effectiveness. While I'm usually quite happy to give things away (which is why I always check the appropriate ""does this review contains spoilers"" checkbox), I'm going to go out of my way to at least TRY not to ruin it. As long as you are okay with the particular source horror genre, it's an exceptionally high quality example and it would be a shame to damage the experience for anyone who wanted to watch it.In short, everything about INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND is very well done. The acting is excellent and quite believable, characters are well defined and well portrayed, very appropriate music, top-flight cinematography, and so on.HOWEVER... Before watching this movie you should be aware that:There are scenes of female human torture which are, for good or ill, very graphic and EXTREMELY believable. These elements of the movie are not gratuitous (given the particular nature of the movie) and are definitely a requisite part of the overall plot line, and there are not more of them than there needs to be to make the plot element point.Also be aware that there is significant violence, blood and bodily harm which are very brutal.The movie also relies upon the notion that if the you have physical deformities or have ""alternative"" personal tastes in clothing or comportment, these are outward indicators of monstrous natures, which may offend the sensibilities of some SJW's. Personally, I didn't have any trouble with that aspect. It's a movie...I can't say that, overall, I ""liked"" INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND because of the intrinsic nature of its particular variety of horror. I tend to gravitate strongly toward horror pictures of the supernatural variation because of their escapist quality and the fact that it's ""safe"" horror because it's absolute balderdash. No matter how scary it gets, and while I might not think about it consciously while I'm watching the movie, I always know somewhere down inside that not only is none of this real (because it's a movie) but that none of it CAN be real. Because, you know, it's balderdash. It may be scary, but it's scary balderdash. Ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggedy beasties and things that go bump in the night don't give me nightmares. Gangsters and other sociopaths DO.The nature of the horror in INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND intrinsically involves particularly gruesome brutality and depictions of people using other people as playthings. These are important elements of the movie because this is the type of movie that it is. My difficulty with it is not a critique of the movie by any means but rather an expression of my individual response as a matter of personal taste. To be clear, the type of horror depicted in INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND, while unlikely and rare, CAN happen and similar events HAVE happened in the real world. It's peculiar, fringe and unlikely, but it is most definitely NOT balderdash and can't easily be shrugged off as such.If this is the genre of horror that you like, make no mistake, INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND is an exceptionally excellent example of it.",Incident in a Ghostland

Its like the director has no awareness of the since-produced Insidious, Conjuring or Annabelle films, or American Horror Story. Trying to reach new depths of horror via a Goonies-looking ogre (ugly people are terrifying, right?) a Marilyn Manson/Ringu looking villain (transgenders are terrifying, right?) and endless dolls feels more like bargain basement 90s schlock. The story flits around with ideas of what might or might not be imagined via a horribly inaccurate and contrived idea of how post-traumatic stress disorder might work. Eventually its about absolutely nothing, except the directors attempt to try and scare you. What you get though is endless jump-scares (e.g. dolls leaping out of wardrobes, sigh), flash-cut shaky editing, and Mylene Farmer channelling Tommy Wiseau as an insincere mother figure.

61,shannen-l-c,Incredibly haunting psychological horror. Must see for horror fans.,9,14 July 2018,"Wow, wow, wow! I've been a horror fan for many years and many people ask me why since the genre is saturated with mediocre and flat out crap films, but I always say that I love it because when you find a good horror it's a true gem better than any other movie you'll find in any other genre and that's exactly what 'Ghostland' is - a freakin' gem!I went into it completely blind (which I would recommend everyone to do) and based on the title and cover, I expected a typical mediocre haunted house horror, but I was proved wrong. The eerie tone that's immediately present in the opening scenes grabbed my attention and pulled me in, and it wastes no time in jumping straight into the nitty gritty. I was practically glued to my screen from beginning to end. The acting is fantastic, the story is well-crafted and it ticks every box you could ask for from a horror. It incorporates psychological horror with sheer brutality and the result is harrowing. It takes A LOT to get under my skin and since I've seen so many horrors I'm rather desensitised, but 'Ghostland' deeply effected me. There were so many moments where I physically couldn't bear to watch, but couldn't bring myself to look away because I was so engrossed. Once again, due to the amount of horror movies I've watched over the years I find that I'm generally able to figure out the plot within the first quarter of the movie, but 'Ghostland' has so many twists and turns that you never know what's going to happen next. What you think the story is at the beginning, is very far from what it becomes and that unpredictably is what makes it so fantastic. Although there's a lot of violence (similar to that featured in movies like 'The Hostel'), the movie isn't just built upon mindless violence, but a very intense and relentless insight into the human psyche. The psychological aspect of this movie is definitely what gives it its edge and it really got into my head. After the end credits came on, myself and my family were all saying how much it had effected us and even half an hour later, it was still at the forefront of our minds (in fact, I'm pretty sure most of us won't be having the most restful night's sleep tonight!) 'Ghostland' is the best horror I've seen in many years and I would recommend it to every horror fan, particularly those that are fans of psychological horror. Be prepared though, this movie is a tough ride and will put you through the ringer. It's one I certainly won't forget any time soon.",Incident in a Ghostland
62,umimelectric,Other Reviews Are Too Generous,4,21 August 2018,"I'll start by saying that I love and understand horror, and I equally understand and appreciate lower budget and independent film-making. The other reviews on imdb are a bit too forgiving of the film's downfalls though. It's acted fairly well by the main cast, but the smaller roles are filled by some trash actors who really, really blow. The script isn't terrible and the mid-way twist does inspire a real feeling of dread for a moment, but then it gets all The Hills Have Eyes/Texas Chainsaw on ya, and you pretty much can predict the rest of it. The title is pretty deceiving too- if you're expecting a ghost story, you'll be let down like I was. I see what they were aiming for here, and it was a decent effort, but had they stayed the course on the direction of the first half of the film, ditched the twist and rode it out, I believe it would have been a better story. 4.5/10",Incident in a Ghostland

What might have been an intriguing concept instead becomes a non stop barrage of titillation in the form of women being beaten, savaged, humiliated and terrorised for the bulk of the movie. There's nothing else, no horror, no scares, no substance, just the director and the makers of this pitiful exercise seemingly getting off on the objectification of women in dire circumstances.More little objects to prod and pinch.Its all a dismal failure of course and its harrowing depiction of atrocities towards the female gender comes across as just a boring and noisy idea desperately in search of a picture.Skip this one and say a prayer for the horror genre in general, it can't get much worse.",Incident in a Ghostland

After all, he is the man behind ""Martyrs"", a great horrror that leaves no one cold. Ghostland, however, has good direction, photography and fast pace right from the start but the dialogue could have been better and all the jump scares somehow fail to have the desirable effect. If you are used to horror like the aforementioned ""Martyrs"" or ""A l'interieur"", ""Ils"" and ""Eden Lake"", you will probably feel nothing despite all the violence and terror that the main characters go through. The twist in the story is not bad but could still be more developed in my opinion. The cast deliver nice performances and all the make-up effects are good too.

The brutal treatment of female characters as shock value is nothing new in the horror genre. That said, the narrative and jump scares was dump down for the audience. The ""adulthood"" of Beth seems too good to be true, and hence, such a twist is not unexpected. Still, the actors did great; love their acting performance. And the camera work was good. And now, I would like to talk about the director. If you read the plots of his past works, they all include female victimisation. And for this movie, he is responsible for the permanent scarring of the actor, Taylor Hickson's (Young Vera) face; only the production company was fined $40,000.",Incident in a Ghostland

People who gave this movie low ratings either didn't really watch the entire movie or they just abhor this type of horror movies. It's definitely difficult watching men torture/brutalize women. But the end pays off. I don't know if I can sit through the entire movie again, but I wouldn't mind watching the end over again because our 2 main girls are the winners in the end.The picture quality is great. The sound quality is awesome - definitely a lot of good bass in the soundtrack. The premise of 2 killers (one mentally-inhibited giant guy and one cross-dresser/gay gay) invading a home where 3 women reside and holding them prisoners isn't exactly original. But it doesn't matter. It is how each one copes with the situation that matters. And the way one of them copes is original. Again, the payoff at the end is gratifying. These 2 killers had it coming to them. The important thing is that the 2 women won in the end. It's sort of a happy ending- almost. 2 out of 3 women isn't bad. 3 out of 3 would have been perfect, but no movie is perfect.",Incident in a Ghostland

Also I didn't understand why the girl(s) didn't do anything to help their mother at the start of the movie. That didn't make any sense. Then came the twist which helped to understand why they kept locked up the other girl. It was a bit surreal and could have been a better twist if they don't make it a nonsense ""world"". But it was ok. Then some crazy stuff happened. With terrible make up and acting. The way they escaped was a smart one. Liked it. They kept running in euphoria and shock. Cops stopped. Everything was fine. Then the st*pid thing. The woman crosses the field and nobody notices it. I mean for real.. Then they can't pull their guns out.The end was a nothing.. Nothing special, nothing bad. Cliche.In overall it wasn't bad, but wasn't good neither. It had it's moments. It was original in a way but also it was missing something.

The result is mediocre at best.

As with all of Laugier's work (see also House Of Voices and The Tall Man), there's plenty of twists and turns and far more to it than first meets the eye. The less you know before going in, the better. 
So what can I tell you? Well, if you couldn't stomach the aforementioned Martyrs, then give this particular Incident a wide berth. Ghostland doesn't quite hit the stomach churning 'heights' of his controversial 2008 movie, but it still proves he hasn't lost his touch when it comes to expertly unleashing brutal bruising violence. There's nothing sexy about fist induced swollen eye sockets & shattered cheek bones, and Laugier rams this conceit home harder than any of his villains.
But this is a l-o-n-g way from being just another tawdry psycho intruders break-in potboiler. Genre clichés and tropes are liberally deployed for sure (as is some outstandingly creepy art direction and set design), but this is deceptive gravy for what is really a psychological exploration of the power of imagination overcoming traumatic scarring and complete mental breakdown. 
Laugier has always stated he wrote the screenplay for Martyrs under a weighty cloud of depression, and with that in mind, its not too difficult to see his latest for what it is: an autobiographical take on the cathartic nature of creating his most talked about work. Martyrs may always be the child that gets the most attention, but if he never makes another movie, this one will surely be recognised as the baby to which he has the most personal attachment.

Having seen none of Laugier's other works was no deterrent as his 2008 'French New Wave' foray ultimately left me spellbound.This was just as well, otherwise I may have stopped watching shortly into the jump scare reliant trope-fest that is Ghostland's First Act. It was all so unimpressive. Creepy looking dolls adorning a creaking old house while terrified women flee from evildoers hell bent on doing evil for evil's sake.At least the antagonists in Martyrs had a motivation. In fact Martyrs posed a question about whether the end justified the means. From a narrative perspective, the question was specifically, can divine knowledge be gleaned through the torture of innocents? Throughout much of Ghostland, I was wondering whether this film's ending would justify the torturous repetition of outmoded scare tactics I'd endured thus far.In the second Act there's the promise of something much deeper at play. Specifically multiple time shifts provide a hint of probing into the psychology behind trauma. Perhaps the over-egged First Act was a purposeful misdirection after all?
The answer to this question was no. Ghostland remains unredeemable and is haunted by a much better and much earlier effort.",Incident in a Ghostland

109,deandraslater,Home Invasion With a Twist,7,24 September 2019,"It must really suck to make a film as gut punching as Martyrs so early in your career and have everyone compare every other film you make to that. Ghostland is a good film, but it suffers from a slightly overlong 2nd act where things begin to get repetitive. Even a 5 minute trim would help things roll along smoother.Ghostland is about two sisters and their mother who move into their aunt's quirky home in the middle of nowhere as two serial killers are prowling the countryside for new victims. Obviously, the killers set their sights on the family and terrorize them.To say much else would deprive the film of one of its most vicious twists that turns everything you've seen before on its head. Ghostland does seem to have a lot to say about the importance of family and a mother's love for her children. There are certainly moving moments and even a few decent scares, but something feels like its missing.Ghostland is a movie you can like, but not really love.

The jump scares don't scare me much, but there are a lot of times where i feel emotionally frightened.

You can imagine my surprise when I realized it had nothing to do with ghosts and, on top on that, Isabella Fuhrman was actually not part of the cast.
But, I'm not the kind of person who turns a movie off 25 minutes through it and so I kept watching. Boy, was that a bad decision!
I understand the charm of the so-called ""torture"" genre; fictional sadism can be cathartic, even liberating: look at those poor people suffering, so glad it's not me! And those p.o.s. behaving like animals? Can't wait to see them get what they deserve! But even the most brutale of the stories must carry some redeeming quality, a hint of morality, an excuse for the average, normal person to sit still 70 minutes watching two young girls beaten and abused without feeling bad.
That's not what happens here. This movie is 20 minutes of setup for a psicological horror, then there's the ""epic"", ""unexpected"" ""twist"", followed by literally 70 minutes of two girls beaten and abused. That's it. Why are the bad guys doing that? Well, just because. Should we feel bad for the girls? Well we are certainly *supposed to* but how can you be sorry for someone who do nothing but SCREAM NON-STOP in EVERY scene they're in? Finally, is the moment of the bad guys' defeat satisfying? Nope, just a handful of bullets shot by a deus ex machina dressed as a cop. Underwhelming, at least.

The script and story are tight, acting excellent, the attention to detail is impeccable, the characters are full, well explored and consistent and as the movie unfolds, it doesn't seem over sensationalised - meaning you can believe this is a real story. This makes Ghostland one of the few films that, while delivering plenty, doesn't rely on it's shock scares to keep atmosphere, tempo and interest maximised throughout. It is very easy to get completely sucked in to the story, and stay on the edge of your seat (or behind the covers, far more likely) until the end.

It's actually a bad attempt at a home invasion story combined with some torture porn. There are constant scene switches that don't help with the storyline. It feels like an attempt to put several genres into one, but fails horribly at all of it. Every 20 mins. there's a switch in horror genre for some reason. It feels desperately random while going nowhere. Skip that one if you actually happened to find a decent horror this year. I sure didn't yet :(.

The perversion of showing violence, even if decidedly less intense and raw than in Martyrs, still stand in this film.The construction of the tension is absolutely extraordinary: it grows in a short time and remains high throughout the whole film, until the very end.Laugier once again manages to scare and create emotional distress both visually but also emotionally, thanks also to fantastic and plot.A film capable of frightening, disturbing but also of moving.Personally I consider it the most beautiful and complete horror film seen in the last 5-6 years.",Incident in a Ghostland

174,iller1234,Absolutely brilliant,8,29 April 2019,"I want to give my opinion on the relatively low vote average. To be sure - this movie is not for everyone. To be honest, I can't really say it's for me. My sympathy with the low-voters lies in the expectation of a movie and the emotions you want to extract from it. When I watch horror movies I want to get scared, and have a nightmare or two because of it. Ghostland doesn't offer that. Instead, it offers something much more chilling and to the core gut wrench-disgusting. I have seen every horror movie in the catalogue and this one stands out as unique. My bet is this: the average low voting stems from the fact that people didn't go to bed that night scared, but emotionally disturbed.Ghostland is at it's core a drama, that, in a brilliant turn of events, turns into a fully-fledged horrorshow. This turning point is really well timed and combines the drama and horror wonderfully. It's not there as a filler or headscratcher but as a catalyst of the remaining brutal events and the emotions they bring. It's not a spoiler but something you sense from the beginning, that you can't quite figure out. The cast is unexpectedly good. Normally a horrorcast is just strong enough to hold up whatever evil is in it, but sisters Beth and Vera (played by Crystal Reed and Anastasia Phillips) together with the great story are excelling.Don't watch this movie for the sake of watching a horror movie.

I can not, not watch only half a horror movie no matter how bad I think it is, so I sat for the third time and finished the last half. If I had not finished it, it would have been a huge mistake and me call myself a horror buff (snob).This movie is well written, well thought out and well acted, directed, etc. It is fresh and if you are into horror a must see. It won't scare you to death, but the creepy factory will stay with you. Top five horror for this decade and if you are a buff or just a movie watcher, I promise you a ride worth taking.

It was also somewhat reminiscent of Martyrs in its themes, though it went too far with the distorted reality element in my opinion.It's a pretty creepy story for sure, though it is quite tame on the blood and guts. The acting is pretty decent and so is the overall production.I would have loved to give it more stars, but it just felt too disjointed at times and once I realized that it was a film by Pascal Laugier, I was even more disappointed.See Martyrs instead if you dare.",Incident in a Ghostland

It's raw and gritty and very well done, with solid acting and the atmosphere is spot on. In terms of a flaw, I just wish there were more answers towards the end but even though, it's horror at its very best.I've never written a review here before but I created an account to give this one major kudos. I knew nothing about it when I watched it, so don't read about it, don't look it up, just go into it blind and if you love horror then you'll love this one. Without a doubt this movie has a place in my horror DVD collection and I predict a cult classic for sure.AND... might I add, I'm so tired of the tired-wannabe-horror-pseudo-intellectual to the genre who claim Martyrs is (for a lack of a better term) ""the man's man to horror movies"". Hey, news flash little ones, we get it, we love that movie too, we're just not stuck in a box with no place to go. Do we expect other movies to meet those expectations, maybe not but that does not mean our noses are so far stuck up our bums that we cannot enjoy other horror movies like this one.

187,PatrickPlantana,Disturbing and suspenseful throughout...,8,1 September 2019,"The director of ""Martyrs"" (one of the all-time best) brings a well sequenced thriller with the right blend of everything. At first glance, we are introduced with a seemingly familiar plot. However, things take a quick turn and pack a hard punch in the process. The first half of the film is a hectic guessing game that gradually spirals out of control, keeping true to stylesque French horror with frightful suspense and explosive scenes. I was pleasantly surprised with the direction the story took once things started becoming clearer. I can't say much more without giving things away, so I recommend you just see for yourself. Lacking just a little bit in backstory, but not a crucial element needed for this film as it makes up for this by diving straight in to the madness that engulfs the atmosphere of the entire movie and doesn't let go. Pascal Laugier's originality truly shines through with enthrallingly vivid shots and iconic memoirs that take the film to the next level.

As much anger as I had when it was over thinking maybe this isn't appropriate , or what the hell did I just watch my mind was swirling with emotions...well I think that's the beauty of it actually. You feel so much like you're in it or like these characters are real. I enjoyed it also because it wasn't a typical cliche horror movie. It was very original and unlike anything I had seen.

I would have preferred he continue setting the movie in France as we have seen so many horror movies in the rural US landscape.The structure was way too close to his other film that it felt lazy; the focus on the 'sister' relationship of the two main characters, the sudden home invasion, the torture and kidnapping elements, the midway twist leaving a film of two halves.I loved it until the twist and it felt earned. But after that it became a bit too predictable. The characters make so many dumb decisions that it annoys you. In Martyrs, the characters were so sympathetic and every decision was understandable.And the jump scares were so frustrating. They are the cancer of modern horror films and although most were false-scares, there were still way too many.Overall this had a good set-up and a very tangible atmosphere. It was just let down by the cheap scares and poor character choices in the second act.",Incident in a Ghostland

And I must say, I was surprised. In a positive way! It is not mainstream and there is drama in it. As well as the twist, which reveals halfway. It's kinda phsycho and disturbed. I think I can catagorise it in the genre like Green Room or Split, which I loved of it's original.

So many shadows fill the screen so you can't see 80% of what's going on.The ""scares"" are relegated to jump scares that only startle you. Jump scares are annoying and a cop out to making a movie scary. Being startled does not equal scary. Your other part of ""scares"" are just gore scenes. They were done very well in Martyrs and actually added to the story, here it just seems like it was to check off boxes rather than lend to storytelling. 
A collection of some of the most dreadful bunch of female ""actresses"" that were hired purely on their ability to scream and wail rather than actually you know, act.Then you've got little taylor with her former non-scared face that sued the production because ""she'll never work again"". Her IMDB page says differently. Honey you're not getting roles, not for a scar on your face but for the fact you cannot act. Then you go on to sue the people who SADLY took a chance on you? You shouldn't get any roles, not because of the scar but because you're literally not able to act and are headed down the Katherine Heigl path of biting the hand that feeds you. Hope her lawsuit gets thrown out since she's had several roles since this supposed ""career ending scar"".Then we have some disgusting transphobic grossness which I never thought this director would do but here it is mocking us trans women. In the words of Rockstar from BB20... DISGUSTING! It was at this point I turned it off. The screaming, wailing and jump startles you can see coming for a mile for the majority of the movie was horrid enough to sit through but I will not continue watching something that mocks who I am. Bad form and totally disappointed the director would do this.To anyone that wants to make horror movies and is casting roles for the love of fake god STOP HIRING WOMEN JUST TO SCREAM FOR AN HOUR!

It plays with the human mind and how we create different realitys to ease the pain. The Photography is well done. The spiral of happenings around the characters is well thought out. It focuses completley on the two girls. It is a waste of time to compare the movie with the masterpiece martyrs. Ghostland is ghostland. Martyrs is Martyrs.,Incident in a Ghostland

The tension built in this film is very good, seems sadistic, brutal and makes us want to do something to help those who are being persecuted by those criminals.The storytelling style that is forward and backward in time frame also serves to present an element of twist that is very interesting and keeps us trying to guess what really happened to the poor characters. Until finally we just realized the true story line after watching this film completely.I recommend this film because it has a happy ending.

241,lmorse-590-175771,How to rate this?,6,13 September 2018,"I am terribly divided. In one hand it is a well crafted, claustrophobic intruder / slasher movie, full of tension and drama. There are a few reasonable twists and it keeps you on your toes. Never dull, it is well paced, claustrophobic, great on the jump scares and the action is what you want from a horror movie. However.... and I have never been compelled to level this complaint against a movie before (even Last House On The Left or Martyrs) - it is horribly misogynistic. I found the subject matter just that little too repugnant. It's an incessant female-rape and torture movie. It is quite relentless in it's abuse. A lot of movies get away with it because the horror is fantasised that extra step - the murderer's motivation is simply that he is hell bent on killing people. In this movie the bad guy is just intent on rape and torture of young women. It was very hard for me to reconcile.",Incident in a Ghostland

""Oh mom, you haven't changed at all in 10 years""The best parts in the film is basically the finale act which feels completely unrelated to what we've seen earlier and like an entirely different movie.

I cant describe how much i want you to stay away from this garbage. Hackneyed, underwritten and devoid of any form of redemption. I rarely venture on here to write a review because, lets face it, some reviews are just opinion and we are all within our rights to express them. Seriously though, this film is not a bad little attempt at being scary, if youre a 12 year old. For the rest of us non emo adults, its garbage. Pure and simple. The actors and craftspeople who worked on this movie (i use the term loosely), did a fine job with what they had. However the scriptwriter and director really overstretched their skill sets and overestimated any small semblance of talent. STAY AWAY!!!!!!",Incident in a Ghostland
259,jacques-schmitz,Probably the best horror movie of 2018,10,15 February 2018,"I had the chance to view this movie at the Gerardmer Fantastic Film Festival.We expected a boring movie.We were so wrong.This movie is a bomb.Its a visceral horror movie which keeps you clutched to your chair till the end.The twist comes in the middle of the movie, unlike usual commercial horror movies where the twist comes imposed in the end.In this movie, the twist really serves the story.
Go watch this masterpiece!
I give it 6/6.And my brother and another friend also 6/6.So 3 times 6.
And the Jury of Gerardmer agreed and gave it the Grand Prize.
Nouf said,
Go watch it if you dare.",Incident in a Ghostland
260,david-genestal,A big disappointment,4,15 March 2018,"Impossible to understand these notes and these dythirambic comments attributed to the last film of Pascal Laugier. I missed it to Gerardmer, thinking I missed the gem. Especially after discovering that he finally won the Grand Prix. So I waited patiently for the theatrical release, encouraged by great reviews and enthusiastic spectators. The movie experience looks promising. And finally what ? A film with high graphic qualities, essentially articulated around its central twist. And then ? A french porn torture that seeks to disturb and provoke, flirting with an unhealthy atmosphere for the greatest satisfaction of the public who cries to genius. Laugier knows his classics and does not hide his sources of inspiration (Tobe Hooper, Robert Aldrich, Rob Zombie in particular). Ghostland is however much less original and radical than Martyrs. And the film recycles elementary visual artifices and unproductive jumpscares: annoying and almost insulting. Let's move on to the pitch that serves as the basis for the film, which does not bother logic or credibility. Laugier first looks to shock the viewer and, obviously, seen the comments on the web, seems to achieve it without I can't understand why. I mean, since Hostel, horror cinema has largely gone around the topic of sequestration. Also, once the rather good surprise of the middle of the film passed, Ghostland doesn't innovate really, in spite of its graphic universe too clean to be really disturbing. Another story of victims and battered executioners who deserved a less caricatural and more thorough exploitation of his ""bad guys"", one in particular, too much left in the shadows despite its potential. Mylène Farmer does the job, no less well, nor better than another. Not enough to trigger hysteria anyway. Except perhaps for fans without any objectivity? In short, a film with a nice coating, played and directed with conviction but which is definitely not the new milestone announced in the horror cinema. Lovecraft is a regularly quoted figure: we would have liked that Laugier goes further in the reference and has delivered a film where the horror is more insidious than here. A disappointment to me.",Incident in a Ghostland

It was so boring, the twist wasn't a surprise, it was simply expected and the emotional point didn't hit me. The ending was like the begining; just a silent fart. Right in the begining Rob Zombie movies are a topic in this movie and seriously; Those have Something, but This has Nothing.

265,footballinjury-569-521090,"Effective, Powerful and Genuine Horror",10,29 September 2019,"It's always perplexing when well made films fly under the radar and go straight to VOD. The fact that Incident In A Ghostland was ignored by the industry is upsetting to say the least. I'm aware that the U.S. market tends to be rather ignorant of films produced in Canada, but when they're stories that are this well executed, that truism is nothing less than a galling crime.Incident In A Ghostland successfully evokes the very same type of dread reminiscent of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. No gimmicks, no fluff. The horror starts about 15 minutes into the film then put to rest for about 20-30 more minutes and is then vengefully resurrected and remains nonstop until the film ends.
I won't go into the plot details as the synopsis provided by the production studio should suffice. I only review films that I truly appreciate and enjoy so I can get the praise out there that I feel they deserve.

The film is not appropriate level for a star singer. Almost consumer goods. It's like she decorated the film and tried to add ""prices"" to it. The film made very badly. Directing horrible effects are simple and intrusive in their simplicity. The script is excellent. The best in movie is play of Mylene Farmer and two other girls actresses.

Well suffice it to say the four horsemen and masterminds behind what has become the hottest horror film festival held in the uk have not failed to select and feature a true 'diamond in the rough' of a film on its 2018 line-up of dark, delectable cinematic delights in 'Ghostland'.First I would advise viewer caution before dipping your toes into the unknown with this film, and my reasoning is this: this film does not shy away from providing the viewer front row seats to a decent into a very real and harsh hell that befalls the women in this title. There are no 'look away' moments with the camera, nor any ""get out of jail free"" cards either.The latest offering from French-Romanian director Pascal Laugier, Ghostland is a modern cautionary tale and fantastic example of how the mind can function in order to survive the most extreme and brutal of situations, often utilising fantastical skills in the name self preservation. With gender identity at the forefront of millennial debate, the subject matter highlighted in this film is notably current and thought inducing for post-viewing conversation if the audience is so inclined.A gargantuan thumbs up must go to the cast, as practically, the process of making this film must have had an immensely physical and psychologically demanding expectation on the actors to carry out an unflinchingly real portrayal of a cinematic nightmare.This film will not fail to disappoint fans of director Laugier's other offerings such as the now infamous cult extreme 'Martyrs' or debut feature 'Saint Ange' due to the expected depth of detail and care taken to ensure that viewers are taken on a stark journey down to the lowest levels of depravity that man can descend into, yet not compromising shocking or extreme visuals for sharp and captivating storytelling.For a great, shocking, violent and eerie ride, viewers strap yourselves in, youre in for a turbulent ride!Bravo Mr Laugier, Bravo!",Incident in a Ghostland

I think your own imagination helps when it comes to horror movies and mine is freaky. A horror like this could so happen in real life and that's the most terrifying part. Put it this way I made sure my doors were locked when I went to bed. My husband wasn't as freaked out about it as me, but he wouldn't give the film a second thought.

Like others have said it can be a comparable to the texas chainsaw massacre in terms of violence/brutality. If I were to describe this movie with other titles I'd say it was a mix of Occulus and The Loved Ones (but it was much better than both titles). Speaking of titles, if anything deserves a low score, it is the title of the movie. They should have kept the title short and relevant...because the current title almost makes no sense. Don't believe reviews that are lower than a 5/10 because the quality of the movie and the acting itself is already above that. And for a horror movie.. its way above 5/10.

I have seen almost every classic (and many, many not so!) film in the genre...Blah, blah, blah. Also, I have never felt compelled to write a review...Til now.I went into this film totally blind, as previous reviewers have mentioned, but recognised the director from his previous title MARTYRS, so thought I would give it a go. I'm not going to bog you down with spoilers and plot, as I don't want to give too much away. All I will say is that this is probably one of the most intense, surreal and grimly odd films I have seen. When the credits rolled, me and my girlfriend just sat there and looked at each in silence, and all I could say was 'wow!'
I couldn't even tell whether I liked it or not, it had screwed with my head that much. All I knew was it had been effective and definitely original. Looking back on it weeks later I probably would have to say that yeah, I guess I must've got something out of it, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this....But I guess it's up to the individual to make up their mind.

351,MoovedByMooovies,"A terrifying experience about the experience of terror., a la Laugier.",7,9 February 2019,"As a fan of Laugier since watching (and being haunted by) Martyrs, I was interested to watch another film written and directed by him. For me, Martyrs crossed a line and/or reached a high water mark in film making that is difficult to beat, (no pun intended) and is used as a bench mark for me when judging other films, in terms of expectations and emotive power. Martyrs re-calibrated not only my cinematic experience - but my nervous system and it's sensitivity to art (and life) - and so I was interested to watch another of Laugier's twisted tales. So I was more than a little curious to see what the twisted mind of Laugier had to offer next.Ghostland entirely lacks any allusions to secret societies as Laugier explores in his other films: rather than an elaborate backstory there is none and the violence is taken as is, with only your own preconceptions availed to try and make sense of the otherwise senseless experience being presented. In Martyrs, meaning was introduced, or at least the search for it was. In Ghostland, meaning is both meta, woven through the act of storytelling itself, and mindless: the reason given is that they just want to play with dolls.... We are invited to reflect upon how we tell each other and ourselves stories to rationalise what is happening to us, in the mundane day-to-day and especially at the extremes. I am reminded of Frankl's saying, on the search for meaning: ""we can endure any how as long as we have a why"". In this regard, there is a Jacob's Ladder like quality to the narrative.Instead of a backstory - of a why and a who for the what we are witnessing - we are instead focused on the foreshadowing of events (via a glimpse at a newspaper article as well as Lovecraftian allusions in the credits) which focus on subverting the home invasion trope (as Laugier did in Martyrs). Again, where was a serious reason for the home invasion to be so brutal in Martyrs - revenge - in Ghostland, there is no serious reason given: all is perverse, sadistic chaos, and ultimately play. Along with playing with the invasion trope, the ""up close and in your face"" (literally) brutal style featured in Martyrs is also present though toned down considerably. A lot of the fear is psychological as thoughts turn to the other families who had been mentioned at the beginning (a trope known as ""fridge horror""). The jump scares are thrown in as a standard, but are not the core of the horror. They are appetisers - Laugier's genre savvy way of saying - you were expecting these, but were you expecting this?This leads to a number of unexpected similarities to Martyrs:*spoiler* the break in symmetry half way through, the horrific twist and the ""what goes on in the basement""; the reveal of the psychotic break (another trope explored in Martyrs) and the general haunting malevolence.*end spoiler*I was intrigued to find those similarities conveyed through a novel story - to find elements of Martyrs sans lazy rehash. Inversion and further subversion - twisting it all up further - rather than mere repetition.So I got to thinking - is Laugier sick? Am I for enjoying his films? He seems to like pitting diminutive women (the feminine) against brute males (the masculine), yes, but he also likes *spoiler* having the women win, even though they get the beaten severely of them.*spoiler* Is this a metaphor for how man treats nature, (ecological perspective), how men treat women (feminist perspective), or is it just evidence of a twisted mind (psychoanalytic perspective)? It's hard to tell - perhaps mostly likely it is a combination. For sure, those who are offended by the storytelling may dismiss the teller as crazed. Arguably, though, his stories shed at least some light on the darkest recesses of the human psyche and it's behavioural tendencies in face of the cosmic horror that presents itself to us all when we stare into the abyss. Far from being transphobic or misogynistic, (as has been claimed by some) I find it paraphobic - playing on the very rational fear of the irrational, of the insane, the unreasonable. As far as the beatings go, I do not like or agree with them, but to the extent that that is a true feature of the world, it must also be a feature of true art.Finally, in Laugier (and perhaps myself too as a considered fan) there is a fascination with the mind's ability to transcend bodily suffering *spoiler* vis a vis the split half way through. The same is true with Anna in Martyrs, with how she is able to survive her tortures whilst the others were not.*end of spoiler* There is an obsession, perhaps, with ""spiritual redemption in physical suffering"" - viewed from different perspectives: *spoiler* in Martyrs, the psychotic break is necessary to survive, but there is an external motive to push beyond, provided by the suggestion to seek evidence of an after life , and thus transcendence. In Ghostland, the break is also necessary for the avoidance of dealing with senseless violence, but the brutality itself is meaningless and arbitrary: it isn't being inflicted for any ""higher purposes"". It just is. *end of spoiler* In both films the mind has a stark choice: shut down and accept death, or break free mentally so that you might save yourself physically - along with your loved one/s.Laugier has found his domain of interest in the bonds which make life bearable in a Lovecraftian context; in the mind's ability to overcome the horrific suffering which can be brought about in the existential chaos and cosmic nightmare we are all born into. To this end, Ghostland has an earthbound redemptive quality lacking in Martyrs. (Martyrs seeks redemption on a metaphysical plane, but that is for a different time). As such, Ghostland finds redemption in sisterly love and familial devotion, and shows us that only love (not romantic love, but genetic love) makes life, in all it's chaos and brutality, bearable and at it's limits, possible. As not everyone comes to see the world, or the cosmos, in this way, he may have a limited appeal but there is universality in what he is addressing. (For example, not everyone has anything to say on Nietzsche, but Nietzsche certainly had something to say on everyone). Laugier is evidently not the cheeriest of fellows, but his gift is to show us that, through art, we need not despair quite so much.One criticism people might have is about *spoiler* the lack of backstory in Ghostland. I felt this added an element of fridge horror all of it's own which leads you to focus more on the 'how' and the 'what' of the encounter than the 'why' and the 'who'. It is obviously a senseless and messed up story about the intense suffering it is possible to experience and endure in the world and ultimately how people overcome it. To be perfectly honest, the characters don't need a backstory: and *end of spoiler* when the villains are described as an ogre and witch, it gave a Brother's Grimm quality to it which made the story take on a folk tale quality, about the extremities of human existence and the need to be - and sometimes the impossibility of being - aware of them in order to protect yourself from them. I don't want to give away any of the ending, but suffice to say, there are some twists that were not expected!In terms of a rating, it's not great (like Martyrs), but it is definitely good and more than worthy of watching, if you can stomach intense violent scenes and psychological terror. Similar territory to Martyrs but suitably different. Scary and intense but not horrific. 6.5 or 7 out of 10.",Incident in a Ghostland
