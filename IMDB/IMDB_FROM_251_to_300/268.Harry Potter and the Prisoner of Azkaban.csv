0,TheLittleSongbird,A valiant effort bringing a truly complex book to screen!,8,21 April 2009,"This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1,Leofwine_draca,Best of the Harry Potter film series,9,3 August 2016,"The third HARRY POTTER film (still gotta get round to reading the books) and definitely a step in a different direction, with more unpredictable narrative – thank god Harry doesn't have to fight a clichéd monster at the end – and better direction by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, who makes it look darker, gloomier and more magical. It's just as great as the last two (if not better – I think this is my favourite of the three) and despite the over-lengthy running time, the interest doesn't let up. Things I noticed in this film were improved acting all around and plenty more humour than in the last two, but thankfully the humour is actually funny for a change. Hats off to Rupert Grint's Ron, the most hilarious character on screen and a wonderful acting performance. Seeing how the kids have grown up is a little alarming, however! Things are pretty unpredictable, with Harry fighting off the monstrous (and excellent CGI-animated) Dementors, wraith-like ghosts which literally suck your face off. Meanwhile there are all sorts of new and weird things happening, like Pam Ferris turning into a balloon and books that bite your fingers off, pretty much like the Luggage from Pratchett's DISCWORLD series. Added in for good measure are some excellent bonding scenes, tons of humour, a little romance here and there, and some wonderful new creatures animated by computer. The hippogriff and the werewolf, in particular, are fine. The returning actors are fantastic as ever and newcomers Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are very good indeed, although the former a little underused. Thewlis puts in his best turn yet I reckon. Enough action, hijinks, cool effects, and twists (including a little time travel thrown in for good measure) to last any film fan. Here's looking forward to the next one!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
2,SnoopyStyle,Darkest and best one yet,9,22 December 2013,"This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso Cuarón shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
3,Hitchcoc,A Dark and Impressive Film,9,3 August 2015,"Harry is maturing and becoming more and more involved in that past that has brought him here. Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
4,Horst_In_Translation,Something wicked this way comes,8,20 January 2015,"For the third Harry Potter film, director Chris Columbus was replaced with Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, recently a double Academy Award winner for ""Gravity"". The film scored nominations for its score and visual effects with the Academy, but lost out as all the other Potter movies did. Personally, I would say that Azkaban is better than the second installment and worse than the first, but easily one of the three best movies from the whole series. It is also one of the most successful films at the box office from 2004. It starts again at Potter's home as a mean relative comes to visit his aunt and uncle, insults his parents and promptly gets turned into a balloon by Potter. The knight bus (nice wordplay) arrives right in time to save the boy from his raging relatives.The action moves to Hogwarts and we find out that Hermione manages to visit courses simultaneously thanks to some time magic which becomes a crucial part of the film later on. Buckbeak and Hagrid make a nice couple as well, one of the highlights of the film. Malfoy gets into trouble as always and Harry ends up as the big hero again, sometimes a bit too heroic for my taste. Same can be said about the next movie afterward. The film has some humor again as do most of the others. We see Severus Snape in a Grandma's dress on one occasion. Looks like the new Defense-against-the-Dark-Arts (played by David Thewlis) teacher is quite a joker. I was not too impressed by the first hour of the film, but things get better quickly afterward. Also the snow at Hogwarts (snowball fight) and paper plane parts are nicely done. Trelawney (Emma Thompson), another teacher at Hogwarts, is really creepy during one scene, almost reminded me of a horror sequence from ""The Exorcist"". One of the sad highlights of the movie is Buckbeak's killing although it gets reversed and we don't even see it.There were a couple negative points too, however. One would be how Harry all of a sudden uses magic against Snape when he encounters Oldman's character, who Harry thought would want to kill him. I found that whole scene pretty cringeworthy and illogical. And as I said earlier, I had some problems with the way Potter is always displayed like some huge powerful superhero. Radcliffe's mediocre acting doesn't help much. Michael Gambon takes over from hereon as Dumbledore for Richard Harris, who died before this was made. The film's biggest strength is possibly the ending. The last hour of the film is among the best the Potter franchise has to offer and all the little details about Harry and Hermione reliving the actual events are done with so much precision that I applaud the makers of this project, for example how he did see himself and not his dad. Only question I asked myself is why would he want to live with Oldman's character if he saw his dad who was supposedly alive (again)? But no more spoilers now. Just watch it yourself. You won't be disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
5,claudio_carvalho,"Although Being a Good Adventure, It Is the Weakest Story of the Trilogy",8,19 December 2004,"While travelling for his third year in Hogwarts, the grown-up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is advised that the criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison Azkaban. Sirius Black is blamed for being responsible for the death of Harry's parents and their best friend, Peter Pettigrew. In the train, Harry Potter faces an evil Dementor, sort of creature who drains good memories and life of their victims and which was sent to chase Sirius Black, but he is saved by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Once in Hogwarts, he realizes that the school is surrounded by Dementors, sent to protect Harry Potter and the students against Sirius Black. After many adventures, the truth is disclosed. Although being a good adventure, I found ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the weakest story of the trilogy. There are many situations used in the other two stories, like the game they play, or the bad treatment of Harry Potter's relatives, the character of Emma Thompson is too silly and not funny and Daniel Radcliffe does not correspond in some dramatic situations. Emma Watson, in the role of Hermion Granger, has another excellent performance. It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years. However, this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban"" (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
6,kosmasp,Gary Oldman,7,10 October 2007,"I don't know why I pointed him out, but I liked his character here. If you've seen the movie or know the books (I personally haven't done the latter), than you know his serious ... excuse me Sirius Black character is very detailed and fun to play (for him) and to watch (for us the viewers).Talking about watching, if you are about to watch this, I can safely assume that have seen or read the previous installments of the franchise, so you know quite a bit about Potter. And you will notice here, that the overall tone just got darker. Which is a good thing! Still family friendly enough though, while Potter remains a ""kid"" magician that has to face another challenge (almost) day by day ...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
7,classicsoncall,"""A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who've forgotten how to listen.""",8,6 May 2012,"I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the quality of the reviews for this film from fans who follow both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter franchise. To say that they've invested a significant amount of time into their hobby would be an understatement. I don't bring that same intensity to my viewing of the Potter films, for me it's a Saturday evening family entertainment, and the franchise has served well so far. This one had an interesting balance of humor and a more serious dark side, and youngsters might actually wind up with a nightmare or two after watching 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I remember as a kid being scared of a tree in the middle of a meadow that someone told me would make a grab if you got too close, so I made it a point not to get too close.I also like the whimsical play with words used to describe various components of the story, like the Monster Book of Monsters, and the Accidental Magic Reversal Department. They're introduced into the story with no fanfare, simply as a matter of fact, a part of life for anyone attending the Hogwarts School. Those dementors though, pretty creepy apparitions if I have to say so myself.The first two Harry Potter movies are the only ones I ever saw when they were first released, so I'm behind the curve here as far as most viewers go. That turns out to be a benefit however, as I can watch the series in order at my own pace and not have to wait a long time for the next installment. It's interesting to watch Harry, Hermione, Ron and the rest of the students grow up and into their roles, and consider it a pretty remarkable achievement for J.K. Rowling to have invented this creative ongoing story.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
8,gavin6942,Black Could Be Anywhere,8,2 May 2011,"It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry. Of the first three Harry Potter films, this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere shifts to a darker place, which may be partly due to the story and partly due to the new director. Besides the darker images, I like the characters introduced here -- Professor Lupin, the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor thus far, and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is my favorite character in the entire series. We also have the Hippogriff, which is a fantastic creature, and Doby the house elf. And a time travel element that plays out just as effectively -- and with more sense -- than ""Timecrimes"".Harry Potter purists may have some complaints here. Hermione now has normal girl hair rather than the wild, frizzy hair, making her less of an outcast that she may be supposed to be. And they spend very, very little time in their school uniforms. Of course, they are more often outside of the school grounds, so that explains itself. I was curious why Ginny never appears even once. Perhaps she does not appear in the book, but at this point she should be becoming a more important character.There is a line in the film that really stands out: ""Black could be anywhere."" I do not wish to dwell on this, but I cannot help but wonder if this is some sort of inside joke...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
9,lee_eisenberg,thank God that changing directors didn't diminish the movie's quality,10,12 January 2006,"Now that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his third year, he has new things with which to contend: Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and escaped prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), in jail for murdering Harry's parents.When I read the book, I realized at the end that there was a clue to one of the things that happens. Maybe it's harder for the movie to present that, but they still do a good job with the movie. The cast all does a great job once again. Part 4 was equally good too. It just goes to show how much the Harry Potter franchise is part of our cultural heritage. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is dynamite.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
10,jboothmillard,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,8,14 March 2005,"The previous two films were slightly lighter in tone, and this is when it does become much more than a family film, all the following films go up to the 12 certificate, this is obviously the third instalment, from director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) runs away from home after losing his patience living with the Dursleys, and he gets picked up by the Knight Bus, taking him to friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). They all hear that supposedly dangerous criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has done the impossible and escaped from Azkaban Prison, and he apparently has links with Lord Voldermort, and there are rumours he wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. On the way to Hogwarts the three friends and other passengers on the train are encountered by Dementors, the dark creatures that guard Azkaban, they are looking for Black, but they are not thinking when trying to suck out souls from people. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon, replacing Richard Harris who died shortly after the second film) announces these Dementors around, that Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is the new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher, he saved Harry's life from a Dementor. Lessons carry on like normal, including tea life reading from Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and learning to fly Buckbeak the Hippogriff from Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), he is saddened the creature is sentenced to death after attacking Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Professor Lupin teaches a class where a creature called a Boggart is used, this creature turns into whatever someone can think of in the moment that scares them the most, and the given spell defeats it with laughter, Harry unfortunately think of a Dementor and is saved again. He also gets attacked by one during Quittitch, so The Professor decides he needs to learn to defend himself against them, and he also gets a Marauder's Map as he can't go without parental permission to Hogsmeade. After Harry gains more of a want to kill Sirius Black overhearing a conversation, where there is mention that he is his godfather, he, Ron and Hermoine visit Hagrid sympathising that Buckbeak will be killed, and then they run after Ron's rat Scabbers, also avoiding being caught by Dumbledore and others. Chasing him they find a secret passageway under the Whomping Willow that leads to the Shrieking Shack, and there they find a dog that is actually Sirius Black transformed, and Lupin, Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who was Scabbers, also turn up. During the conversation they find out that Black is innocent, it was in fact Pettigrew that committed the crime, but when Lupin sees the full moon and transforms unintentionally into a werewolf he is allowed to escape. Harry and Black are almost finished off again by Dementors, but before fainting Harry thinks he saw his father James defeat them with the Patronus spell, he wakes and is advised by Dumbledore that he and Hermoine should use time to save a life or two. Hermoine reveals she has a time-turner, which explains why she is never late and appears in her lessons, and they have to save Buckbeak, retracing all their steps so as not to be spotted by their past selves, and not change too much. So Buckbeak is saved, the Executioner did not actually kill him, and they wait for the events in the Shrieking Shack to pass, make Lupin the werewolf come their direction to save their past selves, and it isn't Harry's father that saved him, but Harry himself, and they return to the present fine. In the end Sirius decides that it is best that he stays in hiding as he has not been proved innocent of the crime, and the final scene sees that he sent Harry a new Firebolt broomstick, the fastest in the world. Also starring Dame Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Pam Ferris as Aunt Marge, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Dawn French as Fat Lady in Painting, Julie Christie as Madame Rosmerta, Robert Hardy as Cornelius Fudge, Paul Whitehouse as Sir Cadogan (scene cut out), Lenny Henry as Shrunken Head, Warwick Davis as Wizard, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. The young actors grew up very fast and become much more mature, the other actors in the cast do great too, the story is easy to follow, it may be a little odd without Lord Voldermort but it doesn't matter, and of course the scene stealing special effects and action sequences are fantastic, a great fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Written Music for John Williams and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA Audience Award and the Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design.

11,ccthemovieman-1,My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Films,9,17 February 2008,"I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

13,Quinoa1984,Cuaron and company rise this to the level of near pop-art; Harry Potter moving on up in style and substance,9,15 July 2007,"After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director's seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It's an interesting choice, as he had only done one 'family-friendly' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I've yet to read 'Azkaban' or any of the books, from what I've heard from those that have it's a book that doesn't seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging 'plot'. We're only learning so much about Potter's lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the ""dark lord."" But through this set-up, Cuaron does the most extraordinary things, surpassing Columbus's big-epic aspirations and making it...still epic, yes, but with a more ambitious scop in directorial style. Even when things get at their most conventional, there's a full sense of balancing whimsy and true dark intonations. I loved how he and the visual effects crew dealt with the Dementors, the shape shifters who act as a double-edged sword with Hogwarts and Potter. I haven't seen the film in a while, but I still remember so clearly many scenes and shots, and how the filmmaker this time really brings on a strong presence that actually, if anything, enriches the material of the book.There's other small pleasures as well: Emma Thompson wonderfully plays a scatter-shot professor who looks like she could get lost in a grocery store; the beginning scenes, where the pig-headed family that's taken in Harry all this time getting their just desserts; the Quiddich battle, which ends up being a little unexpected in some ways, and is actually much ahead in suspense than in even the first film, which introduced the whole bloody concept; the acting by David Thewlis, usually known for more idiosyncratic character roles in movies indie and mainstream, who despite all appearances is also ambiguous. Best of all is Oldman as Sirius Black, and for the brief moments he's on screen (and, to be sure, how sentimental the dialog veers towards when he and Potter sit down for a talk on the roof), the screen does the clichéd move of ""lighting up"". Just the poster image alone, with ""have you seen this man"" is ominous, even as there is almost the feeling that he isn't quite as evil as might be let on. The levels of darkness in the film are upped a bit- this is the first time that the Harry Potter series has to get a little more mature, even still on ""family-friendly"" terms- and cast and crew are up completely to the challenge.In fact, this might still be my favorite of the Potter films (Order of Phoenix close second), as it does capture the levels of wonder at such a concept that a wizard school offers, and expands further into the crevices of the psychologies of the characters and the possibilities of the identity of evil or good or what might be mixed around. 8.5/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

15,sunwarrior13,A Harry Potter Classic,10,22 October 2012,"In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. This movie features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. This fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón is based on the novel of the same title by J. K. Rowling. It is the third installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by Chris Columbus, David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe. The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and wants to murder him. It is somewhat of a departure from its predecessors, and particularly beloved among fans for its surprise ending. Prisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black,portrayed by Gary Oldman who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration.Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. Upon his return to school, however, Harry is relatively unconcerned with Black. Run by Albus Dumbledore who is widely regarded as the most powerful wizard of the age as Hogwarts is renowned for its safety. Harry's nonchalance eventually turns to blind rage after accidentally learning the first of Black's many secrets during a field trip to a neighboring village. Of course, a loose serial killer is only one of the problems plaguing the bespectacled wizard's third year back at school such as the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban prison have been employed at Hogwarts to protect the students, but their mere presence sends Harry into crippling fainting spells. With the help of his friends Ron and Hermione, and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin, Harry struggles to thwart the Dementors, find Sirius Black, and uncover the mysteries of the night that left him orphaned.Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise.Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the art-house success of Y Tu Mamá También, Cuarón proves a perfect choice to guide Harry and his friends into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown, he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action.The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination, The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Harry Potter-movie classic that deserves the highest rating.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
16,studioAT,The magic darkens,7,8 July 2011,"After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

18,hitchcockthelegend,"A wonderfully put together film, both in style and substance.",9,19 March 2008,"Well for me at least, having just had my third viewing of this, the third instalment in the Harry Potter franchise, and I'm pleased to report that now I'm finally at peace with how I feel about Alfonso Cuarón's delightful picture. When I first watched this film upon its DVD release, I found myself yearning for the children to be children again, it was as if the magic had gone, for the reason I liked the first two films was because they allowed me to be childlike again, was the franchise losing it's fantastical ability to draw the viewer in and make us feel magically childlike? Thankfully some four years later I'm positively beaming about it's wonderful adult aura, the professionally handled structure, and yes, the delightful magical charm at every turn.The Prisoner Of Azkaban finds Harry aged 13, back at Hogwarts with his friends he finds out that a murderous prisoner has escaped from Azkaban prison, and he's heading straight for Harry.The film suffers from its young stars not quite developing their acting skills to befit the burgeoning onset of their now teenage characters, but it's a minor complaint that's forgiven because the new additions to the adult cast are positively fabulous. One could possibly decry that Gary Oldman & David Thewlis are sadly underused, and to a degree that would be a fair gripe, but both men leave such an indelible impact it helps offset the sad loss of Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Into Dumbledore's big robe comes Michael Gambon, and although he is solid, watchable, and graceful enough, he could never have hoped to achieve the magnificent aura that Harris brought to the role.Directing wise I think it's fair to say that Alfonso Cuarón was blessed with a far better script than Christopher Columbus had for the first two Potter movies, where here we get a gripping denouement and certainly the best finale of the franchise thus far. Certainly this is a darker movie, where threats of death loom large and moody imagery features throughout, but credit has to go to Cuarón for neatly pulling it all together, be it for the snow bound sequences, a Dementor attack, or a sumptuous wide angled shot of the rolling Scottish hills, it's a beautifully crafted piece of work that thrills for adults and kids alike. Stuart Craig's sets are a joy to behold, Michael Seresin's wonderfully mystical cinematography brings the whole locale into your lap, and John Williams naturally scores it with deftness personified.

19,jotix100,Y Alfonso Cuaron tambien!,8,23 June 2004,"The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous.Credit must go to Mr. Cuaron in perhaps getting Daniel Radcliffe to be a bit less stiff than in the other two films before. Also, Mr. Cuaron has the advantage of bringing together most of the best actors of the English stage and cinema.David Thewlis excels as Professor Lupin. This excellent actor has never been better and it's a shame we don't get to see him much. What can one say of the tremendously gifted Alan Rickman? His contribution is also vital to the film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is amazing. So is Timothy Spall, in the small role of Peter Pettigrew.On the other hand, the female roles are a bit anemic. One would have liked to have seen more of the incomparable Julie Christie, who is seen through a glass darkly! Emma Thompson is hilarious as Professor Sybil Trelawney.Let's hope that now that Mr. Cuaron has been found, the producers entrust him with the next films.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
20,CinemaSerf,The battle lines are starting to be drawn...,8,26 February 2020,"I recall the controversy as this was released. Alfonso Cuarón consciously decided to darken this film, and the light-hearted stories of the first two are replaced by an edgier approach to this tale for our wizarding trio. The world's most wanted wizard ""Sirius Black"" (Gary Oldman) escapes from ""Azkaban"" allegedly bent on the destruction of ""Harry"". The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the ""Dementors"" that are supposed to protect the innocent and the ""Boggart"" all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of ""Valdemort"" becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now. Michael Gambon takes over the role of Valdemort without quite the presence of Richard Harris, but we can tell now that this series is heading for murky, dangerous, waters...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
21,dbborroughs,One of the Best Fantasies on Film,10,5 June 2004,"I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all.Granted the acting is at times off by the two male leads,and Malfoy is too much of a wimp but for the most part this is everything that the first two films should have been but weren't. I have to credit the fact that this film was not directed by Chris Columbus, who is too light weight a director and was too faithful to the material. That is not the case here...Here the hero is director Alfonso Cuarón, who made great dark fantasy by handling the material the way that it should have been handled. He made changes in the source, but kept everything focused on characters and plot. Best of all he made a movie that seems real, no matter how fantastic it gets, something that never happened in the first two films.I want to recommend this film to everyone, but I'm pretty certain you'll be best off if you watch one of the first two films to bring you up speed. It's worth it, trust me.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

23,Boba_Fett1138,Different but not necessarily better.,7,4 January 2005,"This third Harry Potter movie is different from the previous two movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker and much more mature but not better than its predecessors.Yet again there are several things wrong with this Harry Potter movie. The movie starts of too slow with a completely wrong pace due to some poor editing. Once the movie really gets started you'll notice that there are several things different about this movie compared to the first two. No, I'm not just talking about the visual style or the fact that Harry and his friends are wearing 'normal' clothes, I'm mainly talking about the two things that I missed most in the movie; The humor and the adult cast. What made the first two Harry Potter movies excellent to watch was the perfect English adult cast with many big names. In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the adult cast is heavily underused. Gary Oldman who I normally love was way too plain and boring in this movie, I actually really wish now that he hadn't been in it. Odd thing is that they let the main adult character play by the fairly unknown actor David Thewlis. Micheal Gambon does his best but he really wasn't Dumbledore to me. Richard Harris scene's as Dumbledore always brought a smile on my face and I really enjoyed every scene with him, Gambon just plays the role very plain and I just couldn't like it...Problem is that the story takes itself too serious. The first two Harry Potter movies had a fun feeling especially between the three main characters and some good humor. In ""Harry Potter the Prisoner of Azkaban"" everything is far more serious and less fun. The story also gave me the feeling that it wasn't very original all. It seems like J.K. Rowling uses a bit too many parts and elements from different fantasy genres.Good news is that the special effects are looking great. Another great thing was that there were some nicely done acting sequence's such as the werewolf scene which I found quite good.It is still good entertainment, especially for children and the Potter fans, although the movie probably is too scary for the very young ones.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
24,evanston_dad,The First Potter Film to Feel Like a Film,8,8 October 2010,"Alfonso Cuaron picks up the reigns of the blockbuster film franchise from Chris Columbus. The result is the first Harry Potter movie to feel like a movie and have its own cinematic vision.I haven't read any of the Potter books, and those who have claim that Azkaban isn't as faithful to the source material as the first two movies. Whatever. This movie works in a way the first two didn't, and if story is left out, the excising was done very well, because the film has a narrative drive to it that makes it immensely exciting and clear as a bell to follow. One of the film's highlights is the time travel sequence, helped in no end by Cuaron's swooping, active camera and John Williams' ticking stopwatch score.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are introduced in the large roles of Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, and the movie belongs to them.

Its imprisonment has to do with letting go. In this case the prisoner of Azkaban is rumored to be responsible for the death of Harry's parents and he has escaped. Alfonso Cuaron takes over directing after Chris Columbus successfully translated the first two. Cuaron previously made such films as Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Daniel Radcliffe plays Potter who learns the secret of his parents' death but also faces other fears. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are marvelous as his teenage companions who assist him in his quest. Gary Oldman steals scenes as the escape prisoner who not only has a secret regarding Harry's family, but also a specific power of his own. David Thewlis is also a great addition as a new professor who has a secret of his own. Exquisite special effects include a monstrous tree, werewolves, a griffin, a creature that is half horse and half eagle, and a trip back in time that serves different perspectives. Solid entertainment may be too dark for young viewers. Some parents may wish to use discernment with regard to the light-hearted use of witchcraft but the film is magical and adventurous at any rate.

26,HotToastyRag,Directing and screenwriter stand out in perfection,10,17 June 2019,"Everyone's favorite of the Harry Potter movies is the first one, right? A close second place for me and my family is the third installment: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only is the story very interesting, fast-paced, and full of mysterious twists, but director Alfonso Cuaron turns ordinary exposition shots into works of art. After seeing the same castle and sets the past two movies, it's intriguing to see them filmed differently. It reminds you to pay attention to details as well as the big picture, and it subtly tells you that you'll need to see the movie at least twice to understand its full potential. There's a famous transition he films through the clock tower that's continually gorgeous no matter how many times you've seen it.Onto the story: Once again, Daniel Radcliffe starts the movie unhappy in the home of his aunt and uncle, Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths. This time around, since he's entering his teenage years, he gets fed up and runs away to the wizarding world before summer vacation has ended. Everyone's worried about him because there's been a prison break from Alcatraz-I mean, Azkaban-and a dangerous criminal, Gary Oldman, is on the loose. Entering his third year of school with all that on his mind, he still has to deal with the hostility of his least favorite teacher, Alan Rickman, taunts from the school bully, Tom Felton, and the presence of some very scary guards hanging around the school who are on the lookout for Gary but might kill anyone else on accident. Hogwarts sure isn't the safest school out there, is it?Believe me, that's just the start of the plot, and as the film progresses, you'll be endlessly fascinated by the story. Screenwriter Steve Kloves managed to sew the scenes together tightly without making anything feel rushed, and since the audience already knows the ins and outs of the Hogwarts world, there's no time spent on explanations or exposition. There are a few new additions in this movie, of course: the Marauder's Map that shows the locations of everyone on campus, Hagrid's pet Hippogriff, the speedy public transit for the wizarding world, the Dementors and the special spell that repels them, and the new ""guest star"" teacher, ¬¬¬David Thewlis, who's very sympathetic and easy to like. Keep an eye out for Julie Christie, who has a cameo as a pub owner, Emma Thompson as the ""psychic"" divinity teacher, and Timothy Spall.The only blot of imperfection on an otherwise imperfect film is the replacement of Richard Harris with Michael Gambon. Even if you managed to get used to him in later films, it's quite a shock to have him installed in this movie. Not only does he look nothing like his predecessor, but he's fashioned differently and delivers every line as if he thought to himself, ""How wouldn't Richard Harris have said this line?"" If he truly did have a vastly different interpretation of the character, it would have been nice to ease the audience into it. The replacement couldn't have been helped, unless a huge change to the rest of the stories was made-had the school given a very sad but touching funeral for Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall been promoted to Headmistress, the rest of the stories still would have been functional, and with an added boost for feminist viewers-but we'll all miss Richard Harris's twinkling blue eyes and kind, sensitive delivery.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

But this film doesn't feel that dark, yet still managed to be less magical and less fun then the previous two films. Granted with ""Chamber of Secrets"", the bar was sat extremely high, but this film is definitely missing Chris Columbus's touch. The good acting is there (Gary Olman is great in damn near everything), the good special effects are there, and it's nice to see Rupert Grint growing into his own skin a bit and not looking so weird looking. The substance so much displayed in the first two isn't there, the heart isn't there (not in the same degree at least). This is not to say the the third film isn't good, I DO like it.

28,JamesHitchcock,The Series Darkens,7,18 April 2010,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, and marks a new departure for that series in several ways. It was the first in the series to be released in summer; the original idea was for the series to consist of seven films, one of which was to be released at Christmas every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule proved to be over-ambitious and the third film was released in midsummer 2004 rather than Christmas 2003.The film also saw a new director, Alfonso Cuarón taking over from Chris Columbus who had directed the first two films, and a new actor in the key role of Albus Dumbledore, Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris, who had died in the intervening period.Finally, the film marked a darkening in the tone of the series, something possibly attributable to the change of director but also to the content of the original novel. The ""Azkaban"" of the title is the prison which holds wizards who have violated the laws of magic, generally by using their powers for evil ends, and the ""prisoner"" is Sirius Black, a wizard who has succeeded in escaping from the prison. It is assumed that Black is a supporter of Lord Voldemort (the arch-villain of J. K. Rowling's universe) and that his intention is to kill Harry Potter.The perceptible ""darkening"" in this episode is both literal and metaphorical. In a literal sense the film is bleaker in appearance that its two predecessors, with many scenes being shot at night or in dim light. Cuarón uses a much darker visual palette than did Columbus. (David Yates uses a similar palette in the most recent Potter film, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""). In the metaphorical sense the film is certainly more scary than anything in the first two films. Although this is the only film in the series in which Voldemort does not appear directly, much of the plot revolves around Rowling's most terrifying creations, the Dementors.Harry, who in the first two episodes was played as a young boy, now emerges as a rather rebellious, truculent teenager, and Daniel Radcliffe does well to suggest the difference. There are good contributions from two newcomers to the series, Gary Oldman as Sirius and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, the seemingly mild-mannered new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who turns out to be a practising werewolf. (Rowling's names often have some relevance to the character's personality or attributes, Remus being one of the twins in Roman mythology who were raised by a she-wolf). There is another good contribution from an established cast member, Robbie Coltrane, as the genial West Country giant Rubeus Hagrid, now promoted to Teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Gambon, however, does not yet seem quite at home with the difficult task of taking over a role first created by another actor. (He was to improve in subsequent episodes).Overall, I did not enjoy the film quite as much as the first two, possibly because by 2004 the concept no longer seemed as fresh and new as it had done in 2001. There is, however, a lot to enjoy; scenes I found particularly memorable include the journey through the streets of London on that triple-decker bus and Harry's ride on the Hippogriff Buckbeak. This was also the first film which revealed that Harry's parents were named James and Lily; as my name is James and my wife is Lily we have decided that should we have a son we will name him Harry. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,8,11 July 2007,"OK, finished the third installment of the Harry Potter series and still doing fine, lol. I have to say that this was a great installment into the series, I still haven't read the books, so I cannot judge on those, only the films. So the Prisoner of Azkaban I must say had a much more dark side of the story, the kids are now a little more grown up and facing much more terrifying things as the head on to become great sorcerers. The cast is still doing great things together, same as the other films with a great addition of Gary Oldman. The story seemed also a bit stronger than the other Harry Potter films.After having trouble at home once again with Harry Potter's adoptive family, he runs away sick of being called a freak and wanting to be with his own. Only now entering his third year at Hogwart, he is about to face a great enemy, Sirus Black, a murderer who would like to see Harry dead to avenge the sorcerers. Not to mention his constant feud with his schoolmate, Draco, won't stop, but he has his friends to help him lead on into a world where Harry will live and become a great sorcerer.The Prisoner of Azkaban was extremely entertaining and kept my total attention. I loved watching him having to learn how to control and use the bird like creature in his first class and just seeing finally Draco getting his. I would very much recommend The Prisoner of Azkaban, it was a great installment and I cannot wait for the Goblet of Fire, from the rating, I'm extremely excited to see what that is about.8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

31,KineticSeoul,"Isn't really faithful to the book compared to the previous movies, but it's fast paced and keeps your attention for the most part",6,18 July 2011,"It's a shame some aspect of the movie is missing this time around, at least a lot compared to the previous two movies. Although this movie is missing some scenes I wanted to see from the novel, but I liked the fast pacing of this movie at the same time. But being more faithful to the novel while being fast paced would have been nice. Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the fact that the original actor that played Albus Dumbledore is replaced because of the unfortunate passing away of Richard Harris. The new Dumbledore lacks a lot of aspects that Richard Harris showed while playing the head Wizard of Hogwarts. The new guy simply didn't have the soft and yet someone you should never cross thing going for him, nor did he have that certain look in his eyes that showed wisdom. Yes, for some movies that is based on a book that doesn't go EXACTLY like the book doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But like I said those scenes would have made this movie much better in my opinion. Even if I didn't read the 3rd book in this franchise and saw this movie after watching the previous two movies. I would have thought something was missing in this movie regardless. I personally thought it could fit a lot of the parts in the book in this movie since this movie isn't close to the 3 hour mark. On a positive note though besides the fast pacing, is how this movie somewhat atones for the stuff that is missing from the book and makes it a bit more lively and actually has a bit of satire. Everything seemed slightly more sharp including the humor. Also addition of Gary Oldman is always a plus.6.9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
32,OllieSuave-007,Another magical sequel.,8,15 March 2014,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is the third film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about Harry Potter In his third year at Hogwarts, where he discovers the convicted mass murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Black is known as Lord Voldemort's most devoted follower, and he's after Harry to avenge Voldemort. But, Harry soon discovers that there is a bigger culprit behind the conviction and that there is a strong connection between Harry and Sirius.While there are some light-hearted scenes like the previous two films, this movie has more suspense, drama and action as it delves upon more elements of the Dark Lord and Harry's past. I think the actors did a more dramatic and compelling performance in this one, and witches Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Gamdon) return in this sequel, providing another mystical performance. The plot is good and is more exciting, and the special effects were decent.

As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes). The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination. One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.Although many people have noted a ""darker"" element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think ""Prisoner"" is less intense than the second - and best - installment, ""Chamber of Secrets."" Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more ""Potter"" movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose. I guess only future installments will truly tell.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
34,thesar-2,Something Wicked Finally Came,5,3 March 2013,"Does this series get better and better as everyone proclaims? Well, yes and, sadly no.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sure as hell started that way – good, that is. The film actually, for once, felt like a real film, meaning well made. Though the previous two entries were not an amateur's projects, this one showed real signs a higher talent took the wand and ran with it. The cinematography was my first indication – it was crisp, expansive and absolutely gorgeous. It almost made me wonder if Hogwart's Castle had ""magically"" relocated in the year since the previous entry.That was the first sign that I noticed we were heading in the right direction. The second was a visually older Harry, inside and out. He's running thin on wonder and amazement and he's finally showing signs of frustration. Good. Let it out, Harry. But don't go all Anakin on usThirdly, with the locations, most names of creatures, teachers and bleachers (in the backdrop of the never-ending Quidditch matches) and the themes, score or otherwise, established, finally the storytelling can settle in and have fununtil roughly the last third of the movie. I wouldn't necessarily say that's ""where it all fell apart"" but it was a rather tame and lame finale(s). Sure, I guess, Harry can't always thwart a giant snake (#2) or play a game of chess (#1) as the final battle, but this one – no spoilers – was so ho-hum and was completed with one of the most ridiculous final second shot of a movie that I've seen in a long time. I was half tempted to literally erase half a star from my rating for that final moment before the credits rolled. But, as much as it didn't fit and as much as I hated it, I'll just mark it as a ""WTF"" moment in Harry History. (Like when Harry stole a sucker. I didn't know he was a thief. ??)Leading up to that disappointing third act, there were sure signs of the book here. Now, I haven't, nor plan to, read past book one, but the utter randomness of multiple scenes and characters indicated to me they were just trying to appease the book fans. Although, I'm sure there are a great majority sooo sad that everysingleplottwistanddialogue wasn't involved in every movie. GET OVER IT. I was ecstatic that this was the shortest one, albeit still too long at 2 hours 21 minutes and I DO NOT care to see a 6-hour miniseries of each book (or 42 hours) to ensure every single line was shown on screen.I digressOnce again, Harry's being abused by his adopted family and takes the long journey back to school after summer break. Upon arrival, once again, he's warned not to be there and once again he ignores such ""rubbish"" – I'm guessing he's thinking. And finally, once again, Harry & Pals must combat a mystery/terror that threatens to shut down the most unsafe harbor of mutants since Professor Xavier's school, long before J.K. Rowling thought of Hogwarts.Sure, I made that last paragraph out to sound like a complaint, but I confess: it doesn't really bother me. I understand this is the common theme, at least from the first three chapters. What I like is, aside from the obligatory (too long) 25+ minute running time of getting him to Hogwarts, is that once there, the mystery starts sooner and sooner with each film. I'm an impatient guy and can only take so many shots of the kids learning proving to me that A: there's teachers, B: there's classes and C: there's students. Yeah, I get it: it's a school, but can we get back to what Harry needs to solve?Oh, and I also understand we need comic relief, but I've never been a fan of the Three Stooges. The appropriately named Ron Weasley is definitely one of the three stooges and is completely useless. It's painfully obvious that Harry won't be dating miss know-it-all, Hermione, but it's still best they drop him like a bad spell.I know, I know, all of this sounds like criticisms. Allow me to backtrack – for the first two-thirds, I did enjoy this feature and I liked the addition of David Thewlis and I always like both Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore – although, Richard Harris was much better in the first two.As much as I wanted to proclaim this series has ""increasingly gotten better"" when it was about an hour over, it was that dreaded middle-of-the-road final act that lowered my score to make it actually slightly dip in quality from Harry Potter #2. I said slightly as I still awarded both 3/5 stars.Here's to Gobleting some Fire for the next movie(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
35,cherold,The difference between a workmanlike adaptation and cinema art,8,5 June 2005,"The first two Harry Potter movies were faithful, efficient adaptations of their respective books. I enjoyed them, although since I had read the books and they just retold the story of those books I felt they would have been more fun for someone who did not already know the story.This third movie is something entirely different. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who helmed the brilliant, magical A Little Princess, Cuaron adds a lyrical quality to the magic and brings Hogswart alive in a way Chris Columbus, the competent but unimaginative director of movies Like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, failed to do in his movies. Columbus brought the sort of magic you get from a stage magician, Cuaron makes magic come alive.Skimming the other reviews I get the impression a lot of people were put of by the darkness of this film. Having read all the Potter books I am ahead of the movies in terms of grimness: I am so used to the darkness of later books that it didn't even occur to me this one was dark. I must warn those who don't read the books that things are going to get much, much grimmer in the succeeding movies. Honestly I wish the books weren't getting so brutally tragic, but I still find them fascinating.Sadly, none of the future Potter movies are to be directed by Cuaron, and I won't be surprised if this is the most artful of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I have been waiting quit a while to finally get the chance to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I don't know when I've been more disappointed with a movie.From the very start, the movie feels rushed. It's amazing that the longest of the Harry Potter books was turned into the shortest of the Harry Potter movies. There's just so much that's left out. Take Harry's crush on an older student, Cho Chang. This relationship is so important to the next book and she is not even mentioned in this installment. I realize that to include everything in the book would have meant a 6 hour movie, but to leave out plot points like this is unforgivable.Unless your a fan of the books or have seen the first two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban must be a very difficult movie to follow. I mean I've read the book twice and still had trouble keeping up with what was going on. Take the line spoken by one of Harry's teachers with no explanation, ""Five points from Gryffindor!"" I can just imagine someone asking themselves ""Five Points? What Five Points?"" or ""Gryffindor? What the hell is a Gryffindor?"" I realize that my biggest complaint about the movie is something that is difficult to put into words, but (and excuse the pun) the magic is gone. I sat in wonderment of the magic power the first two movies had. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban didn't come close to giving me that same feeling.

The Harry Potter series (especially the last two installments) including Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban gives children and adults who love fantasy a very serious epic with no holds barred, it doesn't feel toned down or edited for content but rather very real and intense and scary at times, exciting, masterful, and brilliant. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón takes the helm from director Chris Columbus and gives the series a serious boost in maturity which it definitely needed. Harry is older, his friends are older, the story is darker and his fans watching it have aged too quite likely. Cuarón gives it exactly the dark edge it needs. There is no doubt he is a far more mature director and perhaps even too dark himself to take on a children's movie such as this but he does it and flawlessly.One of the amazing and terrific things about the Harry Potter films is the cast that always seem to return for every film so far and the addition of new characters as well. Daniel Radcliffe takes his third turn as the boy wizard Harry Potter and nails it home once again. Radcliffe was absolutely BORN for this role. He might get typecast for the rest of his life but he should be blown away by his accomplishment of embodying a literary legend such as Harry Potter. His intensity, sadness, power, hidden talents all shine through and no one else could nail the part like he does. Rupert Grint also returns as Harry's best friend, the terminally nervous and jittery Ron Weasley. His role seemed to be slightly less in Prisoner of Azkaban and that might be perhaps because his role is comedic at times and takes a bit away from the edge of the dark tone of the film. Still he does a terrific job and really nails his role as well. The third in the trio is the terrific Emma Watson. I wish she would do something else in films because I think she is extremely talented. Her performance as Hermione Granger not only gives young girls someone to root for but really puts a bite into the story. She's feisty, strong, easily stands up to the testosterone driven cast and she's fantastic. Veteran actor Michael Gambon graciously and flawlessly takes over the role of headmaster Albus Dumbledore from the late, great Richard Harris. Not only does Gambon look the part (kudos to the make-up and costume teams) but he does such an incredible job and performing the role exactly the way Harris did. A strong, mysterious, caring, powerful wizard. You don't even notice the switch between actors which truly is great compliment to not only Richard Harris but Gambon as well. Robbie Coltrane returns in one of my favorite roles as Hagrid, a loving, caring giant of a man whom the kids always turn to in trouble. Now a professor Hagrid doesn't get a whole lot screen time but still shines when he's on there. Coltrane embodies the character like the rest of the them. Alan Rickman returns as Snape, the professor everyone loves to hate. Rickman doesn't get a lot of screen time either but Snape is a great character and Rickman is perfect for it. The two big additions to the cast are David Thewlis as Harry's new found mentor Remus Lupin. Thewlis fits right in and has great chemistry opposite Harry Potter alumni especially Daniel Radcliffe. And Gary Oldman who until recently I have never been a fan of. I always found him rather dry and boring, and always confused him with John Malkovich for some reason?? But Oldman does a terrific job and is barely recognizable as the misunderstood Prisoner Sirius Black. He is convincing as being a terrible murderer but easily switches to being misunderstood and cared for by the audience as well as Harry.There are so many brilliant things about The Harry Potter series. I happen to think just now with the third and fourth installment the series is really taking off. Prisoner of Azkaban is an easy 10/10 and Goblet of Fire was EVEN BETTER!! a 10+/10. For a film series to get better three or four films in is a rarity especially this incredible!! The special effects are far beyond special effects. They create this incredible world at Hogwarths and beyond that just sucks you in and makes you a part of it and makes your imagination come alive. The beautifully created creatures such as the incredible Buckbeak, and the trees that come alive, the castle, the school, the magic...everything just falls into place and creates this epic with children in mind but so brilliantly done that every single person can adore it!! Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is brilliance unprecedented in film history. You must see this installment!! 10/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
38,ElMaruecan82,"The ""Harry Potter"" franchise at (broomstick's) cruising speed...",9,18 November 2018,"Animaguses and werewolves, a flying hypogriff, which is a pleonasm, night buses, talking paintings, time turners and so on and so forth... all these exciting products of J.K. Rowling's fruitful imagination blending with centuries of fantasy literature, bloom as smoothly as naturally in the third opus of the Harry Potter's series: ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I liked it a lot and I was surprised by how much I liked it.Indeed, after two movies, I started to notice patterns within the structure ... sometimes they enhanced my excitement, some others, I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to experience them again. For instance, I knew the film would start at the Dursleys and I was wondering what kind of mischief Harry would inadvertently cause, I wasn't disappointed and Pam Ferris sure got what she deserved for insulting his parents. I also liked that for once it was Harry going out by himself telling viewers in all subtext that Harry has grown up and wouldn't take it anymore.I was also expecting a few newcomers: as the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Professor Rupin, David Thewlis proved to be a nice addition and so was Emma Thompson as a Professor Sybill Trelawney. I expected of course a new villain, and seeing Gary Oldman introduced as Sirius Black, the man who caused the murder of Potter's parent, I expected quite a climax. But all positive expectations put aside; in all fairness, there was something perplexing about the title.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" made me expect a prison (duh!) so I visualized a high dungeon or a dark tower over a high cliff with many passageways and corridors inside. Which means that after the claustrophobic and unnerving journey around the ""Chamber of Secrets"", I wasn't too excited by the premise of another in-door adventure. So you can imagine how much I enjoyed ""Azkaban"" and its departure from the usual settings. Most of the adventure takes place outside Hogwarts, and features great exterior shots. It says a lot that the film wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Set Design.However, it was nominated for Best Score and Best Visual Effects and on that level, the film is an absolute delight. ""Secrets"" was made of variations from the previous score because John Williams had a busy year but here, he makes a spectacular come-back with a score that is as heart-pounding and triumphant as any fantasy epic, far from the ominous and whimsicality of the original score. And the visuals remind us that CGI reached a point of maturation in 2004, though Alfonso Cuaron, the newly assigned director, didn't let them overtake the film and the best computer effects are never obtained without the involvement of some practical ones.So ""Azkaban"" is an outdoor adventure, perfectly suitable for three protagonists whose ages are around 13 or 15 and seem more fit to be running over a hill, flying on an apogriff or finally punching the odious Malefoy in the face, than any riddle to solve within the confined walls of Hogwarts. It's like the scope of the adventure was too big for the school and allowed us viewers to have some relief and a share of fun as Harry attempts to catch Sirius Black and avenge his parents' death. That would be too linear of course so within his journey, many obstacles will be set as well as many opportunities to unveil many secrets.And that's the mark of the best franchises, they don't touch the pillars (the leading trio, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Snape and even Malefoy) they enrich the gallery with new protagonists and plot elements, but they also dig deeper in the past and reveal a whole chain of events that preceded Harry Potter, as if the story was only one link of an epic chain, one that involves so many characters the franchise start to strike as a real universe where each member gets into a passage rite consisting of a substantial contribution to the plot. In ""Secrets"", Ron took part to the climax without Hermione, ""Azkaban"" allows Hermione to finally shine and contribute to the resolution. Characters start to act like heroes on their own and not just foils.And all the teachers and courses are left to the backdrop. Seriously, I didn't expect the film to be contain such a great deal of escapism but it says a lot about the seriousness upon which Rowling and the Warner Bros studios considered the franchise and insisted on maintaining this capability to precede the viewers or the readers' anticipations, to surprise them. And that's the least one would expect from a series dealing with the world of wizardry, isn't it? And any innovation works because we're getting used to the world of spells and magical formulas so we can accept any new trick as long as it has rules of its own.And it all comes down to that last nice time-playing twist I didn't see coming, and that could have been contrived if it wasn't foreshadowed in previous scenes. Yes, the Harry Potter plays tricks with us but never without elements of foreshadowing, even some that weren't meant to foretell anything. Yes, they play tricks with us, and in retrospect, they often work. : from a simple pet animal that hides a terrible secret to the explanation of why Hermione is so studious and always ahead of her schoolmates.Though the story didn't get darker than ""Secrets"", it goes deeper in Harry's fears and traumas and features some of the most frightening creatures after you-know-who in the Dementors (the guardians of Azkaban). But the tone is quite lighthearted and the film has more the flavor of a teen adventure than a fantasy movie, but don't get it wrong, it's still a Harry Potter, and the series is definitely at cruising speed. Broomstick-wise of course.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A wonderfully inventive and entertaining entry that starts the series' slow transition into darker territory.,8,30 April 2018,"A change of direction helps bolster the film's darker tone, lending a slightly 'odd' feel to the piece, and a time-travel element introduced later on provides a refreshingly unique third act, but 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (2004)' feels perhaps the least connected to the overall franchise, with its plot having little lasting impact aside from introducing some interesting new characters and concepts. It is an entertaining movie with several exciting, and occasionally somewhat scary, sequences, but it does feel slightly underwhelming on the whole. Still, it's a great film. It's a unique, enjoyable experience that sits comfortably among its peers. It also serves as a perfect transition from the earlier and generally lighter films to the heavier ones later on, though the transition is much smoother than you might remember and even the first flick has moments of proper grittiness in it. This film is the first in the series to properly capture the wistful tone associated with the character, too. Wonderfully inventive stuff. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
40,dromasca,just a kids movie - a good one though,8,12 June 2004,"I confess that I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, and I am afraid I will not have the time to do it during the current reincarnation of my soul. This being said, I am judging the film by what I saw on the screen, and I cannot refer to the many details the book afficionados seem to be that familiar with. My opinion is that this film belongs to the category of kids film, and should not be over-estimated or over-judged beyond. It is actually quite good in its own terms, and doing good kids movies should not be under-estimated in a world poluated with that many bad taste or plain boring movies targeting young audiences, unfortunately many claiming Disney descendence, or even bearing Disney labels. My young teen-age soon enjoyed the film, and so did my wife and myself. The good parts are the overall atmosphere, darker, and less surprising if you saw the previous films in the series, but still very consistent and catching. Computerized film graphics is by now an art in itself, and the makers of this film master it fully. I did not like that much the horse-bird character, which looks like being intended to generate some affection, but fails to bear a personality as some other recent film monsters.Acting is good, with the kids trio, now on the verge of their teen years growing up still as a consistent team, although Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter seems to have less acting resources than Emma Watson in Hermione, who may develop into a real screen star. Interesting to guess how the makers of the series will deal with the inevitable growing pains and crisis of the young actors. A good team of good and better actors surrounds the kids, with Michael Gambon having taken over the key role of dean Dumbledore after the passing of Richard Harris in a flawless manner.Sure, the fans can and will build a world around the books and the films. Even for the non-initiated or beyond the age groups, like the ones I belong to, there is enough good stuff to enjoy in this film. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
41,ThomasDrufke,"Cuarón Brings a More Mature, Stylistic Approach to the Series",8,6 November 2016,"As the trio gets older the films become a little darker and more mature. Watching the Harry Potter series within days of each other can be a tough adjustment. Especially considering how family friendly the first two installments are, but no matter the subtitle, Harry Potter films always maintain that fun atmosphere.Harry and his buddies have turned 13, his first year of his teens, and this film subtly tackles some common issues that an early teen has. Not only is Harry dealing with the angst of trying to be independent from his muggle family, but he then is forced with coming to terms with an estranged family member returning to find Harry, Sirius Black. All the films have relatively the same setting, characters, and tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is clearly a part of a maturation process for Harry. There's something to be said for a film that takes its franchise in a totally new direction (i.e. Fast Five), but I also can't help but think this film was missing a few familiar plot points.Alfonso Cuarón took the reigns from Chris Columbus and he brought a refreshing take on the Potterverse. Just by simply looking at the advancement of technology in CGI and in the unique camera movements/shots, this was going to be a different Potter film. Cuarón brought along Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore, after the unfortunate passing of Richard Harris. As great as Harris is, his calming presence may not have worked as Dumbledore here. Gambon fits in well as a more demanding and mysterious headmaster than in the previous two films.With that said, Voldemort's lack of presence is definitely felt. I enjoy the late-game twist in the film's villain and I understand we don't necessarily need him every film, but there was barely any mention of him. Yes, that's the way it is in the book, but for me, it degrades the score a bit. The focus here is more on Sirius Black and Professor Lupin. Both of which have unexpected twists and turns that make the third act quite the whirlwind. To me, this film plays more as a part 1 of 2 to the Goblet of Fire, because we only get a glimpse into Pettigrew and his relation to the dark lord and Harry's parents. Either way, Prisoner of Azkaban is a welcomed changeup in the film's franchise and one that, on repeat viewings, only gets better. I mean, who doesn't love time travel, Hippogriff's, a long awaited punch, a little quality time with Harry & Hermione, and one big twist right? It's a slower pace and a darker tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is no slouch of a film.+ Cuarón's different style+Gary Oldman enters the picture+Fantastic visuals/cinematography+Hermione & Harry team-up-No Voldemort presence8.7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
42,MLDinTN,"awesome special effects, decent plot",7,10 June 2005,"I think movie wise, this was the best of the Harry Potter films. The story was OK, but of course the books are better because they have so much more detail.The special effects are incredible. At times, it looks realistic. Like when Harry is flying on the half bird/half horse creature. The animal looks like it has depth. Another example is the extremely fast bus Harry catches a ride on at the beginning. It's refreshing to see a film with good effects that don't look like they belong in a video game.The acting by the kids has gotten so much better than in the first film. Too bad some of the teachers aren't featured more like they are in the books.FINAL VERDICT: If you have watched the first two films, then I'm sure you'll be watching this one. But, if you have never read the books are seen the other movies, then you best not start off with the third film because you will be lost.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

This time around, Harry enters his third year and he must deal with an escaped convict who is seemingly after Harry. The acting in this film is better than the first two. As the main actors(Radcliffe, Grint,and Watson)grow up, their abilities seem to improve. The supporting actors were good, but they needed a bit more screen time. Also, it's nice to see normal clothing instead of robes. The new director, Cuaron did a good job. He added a different style into this film. The music by the famous John Williams is different, but good. Finally, some sub-plots were cut out. I wished to see Harry and his win of the Quidditch cup. Other than that, this movie is pretty good.

45,lesleyharris30,"Franchise Jumps in to Darker, more Thrilling, Territories,",8,18 December 2015,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a great third installment for the franchise, while a third film is normally when they start to fall flat, this loses no creative energy and clearly has much more story left to tell, and we are in no way sick of these characters yet either. Though I mostly find it to be a delightful entry in to the series, I did feel that it was a bit too dark, there wasn't really any gradual increase in the tone of storytelling that is light and simple in the Chamber of Secrets, to being much more sinister and severe here, I just felt the transition could have been more natural. The cast continues to delight as they deliver more dramatic and intense performances than the previous two movies, regulars such as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are all outstanding, and newcomers Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon, who is terrific in his first portrayal of Dumbledore after the death of the great Richard Harris, they all add that extra depth that make these movies so much fun. A darker story that will have you at the edge of your seat, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to anyone looking for a good adventure or family film.

Sorry, rhetorical question. The answer is that we live a polar world, light and dark, night and day, positive and negative.So this may well be the last episode in the series which is both exhilarating and innocent.Especially if you compare it to the last two in the series, which I suggest you do not do because you will lose your lunch.The cinematography does not get better. In the winter scenes you can feel the chill and in the flying scenes you get airsick.And the story includes a ""time loop"" twist which is handled so perfectly that you want to see the film a second or third time to make sure you got it all.Wow.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
47,CuriosityKilledShawn,Anorexic,5,12 January 2006,"There are some sensationalist reviews here that believe the hype that everything Harry Potter is great and give the movie five stars regardless (the book of Azkaban was definitely a 5 starrer) but this movie ain't so great I'm afraid.Prisoner of Azkaban is my fave Harry Potter book so far (and was more than welcome after the weak Chamber of Secrets) but the translation from book to film loses 90% of JK Rowling's story.Every single second, every frame of this film is utterly devoted to being nothing but pure exposition for a plot that has no mystery intrigue. If you have read the book then there isn't much point in seeing this as you'll already know the twist. But I didn't want this to bias my opinion so I gave it a go anyway.As I have said, there are no subplots. Everything focuses on the Sirius Black story. Character development and mystery are non-existent. It almost feels as if Harry, Ron and Hermione are the only students at Hogwarts because no one else gets a mention and Draco Malfoy is reduced to wimpy, comic-relief. The strangest change of all is the presence of Dudley (a funny character) with NO dialogue at all.I liked Professor Lupin in the book, he was a rebel, renegade teacher who broke the rules and was one of the best mentors Harry has ever had. In the movie he doesn't do much and the character never really comes through. Same goes for Snape (a character I am liking more and more), he barely has two lines to say. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore is cool and naturally authoritative but he's got nowt to do either. Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny has five minutes of screen time and Hagrid has two scenes.The relationship between every character and situation is very much defined in the book. In the film all of that is stripped away in order to tell the Sirius Black story as quickly as possible. Which would be fine if the Sirius Black story could make the film stand on its own but it doesn't.Alfonso Cuaron may bring a new look to the film and a more modern edge but I blame him and Steven Kloves for the hasty rearranging and muddling of JK Rowling's story. Sure, some sacrifices had to be made in adaptation but they've diluted the story to the point of obscurity.There were rumors of Goblet of Fire being released as two separate parts (ala Kill Bill) but Mike Newell got overambitious and stripped about 90% of the story out of that one too. At this rate, Order of the Pheonix, will be the worst yet.For a much more atmospheric and exciting mystery try Young Sherlock Holmes. A film with many alarming similarities to the Harry Potter world. This movie may look good with a new director doing a fresh take on the Harry Potter universe but there are so many restrictions weighing this franchise down and it's REALLY beginning to show.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

51,tomgillespie2002,The franchise can finally be taken seriously,7,15 July 2014,"With Chris Columbus abdicating at the sight of dark material, the Harry Potter was gratefully gobbled up by Alfonso Cuaron, a director having only at that point turned heads with the incredibly sexy Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). This is a vastly different Potter to that which came before. When his dead parents are insulted by an obnoxious aunt (Pam Ferris), Harry blows her out of the window, kicking his bedroom cupboard in a rage. There's no plinky-plonky music or pie-in-the-face sight gags, and when Harry steps outside of his house, the streets are grey and grim, not a cosy suburban horror show.After fleeing another run-in with the Dursleys, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) hops on the Knight Bus, which takes him to the Leaky Cauldron where he is to learn his fate having used magic outside of Hogwarts. Best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are there waiting for him, when they all learn that convicted serial killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from notorious prison Azkaban, possibly with Harry in his sights. With the ghostly guardians of Azkaban, the Dementors, surrounding Hogwarts in search of Black, Harry finds his own life in danger, and seeks help from new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and friend of his parents, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis).With Columbus's kid-friendly approach ditched and Cuaron's more focused direction, the franchise at this point could finally be taken seriously, with real threats finally entering Harry's life, and the trio's characters hitting puberty and becoming more feisty in the process. Cuaron also wisely adapted the book, rather than simply filming the pages, and this is noticeably shorter than it's predecessors despite being the biggest book at this point. Hermione is less precocious, Ron is less gurny, and Daniel Radcliffe finally puts in a decent performance. He isn't perfect, but there's a delightful eccentricity to the actor's mannerisms which make him endearing to watch.Apart from a climax that makes as little sense as it does in the novel, the story is also more gripping. We finally see Harry's past intertwine with his present, with revelations coming out of the woodwork, and Harry finally starting to learn more about his parents. There's also some genuinely frightening scenes, including the Dementors - hooded, faceless ghouls - and a scene involving a certain character's dangerous affliction. In Cuaron's hands, Harry Potter is genuinely magic, funny when it should be, dark when it needs to be, and it's rather disappointing he didn't go on to direct more of them.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

53,zkonedog,The Series Starts To Grow Up,8,5 March 2017,"In the first two Harry Potter films, the plots/action are primarily geared towards a much younger audience than the medium. There are some ""tense moments"" and drama in those films, of course, but it isn't until ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" that the series really starts to grow up and deal with some more mature themes.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an escaped prisoner from the terrible Azkaban prison, come to Hogwarts in search of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) for reasons dealing with Potter's deceased parents. Hermoine (Emma Watson) & Ron (Rupert Grint) still play large roles in the action (Hermoine especially in this one), while new Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) brings a new dynamic to the Hogwarts third-year experience.In terms of ""growing up"", this film does so more with themes than content. There isn't any objectionable content in this one, but the themes and some of the characters present are sophisticated enough that younger children might have difficulty following them. Basically, this is the type of movie that seeks to maintain a fanbase and not create new followers based on this effort alone.As with the book, the ending portions of ""Azkaban"" really serve to change the entire tone of the series. I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice it to say that it feels as if the saga could go in any direction now and not be limited by the more child-friendly plots.This is also the first movie of the series that has noticeable differences from the novel. Nothing too ""gasp-worthy"" or anything like that, but certain parts of the narrative this time are indeed re- arranged to better suit the cinematic experience.Overall, ""Azkaban"" might be even better as a movie than as a book because it skips over some of the ""fluff"" found at the beginning of the book and gets right into the thick of things from the get- go. Despite a few key scenes that were explained a bit better by Rowling herself, this movie is the perfect complement to its literature twin.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
54,johnnyboyz,A healthy blend of fantasy and suspense in an easily manipulative world.,7,11 July 2006,"With two Harry Potter films firmly under the belt and many other books, the phenomenon that is Harry Potter is easy to recognise and will stick with generations to come, but how does this film match up against two other reasonably successful films? Surely the curse of the sequel has to strike sooner or later. Not necessarily.Chris Columbus is something of an auteur when it comes to family films given the fact 'Home Alone' (1990) and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993) are two easily recognisable films when it comes to the genre and the first two Harry Potter films were a healthy way in which to introduce the series. This third one takes it up a level.Oddly enough, the film starts rather blandly, almost randomly, and it takes a while to get to grips with the world of the film and in which the characters live in. This may be easier for others depending on your taste in film and knowledge of Harry Potter though. We're given a rather ridiculous and unfunny introduction to Harry Potter at home during the summer and the reminder of the cruel setting of which he lives. Everything here seems a little too forced and it's as if it's mandatory that we are told, once again, Harry isn't happy at home. It's unnecessary.Once the film gets going, we are thrown into the world of magic and of Hogwarts, the superb setting for the film. The fantasy element is amazing and it's easily to get lost in. This is clever as you need your brain active for this film in order to follow the plot's twists and the time travel element when they arrive but at the same time, there's no shame to just simply relax and let Hogwarts take you wherever and engross you with it's entertaining quips that it has. Some techniques that I'm a big fan of in this film is the one used really early on which sets up an uncomfortable feeling you have throughout the film. Here, the example is when our three heroes are on the train and dialogue is used to build up a disturbing and uncomfortable feeling for characters know as 'dementors'. This is done, as I said, early on in the film and sets the scene brilliantly as the threat of them is there throughout and we know what they're capable of and what a threat they are. The technique is also used with Sirius Black's character.Following on from this dialogue technique, the use of a rather disturbing and eerie scene so early on and so soon after the dialogue is another good way of making an effective film. We are told of the beings and then suddenly, we are confronted by one and we're left with the feeling if 'Hold on, this is too soon! I need more time to digest this stuff!' Clever film-making.This happens through out the film and the timing and placing of the horror, the fantasy and the comedy, which has a couple of reoccurring jokes, is very welcome and very well done. It makes the film so much more clean and well put together. There's also a very pleasant feeling of ambiguity flowing throughout up until round about the start of the last act which keeps everything very mysterious and suspenseful. This, along with my last point, keeps the film going beautifully.Apart from a bit of 'poker faced' acting from the heroes, nobody else puts a foot wrong in the acting department and one thing I didn't like was the confusing way in which suddenly everything is un ravelled following a plot turn. Although I'm alien to the book's content, it didn't work well for me and had to have it explained afterwards.Don't be put off seeing this film, as it is enjoyable with a nice blend of almost everything.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
55,filipemanuelneto,Interesting but not surprising.,5,5 September 2015,"This film is the adaptation of the third book in the Harry Potter's saga written by J.K. Rowling, and is the first in the franchise that isn't directed by Chris Columbus, who makes way for Alfonso Cuarón. The cast, however, remains the same, which allows to this film doesn't seems a totally different thing from the first two, although there are changes in the way the story is told and seen. One of the most obvious changes is the gradual abandonment of the use of black school robes, almost ubiquitous in the first two movies. For some fans, its a transition to another stage of the film franchise. Also notable is the arrival of Michael Gambon to the role of Albus Dumbledore, left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. Although loyalty and attachment to the original book and it's details is a feature that will come to gradually disappearing, this movie still follows closely the history of the book. For all these reasons, this movie entertains, delights but haven't nothing surprising.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
56,Rectangular_businessman,The best Harry Potter film,8,5 October 2020,"The best Harry Potter film, mostly thanks to Alfonso Cuarón and his crew.Back then it used to be a rather divisive film, since the fans were not happy with the changes made to the plot of the original book (Honestly, those changes were mostly superficial, and usually the movie adaptations of these kind of novels tend to take plenty of liberties with their respective source material.)From this whole movie series, this was the one with the most distinctive personality, and it while some of the effects have not aged well, the overall tone from the film is quite effective.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
57,leplatypus,Harry and the prisoner of azkaback to the future (dvd),7,10 March 2012,"Well, as soon as we left the Yate's movies, the Potter movies are rather good. Newell brought a touch of humor and levity while Cuaron has a really naturalistic feeling. If I had understood, it's the one who had been shot the most outside in the Scottish country and it's clear: the cinematography are extraordinary, much, much better than the dark Yate's movies. Next, if the movie is as calm and dull as the book (it's about an invisible threat without attacks contrary to the previous one), Cuaron took the opportunity to put Hogwarts and its grounds on the stage. We have never seen the school like this and the passing of seasons was depicted with poetry. In fact, as the only story Voldemort- less, the characters make a step behind and in this void, Cuaron was a best choice to shoot this stillness. For me, it was almost a lynchian movie because it was deeply rooted in nature and grabbed a lot of abstract or symbolic shots. I didn't count them but the ring, the circle is a motive repeated a lot here. Next, Williams succeeds an amazing task to double the great themes of Potter's score: after the Hedwig's one, the new one with the flute is excellent. At last, to explain my title, the climax of the story is as exciting than one its predecessor: with movies traveling into time, it's always great to see the characters watching themselves. On the extras disc, you got the best interviews session of the cast with a very supportive host. Thus, if all the ingredients were there for this great potion, the mystery is why they throw it away? NB: beyond the Hyppogryph poop, other funnies details: can anybody explain me why Pettigrew can have his clothes when turning into a human and lost them when he comes a rat?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
58,BaronBl00d,The Least of Potter Films So Far,5,26 December 2004,"Maybe I am too jaded today, or maybe I don't like a lot of change, but change came plenty in this third installment of the Harry Potter films. I have never read one printed word of the series, but I did see and enjoy the first two films immensely. They were gorgeous, splendid, exciting films laced with suspenseful action scenes, quirky, genuine acting performances, and likable heroes. Not so for this film. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione age and become teens, I found that I liked them a good deal less as rebellious teenagers(another viewer touched on this earlier). Don't get me wrong. I know it is the natural progression of events. But I see too much of this in real life(and am not fond of it at all), I just didn't seem to care or appreciate Harry's problems in this one. Point number two: the acting in this film was not up to snuff with the other two. There are I think two reasons for this. One, the ""bad"" guy Gary Oldman has virtually nothing to do or say. When he is on screen he gives one of his most boring, humdrum performances I ever seen from someone with his talent. Emma Thompson is wasted in her role as an instructor, and Michael Gambon has none of the charm Richard Harris gave to the Dummbledorf(?) role. There was no Jon Cleese cameo. Richard Griffiths has a very small role as Harry's bad uncle. Maggie Smith has maybe two lines. Why bother having her in the film? At least Alan Rickman and David Thewlis add some meat to this otherwise lean offering in terms of acting. The second reason is that the actors were not nearly as developed as they had been in the previous two films. Where was the tenderness between Harry and Dumbledorf? Daniel Radcliffe's angst over his parent's series of unfortunate events was not realistic nor was it even passably believable. Another thing that happens with child actors as they age is that much that they could get away with as younger children they cannot as they age. The cute factor or the believability factor decreases or in this disappears. What the film does have going for it are some well-shot action sequences with some impressive CGI effects. The game scene in the rain was especially breath-taking and the hippogryph was amazing. The movie is not bad, but, for me at least, it just doesn't conjure the same kind of magic the first Potter films did. Of course much of that change came with a new director with few legitimate screen credits to take on a project of this size. It is a bit darker in some ways, but the plot doesn't seem to be nearly as cohesive as the first two. I guess as its cast will not get any younger - I probably will never feel the same way about future Potter installments. Mouthy teenagers just don't seem to engage me at all but rather enrage me.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Potter"" is sharper, smarter with new director Cuaron",9,8 July 2009,"Producer Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films made of the Harry Potter series of fantasy books by J.K. Rowling, couldn't have made a better choice than stepping away from the camera and giving the reigns to a seasoned director with a fresh perspective. It's what makes ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" go from merely good to great.Director Alfonso Cuaron, who brings his fantasy experience from the mid-'90s film ""A Little Princess,"" adds a layer of complexity, maturity and beauty to the Harry Potter universe that had been just a bit too fantastical and gimmicky under Columbus' direction. Though the second does this better than the first, the third completely outdoes both.In this chapter, Harry (Radcliffe) heads for Hogwarts with the knowledge that an infamous Dark wizard named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizard prison of Azkaban and is out to find Harry and kill him. Along the way Harry must learn to overcome his fear of the Azkaban prison guards out searching Hogwarts for Black -- ghastly creatures called Dementors -- during which he learns a bit about his parents. New to the cast include David Thewlis as new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and ally of Harry's, Remus Lupin, a nearly unrecognizable Emma Thompson as Divination teacher Professor Trelawney and Michael Gambon as the new Albus Dumbledore after the sad passing of Richard Harris. All are great, even Gambon, who adds a youthful vigor to Dumbledore despite the true magic that Harris brought to the role.A lot has also changed visually in ""Azkaban."" There seems to be more of a sense of realism to the characters despite the fantasy world around them. Cuaron has the main trio of Harry, Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) in modern dress most of the film (whenever they're not in classes) and this really helps make them seem more like the teenagers they are. It makes us identify with them more. Even when they are in robes/proper dress, they do what Catholic school kids with uniforms would: loosen the ties, unbutton a couple buttons -- Cuaron's image is not as neat and tidy of a fantasy world. This is more of a young adults adventure story, not a children's fantasy. Then again, the books are heading in this direction and it's only appropriate.The sets are even more beautiful and Cuaron's attention to the seasons changing helps emphasize his themes of time while grounding the narrative of the film. Steve Kloves, adapter of the first two books, has clearly by now honed his craft. He has much better ways of working in the information of the book visually than through dialogue. Cuaron's vision makes that seem all the more apparent. What you see in ""Azkaban"" just has so much more weight to it. There aren't nearly as many visual effects or interesting nature sequences that are just there to be pretty. All of it has a purpose with the exception of Harry flying around on Buckbeak the hippogriff for a few minutes, and even that lets John Williams take his great score to the next level.""Azkaban"" is easily the best Potter film to date and it's one of the shortest, so that gives you a sense of how much more improved the entire process was this time around. This film really lives up to the book more than any other in entertainment and maturity. It's a shame Cuaron didn't stick around for another go.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

62,Anonymous_Maxine,Y tú mago también!,9,12 June 2004,"(spoilers) Okay, I won't make any more jokes about the director, but you really can't help making a crack or two about a director who just made an acclaimed nearly porn film and the turned to a wildly popular adventure series starring a lot of budding teenagers. As it turns out, of course, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, personally chose Alfonso Cuarón to direct the third installment in the Harry Potter films, so that should really end any controversy about how closely the movie follows the book. I read the third book not long after the second film was released, so it has faded a bit in my mind, but it's pretty obvious that the majority of the storyline remains intact, and quite frankly I generally find it boring to hear lists of things that were in the book but not in the movie, or vice versa. I got enough of that while reading reviews of Troy.The amazing thing to me is how much the kids have changed since the last film. They're at that point in their lives where they'll grow faster than at any other time, and it's amazing how different they are. Draco Malfoy, especially, looks like an almost entirely different actor. Clearly, despite the changing appearance of the cast, the largest difference here is in the direction. Alfonso Cuarón brings a much darker and sleeker feel to the series, which I think is a welcome and necessary change.The focus of the film is on the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, the infamous wizard prison (which I would have liked to actually see in the movie), and his apparent dedication to exact his murderous revenge on Harry Potter. Early on, the film slips a little bit when it starts with a gigantic cliché, which is that Harry Potter's Life Is In Grave Danger, but thankfully it recovers quickly. Hermione's ability to take on a massive amount of classes in quietly hinted at throughout the film, exactly as it was in the novel, and it leads to a great sequence that reminds me of the Back to the Future movies, where Marty traveled through time and had to avoid running into his other self. This movie even throws in a scene to show how the multiple selves are ultimately melded back into their originals when the time traveling is done, which the Back to the Future series never put a lot of effort into. Gary Oldman is tragically underused in the movie as Sirius Black, but he delivers a powerful and convincing performance and clearly had a great time of it. (Again, there are spoilers ahead) However, given the fact that he turned out to be a vastly different person than everyone thought he was ever since he was thrown into prison 12 years earlier, it seems that he would have been better able to convince people that he was really a good man had he not offered such a menacing pose for his WANTED poster. Oops.As is generally the case, the new year at Hogwarts offers a few quirky new staff members, including the necessary addition of a new Dumbledore, the mysterious Professor Lupin, who has a tendency to disappear and then reappear covered in strange scratches, and the eccentric Professor Sybil Trelawney, a role which does not do Emma Thompson justice. Robbie Coltrane returns as the endlessly lovable Hagrid, now promoted to professor status, as well as the tremendously impressive character of Professor Snape, who I enjoy mostly because Alan Rickman fits the role better than any other actor in any of the Harry Potter movies fits theirs. Until the Harry Potter movies came along, I thought he would never top his role as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Turns out I was wrong!The Hippogriff that Hagrid introduces to his class early in the film is one of the most impressive and realistic computer-generated animals that I've ever seen in a movie, with expressions and movements that made it seem so real that it actually had personality, despite being such a mythical creature. Compare it, for example, to the ridiculous wolves in The Day After Tomorrow, and you'll know what I mean. The first half of the film, unfortunately, seems a little uncomfortable with itself. It tries pretty hard to get Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson to act like their younger selves from the previous movies, but it's almost like the awkwardness of their early teenage years is creeping into their characters, who are younger than the actors playing them.The film follows the novel as closely as is necessary, especially since Cuarón was deliberately trying to make the film noticeably different from the previous films, which followed the books with striking detail. A little bit of artistic liberty taken with a novel when adapting it into a film is a pretty dangerous proposition, but I think that, as in this case, the author of the work personally chose the director, a bit of artistic license should be granted, and I think Cuarón did a great job with the liberties that he did take. That being said, I can't help but end with a quote I read in a review of The Prisoner of Azkaban, in which Time Magazine's film critic Richard Corliss speculates on possible directors for the remaining Harry Potter films - 'How about Tim Burton (Sleepy Hogwarts), Ang Lee (Crouching Wizard, Hidden Snape), Pedro Almodóvar (All About My Voldemort) and, for the wrenching finale, Mel Gibson (The Passion of the Quidditch)?'",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
63,jzappa,The Saga Grows with Its Character.,9,21 May 2011,"Like its two predecessors, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an out-of-this-world triumph in production design. But it's the first to depict not only the sensation of yearning propelling the characters at the heart of the world constructed by Stuart Craig, but a grasp of the way the supernatural lies beneath the ordinary, rather than merely frolicking whimsically at a frivolous remoteness from it. It's far less self-conscious about how to gratify an audience as immediately as possible and isn't as unquestioningly cooperative with the conventional modern family blockbuster mold. A new director with a diverse point of view can recoat and ventilate a series that could otherwise fall back on tired reiteration, which it previously seemed poised to do, and Alfonso Cuaron, a clever, unique and energetic filmmaker with a highly sensitive eye for quirky nuances, has done what few sequel custodians ever achieve or care to achieve, stimulating the characters and story arcs.His exceptionally lensed wizard cosmos is coarser and grittier than Chris Columbus's. It seems immediately more hazardous, more utterly captivating and more authentic. While the two first installments were set largely in the passageways and classrooms of Hogwarts, this one stays behind in the eerie forests and soggy pastures outside the school walls, a backdrop that accentuates Cuarón's flair for inducing the poignant, physical influence of natural environments. His work always having crossed all cultural and stylistic barriers, his was a name that was certain to electrify the spirits of critics more than the greater part of die-hard Harry Potter aficionados, who tend not to see many unrated, subtitled films or to be familiar with the names of many foreign filmmakers, were prone to react with a shrug.Harry, Weasley and Hermione drift on the threshold of teenage years, and whereas they seem nervier and more competent than before, the perils they confront appear far more serious and their own vulnerabilities deeper. At the start, in the compulsory Muggle-baiting scene, Harry's boiling resentment at his orphaned situation and his malicious adoptive keepers finally overpowers him. As the plot follows him---as opposed to normal, in which he's a piece of a clockwork plot---toward a battle with the man who allegedly slayed his parents, a fugitive convict played by the great broad-spectrum villain Gary Oldman, Harry's carefree civility is dimmed by sorrow, anger and moral bewilderment.If Rowling's success is in not allowing her child characters to languish but thoughtfully delving into their maturation in a way that only some, if any, children's literature have before, then the films' producers' is in electing Cuarón to take charge of the franchise's first physical and mental transitional stage. Not only is Harry getting bristly, but Weasley and Hermione are shedding their juvenile hides in surprising ways, and Cuarón stages everything about their lives in a minor register. The soundtrack buzzes with recognizable themes, only now heard in minimal arrangements on archaic instruments instead of the swanky orchestrations of the first two films. The pubs now look authentically aged and dilapidated. The Hogwarts castle now sits among a much less steady, much more jagged panorama. Colors are subdued. Cuaron's signature use of hand-held verite-style camera-work contributes a further closeness, occasionally a claustrophobia that's precisely truthful. Even the costumes echo the fidgety contradiction of character moods: The Harry's school uniform tie is at all times crooked.Sinister and visceral, this really is a grim fairy tale, in which Harry confronts bigger doubts and threats than before when he would play Culkin to Voldemort's many Pescis and Sterns. And I don't mean Sirius Black. What great madcap wizard doesn't seemingly target Harry? Before Harry even disembarks for his third year at Hogwarts, it's obvious that threats will come from within. Cuarón and recurring screenwriter Steve Kloves deal with antagonistic, temperamental adolescence like Stephen King: Harry's thick with anger, almost savoring too much the intoxicating occult capability he has. The literal flare-up of infuriated conjuring he directs at Uncle Vernon's thoroughly deserving sister evokes Carrie at the prom. The first scene, right from the start: What happened to our kind, wholesome little Harry?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

66,FiendishDramaturgy,"Beautifully dark, but with holes",8,25 January 2005,"This work is beautifully dark and lovingly done, but it does leave gaping holes in J. K. Rowling's magical world. The close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is obliterated, as is Hermione's almost conspiratorial relationship with McGonagal. You are never told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are (a necessary element). They completely avoid the fact that Snape has knowledge of Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and Harry received the Firebolt at the beginning of this work rather than the end. The whole incident at the Shrieking Shack was changed and lost too much in the translation. Crookshanks was calumniated from a beloved kneazle to a noisome feline who'd be more likely to pee in your shoes than help you, aside of course from his determination to eat Scabbers.Columbus's epic style is notably missing, as is the awe-inspiring score, and the magical feeling inspired by the first two. Hagrid's hut was reinvisioned (more a gripe with Columbus for not having read ahead and determining what was needed to begin with, than a grip with this movie), there is a pumpkin patch which wasn't there last year, and Hogwarts grounds seemed to have sprouted mountains and rocky hills which weren't previously there. And Dumbledore no longer bears the traits of a beloved, serenely all-knowing Headmaster who commands respect from all (the ONLY Wizard of whom He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is afraid), he is now a lesser man who barely commands notice much less great respect. It aggravated me that Columbus never felt it necessary to research his resource materials by reading ahead in order to make a solid determination as to where things were and how they were laid out. Negligance is never a desirable trait among any professional trade, and this single act of laziness could have cost the franchise dearly. Indeed, this attempt took a beating on DVD sales due to the lack of contentment with the finished product over the changes. Lapses in sales like this could adversely affect the studio's decision to make further films!However. Cuarón's style is superior in his use of light and color, and the lack of these elements. He is not afraid to approach the darkness of this work, and shows it as he rivals the power of the script, rifling through each line and page for ways to illuminate the scene through means other than mere lighting. Much has been said concerning the ""darker"" script, etc. While this work IS darker, so was the literary work from which this was adapted. Even with all the changes (some of them barely noticeable and some of them contemptible) this attempt is the first Harry Potter film which, in my opinion, captured the true spirit and feeling of the novel which it attempts to document.I, for one, am happy to see Chris Columbus move from the director's chair to that of producer. I've wondered though, why he was not Executive Producer of this work, as he was the previous two and the upcoming GOF? Ah well. I must have missed something. His sweeping epic style is beautiful but his works never achieved the level of awe, mystery, and joy present in the first two novels. This third attempt, as I've said, succeeded in capturing all the necessary elements.Hagrid's hut is beautifully done and the audience has a much better feel for the grounds of Hogwarts due to Cuarón's talents. As much as I detested the fact that things had to be changed, I am very satisfied with how things looked and felt on the grounds. It felt much more magical, even with a lack of epic filming (of which I am a huge fan). Cuarón handled the maturing of our three protagonists quite well in that he had just finished a near-porn and, indeed, a nod is given to that work in this movie. If you've seen them both, then you know what I mean. Hermione's Emma Watson is maturing well so far, as are our other favorite Hogwarts students. They do not appear to be maturing so quickly as to warrant their replacement in this series; a situation about which much speculation has been made.This work was incredible in that the characters, creatures, and effects were all impeccably conceived and executed. The legendary hippogryph was incredibly realistic. Some critics have charged J. K. Rowling with making up these animals by ""taking one half of one animal and just sticking it onto another."" This is laughable, as the hippogryph is a mystical animal of legend, and not a Rowling creation. According to legend, the hippogryph, living far beyond the seas in the Rhiphaean Mountains, is the result of the rare breeding of a male gryphon and a filly. It has the head, wings and front legs of a gryphon, and the back and hind legs of a horse. It is a large powerful creature that can move through the air more swiftly than lightning. It figured in several of the legends of Charlemagne as a mount for some of the knights. And since many types of gryphons exist, including a variation involving an eagle head and forepaws, this rendition of this legendary creature is really quite realistic. I do wish people would research before criticizing.While this movie is far from Oscar-worthy, it is quite entertaining and does its best to follow the main theme of the literary work. While I was a bit put off by the changes, I must acquiesce that Cuarón did a most excellent job in adapting the largest and longest Harry Potter literary alteration so far with the lowest running time of any Harry Potter film yet. Thus far, this is my favorite for film style and maintaining the appropriate atmosphere in accordance with the novel, though I do hope Gambon can pull off the rigors of the next two attempts. A lot will ride on his ability to BE Dumbledore.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
67,freemantle_uk,Expecto Patronum!,10,25 November 2009,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is easily the best of the Harry Potter films, and there is one simple reason for that: Alfonso Cuarón! After two films done by the capable, but workmanlike Chris Columbus, Warner Brothers realised their needed a stronger storyteller for when the Harry Potter films started to turn darker, and an excellent Mexican director stepped into the frame.Set during Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts a murdered named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) escapes from Azkaban prison. Sirius was believed to be a follower of Lord Voldemort and its believed wants to kill Harry. The Minstry of Magic use a creature called Dementors to protect Hogwarts from Sirius. The Dementors can suck out happiness and the live out of people, which has a really powerful affect on Harry considering his past. Harry asks for help from the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) to help him defend himself against the Dementors. Harry overhears that not only does Sirius want to kill him, but that he used to be a friend of his parents. Sirius betrayed them, telling Voldemort where they were hiding, and kills their other best friend Peter Pettigrew. Harry swears he will kill Sirius for what he did.Cuaron has such visual flair to directing which Columbus lacked. He knows action and where the camera should be based or follow, such as the fight scenes and the scene involving the Whomping Willow. He got the pacing right, making the film shorter then the previous two, and he focused on a characters and the story. He also offered some very stylist shots, worked well with the special effects (using both CGI and traditional techniques) and got the best out of his actors. He builds the relationships between the characters, especially Harry growing anger and need for a father figure. Cuaron also shows that he is much better at handling the darker elements of the story, whilst still having time for some physical humour. The main three actors, Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all improve a lot from the first films. Radcliffe and Grint show that they have good potential in the acting world after the Harry Potter series, whilst this is Emma Watson's best performance in the film. Adding Gary Oldman into the cast is always a good way to improve film straight away, and David Thewlis is a fine addition to the film. Michael Gambon is a good replace for Richard Harris who sadly died in 2002 and Alan Rickman has a lot more to do in this film then in The Chamber of Secrets. In novel terms, Prisoner of Azkaban was when the Harry Potter started to improve and look at darker themes. It is also the only novel/film where Voldemort doesn't show up as the main protagonist in some form. J.K. Rowling, screenwriter Steve Kloves and Cuaron all hand the third act involving time travelling with real talent and tie-up all the sub-plot which was needed.Best of the Potter films.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
68,dfranzen70,"Fun, dark ride",8,6 June 2004,"If you enjoyed the first two movies, be warned: There are plenty of differences in this third installment. With a new director on board (Alfonso Cuaron), the tone of the series has shifted somewhat, to a darker, more serious Harry Potter universe.If you've read the books, you should also be warned: There's a lot of stuff in the third book that doesn't appear in the third movie. Part of this is out of necessity, as this film is a bit shorter than the first two (while the book is longer), but even so there are characters from the book who don't appear in the movie and story threads that aren't satisfactorily resolved.The crux of the story is that the man who led Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban Prison, presumably to hunt down the offspring of his onetime close friends - and kill him! The guards at Azkaban, the Dementors, are out in full force to track down Black and return him to prison. Ah, but these are no ordinary guards; the Dementors - dark, faceless beings in black cloaks - feed off a person's emotions, eventually sucking their soul out, rending them helpless. The Dementors personify depression in the extreme, you see.Harry first encounters the Dementors on the way to school aboard the Hogwarts Express as they search the train for Black. It's not an enjoyable encounter for the boy wizard, who faints dead away.Later, at the school, it's learned that Black is getting closer and closer. Will he find Harry?New to the faculty at Hogwarts are Remus Lupin as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor (a position that is empty at the end of each book) and Sybil Trelawney as the Divination professor. Both figured into the plot of the book, but only Lupin gets any real screen time in the movie. Lupin, played with effortless panache by David Thewlis, winds up being a confidante of Harry, and he has more than a few secrets in his closet as well. Also, taking the place of the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore is Michael Gambon, while Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is promoted to the position of professor.There are two main plotlines at work here: the anticipation of the arrival of Black and the revelations of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harry's parents. We learned a bit at the end of each of the first two HP films, and this one too takes its sweet time in clueing us all in.A new director and tone can lead to some dangerous uncharted waters, and expectations must be tempered somewhat. Please do go to this movie expecting the charm of the first two; this is not your older brother's HP. As Harry himself matures, so must his movies, and this one is more cynical and downbeat at times than either of the first two in the series. This matches, at least somewhat, the tenor of the third book itself.Cuaron's direction is excellent, and his little touches are abundant (such as the rearranging of the Hogwarts grounds, the use of the Whomping Willow as a device to show time, and endless presence of a giant outdoors clock). The movie doesn't lag too much, although it's possible that a newcomer to the HP oeuvre might not pick up all of the plot threds.The cast does a good job, I think, in maintaining the spirit of the previous movies and books. The young lead trio (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) are aging quite well; in fact, I think Watson is becoming quite a wonderful young actress. (Grint, by the way, holds his hamminess down to a dull roar.)They're well supported, of course, by a who's who of master British thespians, from Thompson to Thewlis to Alan Rickman (still delightfully creepy as Snape) to Gambon to Maggie Smith to Coltrane. Any British actor who's anyone wants to be in these movies, and that's high praise indeed.The special effects, too, aren't second rate. Buckbeack the hippogriff looked positively realistic (although Crookshanks the cat looked laughable).HP:PoA is well worth watching, especially if you have little munchkins in your household who have been clamoring for it since the last Harry Potter movie. But beware, there are some scenes that the younguns may find a bit more unsettling than either of the first two movies.My score: ***1/2",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
69,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,10,8 January 2020,10/10 - the third installment is a cinematic tour de force that does not let up in its wondrous adaptation of the even-better series of novels,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
70,drqshadow-reviews,Alphonso Cuaron Steers Potter and Friends Into Stormier Waters,6,20 September 2018,"It's the third installment of Harry Potter and already the child actors have done a lot of growing up. Visually and dramatically, they've grown into their roles, and director Alphonso Cuarón lets them flaunt that newfound independence in his only take on the series. The school feels more lived-in and tangible, as opposed to the amusement park it seemed in the first two movies, and its residents (particularly the three central Hogwarts kids) are less buttoned-up and disciplined, more comfortable with their surroundings. It's also darker and more foreboding, foreshadowing the idea that this series was headed into stormy waters.Adding Gary Oldman to the mix seems a good choice, though he does little more than snarl and growl menacingly, Michael Gambon plays a more vibrant Dumbledore in relief of the late Richard Harris, and the returning cast all do well in their established roles. The plot flitters around for quite a while, however, obsessing over excessive amounts of day-in-the-life snapshots and unrelated asides. That does confirm the sense of wonder that's been imbued in this world since day one, but it also makes the plot feel extra slow and padded-out.The effects work has improved since The Chamber of Secrets, even if it still shows some cobwebs (particularly during the whomping willow ride). That progress could be attributed to a strict limit on house elves and quidditch matches, which were both prime suspects in the more eye-rolling segments of the preceding film. Azkaban is fair enough, with a meatier plot and a more tangible landscape. And, huzzah, the greater narrative does finally begin to move somewhere interesting. Alas, I still can't quite figure what all the fuss is about with this series. Maybe one had to grow up reading the novels.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
71,alindsay-al,A good darker take on these films,7,31 July 2016,"I have now seen the third film in the harry potter franchise the prisoner of Azkaban and this is another pretty good film. The premise sees harry back at Hogwarts when an old ally of he who should not be named escapes the prison of Azkaban looking for harry. Daniel Radcliffe seems to really mature into the role of harry potter in this film and I really thought he did a great job in this film. His character really develops allot in this film and you really grow to care about him in this series so far. Ron and Hermione aren't as important in this film in my opinion but they both are fun characters and the three wizards chemistry is great. Gary oldman plays Sirius black and he does a good job in this film I just wish his character had more time to be developed because he wasn't in the film that much. David thewlis plays the new professor of defence against the dark arts lupin and I really liked his relationship with harry throughout this film. Alan rickman has slightly more to do as snape and I like his interesting character and think he can do more in these films. Michael gambon is the new Dumbledore and I thought he did a really good job in the film. The story has harry looking into the darker parts of magic and I found his development as a character was great. However, I feel like this film takes too long to get to it's most interesting story. Also the film takes some cheap ways to solve some of its problems. The script has some good drama in it especially with Harry's situation. The humour is better in this film, however, the conflicting tone of the dialogue comes across as messy. The style has a much darker tone to it and I liked it quite allot especially the addition of the dementers. However, like the previous two films I just feel the pacing of the film is messy. These films seem to want to include everything from the books and it comes across as overly bloated. Overall I think this is a decent film and it is a worthy addition to the franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
72,MaxBorg89,Darker and better: the Potter franchise keeps maturing,9,22 November 2005,"Like Tim Burton did with Batman, Chris Columbus ""dumped"" the Harry Potter franchise after the first two movies. Luckily, his replacement, Alfonso Cuaròn, is no Joel Schumacher and the third Potter episode is no Batman Forever.While still children-friendly enough to get a PG, The Prisoner of Azkaban is quite darker than Columbus' opening twosome: this time, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in serious danger. No, the fact that he put a spell on his aunt has nothing to do with it. The real problem Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a feared murderer who has broken out of magical prison Azkaban to track down and kill our favorite teenage wizard. Why? Well, probably because he used to work for Voldemort and wants to complete what he started several years ago: apparently, he is the one who betrayed Harry's parents, leading to their death. With all the other weird things going on at Hogwarts (new teachers, werewolves, ""I have a bad feeling about this"" speeches), it looks like the third year will be like the previous two: filled with dangers, excitement and, most of all, magic.Cuaròn does an excellent job when it comes to showing the young protagonists' growing pains and frustrations, emphasizing the fact that they are getting older and more aware of what is required of them, as well as laying the grounds for further exploration of teenage problems in the upcoming fourth film. Also, unlike Columbus, he's not afraid of removing certain parts of the book to make the film less stiff. As a result, Prisoner of Azkaban is more fluid and enjoyable than the first two Potter flicks, but the director could and should have kept a couple of crucial explanations in the third act, their absence implying viewers who haven't read the book might be left with more questions than answers. Another crucial innovation, as previously mentioned, is the darker tone, never more evident than in the scenes featuring the Dementors, the demonic creatures that have been sent to capture Black. An impressive example of good (as in serving the story, not being above it) CGI, they might remind of the Nazguls from The Lord of the Rings at first, but in the end they come off as much more frightening).As for the additions the cast (the other element to constantly evaluate in each new film), Emma Thompson is very amusing (though in a spooky way), while Michael Gambon proves a worthy replacement for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, having the authority and at the same time kindness the role demands. But ultimately, this movie belongs to two actors: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. The former provides warmth and humanity as Remus Lupin, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, even if it is weird no one ever becomes suspicious because of his last name (as seen in the brilliant climax); the latter comes close to stealing the entire movie, making Sirius Black this installment's Big Thing. All the character's pain, resentment and anger come out of Oldman's face and mouth with an almost scary intensity, adding plenty to the film's emotional resonance.Overall, this darker, less by-the-book (in terms of fidelity to the source material) Potter is much better than the first two entries in the series. If the fourth movie is at least equally good, the franchise might turn into something spectacular.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
73,barnabyrudge,"A more ""grown-up looking"" Harry Potter adventure, held back by lacklustre plot and over-active camera work.",6,24 August 2009,"The third Harry Potter film has a better 'look' than the previous two. The colours and photography are much darker, presumably to reflect the darker turn taken by the story. It's clear that new director Alfonso Cuaron is intent on moving the series into a more grown-up, emotionally engaging, self-consciously moody realm of film-making. What lets Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban down is the absence of a truly compelling storyline (it hovers constantly on the verge of something really good, but never quite gets there). There's also an irritating over-emphasis on the camera work, more of which will be said later.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts, but things at the school are not at all well. A notorious prisoner, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban Prison and many fear that he will head for Hogwarts. Black has spent years imprisoned for being an ally of Voldemort (the bad wizard who murdered Harry's parents) and it is feared that he wants to track down Harry and kill him. Dementors, demon-like guardians from Azkaban, are placed around the school perimeters to intercept the escaped villain – yet they seem just as dangerous to the safety of the pupils, Harry most of all. Rather than sit around and wait for trouble to come to him, Harry tries to piece together more of the events that led to his parent's demise all those years ago, in the hope that something from his past will help him in his quest to stay alive.Like the previous two films, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is geared towards fans of the book more than casual viewers. There are occasional incidents and bits of dialogue that seem incoherent or flawed, yet those more familiar with the book seem able to fill in such gaps in narrative logic quite readily. On the positive side, though, there are favourable things to say about the film. Its dark mood is nicely maintained; the child actors finally seem to be getting better; there is a more fulfilling sense of character development; some of the plot developments are quite unpredictable. The film is certainly equal to – possibly a fraction better than – the first one, and considerably improves on the underwhelming number Two. One thing which really mars this film, though, is the restless camera work. In every shot – even a scene as mundane as a conversation or a lesson – the camera pans and zooms and prowls needlessly, to the point where it induces headaches. Photographer Michael Seresin has tried to be a little too showy for his own good, and the effect merely lessens one's enjoyment of the film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
74,noralee,A Delight for Fans of the Book,10,19 December 2005,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the most enjoyable and entertaining of the series so far.Director Alfonso Cuarón and adapter Steven Kloves just assume we've read the books and seen the other movies so focuses on new main plot points with little time spent on explanations and side stories. So while this not a good entry point for neophytes, it's a barrel of laughs and excitement for fans. The kid stars and co-stars are growing suitably along with the story line and I certainly hope they can continue with each movie, as their characters fit like gloves.The adults continue to be a stellar representation of British talent, though they ham it up a bit too much, with the addition of David Thewlis as the first nice guy defense of the dark arts teacher who surprisingly could have seemed a bit more tormented about his monthly problem, Emma Thompson playing the clairvoyant as just plain batty, Michael Gambon a bit too twinkly in replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Timothy Spall literally as a rat.The very long, and visually delightful, closing credits show the extent of the special effects, but we do see them all on the screen. Well, not all the long list of accountants and the masseur.And they needed Cynthia Weil to come up with song lyrics that are taken straight from the witches of ""MacBeth""? As it was a few weeks until my family could get organized to see it, the print we saw was pale and had poor sound, which made the noisy and noting-the-obvious all-ages audience particularly distracting. Though at the end of the 141 minutes, the kid in back of me (and inside of me, too) protested to his parents: ""That wasn't long!""

78,aharmas,Superb,10,6 June 2004,"Problems with books are that they inspire disappointing films.  For a change, magic is created from a book that defied adaptation.  The first two films based on the Harry Potter saga were mildly amusing, and we were glad we were given the opportunity to at least see what that magical world looked like.  They just didn't have the magic the prose of J.K. Rowlings had.  Now, Mr. Cuaron has created a darker and more beautiful interpretation of the third book, and this one contains every element the others lacked.  For once, our spirits soar and weep at the right moment.  Even the very short performances are given nuance and details to keep them in memory.This one doesn't feel like fluff, and with more maturing work by the three leads, especially the enchanting Ms. Watson, one can truly witness what a good director combined with the right source can do. This was a magical work of art which shows how amazing a film can be. It's truly one of the best films of the last two decades.On a side note to the person who wanted more humour from Mr. Cuaron, please reconsider the themes in this book, and go back to the film to see how much funnier this installment is, compared to the first two. There is plenty of visual gags and funnier elements here, but there is a time when more important and serious aspects had to be addressed, and here is the time to grow.  Just remember, growing up sometimes is painful.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
79,questl-18592,HP3,7,24 March 2021,"The Harry Potter series begins to enter it's adolescence and leave behind the childishness of the first two films, resulting in one of the best films in the franchise. Oldman as Sirius Black is a delight, especially given he was always my favorite character, the addition of the Dementors add severity to the world as suddenly there is an institutionalized kill squad roaming about of devious creatures that are near unstoppable leading to one of the great moments of the series when they are inevitably overcome in grand fashion.Now, admittedly none of these movies hit me the way they seem to hit others. I enjoy this one more than most of them and even then it still just never really, truly wows me or hits home for me. It's a good movie, it just never reaches levels of greatness for me personally although I recognize where it would shine for a lot of people. As far as recommendations, you're either watching the series at this point or you're not. There is no reason to start anywhere but number one and progress naturally from there. If you haven't seen the others, don't just jump into this to start.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
80,ShootingShark,Third Harry Potter Movie Isn't The Best One But Still Terrific Entertainment,7,12 June 2005,"It's Harry and his friends' third term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and the big news is that the sinister Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison. Black was incarcerated for his role in the death of Harry's parents and will be seeking revenge, so headmaster Dumbledore orders the school guarded by the fearsome Dementors and appoints a new teacher in the Black Arts, the mysterious Professor Lupin ...The third Harry Potter movie is an excellent adventure, bursting with great ideas and lots of deliciously scary scenes, but for some reason it doesn't quite match up to the first two films for me. I'm not quite sure why - it could be because the big revelation about Sirius Black at the end is that he turns out to be a nice guy, but I think it's the complexity of the script itself, which crams in so much detail it can often be confusing. There's a key scene where Smith and Hardy explain some crucial backstory to Christie - a character we have never even met before - which is hasty, badly written and vague; fantasy movies need to be clear about their mythologies and this one occasionally dips into incoherence. There is much to enjoy though - the wacky Knight Bus, an ultra-scary train ride, the cantankerous and unpredictable Hippogriff, the Boggart sequence, a supercool map of the School and a great time-travel loop. The cast are all terrific again, particularly Rickman as Professor Snape, but Thewlis completely steals the show as the troubled Professor Lupin - sad, thoughtful, kind and eloquent. Oldman is always a joy to watch, even if his part is really just an extended cameo, and Gambon is amusing as Dumbledore, but doesn't bring the role quite as much pathos and mystery as Richard Harris, who died in 2002. As with the previous films, the production quality is first-rate, particularly Michael Seresin's dark photography and the gorgeous sets by Stuart Craig. This is still a great adventure movie by any standards, but isn't quite as magical and enchanting as its predecessors.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
81,adamjohns-42575,It's A Kind Of Magic!,8,16 November 2020,"It is clear that the new director has not just shaken up the style of the films, adding a touch more darkness and still keeping it funny whilst in a realistic fashion, but he has also had an effect on the younger performers. Either that or they've all been to acting classes between years 2 & 3, because their acting is noticeably better and helps to make the film less cringey and soppy than the last two.I really like the darker turn this one takes, carefully exploring death in a way that young minds can understand, but maintaining the fantasy world to keep it interesting.There's a lot from the books that is missed out which is disappointing, but to be expected, although I don't think the choir scene and some of the others were necessary.The biggest change that frustrates me, is Dumbledore's complete transformation from a respected wizard that could be admired, to let's face it, a bit of a loon that most kids would rather take the piss out of than look up to. There are lots of random sentences thrown in to make him seem even more away with the fairies. I know Richard Harris died, which I still think was selfish of him and Gambon is bound to want to put his own mark on the character, but I don't think that such a drastic change was needed.The supporting cast are all superb, as is to be expected from such great names, but the creepy kid that talks about omens and things all the time was a bit freaky. Seamus or Dean could have spoken those lines surely?The story itself is very good and the time travel element is fun. It's a story in its own right, which I like and it sets you up nicely for the next one.In my review for ""The Chamber Of Secrets"", I stated that without the changes made at this stage, I'm not sure the franchise would have lasted as long and I stand by that. This one strips back the filters and the polish to give a more lifelike interpretation of J.K's amazing tale.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
82,rbverhoef,The best yet,9,21 October 2004,"For me this is the best 'Harry Potter'-film yet. The story is better, especially the ending, and the characters are really growing up in this one. 'Azkaban' is darker, scarier than the first two, making it more a grown up film. What also helps for that is director Alfonso Cuarón, known from the terrific 'Y Tu Mamá También', who gives the film a better look. The cinematography is more ""European"", if you can say that, and for me that makes the film better.The only point of critique I have has to do with my comments above. The movie feels more mature, a good thing since the book was pretty dark as well, but I feel younger children should enjoy films like this. I guess there are some scenes here that are not very suitable for the kids. Still, the best entry in the series, a highly enjoyable movie!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The first two novels are decent books, but they're pretty similar to the dozens of other Orphan-learns-magic storylines that populate (and pollute) YA literature. ""Azkaban"" is where Rowling pulled back the curtain to show us what the Wizarding World really held, and it's also one of the tightest stories in terms of what Harry and his friends set out to accomplish during their year at Hogwarts. Simply stated, ""Azkaban"" is about as magical an adaptation as we could've hoped for.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

85,rosscinema,Excellent third installment,7,6 July 2004,"This third story with Harry Potter is easily better than the first film and is at least equal to the second and this third chapter seems to have a darker edge to it. Story begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going back for his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and re-teaming with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) but while at school he learns that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and that he is responsible for the death of his parents and now wants to kill him! Harry meets some of the new faculty like Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson) and Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and while Sirius Black is still roaming the area the Dementors guard every exit but are they really going to protect them?*****SPOILER ALERT*****Word spreads that a werewolf is also on the prowl and everyone must be careful but Harry finds a map that may help him solve the mystery about Ron's rat and even the death of his parents. A giant bird/horse named the Buckbeak is to be killed so Hermione and Harry figure out how to go back into time and try and help themselves as Black and the werewolf get involved in their adventures.This third installment is directed by Alfonso Cuaron and he adds a darker tone to the series which I enjoyed and it seems to fit as each of these characters are getting older and not exactly kids anymore. In each of these films the character Hermione keeps getting more prominent and Watson could easily star in her own series of films, her character actually takes charge and brings Harry along with her! The actors are getting older and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy has grown a good foot taller than the last film. Some new actors pop up in roles like Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, Julie Christie and Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. Like the previous two installments this is a visual delight and there is so much detail in every scene like all the pictures on the walls having a life of their own. One of the hard parts of viewing this film is trying to catch all the action that goes on in every shot as anything and everything has a life of it's own. One thing about the story that I found confusing was Sirius Black wanting to kill Harry. I never understood why he wanted this and if it was explained in the film than I missed it. Readers of the Potter books should be more than satisfied as this story is brought to life on screen but even if you haven't read any of them (Like myself) this is still a very entertaining film from start to finish.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

In the end, this movie is mostly filler. Yes, they attempted and succeeded at utilizing time travel in a way that made sense, but the characters are so stupid and the runtime is so long that its hard to care.

He runs away after using magic to blow Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.This film is darker and much better than the previous two films. I loved the new vision of the Harry Potter world by Alfonso Cuarón (obviously, each director has a different perspective). I found this perspective much more dangerous and less for little children, per se. The comedy is still here, though.This film or the fourth Harry Potter film is probably the best film to date! I love the new score (although missing the old one) but this one gives us a bit darker atmosphere and magical at the same time. I love the new style of the film, giving it a more ""laid back"" look than the uniforms look.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson matured more into their roles, which makes their performances better. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, plays a much younger and stronger look of this character.The visual effects are also good and there are much more sophisticated story telling in here, which I like. There are even more darker action sequences which contains more thrills and suspense. I like Alfonso Cuarón as a director and this is one of his finest work.No more kidding around. This movie is much better and darker then the previous two movies. The performances are a bit better and the story a bit more sophisticated with great CGI and script. It's not all about the action.

We have now Sirius Black and Lupin, two of the best characters that J.K. Rowlling already have created in all of her life. The things I feel sorry about this film are that many good explanations about Harry's family and life, and also many things about the Marauders are not showed.

The story of this particular movie is full of spectacular moments, some adventurous and hazardous while others are dazzling and some others humorous but all of them making sense, taking of course the fantasy for granted as we said above. Their rhythm is almost hallucinating. The majority of these wizards (the young ones and the adults) are intrinsically human creatures and behave humanely, displaying humane feelings of love, hate, fear, distaste, friendship and solidarity.

No longer always in Hermione's shadow Harrys magical powers are needed now more than ever, stalked as he is by the Dementors (these are cool) This movie uses some cool tricks, some great visuals and has plenty of story developments.

The first two films weren't as good because in the first film, the three kids were annoying. In the second film, they grew up a little bit. But by the third film, they were all grown up. Daniel Radcliffe was fifteen, Rupert Grint was sixteen, and Emma Watson was fourteen. THey had matured also. They're acting improved also. They got rid of director Chris Columbus and the stupid one liners. They gave it to Alfonso Cuaron, a way better director. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a change to the series. Things got darker and more interesting. They're are tons of new people, including Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson. THe third film is more awesome than the first two also.

Emma Thompson's character says in the films. It will broaden your minds into the future of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
95,Spuzzlightyear,This movie gives me the creeps.,7,27 April 2006,"I went to the library the other day, ready to pick up my DVD copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when I picked it up though, I swore to myself as I reserved the wrong Harry Potter movie, it was Azkhaban. I didn't really want to see it again. I wasn't sure why, I knew I liked the movie, perhaps it was because I had seen this not too long ago. But nevertheless, I started to watch it again. About half way through, it dawned on me why I wasn't too thrilled to see this again.The Dementors. Seriously, those things scared the WILLIES out of me. Something that sucks your soul out? Nuh-uh. Not for me. Luckily, I knew how this ended, so I kept watching.Dang, maybe I should say something about the movie! OK, HPO and friends go on another magical journey. This time Harry must come face to face with the man who possibly killed his parents! I liked this one (except for the Dementors EEK!) I found it fitfully amusing that David Thewlis, Gary Oldman AND Alan Rickman all threaten each other with sticks, (Let me repeat, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman have it out in a HARRY POTTER MOVIE) and all the kids are great as usual.Great stuff!

There are all the beings we hear in fairy tales, and other similar pc games and movies like Nancy Drew and Lord of the Rings like werewolf, dementor, effect of the full moon, magic map, and best of all - time travel. There is constant feeling of excitement, unpredictability, adventure, fun, and hope. So much small funny and realistic stuff, all which reminds me of childhood, jokes, pranks.

98,PatrynXX,Missing it's magic. But not a total wash.,6,11 July 2005,"Well clearly Richard Harris is to be totally missed. He came across as a more sincere Albus. Michael Gambon is good at one thing. Being a bad guy. I can't trust Albus now. Not totally. Now not that Michael isn't a good actor. He's very good when he plays less than goodie tushu characters. He's perfect in Open Range. And not that Richard Harris never played bad guys. But Richard was a far better actor. He was convincing at a bad or good guy. I just can't help but wonder if there could have been a better choice. I suppose Ian Mckellen was taken. But the similarities in Potter 3 to LOTR are matched in more than just actors. So he could have been a great albus. I can't believe how much their ghosts/guards... whatever look like LOTR's Ring Wraiths. No creativity here. Certainly the CGI has massively improved here, but so much so they may have forgotten the characters themselves. I'm not gonna go on a blistering attack on the movie. It's hardly a letdown. But I'm not gonna swoon over it like the first two films. I just hope they get their act together. Because Potter 3 is missing the fun. Wonder if Chris Columbus will ever come back. It was good to see Gary Oldman again. I don't see him in many films of the type he did in the 90's. And he's hardly recognizable in Hannibal. I hope they keep the original 3 friend cast together till the end though.

99,vip_ebriega,"Darker, deeper and better. The best 'Potter' so far.",10,22 December 2008,"My Take: The best of the novels come to the screen as the best of the blockbusters. Even as an avid fan of J.K. Rowling's bestselling enterprise that took the teenage generation by storm, I wasn't able to read the first two books in the series before having seen the movies, which were instant blockbuster attractions at their best. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was the only book in the series I have read so far, and the film adaptation, directed by acclaimed director Alfonso Cauron (1995's THE LITTLE PRINCESS), is the best and most entertaining of the series so far (even with the inclusion of later chapters GOBLET OF FIRE and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX). All from the brilliant characters, exuberant special effects and elaborate plot twists, PRISONER OF AZKABAN offers it all in yet another involving and intriguing fantasy adventure. It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year in Hogwarts, and its gloomier this time around (and not just because Cauron gave Hogwarts a gloomier makeover). Harry, along with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are thrown in to a gloomier adventure shrouded with peril and mystery when a convicted murderer named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the ""inescapable"" Azkaban prison with rumors all pointing to his vengeance on Harry and his family. See, Black is supposed to be the evil Voldemort's (aka ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"") shady accomplice who led him to killing Harry's parents, but I bet you all know that. Harry wants to avenge his parents death of course, but the plot grows thicker than that and they (and you) are thrown into a bigger, more exciting adventure than you expected.The characters are as attractive as ever and the special effects are more seamless, but what makes AZKABAN superior to the previous films (which are both still grand in fashion) is the darker, more efficient directorial approach by Cauron. Filling in from his predecessor Chris Colombus, Cauron does everything Colombus has offered us in the previous films with the addition of a whole lot more. Although I feel that comparing this both Cauron and his predecessor Colombus give their own style to their own adaptations, I agree with other critics saying the film as the one that definitely doesn't feel like reading the books in style (not that I felt both previous movies, which I loved, felt like on-screen book-reading). Cauron isn't afraid to risk a little from the fans by altering some elements from the book, making the film much more than an impressive adaptation but a perfect stand-alone effort that would be more pleasant and fitful to the series' non-fans. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the kind of movie the words ""movie magic"" is meant for. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
100,educallejero,Superb jump in quality,10,7 July 2020,"It's the same writer, so what changed? Simple, the director.
Alfonso Cuarón showed his talent, ingenuity and imagination, to bring to life the already good scripts that were wasted in the first two movies.It did help one more year for the kids to grow and get better, yes. But being ""darker"" didn't, like so many say. The second one was as dark, but the director just wasn't that good.Here we have way better exectution at the same type of scenes, with better dialogue, better pace and a way more mature structure. While the first two had this pattern: ""the kids investigate; danger; they are saved; they are lectured; REPEAT""; here we have a more mature film, with the story revealing its details slowly and naturally.The score, already good, also improves with the use of cassical and classical folk beyond the Orquestal, making it more adequate to handle the different type of scenes and moods. Amazing movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
101,PartialMovieViewer,Not Numba 1 or Numba 2 but Numba 3,8,3 September 2015,"All those giddy memories of, 'The Chamber-pot of Dirty Little Secrets' are almost gone now; making room for the infusion of a new and improved escapade of one Harry Potter (or as my fellow movie-critic-wanna-be-snobs would say, H.P.) It has been a long two years since that very forgettable ending of 'Secrets' transpired. As mind-scrubbing as 'Chamber' might have been, we must not forget all the trials and tribulations of our telestic trio. I sense it is now time to return to that mystical land of glue-eating-tinkle-sprinkles and slobbering dog-birds. So come with me - one and all – and let's sneak a peek into that hap-hap-happy land of Her-Very-Very-Winey Granger and her two bestest and most emasculated buds of all timeRon ""The Weasel"" Weasley and Scary Harry Potter. Help me flip open that first movie-page, we will notice that those itsy-bitsy ankle biting-curtain-climbers have all eerily vanished, spookily replaced by older versions of each. Is this witchcraft? Is this some kind of mad wizardry? Whatever this may bedo not tell me this is this nature. Anyways – let's see how happy these pre-adults are – shall we. At first glance, nothing seems amiss. To the person, each student has a 'smiley face' spattered across his or her kisser, gleefully assailing one-another with irreversible spells. Oh the fun, the joy. Disgusting! This is way too happy (and boring)something better be wrong and soon. Thankfully the sickening gladness is squashed by the sudden announcement that the most notoriously spiteful, and evil, and terrible, and unsportsmanlike Sirius Jack Black has escaped from that horrifically, horrible place, we all know as Ask-a-bang-bang Prison. I don't know about the rest of youbut shivers are running up and down my spine. Uh oh, there they go again. This whole movie is a roller-coaster of activity with tailor-made spells and new, made-up words. We have 'The Demanders' who eat souls and make Scary Harry feint. We also find out that 'The Weasel's' hamster is actually a tubby evil, ugly, overweight, mean, scoundrel (who happens to be really bad). Such a snorting wobbler-type should be eviscerated and decapitated - all at the same time. Not really, I am just adding that for effect. Another aspect of the movie is the Walloping Willow Tree and it's spasmodically waving branches. 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Anyone else would have stayed away from this obviously dangerous shrub, but not H.P. No way. Like an idiot Potter flies head-on into the tree and - alas - gets smacked in the head and feints - once again. Do you want more? Not to worry, there is way more and very exciting. For me, this is a movie I can watch once and return in three or four months and watch again. Not only did I enjoy it, but I can enjoy it again and again. This is not Numba 1 in the series nor is it Numba 2 but it is a strong Numba 3. Very good movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
102,Stampsfightclub,Likability still intact despite director fault,8,11 March 2009,"In his third year at Hogwarts Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is under the watchful eyes of the Dementors, soulless creatures on the hunt for murderer Sirius Black.In the third instalment of what surely is now the biggest franchise on the planet, Harry and friends head back to school which is darker and more dangerous than ever before. We say this with every film but this was truly the point where the franchise went from family entertainment to dark and dangerous thrills.Chris Columbus dropped out of his director chair to be replaced by an unknown Alfonso Cuaron, and when reviewing all the films it is evident to see that this change was the biggest mistake in the franchise.Filled with awkward shots, an essence of predictability and many insignificant filling scenes (frozen planets, trees and clock gazing), Cuaron's direction is unbelievably inadequate, particularly for this dark transition. The adaptation of wide angled lenses gives too much information to the scenes and feels inappropriate in context. The camera is always on the move also. It never stays still and we never get a chance to settle on the moment which is a real pain as the significance of scenes is never properly justified. However if there is one thing the director handles well is the arrival of the Dementors. On the train the characters first encounter the Azkaban guards and the slow approach goes so well with the notion of the book you are right there in the heart of the moment, uncontrollably transfixed with the dark ghost like character.This was always debated to be the least thrilling book out of the franchise. Whereas Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets had a mystery to solve, Prisoner of Azkaban sits back and lets the tale come to the characters. Events happen and move on drawing all to a major finale which thankfully livens things up. The book had its moments and where this is still entertaining the fact is this is where the books became more like a soap drama than a family entertainment film.The young stars shine once again with Watson in her best role to date. Gary Oldman's Sirius is what the book represents and Michael Gambon's adaptation of Dumbledore does not do justice to Richard Harris' reflection as the Wizard.Despite the faults in direction and lack of story, this 2004 picture will still grip, shock and entertain with its stunning effects and bouncy performances. The fact is the likability is still intact and will please any fans of the franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
103,fwomp,Dark Days For Harry,7,23 January 2006,"I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says ""Oh you just HAVE to read this!"" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the ""Potter films."" And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush? Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner  Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005)  has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death? Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death.Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.) Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliché), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn! I might have to pick up one of the novels now!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

105,jluis1984,Outstanding!,8,21 November 2005,"Praised by many, hated by many, the third part of this well known fantasy saga is probably the most controversial of all. Nevertheless, and trying to be the most objective about it, this is probably the best movie in the series, and one of the best movies of 2004.Most of the complains have been directed towards the director, Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, who has received many awards for his work in ""A Little Princess"", ""Great Expectations"" and ""Y Tu Mamá También"". I find most of those complains a little bit too childish, considering that their main topic is how much it was taken from the book. Not only this complain should is directed to the wrong person(whether true or false, it's the writer of the screenplay's fault), but it's very simplistic to say that the book should be completely transcript to the movie.Regarding this aspect(and counting myself as a fan of the book), I found the adaptation(key word: Adaption) very good, and while it was not the most faithful to the book(unlike parts 1 & 2), probably this liberties helped the movie to be more entertaining, and gave it a more dynamic pace. In my opinion, all the changes to the book served to a bigger purpose: to make the movie enjoyable. Of Course, as a fan of the books I was shocked at first, but considering the length of the book and how good the final product is, I think they did a pretty good job with the adaptation.Cuarón's direction is fresh, and shows a development over previous parts, considering that our characters have grown up. The world looks now darker as the plot moves to somber situations. The plot is as follows: As the mysterious Prisoner Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban in what seems to be a hunt for Harry Potter, the young wizard, now 13 years old, returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of study. Meanwhile, the Dementors, the horrifying guards of Azkaban, patrol the surroundings of Hogwarts looking for Black and make the year uncomfortable not only for Harry, but for the entire school. Sirius Black carries part of Harry's past and a shocking discovery will take place when they face each other.The acting for the most part is superb with the young actors gaining more experience every year. Emma Watson displays an enormous improvement and shows promise of a bright future. Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, has less chances of displaying his abilities but nevertheless he manages to perform a good acting. Daniel Radcliffe is not so lucky, but considering that the weight of the entire series rest on his shoulders, it's good to see him improve in this movie. Maybe he is not the best actor in the movie, but he has known the part and has made it his own.The adult cast is awesome, and even when the kids are the stars, there are fine performances by veterans of the Harry Potter series Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane as well as newcomers Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon. David Thewlis steals the movie as the gentle but cursed prof. Lupin. He manages to capture the sadness of the character and the kindness he displays to his students.Overall, this is probably the best Harry Potter movie to date. Sure, it's not as faithful to the source as the others, but the changes help it to be enjoyable for both Harry Pottewr fans and the casual movie-goer.9/10. Outstanding",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
106,bankofmarquis,The Best of the Harry Potter franchise,8,30 November 2014,"10 Years after it's release, this film remains my favorite of the Harry Potter franchise. The 3 leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) have settled into the characters and the world of movie making and are more than capable of steering these movies. The supporting cast of British acting royalty (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, David Thewliss and Gary Oldman) have a good time playing in this world and the plot is the most interesting of the series.But it is the direction of Alfonso Cuaron that sets this film apart. The first two movies, under the direction of Chris Columbus, the world of Harry Potter was established looking and feeling like a ""kids"" film. Under Cuaron's direction, it transformed into something much more adult. This is a darker story, so this film was shot very dark, the sets are dark, the costumes are dark and it rains constantly. It sets the mood very, very well.His use of everyday clothes (versus constantly being in their school uniforms) also adds to the realistic feel of this movie.As for the story, time travel plot lines are always tricky, but this movie pulls it off well and fairly.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
107,Angry_Arguer,Quixotic Fincher,10,5 June 2004,"Ridley Scott really hit on something for cinematic fantasy with 'Legend.' Just think, how many millions of dollars has Warner dumped into the 'Potter' and 'Rings' franchises only for them to blindly rip from Scott's masterpiece?Peter Jackson shamelessly plagiarized the Unicorns with his own ugly mule and here the Dementors are Darkness (I should add that it's an appalling design). Besides, the plot influence of 'Legend' spread to Japan and helped forge the RPG video games. That's billions of dollars made from one source, so why duplicate Nintendo concepts? They've already been taken by anime (now under Disney control in the US).This is your only spoiler warning...The first two 'Potter' films stunk. The director, Columbus, was a hack from the Spielberg camp of amazing us superficially versus filmic stimulation. They weren't even competent in those regards. Rowlings' formula has come to the point where she doesn't need to write anymore and should hand the rights over to Disney. But, rather than risk what Disney would do with it, she leaves it to exhibitionistic Warner--currently financing the most expensive projects of late, including this.It's Rowlings' ineptness that will probably strike many as juvenile. The writing is dumb like before, but no one has been brought in to change that philosophy. Consider, Oliver Stone made Johnny Depp the translator in 'Platoon.' Besides being a communication tool between cultures, the translator is supposed to be a master of words and dialect. Obviously, Depp has taken that to heart in his method.So to tackle the words we get a Shakespearean cast including Thompson, Christie, and especially Oldman (I'll get to that later). We even get Davis back in fantasyland after Howard abandoned him. My only complaint is that Dumbledore is exceedingly dull this time, why couldn't Branagh have taken over? That would be interesting.But that's all pointless in this film. It's all about technicals. Our photographer comes from Alan Parker this time, not Gilliam, and we have the designer of 'Elephant Man'. This is probably Craig's best work since then. The editor is pedestrian and Williams shows he is running out of tempo ideas. What really got me this time was costume design. The first two were bland, but this shows real talent in understanding colors and shape.It's amazing to see such ability overriding 'Troy.' 'Troy' had enormous amounts of technical talent, but Petersen royally screwed up the vision. Here we have a newer, fresher vision. This is Cuaron's third adaptation and shows that he finally knows what he's doing. In many cases he borrows from images we've seen before--'Wizard of Oz', 'Matrix', 'Rescuers Down Under'--but that's not his focus. Notice how, unlike the first two, this is muted in color. For the first half, despite the stupid story, I was held in awe by this Fincher-grade work straight from 'Alien3'. Too bad it didn't last into the next half.Other impressive elements:--Many scenes are constructed visually straight out of 'Catch-22' and the more dramatic lightshows are less Columbus and more directly Spielberg. Yes, I'm thinking of 'Close Encounters' and 'Empire of the Sun.'--The werewolf subplot was fumbled, but compare it to 'American Werewolf.' Rather than emphasize the Batman concept of duality and regret, we get an appreciation of the British countryside. Very nice landscapes.--Speaking of which, the cast is finally learning how to use our eye Cuaron is more appreciative in his gaze than Columbus (that could be it). Notice how Watson and Radcliffe shine more exuberantly now than before. Even Thompson does.--Now comes, quite possibly, the biggest change. The notion of play-within-play has been used before (Cervantes made it common), but this is expertly handled. This is what Zemeckis tried in 'Future' with 'Run Lola' added in--and probably why they got a Hispanic director. Watch as the characters interfere with themselves and are concerned with the passage of time. I bet it's because of this quasi-parallel universe that Oldman got the title role. Now I just wish we'd seen more of him, he's the British Depp.So, given the hamhanded attempt at maturity, this is what 'AvP' should be...the fifth 'Alien'. Not as dark as 'Empire Strikes Back', but I give kudos for trying real hard. I'll probably regret my rating later, but this is probably the most interesting sequel we'll in the near future.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
108,gregsrants,Potter just keeps getting better,7,6 June 2004,"I don't read books.  I have mentioned this in reviews before, but every time a Harry Potter movie comes out, I feel embarrassed that I am one of what seems only a handful of people that have never cracked open a J.K. Rowling experience.It's not that I can't read or that I don't have the time, it's just that I find it simpler to have a director tell me a story on the screen from their interpretation of a book or screenplay.  The best books and stories are usually purchased by Hollywood anyways, so by the time I finally get to the back cover of any purchase, the movie version would be nearing the end of its multiplex run anyhow.So when I went to see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I immediately felt out of place with the young pre-teen kids in the line both in front and behind telling their parental guides what their best parts of the book were and what scenes they are most looking forward too.  They seemed to be foaming at the mouth in anticipation while my lone spark of interest was the fact that the reins of the franchise had been turned over to director Alfonso Cuaron who also is accredited with the wonderfully, 2003 Oscar nominated film Y Tu Mama Tambien.  Such a curious choice as the first two Potter films had been incredibly successful under the watchful eye of Chris Columbus who was known for his family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone.  Cauron, on the other hand, has a much darker side as evidenced in the sexually driven Tambien and his 1998 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.  I was then peaked when it was announced that Cauron vision would be applied to the next Potter film and thus my standing in line with a group of rabid looking kids who I had no doubt will cheer as soon as the theatre lights dim.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third of the Potter books totaling five and this installment follows the growing Potter gang as Harry is faced with the threat of convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison and is expected to try and kill our young Potter as per his former masters' wishes. Of course, the books and movies would not be as popular as what they are if it wasn't for an array of magic, special effects, and mythical creatures and maybe even a plot twist or two to help keep us on our toes.  And rest assured, this adaptation has them all.  The special effects are top rate including the Dementors who are sent to protect Hogwart's and the tree outside the school, that later plays a big part in the climax, is both fascinating and provides some humor.  There is a creature in the film that is a cross between a horse and a bird that was too Harryhausen for my tastes, but I am sure it made for a wonderful character in the book and therefore I can't complain that they kept things consistent.Pretty much every actor in Britain plays a role in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon (who steps into the role vacated due to the death of Richard Harris), and the Julies (Christie and Walters) all show up on screen at one time or another.  I guess anyone that couldn't get work in Altman's Gosford Park joined a collective and put their efforts into this film.  Gary Oldman is one of the newbees to the set and he does the best with what is a very limited and understated part.  The three main characters of Potter and his two best friends are back, and it will be interesting to see them in the next Potter movie as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are now in their mid-teens and no longer the young wizards they were just three years ago.It's always hard when it comes to the third film of a franchise.  Return of the Jedi is more of an embarrassment each time I watch it (sorry, Ewoks), The Lord of the Rings and the Matrix third entries also were a disappointment.  But the Potter films seem to be getting stronger each time. I will no doubt agree that the change of director this time round was instrumental in bringing a darker storyline to the table, but to continue to better your achievements in both story and screen presentation each time is a feat not often achieved.     Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a delight.  It was a children's movie with adult situations and effects and the story was complex enough to even have me wondering to myself how it was all going to tie in together in the end.  Now, I won't pick up the next book just because of my recommendation here, but I will ensure I have a ticket for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire due out in 2005.www.gregsrants.com",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
109,Ruskington,An improvement on the first two movies but still very underwhelming,5,14 April 2020,"While I wouldn't exactly be in a hurry to watch it again, the third instalment in the series was probably my favourite so far. It is still prone to atrocious acting from Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, as well as more unforgivably poor special effects, but the story is much less cluttered and contains plenty of exciting, well-executed sequences.However, we still see all the trademarks of Rowling's weak writing. The Superman-style 'turn-back-time' plot band-aid was simply laughable, and although it was a fun part of the film, the logistics of those events just don't work. I also became aware of just how weak a lead character Harry is while watching this film. He doesn't actually achieve anything off his own back. He doesn't train hard, study hard or ever really sacrifice himself. He has genetically inherited skills that he doesn't seem to have any control or understanding of and is constantly told what to do by Hermione and all the Hogwarts staff. Dumbledore and McGonagall seem to have no other purpose in the story than to help Harry justify his place as the star of the story.One thing I will say about the series so far is that Emma Watson and Alan Rickman are both excellent. Admittedly, it would be difficult not to shine when starring alongside Radcliffe and Grint, but they still do a lot to make these films watchable. The heavy-hitting A-listers Oldman, Thompson and Spall are all decent in their roles but are not really tested in this particular film. A slight improvement but still a grotesquely overrated production.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
110,fernandoschiavi,"The Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off for a more adult stage for the series, without abandoning the fantasy elements and new Hogwarts",8,1 January 2021,"Alfonso Cuarón brought a different look and very pleased that the fans of the books, making The Prisoner of Azkaban, one of the most difficult and complex, one of the most lauded films of the franchise. The Mexican let go once the weather over the first two children and put Harry and the other students at Hogwarts during adolescence, leaving the plot darker, realistic, complex and dangerous. Everything is more compatible with the arrival of the main characters and the secondary stage of adolescence. Cuarón added more pace, humor and especially the adventure to the film, and the story flows without major interruptions. The direction leads to Harry Potter themes denser and deep, stirring with the past of the boy and bringing feelings such as anger, forgiveness and fear.This is the first film in the series that the script is extremely faithful to the book. Steve Kloves certainly faced a huge challenge since had a much more complex material at hand. He would have to deal with back and forth in time and several new elements without confusing the viewer, especially those who have not read the book. The Prisoner of Azkaban is the shortest film of Harry Potter, but his time perfectly encompasses the story, which always progresses. The film does not have many action scenes but that there are very well made, but in compensation the suspense is uninterrupted. Even being considered as an adaptation made to the letter, only a few facts are noticed really, as details of his father's friendship with Harry Lupin, Pettigrew and Sirius and his relationship with Severus Snape, the film is also not what it was for the house the screams, the film changes very quickly from Harry opinion on Sirius (one hour Harry thinks he will kill him and soon after already want to live with him). In the book they have a great conversation about everything that happened, in the film, Harry wins the Firebolt broom in the final scenes. In the book, he gets in the middle of the school year, when Harry did not even know him.
Many other elements are shown with anticipated mastery by production designer Stuart Craig, who had to worry about creating many other environments for The Prisoner of Azkaban. The Knight Bus arrives on the scene providing comic relief and to introduce to the protagonist about Sirius Black, who had escaped from Azkaban, taken as a maximum security prison in the wizarding world. The visual external and internal bus is full of details described in the books. We first representation in theaters at the Leaky Cauldron, many new environments of Hogwarts Castle as the new Hagrid's hut, located in different location of the first two films, scenarios for Divination Professor Trelawney and Professor Lupin, external scenarios never before explored in films like Hogwarts and where patios are managed aulasde Hagrid, the Shrieking Shack, further exploration scenarios in the forest, and the complex construction of the town of Hogsmeade. Often it seems like we are somewhere else and not in Hogwarts since explored many other local school and let practically the same as the previous films. For example, in one scenario, a source close to the entrance of Hogwarts, there are several statues of eagles eating snakes, which is a reference to Alfonso Cuarón and art direction did the image that appears on the flag of your country director, Mexico.Another point I noticed a sudden change to the previous movies is the issue of costumes created by Jany Temime. In class students are the uniforms, but we have noted a more modern style in order to dress these uniforms by students, with looser ties and different lengths, in addition to shirts out of pants in various characters. Already in the scenes that take place outside the classroom (which correspond to most of the scenes) are not all uniform, modern clothes for teenagers. The change is also reflected in the personality of the characters.If before the Goblin, the Three Headed Dog and even the house-elf Dobby (when compared to the perfection of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings) were heavily criticized, this production marks a revolution in the Harry Potter series in relation to visual effects. As before, several creatures were created with quality not seen in the first film. The look of the Dementors expresses very well what are the creatures. To get an idea, the special effects team took six months to create the final look of the guards of Azkaban. All scenes involving creatures are very high points of the film bringing great moments of apprehension. The animated rat Scabbers, filling Aunt Marge, and the creation of Buckbeak the Hippogriff flight with Harry, and especially the creation of Sinister and werewolf. The transformation of Lupin in werewolf close is one of the best parts of effects, as well as the movement of the creatures in the forest at night. The Whomping Willow had already aprecido especially in the earlier film, appears again excited competently and intelligently used marking the passage of time during the third school year of Harry at Hogwarts. No wonder that the film received an Oscar nomination in the category, losing the award to Spider-Man 2.John Williams composed the track again, but it does not shine as before. The track is interesting, goes well with the mood tenser and loaded and engages the viewer again, so much so that Williams was nominated again for an Oscar for best soundtrack, losing to Polish by Jan AP Kaczmarek track In Search of Neverland.
Cuarón uses photography darker and more gothic monuments (such as the statues in the yards of Hogwarts), and panoramic images and more open to show the grandeur of the scenery and to increase the suspense. There are scenes with gray skies and torrential rain, many night scenes and a few scenes with daytime sun. Cuaron also imparts a great pace to the film. The opening scene at the Dursleys, for example, is fast, but well defines Harry and his teenage side and contesting. The Mexican category is also given on plans drawn up throughout the film, which prioritize more outdoor scenes than impressive sceneries. The way Cuaron presents Dumbledore being played by a new actor comes with an expectation until he appears. We have to notice the train that takes students to Hogwarts through the rain, the movement of the camera during the fight with the werewolf Lupin as Sinister, always far away in the shadows, or the climactic scene near the lake when Patronum is conjured by someone mysterious when Harry and Sirius were surrounded by dangerous Dementors. Another scene worth mentioning is when Harry and Hermione set out to try to change the events using the setback. The camera shows them leaving the room, through the window of the school nurse and came when the two come running in the schoolyard below. The same movement occurs when they return to the same place, with the camera following the arrival in the courtyard, up and through the window, until they reached the room. Sequences are simple but well prepared and daring on the part of the director. Cuaron also has some amusing moments. The passage of the Knight Bus, or the scene where the maid of the Leaky Cauldron opens the door and comes a roar powerful, she says: ""I'll be back later,"" like a trivial, normal event (normal to the wizarding world). We also have the Marauder's Map, magical artifact useful for Harry.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off for a more adult stage for the series, which has benefited from the addition of Alfonso Cuaron who brought a new look, more realistic and copyright, which eventually became one of the most difficult films to be adapted a favorite for fans of Harry Potter. A film visually beautiful but different from the others in the series who knew better develop the characters and move past the protagonist, and rely on special effects very well done. All this without abandoning the fantasy elements and new Hogwarts.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
111,agmoldham,A new yardstick for movies,5,22 June 2004,"The Potter series is undoubtedly aimed at the 8-14 age range. I've no doubt that anyone in this age range will measure the films of the future against these films. I've no doubt I'll be castigated for saying this, but I don't think the films work for adults. Ignoring the excessive use of cgi ,I suspect that this is mostly down to the wooden acting of the three leads. Strangely, I've started siding with Malfoy who seems much more sympathetic than the aloof Potter.Anyway a prisoner is on the loose in the latest outing with a link to HP's tragic past. The measures taken to protect Hogwarts seem far more dangerous than the prisoner. There's lots of fantasy thrown into the pot and I've no doubt that the target age range will be totally spellbound.
Some of the older actors put in nice cameos, but overall the film is never compelling. 6/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
112,ja_kitty_71,Another great Harry Potter installment,10,11 July 2011,"We now come to ""year #3"" of the ""Harry Potter"" films. After inflating his uncle's sister's with his anger and unconscious magical powers after she insults him and his parents. Harry runs away from the Dursleys, and is also afraid he might get expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside the school.Harry took the ""Knight Bus"" to the Leaky Cauldron pub/inn. There, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge tells Harry he will not be expelled. But he was a bit...miffed at Harry for running away, when a supposedly dangerous criminal named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison. Later on, Harry was also informed by Arthur Weasley that Black will likely come after him.Harry journeys to Hogwarts with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. On the train they share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping when they enter it. Abruptly, the Hogwarts Express has stopped and a phantom creature called a Dementor boards, searching for Black. The creature has a profound effect on Harry, causing him to faint. Lupin awakens and repels the Dementor. At school, Headmaster Dumbledore informs the Hogwarts students that because Black has escaped, Dementors have been set up around the school as a protection. In addition to Lupin's appointment, Hagrid was also to be the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. As lessons begin, Hermione frequently arrives at their various classes by appearing out of nowhere. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable, as he teaches useful spells and helps less confident students like Neville Longbottom. However Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class does not go as planned, and on the first day, Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff Buckbeak into attacking him. His father successfully has Buckbeak sentenced to death; those Malfoys really p*** me off! So that's all I could say. You'll have to watch the film and see how it ends. I loved watching Hermione giving Malfoy a slug in the face, and I think Lupin has to be the funnest D.A.D.A teacher. Anyway, the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" goes very well with the first two Harry Potter films; another great installment.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
113,rainking_es,"I'm 27 and I love Potter... is it good, Doctor?",8,25 March 2005,"When they released Harry Potter's first movie I must confess I was a little bit reluctant; I mean, I thought it was gonna be such an stupid thing like all those Walt Disney 90's products (Mermaid, Alladdin, and so), those movies that are to be watched by stupid children. Anyway, I decided to watch it (I hadn't read none of the books neither), and it was quite a surprise. It reminded me of some great fantasy movies that I've always loved such as ""Labyrinth"", ""Neverending Story"", etc. I really liked it, and I liked the second part two. Mr. Columbus made an outstanding job to be enjoyed by children, adults, grandpa's Now this ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" came with some changes: first of all the director wasn't Chris Columbus anymore, and instead of him they recruited Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tu Mamá También""). I thought that he wouldn't be as good as Columbus, just because he has no experience on filming fantasy stuff, full of special effects and with a big big budget But then again I was wrong: Cuarón has demonstrated that he is as good in this genre than in any other else.""Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban"" is the darkest movie of this series, full of terrifying creatures, and with a nice plot. You won't look away for a second all along its 140 minutes of length. The story it catches you, that fantasy world, Howard's, the teachers, the talking pictures!, and some secrets that are revealed. The starring trio does it as well as in the two previous parts. We've lost Richard Harris as the director of the school (rest in peace, Mr. Harris), but Michael Ganbom makes a honorable substitution. We got some new teachers two, such as Emma Thompson's weird character (look at those glasses!!!), and last but not least, we got the Prisoner of Azkaban: the histrionic (that's why I love him, any problem about it?) and excessive Gary Oldman.The best that someone can say about a movie like this is that it is QUITE an entertaining artifact. I like drama, and social cinema but from time to time you need to go back to your childhood, and escape from this adult world watching movies like Harry Potter's ones.My Rate: 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
114,russem31,The best of the 4 so far,9,3 December 2005,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the 4 films that are out (as of December 2005). The main kudos goes to the director, Alfonso Cuarón (the director of the acclaimed film Y Tu Mamá También). He brought out the adolescent natures of Harry Potter and his friends, starting with their loose clothing (as kids their age would do, whereas in the first 2, the clothes were kempt and proper) and flowing hairstyles (again the kids starting to show their independent natures as opposed to the first two films). The music is also the best of the 4 films, John Williams having outdone himself - this score is the best he has done in quite a long time, putting such varied styles into the film to make it a musical feast. But not only this, unlike the other 3 films which for me are merely adaptations of the beloved books, this one is an actual film which has a proper beginning, middle, and end and not just cut-and-pasted scenes as per book. Therefore, I give this film a well-done 9 out of 10! Highly recommended.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
115,FilmOtaku,Near perfection,8,21 June 2004,"Everything that I disliked or criticized about the previous two Harry Potter films (which I absolutely didn't like) were masterfully done in the third installment of the series, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is a triumph  even scenes that I was cringing in anticipation over based on earlier CGI work, (the Quidditch match, the werewolves, etc.) were brilliant.  Overall, the film was a lot darker, a lot meatier, and had an exponential amount of style over its predecessors. Among the many amazing techniques that could be mentioned, Cuaron briefly introduces hand-held camera work, experimental use of color in various scenes, and best of all, not being a fan of the fantasy genre, steady pacing that never once allowed me to be bored.  Possible spoilersOf course, making this next statement is dangerous because I may eat my words after seeing the fourth installment, but it is encouraging to see that as Harry Potter gets older and edgier, the films do the same.  This could solely be attributed to Cuaron's direction; only time will tell.  The best assessment of this film is that coming from a highly critical, general hater of fantasy film viewer, there were only two miniscule criticisms I had regarding this film.  One of them was the cheesy way the film ended, (meaning, the last three seconds) and the other is quite possibly my own fault, and that is the very neat and quick turnaround of Sirius Black.  I was a bit confused as to how in one moment, Harry was in peril and the next, everything was cleared up rather easily, but again, that may just be a misunderstanding on my own part.The bottom line is that this is a first-rate film that (again, not an easy thing for a cynical viewer like me to say) truly is a film for any generation to enjoy.  There are many other films that are accredited with this distinction (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Disney cartoons) but this is one of the first times I actually agree with them.  The aforementioned films that I have seen, I feel, do not translate well into adult viewership; the most that can be said is that the film is `cute'.  `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is not `cute', it is a bona fide good film and it has done what the first two films of the series couldn't do  not only thoroughly enjoy myself, but give me a reason to see the next installment.--Shelly",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
116,jpschapira,Well done Cuarón...,8,10 December 2005,"I don't feel the need of writing about Harry Potter movies. I have read the books, I have been (in my mind) inside the magical world, I have witnessed the experiencesNow I'll try to write about the third part of J.K Rowling's fantasy. Why this and not any of the others? Probably because it is the best movie (not novel) of the first three and because I plan to write about the others eventually.People have asked me why I think this one's the best, as in asking for reasons. I don't know if I can give a list of things that define this one as the better one. I can explain it saying that it's something you sense; on the whole. This is a well rounded project in all of its parts; and it's not even perfect.Anyway, here I go with everything I think; like it or not. Alfonso Cuarón is a truly gifted filmmaker. ""A little princess"" is one of the most wonderful things I've seen in my life, it still amazes me today; ""Y tu mamá también"" has no shameMaybe that gift made him take Harry Potter from where it needed to be taken.So he grabbed his work strictly from the view of film-making. I explain: in the first two deliveries, Chris Columbus took a commitment with Rowling's story; Cuarón took a commitment with the plain fact of making a movie. What he chose is much darker, obscure, and mysterious; apart from Columbus' shining universe.There are deep moving issues in the novels, and Columbus knew it, but didn't show it; now there are long talks about the characters' past. The screenplay is shorter and not so ""by the book"" as the last two; which explains clearly the freedom Cuarón took for the film. There's an intense development of personalities, which is a positive aspect for every element of the movie.Take the young actors that this is just as the only thing they've done in their lives and I still can't say if they've got the skill. Daniel Radcliffe's character actually faces his past for the first time in this film, and that requires a different approach. Rupert Grint's character has to deal with problems of the heart; with feelings. Emma Watson's character takes the helm of everything, has to handle a different kind of responsibility; and they all have to reach other levels.A blessing is to see the ensemble coming to life. A blessing is to imagine and think about the actors that will play the characters you've met in the book. A blessing was to see Emma Thompson in a wonderful portrayal as Professor Trelawney, to meet Sirius Black in the skin of a curly-haired Gary Oldman and meet the revelation of the journey David Thewlis portraying R.J Lupin. Plus, Alan Rickman's Snape is better every minute; Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith maintain the class and Robbie Coltrane keeps his fun going.Not to mention the visualsTo achieve his perfect world, Cuarón recurred to his old editing collaborator Steven Weisberg, who got his vision perfectly, taking everything to the sky. The cinematography by Michael Seresin is also a remarkable; in the best representation of this tale that has been able to keep one thing going during its three deliveriesFrame by frame, shot by shot, moment by moment, nothing stays still; there's always some element that connects the image with another thing to keep a continuous movement.Look closely.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

118,rebeljenn,the best so far,7,29 December 2005,"'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sees Harry becoming an older and more rebellious character, this time wanting to escape the escape prisoner Sirius Black. In this story, Potter learns even more about his parents and about himself. This story and film is much more darker than the previous two, and although there is too much to fit into the film, the editing was done well to allow the most important parts crucial to the films success. I would recommend reading the book to get more of the depth of the story because some parts had to be cut out completely, and these are no-doubt relevant to what happens later on. Mainly, these were more character-focused scenes to build up the characters rather than action scenes.The film is also less innocent than the original, and there is more detail in the scenes and more character to these scenes. It's very good, and this is a sure winner for Potter fans. Even if you're not a Potter fan, you will enjoy it. Just don't forget to read the books!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
119,EijnarAmadeus,The latest and best,8,12 June 2004,"The first HARRY POTTER we saw on the big screen was pretty young, today he isn't just pretty young; he's a baby! Daniel Radcliffe is much more mature and looking better in every way in this third story of Harry Potter. The movie is much darker, much more thrilling and satisfying than any of the two before. The movie is truly fabulous I tell you, and with all the fantastic characters this movie is even far more interesting than the others!
Radcliffe, Watson and Grint playing the three main characters is just a little gig against Rickman's genius Snape, Thompson's addition and what about Coltrane, amazing! The movie attacks you quickly with its aggressive and tricky main title appearing, from there the magic goes on as usual in Harry Potter's wicked world. The music by Zimmer is as always brilliant but I think the director deserves a lot of the honour here! He has put his totally own twist into it and that makes a fantastic twist too I tell ya'!
HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is just as entertaining, magical and wonderful watching as the two others when they were released. Although Potter has taken a huge step forward in movie making I think. Radcliffe may not be the greatest actor, but he is cool and relaxed in his role making Harry look better than ever before. Rupert Grint charms everybody as the funny Ron, and Emma Watson is truly beautiful and sweet! Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis and Gary Oldman just adds more magic into the movie and makes it just better! The latest Harry Potter is really a killer fine movie that is without doubt the best of the three so far. I canæt wait for the next! STARS: 5/5",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
120,hte-trasme,Shouldn't be held prisoner,7,25 January 2010,"I've been watching the Harry Potter movies despite being the one person in society who hasn't read the books, and I've been enjoying them. The series got a new director for ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" and that's immediately apparent not just from the name on the credits but from a noticeably different stylistic feel. As a consequence, the strengths and weaknesses of the third film are balanced a little differently from those of the first two. One of the most immediately arresting, memorable, and commendable things about ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the extraordinarily imaginative and well-realized visual style, far outpacing the already-impressive first two films. It's packed with stunningly-created sights such as the aunt who is blown up like a balloon, talking shrunken heads, crooked offices, and rather haunting moving mugshots on the newspapers. I even loved little touches such as the addition of a uniform number and realistic-looking sports equipment to the quiddich game. I don't know how much of this stuff was described is prose form by J. K. Rowling and how much was created for this film, but I'm hugely impressed: I feel as if I could pause the film at any shot and spend fifteen minutes examining the background.I also appreciated Alonso Cuaron's approach to handling scenes. There was a little bit more down-to-Earth realism cutting through people's interactions in the magical world in the film, and I appreciated that. Again, little touches such as Harry Potter's reactions to his uncle's family's obnoxiousness, the very authentically middle-school was Draco Malfoy and friends circle round to gang up on the heroes, and little offhand indications of running jokes between characters that we now know have known each other for a while (""How is it she knows everything?"") make a big difference. There is a strong strain of dark humor running through this particular film, casting special light on officialdom's obliviousness to the fact that Harry Potter might want to know there's a convicted murderer chasing him down, and I appreciate it. Character-wise, the leads are growing up enough to get some more satisfying development, and Harry Potter himself especially is becoming a very rounded character with a stubborn, anti-establishment streak that I enjoy. Due to a sad death among the cast Michael Gambon is called upon as a replacement -- he avoids imitation and is as excellent as ever.In many senses, then, I found this film superior -- but unfortunately the way its plot is handled felt a little unsatisfactory to me. After a certain point where a major twist occurs involving how we perceive one of the characters, a number of things start failing to make sense to me or to be explained. I think issues of what actually happened between Pettigrew, Black, Lupis, and Harry Potter's father are only hinted at here, with the expectation that fans already understand them. What's more, they are sprung upon us very quickly without much of a lead-in. In all I found this stylistically a joy and far ahead of it predecessors, which were no slouches, but the muddled plot line mitigates that somewhat.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Of course, they ARE teens now. But they've actually become disrespectful, yelling SHUT UP to adults and generally acting a bit too much like I see kids doing everywhere. It make it a bit more difficult to actually LIKE the kids the way we have in the past. The story is, as usual, very good, the acting first-rate and the special effects are better than the previous films. There is a little less ""wonder"" built in, with emphasis on the story and characters rather than the magical stuff at Hogwarts (floating candles and the like). The tone of this film is a good bit darker than the previous two also. However, I still enjoyed watching it and will, as always, eagerly await the next installment of the Harry Potter series.

Of course, there is a concern for Hogwarts as the inevitable fight between good and evil continues once again. Yet, I found the eventual plot twist so distasteful and unbelievable that it crashed my suspension of belief & ruined the film for me.This movie is a bit darker than the previous two films before it.

124,Son_of_Mansfield,Harry Potter and the Difference of Direction.,8,14 March 2005,"This third Harry Potter film strays from both the lighter Chris Columbus movies and the book it is based on. This means that it sticks out like a sore thumb, but it is a well directed sore thumb. It is by far the most exciting of the three movies. The movie may not be quite as magical as the first two, but it does capture some of the severity of the book. The scene in the shrieking shack is tense. The scene where Harry goes into a hallway after seeing Peter on the Maurauder's Map, while not in the book, is still an effective scene. I think that it was wise to take out the center of the book, because, none of the movies written by Steven Kloves are very faithful except in structure anyway. Why keep the basic story, but slant everything and say ""we are faithful""? The removal of the middle made the film easier to make exciting without that all that nasty character development that we hate so much. Fans of the book looking for a straight adaptation will be and have been disappointed. If Mike Newell can combine Columbus's whimsy with Cauron's tension, Goblet of Fire may be magical and exciting. Of course, this is assuming that Steve Kloves will stop doing the Reader's Digest versions of the books in his screenplays. The actors are growing up nicely. There is a stronger Daniel Radcliffe and a Hermonie that is ready for her date with Krum. Unfortunately, Richard Harris, who was a fine Dumbledore, is no longer with us. He is missed. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon is very different, but stronger in his portrayal. The music by John Williams is impressive as always. This is a very good movie that must be approached openly, although I would be very open to a version that followed the book more closely.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
125,jdkraus,Alfonzo has directed the best Harry Potter film ever!,8,15 June 2004,"I honestly thought that this film was going to be a failure, but I was proven wrong. It is better than the first two films! Not necessarily a triumph over the others though. The prisoner of Azkaban was always my least favorite of the series. To me, the book was too dark. the movie was dark though too. I say the first two films are based upon the magic of Hogwarts while the third is about the true, present darkness of the wizard world. I will not say anymore, so I won't be considered a spoiler! the film is also different for many reasons and the same. here's a list of differences and similarities.Same:                                    Differences: 1.) cast members                        1.) New Dumbledore 2.) Music theme                         2.) New locations 3.) location                            3.) More maturity/teenage like 4.) A child film                        4.) Darker cinematography/story 5.) An unsolved mystery                 5.) New teachers/clothing The differences are more approving than the similarities. however, it has amazed how much the cast as AGED!! Snape has aged, Neville is thin, Harry, and his two friends. Also Malfoy has a RIDICULOUS haircut, and is more of a 'pussy'! (Watch the film, witness what happens to him.) I also noticed more things happened in the background, more moving pictures, creatures and entertainment. the actor who played Dumbledore did not do a bad job! He did well, but his beard looked RIDICULOUS! the music was more teenage like, the action was more intense, the humor, more hilarious, and the grounds of Hogwarts was a lot more explored, which i was most glad about!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
126,Prichards12345,"Oooh, It's so dark!",7,26 July 2007,"This third outing for Harry Potter sees the franchise beginning to expand on its roots. The feel of this movie is different compared to Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, giving us a darker, more intense experience. Harry and his pals are growing up fast, our hero having to come to terms with the fact that the psychopathic betrayer of his parents to Lord Voldemort has broken out of the wizard's prison Azkaban (a sort of magical version of Broadmoor)and is possibly hunting him.Director Alphonso Curaron wastes no time in setting up the plot, which fairly zips along, bypassing the occasionally leaden pace of the first two films. And the basic theme of the story - that of facing up to fears and conquering them, gives it slightly more gravitas, too. Curaron takes a few more risks with the material, and generally brings it off, although the ""darkness"" of the story is only relative. Get Carter it isn't.Certain scenes will stay in your memory, The ""Boggart Bit"" and the hilarious sight of Alan Rickman in drag. Hard to picture him as the Sheriff Of Nottingham after this! The leads do reasonably well again, and David Thewlis is a welcome addition to the regular cast. And it's great to see Gary Oldman playing on his image as the escaped dark wizard Sirius Black. Of course there's more about him than meets the eye...Michael Gambon takes over the role of Albus Dumbledore from the late Richard Harris, although he doesn't have the same sort of charm, coming across as a bit stroppy on occasion. It is always difficult to replace an already accepted actor in the part, though.If it were possible, I'd give Prisoner of Azkaban 7.5, as it's the best of the first three films, but I'll have to settle for the same rating as Chamber of Secrets.Highly recommended, though it might be hard to pick up the story if you've not seen the first two.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
127,Movi3DO,Story lost me a bit,7,14 June 2021,"LUMOS MAXIMA!! Let there be light.The third in the franchise, and we followed Harry Potter and his friends in their third year. It's worth noting that the director changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón.Even though this is the third, I'm still amazed at the new magic tricks that the source material created. They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad.The biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow.Even though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner.Overall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience. The story was more complex, which was good and enjoyable, but nonetheless still felt too long and lost me couple of times. 7/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
128,TheOtherFool,"Yep, they're back again",6,22 June 2004,"Harry Potters third adventure is darker and grimmer than the first two (probably mainly because of it's new director), but that doesn't necessarily make it better... or worse, for that matter.First shots of the movie are a nice touch, as it's shot from the hand, and it shows us the movie's gonna be a bit more for the elder, as there's a foul-mouthed auntie who's getting blown up by Harry, before he leaves the house of his uncle Vernon, for good as it seems this time.He leaves for Hogwarts where the place is garded by Dementors as known killer Sirius Black (who reportedly betrayed Harry's mom and dad to Him That Shall Not Be Named (or whatever)) has escaped the infamous Azkaban (probably named after Alcatraz?), who's out to get Harry as well.Harry gets help from his old pals Ron and Hermione as well as new teacher Lupin to fight of the danger, but things aren't as they first appear (as you would expect).Before we go any further, I'd like to state I haven't read the books of Rowling, so I don't care if Hagrids hut is further from the castle than it should, and things like that. So if Cuaron thinks he should do it this way, it doesn't mean it's better or worse the way Columbus did it, it's just different.Having said that, I like the athmosphere of this movie better than the first two. Maybe because it is aimed at a bit older public (I'm 25 right now), it was a bit more exciting and scary. In fact, the Dutch certification for this movie was 9 years and older, a certification never used before. No kids stuff, for sure.The actors themselves look and act older as well. Harry looks a bit tougher and Ron has his eyes set out for Hermione, and I think many 15 year olds in the audience can't really blame him.So we have grimmer athmosphere, a more mature cast for a more mature audience, what about the story?Too bad it is exactly here the movie goes wrong. The story has it's dull moments (with 141 minutes, this really is too long people!) and flies all over the place, with some characters with too little screen time (Hagrid, Dumbledore, but more importantly, Draco) and others with too much (Hermione in particular). The 'surprise meeting' in the (ehm, forgot how the place was called), well, you know, when they're pulled underneath the tree was really silly, and the worst thing still had to come.I'm talking, of course, about the 'going back in time' incident. Why oh why do they keep on doing this. It's like that old Superman joke: why doesn't Superman ALWAYS fly around the earth so that he can undo ALL evil. I had the same with (I think) the 8th Startrek movie, where the crew goes back in time to stop those who already went back. When they're stopped, why don't they try it again, or at another point. If you have this ability to travel through time, why not use it all the time?The same things happens here. By going back in time, Harry and Hermione save the innocent, as they say. Well, if they know how to do that (and it looked really easy), why not save Harry's parents then? Why not use it for more important things than simply being able to catch more classes?It's a bit of a let-down, how this ended, and I'm sure it's the same in the book, but having not read them I can only judge the movie and I think that was a terrible mistake.All in all: it's not a bad movie for sure, and it had some enjoyable moments, but can't really give it any more than a 6/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

130,griffolyon12,The Best Potter Yet!!!,10,8 July 2007,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved the first two films.When I heard that they got a new director(Alfonso Cuaron) for the third installment I was worried,but I must say I worried over absolutely nothing.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins when Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) accidentally blows up his Uncle Vernon's sister like a balloon after she makes an off-color remark about his parents.Wrapped in anger Harry runs away.Through various trials Harry makes it back to the wizarding world,and is reunited with his friends,to learn that a dark wizard named Sirius Black(Gary Oldman),who followed Voldermort,has broken out of Azkaban(a wizard prison) and is out to kill Harry.When Harry returns to school he meets an old friend of his fathers,while he learns more about Sirius Black learning he is his godfather and that he betrayed his parents,angering Harry.Throughout the film Harry battles these dark,hooded creatures known as Dementors,he prepares for a confrontation with Sirius Black,and battles his own inner demons.Overall this film is much darker,and more serious in tone than the first two,which in my opinion has only made it better.Once more the cinematography,special effects,and production design is superb and definitely creates this believable fantasy world,although the look of the film is different it fits the darker story,and I even prefer this film's look at times to the first two.That isn't all that is different,John Williams is back this time,but tries something that is much more darker and a little less playful,and it works helping to create this amazing fantasy.Once again the acting is great,although their is a new Dumbledore(in Michael Gambon).What really is the show stealer is the directing,Chris Columbus has stepped down as director and Alfonso Cuaron takes his place at the helm of this franchise and he does an amazing job.Cuaron takes the dark tone of the story and sells it to the audience while still retaining much of the look of the first two,just adding on.Cuaron also transforms the three leads into teenagers in this film and expands their characters even further.Cuaron and screenwriter Steve Kloves definitely need a huge pat on the back for the time turner sequence.This third outing in Harry's world is darker,and at times scarier than the first two.I find it hard to believe this got by with a PG rating.The kids have now grown up into rebellious teenagers and are now handling more mature themes and adult problems thus adding to its darker tone.Its darker tone in fact actually makes it better and more enjoyable.With more character development than previous entries,just as many laughs,more emotion,and more heart than the first two,this film is the best entry in this franchise so far.A superbly perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
131,movieguy1021,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 8/10,8,6 June 2004,"Finally! A breath of fresh air comes to the Harry Potter series! After the two good, but not great, films directed by Chris Columbus, which were both pretty much the same, something new had to come to the series. Something that could take this series and spin it in a whole new direction. Something to make this children's series a bit less childish. That something is director Alfonso Cuaron.The titular wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) is back for his third year of wizarding school at Hogwarts. After defeating the evil wizard Voldemore twice already, he learns that a serial killer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban prison and is out to get him. In addition, the prison guards, computer-generated Dementors, come to Hogwarts looking for Black, but seem to affect Harry, also. Add some more teenage angst (after all, these people are 13), and you've got a recipe for a great third film of a series.It's sad to see how much of an asset Cuaron is to the Harry Potter series to see all of his talent go down the drain by a truly awful script by Steven Kloves. His first two scripts were mediocre-just general, basically stealing exactly from the book. But this script, being that it's based off the longest of three books so far made into movies (and it's the best of the five so far), his first mistake is making it shorter than the first two. A book that's maybe 75 pages longer than the others shouldn't be 20-30 minutes less than those. The movie's really for those who have read the books, because most of the things that are crucial are just referenced to in the movie. Many other crucial details are just plain left out in order for more ""humor"" involving the Whomping Willow tree.But now I have to praise Cuaron. He takes the mess that is Kloves' script and does the best he can with it, which is pretty good. As I said previously, the first two movies were pretty childish and by-the-book, so to speak. Here, Cuaron uses adult stylings to make this movie more open to adults. Instead of showing off what he can do with special effects, he uses them minimally, basically as an understatement, just using them whenever necessary. Therefore, this scarcity of the special effects made them more welcome. Although the werewolf that comes in at the end of the movie looked like it was something straight out of Van Helsing, at least it wasn't too overdone.I also have to applaud Cuaron for his artistic license. In Kloves' previous scripts, he had a few Quidditch games that went on for way too long, brought nothing to the table, and looked way too fake. Here, there's only one that's short and has a purpose. Although everything had a purpose in J.K. Rowling's books, here much felt rushed and just there to get it out of the way. That's what it's like in Azkaban, also, but it, for the most part, works, since I have read the books. Much of what was needed to make the books work weren't in the movie and were omitted for the relationship between the characters to build. And it worked. You could see the palpable bonding between most of the characters. That's why this movie is better than the first two: it spends more time on what we actually care about: the characters, not how much money they had in the budget to create special effects.Sure, I have a few complaints, such as John Cleese not coming back as the ghost Nearly-Headless-Nick, Gary Oldman's underuse, and other minor details. But for the most part, Cuaron saves a movie series from a line of childish directing and terrible writing and turns it into something that is very real and something that other series (such as the Lord of the Rings) could have used.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for frightening moments, creature violence and mild language.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
132,Min111,There was no Voldemort,8,18 December 2019,"I found this movie to be particularly interesting. It was the only movie in the series that didn't feature ""you know who"", and that somehow worked. It was more than an interesting film.This was a movie that introduced us the Dementors, and they become prominent later-on. So, if you do see the films following the Prisoner of Azkaban, and you feel confused, maybe it's because you forgotten to see a particular film of the series (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban).This is a movie unlike the others that probably divides many people. Some say it's a great movie; others say it's the worst movie. I think it was okay.Why is that though? Good question - There are a lot of people that think the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best film of the series, mainly because of the plot, and that it's the third year, and that things are starting to move along at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but either way, the Prisoner of Azkaban is a unique film in its own right. It's unique because it's the only movie which didn't feature...Like the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also a good film. Remember the Harry Potter books? The first three books were short. That's why I find Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban interesting, film and book.This movie, as you can tell from the title, and a wonderful title is about the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". Who is the ""Prisoner of Azkaban""? Serius Black. Forget about ""You know who"" for now. In this movie, it's about Serius Black, who becomes very important in Harry's adventures later in the movies.Serius Black is a very important character within the Harry Potter series, so in order to effectively enjoy the films from Prisoner of Azkaban and onwards, I would advise the Harry Potter fans to learn more about Serius Black, and why he's important to Harry Potter's journey, especially against ""you know who"". That way, you will enjoy Harry Potter even more, especially Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.If you can learn about Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid and so on, characters we all like, then why can't you also learn about and like Serius Black? He's very important in their lives and adventures starting from the third movie.In the Harry Potter series, majority people think of the first two and final two of the Harry Potter films as their favourites, but why not the four films in the middle? with one of them being the Prisoner of Azkaban.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
133,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A brilliant installment!,10,15 August 2009,"Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwart's school of Witchcraft and Wizardy but trouble has started in the world of non-magic folks aka Muggles. It seems Harry has accident inflated his Aunt Marge (Pam Farris) and runs away to be united with his best friends in the whole wide galaxy known as Hermonine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn) as he goes back into the world of magic for his new school year.

Not only that but also some Death-esquire Dementors are searching around for him to have his soul but can Harry find out who the true heir of Voldermort is and is Sirius really the one behind it? One of the best installments of the series by far! Alfonso Cauron takes Chris Columbus place as director with Columbus as executive producer as it's the most artsy and complex of the series. The film does replace Richard Harris with Michael Gambon for Dumbledore and reunites Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Julie Waters as Mrs. Weasley, Maggie Smith as Professor McGarnagle, John Cleese as Nearly-Headless Nick and introduces new characters like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelaway. Here the film is more darker and more complex then it's processors but has more improved acting on the kid cast being no longer kids but teens.There's plenty of surprises and dark stuff galore with a good storyline including faithfulness to the book in this installment that makes this the most beloved movie of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

135,RossRivero99,Just as magical as the first two,10,5 June 2017,"These days Alfonso Cuaron has proved himself to be one of the finest film directors of his generation thanks to him making great films like ""Children of Men"" (2006) and ""Gravity' (2013) along with adding this movie to his resume of memorable films back in 2004. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third of 8 films in the entire Harry Potter franchise and it is a really good movie even though it isn't really as original as the first two movies in the series, even though Cuaron is very engaged with his storytelling here. Like the first two films the main characters along with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who still continues his adventures at Hogwarts with his two good friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint), but the threat against Harry is much more serious against him this time. The threat to Potter and his friends is realized after he returns to Hogwarts and is told by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) that a convicted murderer by the name of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from the prison of Azkaban who is supposedly out to kill Potter. After the other professors find out about this threat Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells all Hogwarts students that they have set creatures that look like the Grim Reaper called Dementors at every single entrance on the grounds of the Hogwarts campus. Black was convicted in Voldemort's plot to kill Harry Potter's parents but towards the end of the movie Black becomes a changed man, for reasons that I will not spoil. The visuals are still breathtaking as ever, and the supporting characters along with Black and Lupin, as well as the likes of Dumbledore, Snape (Alan Rickman), McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Trelawney (Emma Thompson) are expertly written. There are also other great components of this movie including the script by Steve Kloves who also wrote the screenplays for the first two films, as well as mind-blowing editing, excellent cinematography, brilliant performances, and the haunting score by the legendary John Williams are what make this movie work on a full scale. Though I have no problems with this movie, I do have a problem with Warner Bros. for not honoring the replacement request from Richard Harris who originally played Professor Dumbledore, of which Harris wanted his good friend Peter O'Toole to replace him after his death. Though Michael Gambon was excellent as Dumbledore I do happen to think that O'Toole could have done him one better. Despite that I still think that this is one of the finest films of 2004.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.As one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Overall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes.

138,dr_foreman,the best entry in a strong series,10,10 June 2004,"""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best Harry Potter movie so far - and I'm not at all embarrassed to admit that I enjoyed the first two films as well. Critics of this series puzzle me; the books are good potboilers, and so are the movies, so what's to complain about?  The casting and production design in each film has been pretty much perfect.  Certainly, the Potter films are closer in ""look"" and tone to the books' vision than the mysteriously acclaimed Lord of the Rings movies, which drain much of the whimsy out of Middle Earth and turn the whole saga into an Orc-hewing action fest.The only thing that was missing from the first two Potter films was an arty director, and lo and behold, they got Alfonso Cuaron to replace Chris Columbus for Azkaban.  But I certainly didn't hate Columbus' directing, and arguably his straightforward style was well suited to the material, since the early books were not particularly atmospheric.  Only with Azkaban did the Potter books begin to truly emphasize elements of mood, horror, and danger, and so the movies shift in tone at exactly the same point as the source material.  This was the right time to bring Cuaron on board.Defenses of Columbus aside, Cuaron inarguably takes him to school here by managing to tell a coherent story and getting fancy with his camerawork at the same time (Columbus had trouble with the latter trick).The special effects get better every time, with Buckbeak the Hippogriff making the biggest impression here.  It's funny how much they can make you care about some CGI creature!  The Dementors are awesome, swooping Reaper-like creatures who add a welcome stab of Gothic horror to the proceedings.  Every segment that features the Dementors is wonderfully suspenseful - much more suspenseful, in fact, than the flat attack scenes involving the Wraiths in Lord of the Rings.  It's amazing what a director can achieve when he's got a sense of good pacing and actually holds his shots...Casting is great again, with Emma Thompson giving a memorably loopy performance as the seer and David Thewlis making a very charismatic Lupin. The Harry/Lupin scenes are in fact my favorite part, and the character development in this film clearly eclipses what we've seen before, particularly in the more action-oriented Chamber of Secrets.  As for Michael Gambon - well, he rocks.  I'm not on board with comments that he's inferior to Richard Harris.  For goodness' sake, Harris was almost impossible to hear in the second film!  Gambon is louder, more colorful, and more brash, and that's good.  Shame his role is quite truncated, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the next film.  Ditto Gary Oldman, who seems to be having fun playing a ridiculously OTT Sirius Black.I'm glad to see that the movie's early box office receipts are so strong - and people thought the era of Harry Potter was over!  I can hardly wait for the fourth film, which is in Mike ""Donnie Brasco"" Newell's capable hands.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The imagery is beautiful and amazing, such as Buckbeak the hippogriff's appearance.  There has been much creative license taken with the original book, we must admit. But a few of the changes could be called improvements, such as the development of the Marauder's Map.

To be honest here, I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story, but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry, Hermione, and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared, as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor, the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured, and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two.If you enjoyed the first two movies, that's fine.

While the first two films were visualy stunning I had found them to be a tad on the dull side with too much of the books adapted and too many somewhat dull scenes.. however this one seems to have gone the opposite route..  this film seems somewhat rushed, as though we are missing storylines.. things seemed to move too fast to have much of an impact and many of the characters, particularly the adult ones, seemed to filter in and out with little development.. Someone who missed the first two chapters and then checked in for this one would be completly lost. Not that this one is without its merits, the kid actors are developing into decent thespians and growing with their roles, and I did apreciate the slightly darker tone that this version took.. but the storyline just seemed to lurch along too much without satisfying resolutions.. they really need to kinda split the difference on the next installment.

146,willcundallreview,A technical master class,8,10 July 2015,"Rating-8/10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the hugely popular Harry Potter series of adapted films, and what an important one this is. This is a step up not only from the first two in the franchise, but when looking at the series as a whole, this stands as one of the very best. Technically it's beautiful, directed with an air of class and looks sinister yet underneath holds a loving and philosophical tone.This is the kind of movie that many film series just never have, one that stands out and is remembered at times as one with a slightly quirky edge to it. The whole story centres around the escape of convict Sirius Black and basically how frightened all the wizards are because of it, but that's not all this is about. Not including the Quidditch and of course magical lessons, this also contains a kind of heartbreaking story that connects with the main plot to make this an emotional ride, and one that may at times have some reaching for the tissues.Radcliffe and co return better than before, now they aren't quite top quality yet but there are signs here of what is truly to come in future careers. The addition of David Thewlis makes the teaching staff look even better at acting, Alan Rickman as the ever miserable Snape has still got it and cast members such as Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid) make's a much more emotional display. The producers(among them Christopher Columbus who directed the first two) create a cast that is imaginative yet also strangely dark, creating a lovely fresh new look for the movie's.This film cannot be reviewed without mentioning the absolutely magnificent technical achievements coursing though this piece. The cinematography is just amazingly fine, in fact watching this for the camera shots, it is beautiful and the fun ways in which it works makes it stand out to us the viewer too, all credit to Michael Seresin. The sets are well made too, dark yes but it makes this look all together much different from the first two movies, less for the children and more for the growing teenager.Alfonso Cuaron is the real mastermind behind this movie, directing it in a way I don't think anyone could have imagined. He makes it as previously mentioned quirky, and he lets the more serious scenes run their course, letting the comedy also have it's time in the limelight. Cuaron makes this just generally new looking, you'd struggle to find a fantasy film so serious yet so as if it were made to be overly crazy.Is it unique, well yes, is it smart well yes I suppose it is but the main point is emotion, now without ruining the ending it could be said emotions run high(without me saying if they're happy or sad). Harry deals with a lot in the movie, and this Harry Potter as well who lets face it, deals with an over abundance of crazy hijinks on a seemingly daily basis, or maybe that could a yearly basis actually. So overall a new take on a fantasy series that always brings something new to the frontier of movie making, it's a very good piece and one I am sure that will live on in the minds of movie fans and of course Potter fans, for many many years.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I can see why this is most Potterheads' favorite HP film, thanks to the perfect story, the time travel sequence and Alfonso Cuaron's direction.

148,PyrolyticCarbon,"Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.",6,17 January 2005,"After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer.Oh sure it was better than the Philosophers Stone, but better than Chamber of Secrets? Surely, with the more adult storyline and the darker mood, surely it was better. The Director had even been changed, and that could make it go either way.Well I wasn't so much disappointed as not excited enough. Yes, it was darker and much more for an adult audiences taste with an extremely clever plot, but there were still some problems with it all.Firstly, the eighty minutes of scene setting and build up, in that time we hardly see anything that's really concerned with the final part of the movie. Just the usual character settings and plot explanations.Then there are the standard plot deviations to explain something new about the Potter universe, and once complete we pop back into the story. This is fine, but in this movie I felt there was too much of that.Yet again, as with the other two films, there is the ending and the many unanswered questions. For example, why doesn't Professor Snipes say anything about Harry blasting him, what happens to the Dementors and why were they after Harry in the first place on the train? There are lots of these and mostly popping up nearer the end of the movie.There's also one of the major plot twists just happening with the wet fanfare of a single trumpeter. In fact the turn happens so quickly and without notice you do suddenly wonder why and what the hell just went on.Unfortunately, I do think Michael Gambon is a great actor, but not as Dumbledore, not as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. His acting and mannerisms are totally wrong for the part and present more of a bungling old man rather than the wise and all knowing character that Harris portrayed.Still, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are very good in their roles. Also the effects were excellent in this movie, in particular the Dementors, the Hypocrate creature and once again the spider! The story overall is much more enjoyable and more representative of a movie plot line than the other two. The darkness and maturity also provide for a much stronger and watchable movie, however the shortcomings are still too much for me to overlook and really be taken into the film and the world of Harry Potter.I think it will now become very interesting as to how the stories progress with such obviously ageing actors in the lead roles and a new Director for the next movie and a new Screenwriter onboard after that. For me, I would like these changes to be for the better, although sticking with Alfonso Cuarón for another movie might have been a wise move.We can but wait and see. As for the DVD, the same issues are in this DVD as before, the extras are difficult to get to and you never really know what each menu option is for. However, it does have a very cool style to the navigation, but still no audio commentary!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

These are the questions Harry, Hermione and Ron must solve in order to find the truth and save Harry from the killer and the Dementors who seems to have a sick obsession with him. They attacked Harry every change they got, what was that all about? The Dementors have got to be the scariest monsters in the HARRY POTTER universe and one I would never want to meet in the flesh. Now this is allot darker then the first two and really little kids around five or six might find it too scary. But kids 7 and older can handle this scariness of this one.

The movie itself lives up to its counterpart really well, the story is iconic, the characters had actors that portrayed them marvelously, all in all this movie was great, the camera angles were intensely satisfying. I've always been a massive Harry Potter fan ever since being a kid but when I watched this again after so many years you pick up on so many different hidden gems and its great when you do see them.I thoroughly was entertained as well as intrigued in the amazing plot wondering where its going next, its good when a movie can keep you on the edge of your seat like this one, truly superb. Daniel Radcliffe has been doing a great job being an actor and in this he is so unexpectedly courageous and entertaining, I hope no one replays Harry Potter as no one can live up to this peformance, highly recommend checking this out, definately worth every minute.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
151,david-meldrum,The Series Hits Its Sweet Spot,9,1 June 2021,"By now the series has found its sweet spot between dark and light, fear and wonder, childhood and adulthood, strangeness and convention. Cuaron is an excellent director who can seemingly turn his hand to any sort of film that comes his way, and as with every film in the series there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is only briefly seen but is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition and the introduction of the Dementors marks the arrival of one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-packed creations. It's trimmed some of the fat in comparison to the first two films, but is still a little too long - otherwise is probably the series at its peak.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
152,supertom-3,Film of the year! Best Potter film by a country mile!!!,9,5 June 2004,"With the latest installment, the producers have taken an extra year to produce it and made the inspired decision to put their faith in Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. It was a brave decision however because although his last film Y Tu Mama Tambien was critically acclaimed, it was as far away from a kids fantasy film as you could get, in fact as some people described it, it was a Mexican porn movie. Now don't get me wronged I enjoyed the first two movies but despite all the money and special effects and sets, it did feel too conventional. Chris Columbus did a good job of introducing the Harry Potter universe but he did it simple. The film looked good but much like the Star Wars prequels it didn't get the blood pumping like a film with that scale has the potential too. The third installment really did work as a great movie going experience, I had sweaty palms by the half way stage and got really engrossed, what a great fantasy film should do.So what has Cuaron done differently then? Well like everyone has said in very simple terms, he has made it much darker. He has also done away with following a set formula. There are no house cup prizes at the end for Griffendore to celebrate. There is a brief Quidditch match but this is given extra dynamic by being set in stormy, thundery, lashing rain with the evil creature the Dementors getting involved. The first two Potter movies almost ran on a similar timeline, in fact when I look back and try and remember parts I do get confused about some parts, whether they were in the first or the second movie. Cuaron's grittier, edgier take on Potter makes it far more exciting not to mention a more exciting storyline to begin with.Harry Potter himself is growing up. He is far more self confident now and will not put up with the Dursley's tormenting. The Dursley's also seem aware and wary or Harry's powers. Harry becomes rebellious and strikes out at his abusive Aunt Marge played by Pam Ferris. When Harry runs away he is then picked up by a triple-decker bus that runs a special service for Wizards who have run away. He is taken to the minister of magic and it seem he may be in a whole heap of trouble because young Wizards cannot use magic outside of Hogwarts. He is merely given a warning but as it turns out there are more urgent matters for the Wizard and Witch community to worry about, the fact that an apparent cohort of Voldemort has escaped form Azkhaban prison. This person is Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman. Harry soon discovers that Black wad shopped his parents to Voldermort leading to his parents untimely deaths. Black's motives for escaping seem to be thus: He will finish the job that Voldermort didn't, kill Harry. Harry though doesn't wish to avoid Black because he becomes bent on revenge. He also has to contend with the guards of Azkhaban prison the dementors. a creation by Rowling and the Wizards at ILM. They really a great dynamic to the film and add some chills. The plot moves a long at a nice place and importantly the last hour is really exciting. Towards the end it is reminiscent of Back To The Future 2 and despite time travel paradoxes I really enjoyed that element.Another important improvement in this was the primary cast. The three young actors played by Harry Potter, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The have really improved, especially Daniel Radcliffe who as Harry has the most responsibility towards the film to do well. He was a little flat in the first two movies which is no disrespect to him because child actors are rarely 100% natural, we have just grown to expect a lot more form young kids after superb little thesps like Haley Joel Osment (AI, Sixth Sense) and Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider). Radcliffe is good here and holds the movie well, and more impressively is that his role is more challenging than it has been before. Emma Watson is very good, she looks like having the most potential, she is already a good actress and looks like she'll be a stunner when she's older. Grint is also good and does more than mug. An important element is that the film now gives more time to the three central actors because they now have increased their ability to hold the movie without having to fall back on the adult cast. As such the roles for the teaching staff are reduced but as ever Alan Rickman is brilliant as Snape, he has made that role his own. Then you have the usual great support from Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffith et al. Also there are new appearances by Emma Thompson, and also Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore. Gambon is good giving a different interpretation of Dumbledore although I kind of liked Harris and his more whispery and regal Dumbledore, but a lot of his quietness and frailty was because he was not at all well during the production of both previous films. Gambon will make a very good replacement though. The two new faces that really stood out for me were firstly Gary Oldman. He was excellent as Black. He essentially only appears in person near the end but as soon as he does Oldman decides that he will steal the thunder of all around him, no mean feat considering he shares a scene with both Rickman and David Thewlis. It is great to see Oldman back on the big screen. He is not playing a conventional bad guy, and you'll know what I mean when you see what transpires, but he is as ever superb. For me though the star role was David Thewlis as professor Lupin. Lupin was a former friend of Harry's parents and as such forms a bond with Harry and also teaches him how to defend himself against the Dementors. Thewlis is excellent, his character will be sorely missed as I don't believe he will re-appear in future films. It is a shame because in each of the sequels there have been characters who have been superbly played by the cream of British talent. Chamber of Secrets featured a scene stealing Kenneth Brannagh. This installment did have the best cast list and cameo list. Dawn French makes an amusing appearance (the day she is not amusing will not come soon) as does her husband Lenny Henry and also a re-appearance, albeit very brief for Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Ron's parents.Cuaron does a great job. The camera is almost always in motion. This works very well with effects shots in the same way Peter Jackson used a lot of CGI shots in the Rings trilogy. By having the camera in motion while a CGI beast is there for example it means it gives less focus on the creature and as such will make it look more real. Cuaron also has some great and unsettling crane shots. Remember the super cool shots in David Fincher's Panic Room when the character moves down from floor to floor and carry's through into the kitchen, through a coffee pot and up to a key hole, with the aid of a computer of cause. These computer assisted crane shots look cool and there a few in this film. Not only is his use of the camera excellent but on a visual basis from the set to the cinematography the film makes far better use of its setting. It looks really great. The film is given a cold look. When it's not raining, it's dark and dingy and muggy or everything is covered in snow. The film looks superb, it makes good visuals from the last movie look better tenfold. Cuaron will certainly be sorely missed and there does seem like there will be an air of pessimism surrounding Mike Newell's appointment for next years Goblet of Fire. Now looking at Newell's track record there is little to suggest he will be a great choice to do a fantasy of this scale but having said that Cuaron raised eyebrows last year in much the same way. It is sadly a fact that a lot of British directors are very conventional and lack flair these days. I hope Newell will take a leaf from Cuaron's style book and surprise everyone, much like Cuaron himself has.Overall this is the best and most enjoyable film I have seen this year and in a year of letdowns as far as the big blockbusters and epics. Kill Bill 2 has been the only film thus far of high anticipation not to be a letdown like overblown epics Last Samurai, Troy and Passion Of Christ has been. This was effective and affecting stuff. ****1/2",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I love the transition to a darker theme which benefits the entire franchise as a whole.3. Set and Costume design is, of course, fantastic.4. Nice visuals.5. Alan Rickman is fantastic as Severus Snape.6. Michael Gambon does a great job as Dumbledore and follows in Richard Hariss' legacy successfully. 7. Great reveal.8. This movie introduces Dementors which are some of the most despicable yet interesting creatures ever devised, in my opinion.9. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black are two new characters that are very interesting even if I thought that their performances were quite weak.10. This movie introduces time travel but does it so intricately and flawlessly that it actually makes sense.Bad:1. Daniel Radlciffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson gave pretty poor performances as far as I'm concerned.2. I also thought that Gary Oldman and David Thewlis were pretty poor as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin respectively. 3. Peter Petigrew is one of the most boring and bland characters in the series as far as I'm concerned.4. I hated the final few scenes.5.

154,christian123,Harry Potter is back for his best film yet,7,25 November 2004,"The start of Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is threatened by the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Voldemort's murderous henchman who betrayed Harry's parents, getting them killed. Along with this pals Hermione and Ron Weasley, Harry must try to stay one step ahead of Black while dealing with the new school year and the horrifying Dementors, Azkaban's jail keepers that now surround the school.After two sold entries in the Harry Potter franchise, the third film really kicks things up. It's a fantastic film with gorgeous special effects and lots of entertaining moments. There's a new switch behind the camera and I like Alfonso Cuarón more than Chris Columbus. Alfonso Cuarón put a lot more ""magic"" and soul into the project while Columbus made the first two films kind of bland. He is a very vanilla like director whereas Alfonso is more fast paced and exciting. This entry is a little more different since they leave out more parts from the book and it's more action. This didn't bother me because the film was more energetic but non readers of the book may be annoyed by this.The acting was pretty good and it was a lot better than the first two entries. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he's improving. He's still lacking a little in the emotional scenes though. Emma Watson plays Hermione and she's probably the best of the three. Rupert Grint was okay as Ron though he is the weakest of the three. There is a new Dumbledore in this film as Michael Gambon replaces the late great Richard Harris. He doesn't play the role as well but it's still pretty good. Emma Thompson plays Professor Sybil Trelawney and she does a pretty good job. However, her character isn't in the film that much which is too bad. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was okay, nothing really special.The only problem I had with the movie was that it went by too fast. They could have added some more scenes so the story was told better. Besides for that, the book's magic seems to have been captured. The dialog is all sharp and funny. The direction is great and the acting is good. The special effects are amazing and the film is just beautiful to look at. People who are bashing this movie are most likely just bitter book nerds. Not all of them are but it seems to me that most are. In the end, the movie is great and it's worth checking out. Rating 9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
155,theshadow908,"While still a good movie, it's the worst of the series.",6,14 January 2006,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the worst film in the series, because too much of the style has been changed. Chris Coloumbus set a standard for how the Harry Potter universe should look. He had everything done a certain way, and it was perfect to the Harry Potter mythos. Now, a new director has come aboard with a completely different vision, and he did it his way.The story and the settings are dark, which is accurate to J.K. Rowling's book, but the style of everything seems off. In the first two movies, they wear their wizard robes through the whole film. In this, they wear their normal clothes. There's no reason given, and this isn't from the book. The story seems to rushed because the director cut so much out of the book, and then didn't come up with a way to connect everything that's in the movie. This movie just isn't as enjoyable as a Harry Potter film. It still provides a fun time of course, but it just doesn't feel the same.As always, the performances are top notch. Gary Oldman is perfect as always in the role of the wicked Sirius Black.

Soul sucking beings called dementors are placed all around the school. At first trying to stay away from Sirius as much as possible, Harry soon learns that it was Sirius that sold out his parents location and led to their deaths. Review: Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one is often considered the favorite among most of the viewers. And while I love it, and say it is a rather good adaptation, I still find this to be one of the weaker films in the series. To me, it relies so much on looking nice.Now as a film, this could be the best of all of them, the lighting, direction, acting, and overall production value are amazing. But as an adaptation it falls short, such as the fact that it doesn't explain who the marauders are, and it never explained that Harry dad could turn into a Stag, so when Harry said his dad saved him, it didn't make any sense. So overall it's the best adabtaion we would get for a few more movies, but it needed to explain the back story a little more.This is the first film in the series to get a new director after Columbus, taking over is Alfanso Curon, who definitely knows how to make a film. His style is obvious as the whole way the film looks is definitely darker than the other two. The whole movie is darker as well, with Harry nearly escaping death several times, and finally learning more about how his parents died. This is also the only film in which Voldemort doesn't appear at all. And the first film in which Micheal Gambon plays Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris. A lot of fans hate Gambon as Dumbledore, saying he is too mean and doesn't look the part, but I think he does a pretty good job, just no where near as good as Richard Harris. Granted his beard looked off, but he definitely acted just as quirky as Dumbledore should have.Overall, as a film it's absolutely fantastic, and even as an adaption, it's still pretty good, but it isn't my favorite in the series as others say.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Of course, I don't know how credible my review is considering I've read only the first book and haven't seen the second movie.  Nontheless, I found this movie very fascinating.  The story was very captivating and kept my eyes glued to the screen.  This was much darker than the first one (could be because of the new director).  There were a lot more special and visual effects.  I strongly disliked the new Dumbledore.  He seemed like a cold-hearted, sly, cunning person compared to the warm, cozy, grandfather-like one in the first one.  Even though I haven't read the book, I still felt in a few places that something was missing and didn't make complete sense.

159,alainenglish,New director and new tone,9,31 July 2007,"Alfonso Cuarvos takes over from Chris Columbus for the third tale in the ""Harry Potter"" adventures. The plot has a more adult, ambiguous tone than it's predecessors, and Hogwart's feels less like a place of magical wonder and more like a creepy, haunted house that just happens to be a school.After performing a spell on his repulsive aunt, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) flees his home and relies on his old mate Ron (Rupert Grint) to help him back to Hogwart's. Word reaches Harry that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped Azkaban prison. Black is meant to have had a hand in his parents death and is heading to Hogwart's to hunt Harry down...The casting in this one is a bit mixed. While the regulars (Emma Watson as Hermione, Coltrane, Smith, Gambon et al) do their parts well, they are let down slightly by Emma Thompson, who just seems embarrassed playing the kids' new psychic teacher. On the other hand Mark Williams is on form delivering some delightful comic exposition as Ron's father, and David Thewlis is very moving as a teacher who hides a dark magical secret. To anyone not familiar with Potter but know their cinema the presence of Gary Oldman may wrong-foot some into thinking he's the bad guy. He isn't, and his brief appearance continues a run of quality good guy characters from the actor.Another great sequel. Worth watching.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
160,mOVIemAN56,A Few Minor Changes Have No Affect. It's Still Good.,7,7 June 2005,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of the Harry Potter books turned into a movie. With a new director, some mite say the film would be destined to fail but in my book, it's honored the book memorably. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is yet again returning to Hogwarts for his third year at the magical school. Topping the wizard headlines is that the dangerous wizard criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry thinks little of it until it is revealed that Sirius is after Harry, Harry must do his best to remain calm and deal with idea of the man responsible for his parents death coming after him. To help with Harry's problem are his everlasting friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) along with their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Eventually the dark past of Harry's life would reach him again as the vile Sirius Black closes in to finish his work. With a new director in Alfonso Cuaron some things are changed and others shifted around. Hagrid's hut is moved to a different location and some darker features are added to the castle. The story is darker then the previous two and makes it a bit more fun. The kids act as they usually do and show they each have promising careers after the long series is completed. The special effects are sometimes over-used and sometimes distract the viewer from the story. One big and obvious replacement is that of the late and honorable Richard Harris being replaced by Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore's character isn't focused on as much and doesn't really have any effect on the film. Gambon has proved though that he is an honorable replacement to the great Richard Harris.The acting by each actor is pretty strong and the film is loaded with a variety of great actors. The film is pretty good and hopefully the film series continues to be as good as this. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

But it turns out that not everything is actually the same as it looks. Actually, Sirius Black was really innocent, and framed by Peter Pettigrew who actually betrayed Harry's parents, and who was in disguise all along as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Then other stories start to happen like the new teacher is actually a werewolf, and there are these guards of Azkaban who take away souls called Dementors. But enough of the spoilers, and let's start the real review. Now, there were some moments of charming cleverness in the script, and the movie felt new, unique, and smart. There were even funny scenes in the film that included my favorite scene involving the giant Knight Bus with a Shrunken Head in control. Now although those moments were enjoying, this particular movie in the series didn't feel epic, amazing, excellent, or surprising like the first two movies were. But even though the movie wasn't that stunning like I thought it was, the movie was smart with story and characters.

162,Puroo,A huge improvement over its prequel,7,12 May 2021,"After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series).The story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired.As the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the ""show, don't tell"" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do.However, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part.There is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason.

I think that this movie is the best among the three. It is no longer just about good versus evil. It actually has a twist, that made this whole movie so much more interesting and more enjoyable. I am especially interested in those films that have time travel, extra dimensions, etc. The director has done a good job describing the logic behind the time travel story, which could be confusing. And I did not get bored by watching the parallel story played out.I have never read any of the books. So I don't really know any of the magic names. There are quite a few new names that I can't understand. That is the only problem of this film. And I also had a little trouble understanding their English accent.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
164,Trevor-Kerensky,Harry Potter takes a darker turn,8,10 June 2018,"Being the third of seven, this chapter took a whole different direction from the world established by the first two directed by Chris Columbus. Some might criticize the different style but I was entertained. And the chemistry between the main characters worked nicely. I don't care what anyone else says; this was one of the better Harry Potter films. It may have skimped on some of the scenes but it was entertaining for those who wanted a darker tale. It might be like The Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter franchise, but this is modern fantasy plain and simple.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
165,XxEthanHuntxX,The Journey Takes a Darker Turn!,7,23 August 2020,"It's time for the third film of the series, and this one was particularly exciting with a stirring change in director.Alfonso Cuarón, who in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" replaces Chris Columbus as director, and, with great skills, shows what a Harry Potter film should look like. He has toned down the ""childish"" and silly parts, but retained the magical atmosphere and imaginative content. Cuarón, who is a very visual filmmaker, has managed to put a highly personal touch on the third film in the series, and what stands out most is the light and the photo - the handheld camera sometimes makes the film feel like a European independent film, which is a nice surprise. Harry Potter's magical world no longer feels like an unattainable, dreamlike fairytale world, but suddenly becomes darker and more ""realistic"".There's no question that Cuarón has put his stamp on this movie. The return of so many familiar characters will keep viewers comfortable, but the stylistic changes make it seem as if this Harry Potter adventure is taking place in a different universe. The most obvious change is to Hogwarts. Although outwardly the same, the school is photographed and presented in a manner that makes it more ominous and less friendly than in the previous two installments. And a seemingly minor yet significant alteration. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have abandoned the school uniforms and Instead, they dress in ""normal"" every-day clothing.The filmmakers are becoming less literal and more cinematic in their adaptations. A flaw of the first two movies is that they tried to cram every nuance into the screenplay - an act that had a negative impact upon the films' pacing. For this film script-writer Steve Kloves has pared J.K. Rowling's story to its essence, resulting in a more streamlined motion picture.Although Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stands well enough on its own, it has a ""middle chapter"" feeling. In other words, there's no real beginning or ending. Little is resolved and the film's climax is subtle. The villain of the first two chapters and the overall series, the dreaded Voldemort, is absent. His apparent replacement is Sirius Black, although appearances can be deceiving.And in a runtime of this length the film had little progression to the overall Potter story. Oh sure - moments of character development occurs. We learn a few things about Harry's background. The Malfoy/Potter feud enters another chapter. Some new characters are introduced. And we see the beginnings of a tentative affection between Ron and Hermione. But pretty randomly the film stars experience with time travel and, just out of the blue, begins to play modestly with deja vu feelings. The ""feel"" is totally different in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" from its predecessors, thus blame this to the account of change in directors.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
166,GeorgeRoots,Alfonso Cuaron Works That Potter Magic.,8,29 August 2014,"Considering that this is the only entry in the series that doesn't revolve around Lord Voldemort (As much). ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", is the turning point. Introducing more talent, more characters and more thorough stories that will happen to effect Harry's life for the rest of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison and wants to murder him. This leads to a series of ghouls known as ""Dementors"" (Azkaban's guards) patrolling the school, whilst everyone remains unaware that Black has more involvement in Harry past than everybody seems to lead on.Finally, we get to see those exterior shots of Hogwarts re-imagined, a great enjoyment to see as I was never much a fan of the look from the first two movies. The introduction of Remus Lupin who is played brilliantly by David Thewlis, and stunning debut from Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore (R.I.P Richard Harris). But unsurprisingly, the character who ultimately steals the show is Sirius Black, played with charisma and desperation from Gary Oldman.Again, it's the first time we are introduced to a new kind of evil. That comes in the form of the shrieking shack, escaped convicts and somehow it even manages to include a sub-plot on a court case about a magical animals fate that coincides with the main narrative. All that's left to say is that great performances come from Daniel, Rupert & Emma. As the characters are becoming more fleshed out and definitely more vulnerable to all these dangers.Final Verdict: Alfonso Cuaron really adds a great style and edge to the franchise. Those who are fans of the books do not want to miss this very likable entry in the series. 8/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
167,Meven_Stoffat,"WOW!!!! Did we all watch the same movie... or better yet, read the same book?",7,11 November 2010,"1. Not only is the scene where Harry receives the broomstick not in the beginning, but we see Harry practicing magic under his bedsheets. As shown by the second movie/book, practicing magic is not allowed outside Hogwarts. WTF? It's like they want me to hate the movie already.2. We don't find out how Ron's family got the money to go on vacation.3. The Firebolt takes too long to appear. WTF???? AT THE END???? 4.Dementors flying???? In the book(s), they do nothing more but hover above the ground. The same thing happens in the 5th movie, just as annoying.5. The knight bus scenes were WAY overdone and too wacky. And the shrinking head was just cringe worthy.6. Quidditch players do not have numbers on the uniforms.7. Also is it me or did Hogwarts look really small??? Compared to the first two movies where it looked grand and epic. Major effects/design fail.8. Pettigrew is supposed to be short and stubby, not taller than Sirius.9. Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is not shown.10. The punching scene was so overdone. Without the line from Herminone it just feels like a run of the mill scene in any movie with a girl punching a guy. And the clichéd ""That felt good"" line just crowned it.11. The Shrieking Shack. First off it's not SMALL. It's supposed to be HUGE. Secondly that scene ended before it even began. It reminds me of the ministry of magic scenes in OOTP where it was reduced from many rooms into one giant room.12. WHERE IS CADOGAN???? Without him the entire movie didn't make sense!!! That's like cutting Aragorn from Lord of the Rings!!!! 13. The whole film just felt really rushed, like they were focusing more on the action as opposed to the important scenes in the book.14. The best thing about this is that at least Cuaron won't be directing another Harry Potter movie.This just hurt my soul. Thankfully Newell redeemed the series with the best yet, Goblet of Fire.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
168,renegadeviking-271-528568,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,8,23 December 2019,"Now 13, Harry Potter and chums are back off to Hogwarts, only to find that a dangerous escaped prisoner is also heading back to school. Soon nasty prison guards called Dementors have taken up residence in the school grounds.Were it not for the fact that he inflicted Bicentennial Man upon an unsuspecting public, it would be possible to feel some sympathy for Chris Columbus right now. A faithful servant of the material, Columbus cracked the brief, creating both Potter's world and a worldwide audience. He could, perhaps, have cut loose with Secrets, but one hit does not a franchise make, and he again opted for an artistic yardstick that merely measured how many pages could be faithfully recreated on screen before audience arses actually started to turn blue.Now, with the Potter machine in unstoppable gear and even St. Rowling acknowledging that the later/longer books must be boned, Columbus might have finally started to enjoy himself. And yet, not only has he stepped aside, as producer he personally pushes through an exotic relief pitcher whose colourful CV virtually guarantees that every viewer will be aware of a fresh man at the mound and that every review will contain a variation on the following line: New director Cuaron injects much needed visual flair and introduces a narrative daring that was noticeably lacking from 'the Columbus era'.Indeed, Cuaron so comprehensively re-imagines the Potter aesthetic that young fans are likely to wonder where all the colour has gone. From the moment the perfunctory Dursley scenes are invested with a beige-tinted suburban loathing straight out of Mike Leigh, it is clear that the magical kingdom has at last been rooted in our very own Muggle nation. Hogwarts, in particular, benefits enormously from a relocation to Scotland's Glen Coe.Relying as much on wide-angle lenses as he does on computer-controlled tracking, Cuaron keeps the camera moving and the invention coming, unafraid to introduce ideas that Rowling has not personally authored. The entire piece is an absolute picture, with new cinematographer Michael Seresin working his own strange alchemy on Stuart Craig's miraculous sets.Not that Cuaron has it all his own way. The young cast is still rather limited to good line-readings - they are not bad, exactly, but they are being asked to shoulder an increasingly heavy burden and the tantalising glimpses of the excellent Thewlis and Oldman amply demonstrate that expositional dialogue need not be entirely bereft of character.Elsewhere, the all-plot-all-the-time novels remain curiously resistant to adaptation, and if house writer Kloves has mercifully abandoned the novel's three-term structure, he is yet to stumble across a recognisable three-act structure to put in its stead. As before, the third act still kind of happens along, and the middle-section is distinctly choppy, with a much more passive Potter coasting through several short scenes that will lose those who have foresworn the books. Luckily, when the ending (in parts one and two bungled by Columbus) finally arrives, it proves to be Azkaban's ace.Azkaban contains both the longest denouement and the most rousing finish of any of the books, and Cuaron wisely whips through the 'ah-hahs' so that the clever climax, complete with the series' best SFX, can enjoy its moment in the moonlight. Here, at last, Harry Potter And The Movie Adventure hauls itself up to the standards set by the brilliant books, and a middle-aged Mexican emerges as the story's unlikely hero.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
169,AndyVanScoyoc,Definitely NOT a kids movie...Possible Spoilers...,8,5 June 2004,"Dark...I noticed that from the previews in the theaters before the movie came out and on TV when they finally got around the showing the previews. It seems that as the ""kids"" grow up, their plights do as well. This Harry Potter series is not the ""kiddie"" movie that some have said the previous installments were. This movie is more adult with young cast members in almost adult roles.I liked this movie, although I know a lot of people will be disappointed in it. Gone was a lot of the comedy, as it seems that even the adorable Ronald Weasley has matured to the point of not being so quick with the one liners any longer. Harry is harder in this film, as if he has had ""enough"" of everything and everyone and is finally fighting back. The results are not what makes for a kids movie. Hermione seems a little haughtier in this movie as if even she is finally realizing how great of a witch she is. I was disappointed in Draco Malfoy's part in this movie to a degree. Tom Felton has obviously proven himself to be a great actor, yet Draco's part seems to be minimized in this movie...absent to an almost total degree were Crab and Goyle as well. Draco seems to not be as snotty and hateful as he once was, which was a bad change in his part. Where he now should be hateful, backbiting, cunning to an evil degree and self serving, he now seems to be more along the lines of what he should have been when he was younger...sniveling and attention seeking. All of the kids have matured in this movie, even the hapless Neville Longbottom, whom I almost didn't recognize; and while it is still enjoyable, kids may no longer be able to relate to the trio of Harry, Ronald and Hermione, as they once did.I have to say that in this movie, I was the most disappointed in Dumbeldore. While I know that no one can ever replace Richard Harris, I still expected more from Michael Gambon, as established of an actor as he is. Instead Dumbeldore seemed almost wooden and flighty. Gone was the ""attitude with a mere look"" that was so common with Dumbeldore, the ""calm in the storm"" and the sheer ""power"" he seemed to have over all of the children just by standing in the Great Hall. I was also disappointed that Maggie Smith's part was not larger. She is one heck of an actress and deserved much more exposure than she got, as she has proven in the past that no one can play Professor MacGonagall the way she can.Even Hagrid seemed a bit darker in this one. He too seemed harder, as if time has been wearing on him and has caused him great pain.The effects in this movie were spectacular. I especially loved the Hippogryph, the beast from legend and lore that has the face and wings of a large eagle and the body and tail of a horse. This creature was totally believable. My favorite however had to be the Dementors, creatures whose sole purpose was to mete out justice, although their form of justice is not what is necessarily ""just.""I would suggest this movie to children 12 years old and absolutely for adults. I would not recommend it for smaller children as there is not much any longer, as I said before, that children under the age of 12 can relate to. Harry, Ronald and Hermione are NOT children any longer. I liked it and am greatly anticipating the next installment.I gave this movie and 8 out of 10 and would see it again in a heartbeat...Mischief Managed...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

But as soon as after he left the Dursleys and set off for a new year at school, catching up with Ron and Hermione again, things were not as smooth-sailing as it seemed to be.The wizarding world is abuzz with the news that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban. Many were convinced that Black was indirectly the reason why Harry's parents died 12 years ago. As a result of Black's escape, Dumbledore had ordered tighten security with the Dementors guarding the school. But somehow, Black managed to enter in the school compounds.The new school year even sees a new Defence Against The Dark Arts professor - Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), the Divination professor makes her presence. She may be eccentric at times and not many taking her seriously all the time, one of her predictions did came true.And when Ron's new pet rat Scabbers ran away on its own, a whole new set of adventures await the famous trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione.

171,cosmic_quest,Best of the three,8,31 May 2004,"Although this film isn't all that I'd hoped it would be, I believe that it was the best of the three 'Harry Potter' films so far, thanks largely due to director Alfonso Cuaron. In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.The child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.The adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!One of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.However, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. Also, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.At the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Being at Hogwarts would certainly be a great adventure!!! As you can see, I really loved this third Harry Potter´s adventure. It´s intelligent and has lots of action. For the first time, the novel had some of its facts left out. Alfonso Cuaron didn´t do as Chris Columbus did. He selected the most important facts and turned them into this great movie picture. I´m not criticizing Columbu`s job. The first film (made by him) is the best of the already released three ones. But Cuaron had to work with the slowest paced story of all the novels about Potter. Cuaron also created a dark atmosphere. Everything is dark all long the story. There`s also lots of special effects and supernatural facts.

The first time when Hagrid's Bird is Killed stones randomly hit them to get out of the house (the future them) yet the Bird is executed. The Patronus is summoned but Serius Black is captured.

174,dommercaldi,"The Best Harry Potter In My Opinion, With An Excellent Mixture Of Mature And Family-Friendly Themes",8,20 January 2021,"Pros:
1. The special effects, for the most part, still look incredible and they serve up many memorable moments e.g. an inflated Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), the dementors floating up the Hogwarts Express, and the Knight Bus tearing through London.
2. The cinematography is beautiful with the smooth camera-work that not only creates awe-inspiring shots, but it really helps to involve the viewer in each scene.
3. The creature design is brilliant with each creature looking phenomenal from the werewolf, to Buckbeak, to the Dementors.
4. The fantastic score is never solely relied upon or overbearing, and it always adds to the atmosphere appropriately.
5. The sound design is mesmerising and it helps to create a magical and ethereal tone.
6. There are great performances by David Thewlis (Professor Lupin), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew), Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger).
7. The action scenes are engrossing, especially the scenes involving the werewolf and the Dementors.
8. There is tremendous chemistry between Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley).Cons:
1. Some of the CGI definitely hasn't aged well and is a little clunky in its execution.
2. It's extremely unbelievable that Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were not spotted by Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and The Executioner (Peter Best).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Sure the conditions were less than adequate for viewing such a would-be mega movie, but it managed to keep me occupied on the trip down.So what can I say? It was entertaining enough. At times I had a hard time following the storyline or the significance of the various elements of the film. This one also wasn't able to pin down what it was trying to say as well as the first one, although it appeared to be similar in tone, despite the overall ""darkness"" of the film. I think the film would've benefited tremendously from a larger screen presentation with a proper sound system, so I'm going to adjust the final score +1 because of the limited presentation facilities onboard the bus.That said, the film is a bit internal. There's a lot to learn about the world that the film tries to express and although a lot of it isn't necessary, it's all hinted at, which made me feel like I was missing out not reading the books, at the same time, it also made me feel like the film wasn't self-contained enough, not knowing the significance of the creatures, spells and etc. occurring in the film.Anyway, it was entertaining enough for a bus ride and I'm sure it could be even better in a proper environment. 7/10 (6/10 on a bus, adjusted for poor viewing environment/sound).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

In fact, together with those of ""Jurassic Park"", they are the digital ones that have surprised me the most; even more than those of the trilogy of ""Lord of the Rings"", and not because they are better or more quantity, but because they are infinitely more imaginative and elegant.The story of Rowling offers, finally, really unexpected twists. Play with our subconscious and, above all, with our prejudices: I was expecting to see Voldemort again reincarnated, resulting bored by the repetition of history, but how would expect the triangle formed by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew! (Obviously I have not read any of the books yet, I do not know what opinion the lovers of the novel will have about it.)Although we start from a fantastic and magical world, I have been very surprised by the meticulous work in which time travel is minimally coherent.

181,anhedonia,"The darkest of the bunch...and the best, so far",8,9 June 2004,"(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS)Amazing what happens to a franchise when a talented director takes over. Instead of a Hollywood hack taking the directorial reins yet again, this time the film was given to Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón, whose films include the brilliant ""Y tu mamá también"" (2001) and the under-rated ""A Little Princess"" (1995).What refreshing about ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is that Cuarón does not dumb down the story. As Harry and his friends mature, so does the story.The film begins with the customary scene at the Dursleys, where the story stretches to get laughs. But then the film takes a good turn when Harry leaves his relatives' home and Cuarón laces the rest of the story with a sense of dread throughout. Even the game of quiddich, which thankfully is brief, no longer has that playful, colorful aura about it. This time it occurs during a rainstorm and remains dark and dangerous.Hogwarts, too, has changed. For the better. Now, you get the feeling that danger lurks everywhere, that something terrible might indeed happen when we least expect it. And that's the fun of this film.The three main actors - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - have matured well, though I doubt they'll be around for Harry Potter's seventh installment. They might look too old for the parts then. But, for now, they're fine. The surprise is young Miss Watson, who is blossoming into a terrific actress. Her Hermione has spunk and proves a fine role model. It's fun watching Miss Watson take control of her scenes. Once she's done with the Harry Potter series, there's little doubt a rewarding acting career as an adult awaits her.The supporting cast does a fine job, too. Michael Gambon slips nicely into the role of Albus Dumbledore and David Thewlis (as Lupin) always is fun to watch. Gary Oldman relishes every moment on screen as Sirius Black, but it's a pity we don't see enough of him. In fact, the same could be said of the great Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman (surely screenwriter Steve Kloves, who is one of the best in the business - if you doubt it, see ""Flesh and Bone"" and ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" - could give Prof. Severus Snape more scenes.), Emma Thompson and Julie Christie, whose appearance is too brief for such a radiant actress.Some scenes seem superfluous, especially a CGI werewolf-wolf battle that seems to be from another movie. This must be the year for computer-generated wolves - we've seen them in ""Van Helsing,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and now this film. The scene isn't needed because it comes at a time when the plot should focus more on Sirius. Though I liked the CGI tree, especially when it shakes off some snow and the snow hits the camera lens.""Harry Potter"" is an international phenomenon and it matters little what critics say. J.K. Rowling should be commended for creating characters that children (and adults) the world over adore. And anyone who can get kids nowadays to read a 1,000-page book deserves to be championed.Cuarón was ideal for this film. He's taken a mature approach to the story and gives us a beautiful, entertaining and enjoyable film. It might be a bit too dark for very young children, but anyone older than 12 should thoroughly enjoy this film. Under Cuarón's direction, the film is creepier, more sinister, sophisticated and fresh. And that's always a good thing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
182,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"not the best, but the most well done all around",10,4 August 2006,"Where it's sequels and prequels lack, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is better. Unfortunately, it doesn't match up to 'Chamber's' excellent suspense and story, and the action is nowhere near 'Goblet'. But what you do have is a well rounded and fun flick for the whole family. Filled with a stellar cast and a great coming of age story, Harry Potter 3 is a real winner.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown) is now 13 years old, and preparing for his third year at Hogwarts with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). After a weird series of events, Harry finds out that a serial murderer and former Voldemort supporter, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is out of the wizard prison Azkaban and has his eye set on his next target: Harry.The cast is excellent, but the first notable change is the fact that Dumbledore is new. Richard Harris passed away around the same time that HP2 came out in theaters, so Michael Gambon has taken over the role. He is simply adequate, because he lacks the fatherly affection that Harris had perfected in the 2 movies previously. The trio has certainly grown up, both physically and in terms of skill. As usual, the best is Rupert Grint's Ron, who is terribly adapted here. Most of Ron's lines in the book are said by Hermione, which is not fair to Rupert. Emma Watson is nice as Hermione, and her character has more mystery to her this year, more than ever. You'll like Hermione, but not as much as the boys. Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry, and this is definitely his best film playing the boy who lived. His only bad scene is the emotional scene, but he was only 14 when he made this, so I can let it slide. He gives us what we've been looking for in Harry: a hero. Harry is a hero in this film, no doubt about it. The rest of the cast is perfect. The new Defense teacher, Remus Lupin, is one of my favorite characters in the books, and I must say that David Thewlis nails the part very well. I love him as Lupin, the friend to Harry's father, and the calm and intelligent teacher. Alan Rickman is wonderful as Snape as usual, providing that mystery that makes his character so intriguing. The last cast member I'll review is Gary Oldman's Sirius Black. I can't do too much without ruining the plot, so I'll just say that Gary does typical Gary things here, which is great.The film's direction is its strongpoint, as Alfonso Cuaron directs it much better than Columbus or Newell did in the other films. He totally reverses what we're used to in the Potter world, and makes the characters like they should be: teens who don't care about uniforms. Good music and costuming as well make this an enjoyable watch. Steve Kloves...well...he's not that good of an adapter, but I have to say that this is his second best job to date, as his best would be Sorcerer's Stone. Overall, the animation is good, the music and costumes are good, the writing is above average, the acting is superb, and the direction is superb. Harry Potter 3 is a great threequel that does a good job of helping Harry grow up.8/10 --spy",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
183,tributarystu,Care for tea?,8,25 July 2005,"As a Potter fan, the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle, no more, no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way, but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two, nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books, they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough, there were things I liked, but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did, all of them, those little brats, all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance! What makes HP 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the characters are finally bestowed. They are leading a life of their own and the kids finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously, with Cuaron's help, who was more than able to reinvent Rowling's universe in a way only a true visionary could've done. Columbus wasn't up to the task, for all that mattered in his case was the frame and not the painting itself! It's very important to be able to guide children and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural. So Cuaron did.The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot, mainly. That's one of the reasons why it plays out so well as a movie. But the fact that the kids have started to grasp the basic concepts of acting and the stunning visuals create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result. This new film is good because it finally shares the spirit of the book: the innocent hope, the complicated issues of life (and death), the reasons which make us tick the way we do. It's a step in discovering who the heck you really are, who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming. The ""wise words of Dumbledore"" are always powerful and mysterious, in the sense they really should be. And it's good this way, because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be intrigued. That's what Cuaron managed to do, he created a world which leaves enough unanswered questions as there can be. Finally someone who understands the essence of the book. Finally something fresh and exciting. That's the way HP is supposed to be!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
184,illbebackreviews,Alfonso Cuaron Should've Directed the Remaining HP Films,8,31 December 2011,"Its quite fair to say that Chris Colombus did a great job with the first two Harry Potter films. I was quite unsure about what Alfonso was able to produce, but he has done it. He finally captures the true brilliance of JK's story and brilliantly puts it into a film. This film seems closest to the books and I thought it was brilliant. Perhaps the best Harry Potter film out of them all.Alfonso was able to create a film by simply following its storyline without adding any extra fancy scenes for no reason. He stuck true to the book and this is why this film is so brilliant.The characters Sirius Black and Remus Lupin make it my favourite out of them all. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman brilliantly portray the wonderful characters from JK Rowling's imagination and end up being exactly how I imagined them. Even Peter Pettigrew's role was played on very nicely.Alfonso Cuaron out did himself with that film. Its fair to say that Alfonso would've done a much better job with Goblet of Fire than the director. Alfonso would've stuck true to the book, and loyal to JK Rowling. Great Work Alfonso",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
185,MovieGuy109,Azkaban is better than the other Potters.,8,24 October 2011,The producers made their wisest decision in the Potter franchise yet by switching from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron in the directing position. Cuaron keeps a firm hold on the magical aspects of the story while going into darker territory. The film has more complexities and challenges the viewer more than the previous two chapters. It successfully and even compellingly exploits the intricacies from Rowling's tale and also keeps the content manageable for their marketed age range. Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban tops the other two films well and sets up the fourth chapter well. A victory for Director Alfonso Cuaron and the great cast of talents.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
186,mistoppi,Exceeds the two previous movies,8,16 October 2016,"Cuarón was a way better choice compared to Columbus! Columbus' versions were clearly meant more for kids than (young) adults, but Cuarón knows how to make a film truly for the whole family. Prisoner of Azkaban is of course scary for kids, but not too terrifying, yet still thrilling for anyone older. Visually Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds two previous movies. It's a lot different, considering how simple the first movies tried to be. There cinematography is astonishing and the camera moves in fun ways - like through windows or mirrors, and that always fascinated me as a kid. Even if movies are meant for children, cinematographers shouldn't shy away from eccentric, artistic choices because kids will love them. Also Prisoner of Azkaban rocks as an adaptation. It has scenes that didn't exist in the book and many details added by those who made this film, yet they all work. Those conversations between Harry and Lupin were always amazing and even if they weren't in the book or they were in the book but in a different form, those conversations were amazing and deep and gave... some hope to it. Also this is the only movie that has Harry's messy hair right.Prisoner of Azkaban really stands out from all the other Harry Potter movies. It's no wonder many claim it to be their favourite.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

In this third film, Harry becomes a lot more wise, he is now having to face Demeter's and is continuing his feud with Draco Malfoy but overall I do not think the film came off. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and I love the ultimate darkness of the films following but there is something about the unfolding of this one that does not feel right.

188,general-melchett,Probably the darkest Harry Potter film yet - this film is one to be reckoned with!,9,26 October 2006,"One thing I really like about the Harry Potter movies is that they are not sentimentalised, babyish, immature trash that is only made for kids and babies whose parents don't wish to scare them - they are all gripping, dark, scary, and actually have brains behind them that will please the adults as well. This film is no exception - it is probably the darkest of all Potter's adventures so far, and easily lives up to the title of a worthy Harry Potter adaptation. The opening scenes with Aunt Marge are very funny, but after that - the adventure begins - and it is dark from the off. The Dementor scene on the train is stunningly and grippingly done, and this film has a real sense of mystery and intrigue to it. John Williams' classic score is once again used to great effect, Hagrid actually has some kind of a soul in this film, and the ending is a superbly done close to another great Harry Potter film. This might have been the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is by no means the worst. Another thumbs-up is the credits sequence - hugely original, and a great end to 2004's greatest fantasy film!

I was a bit confused near the end when all the explaining occurred, however I was still impressed by, despite the fact that it was based off a book, the way the plot continued. A new challenge for Potter, with more character growth.

Nearly every shot in this flick the camera is dollying, tilting, or on a crane, or on a steady cam. The only time the camera stops whanging around all over the place is when our hero faints - which he does with monotonous regularity.For all the effort that went into this film (and technically it is very impressive) I doubt if I will remember a single frame of it in a weeks time.

Alfonso Cuarón manages to capture the same sense of magic while taking things to the next level in various ways.The kids are given more individuality in the way they wear their school uniforms and also get to wear more casual clothes. Apparently much of the filming was moved to Scotland and there are lots of gorgeous landscapes, some beautiful views. Overall, more time is spent outdoors, showing things we have yet to see. The cinematography is very creative. There are many impossible shots, including some which pass through mirrors. They make you pause and think, wait, how'd they do that? You can't just say ""cgi"" because you can see the actors clearly and the camera seems to move smoothly. However it's done, it's impressive, draws you in and makes the movie much more fun.The story is just as good as the first two movies, giving us some more insight into Harry's parents and what happened leading up to the fateful night he received his scar. One of the new characters is Lupin (David Thewlis) who becomes a kind of paternal figure for Harry, helping him develop useful skills and understand his own emotions. Gary Oldman is excellent as always, in this case a crazed murderer but entwined in a mysterious past which we gradually learn more about. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot. One popular device is made use of, perhaps better than in any other movie. There are a number of nice details which enhance it greatly.There is a theme of light in the movie. Finding light in the darkness. Finding hope and inner strength at the right time. Lifting yourself up by your bootstraps. This movie is in many ways more personal than the previous two. It is less epic in scope and more focused on betrayal, lies and finding the truth. And also about inner conflicts. It's hard to say much else without giving things away.This movie touches on themes of sadness and fear more directly than most movies ever do. They're universal emotions that everyone can relate to. Our childhood might not be the same as Harry's, but most of us can relate to distant happy memories which we can't even tell are real. We all yearn for some lost golden age from the past from time to time. Many of us have times when we realise we'd falsely judged someone, not knowing the full truth.HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also full of humourous moments, clever details which are easy to miss in the background, multiple seasons and cool transitions between them, creative ways of filming scenes and moments of true pathos. John Williams' music is great as always with two stand-out parts being when Harry rides Buckbeak and the theme Window to the Past. This is one of the best fantasy movies of all time - I wish Cuarón got to direct more of the HP movies!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny was an inspired choice!  What a hoot.  I wish the filmmakers hadn't cut this film to ribbons, though.  Clearly, there must have been other scenes featuring ""the emmas"" (Watson and Thompson).  In the book, if I remember right, there are lots more sparks that fly between the two.  I wanted to see more of Emma Thompson!  Also, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was absolutely marvelous.  I sure hope he signs on for the future films.  He's always been a favorite of mine, anyway.  I was unfamiliar with David Thewlis, but he was awesome as well as Professor Lupin.  He managed to be weird and slightly menacing as well as a friendly mentor to Harry.  The film felt a bit ""rushed"" as many points were left out (who, for example are Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail, and Prongs??...the only reason I know is that I read the book.  I wonder if those who haven't were completely lost...would it really have taken THAT long to explain who they were???)  Many of the scenes felt rushed and the dialog was a bit contrived to move the plot along.  I know this is often the nature of the translation of books to film; I don't think this film would have suffered had it been 30 minutes longer.  But don't get me wrong.  IT was a fine film and we all enjoyed it.  Yes, it's a bit darker than the others (I was SHOCKED to see many many toddlers in the audience!!  Hello, people??  What are you thinking????

My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess.

198,RhapsodyReviews,Best in the Series.,9,18 November 2019,"Review:
'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and which is the third instalment in the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is where the franchise starts to get darker while its core audience gets more mature. Alfonso Cuarón brings a dark tale which feels like a Soviet revenge story and it's so good!
The story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and intends to kill him.
I feel like Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor in this movie. That's unfortunate because all of these focus around him, and this is one of the most important movies in the series. When he was in a scene leaning his Patronus with Professor Lupin, he was good, and I was invested. But when he learns a secret about Sirius Black and gets angry, he doesn't do a good job at showing emotion. It took me out a bit. However, everybody else brings their A-Game. Gary Oldman being brought into the series is fantastic, and this is the first time we see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fine, but I did find myself missing Richard Harris as the soft spoken and wise Professor.
This is the 'Harry Potter' film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. And above all else it is beautifully shot and edited.
Overall, in my opinion this is the best in the series. It has so much story to tell and adds important characters to the main story of the series.

199,aura772,~*-Harry Potter and Alfonso Cuarón-*~,10,26 July 2008,"I've seen this movie so many times, until I turned 15 (2006) and I loved it every time! Of course, back then I was watching it for the story. I'm seventeen right now and almost forgot I am still a teenager. This movie reminds me of so much in my life, because every time I watched it, I was sad or angry and it always helped me distract and then concentrate on a solution.Today I watched this movie again and I noticed new things, I can say this is the kind of movie, which you can watch so many times and discover something new about it every time.I've seen ""Y tu mamá también"" and ""Paris, je t'aime"" mostly because of curiosity about Alfonso Cuarón's directing style. I can recognize that style now, in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"". He managed to bring the movie two Oscar nominations (although he wasn't personally nominated, we know the director comes with the ""vision"").Of course the change is huge, it's almost an entirely different ""Harry Potter"" universe, the young wizards are obviously teenagers now, everything is so much darker, the characters were more rebellious and the actors were allowed more liberty with their characters and I think they did a good job. I can clearly recognize Alfonso's style with all the hugs between Harry, Ron and Hermione, you have to admit, those are a tiny bit sexual. And the ""Y tu mamá también"" reference when Hermione hugged Ron and Harry hugged Hermione at Buckbeak's ""execution"", I found a little bit too much. They were supposed to be thirteen and they referenced to a movie that's basically about a ménage à trois.The cast was great, you can feel that Daniel Radcliffe was having a lot of fun with his character and probably Emma Watson and Rupert Grint had fun also, but Radcliffe's performance is the most noticeable.Also, the first thing you forget is how nice and magical the first movie was, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This third one rather felt like real, like this magic world is real and there is a huge story coming about this dark wizard coming back to torment and kill the people. And I believe that was the entire purpose of the third book, getting over this amazing world and focusing on the plot Voldemort-will-be-back-soon.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Second of all, during the train ride to Hogwarts, Harry gets attacked by Dementors, which are creatures who know how to replicate your worst fears and memories.If anything, Harry Potter remains to be a fun movie, even if Harry's worst fear is fear itself, is unrealistic, even for a fantasy film.

201,headly66,ZZZ More of the same,4,23 July 2009,"As with the other HP movies and one of the main reasons that adults mostly have distaste for this series is that there is really no mystery or feeling in these films. A perfect example is the bus ride in the beginning. The driver is a complete moron, and you would think that witches and wizards would have a higher standard than the humans whom they always make fun of. But it's the fact that the bus can't just be a bus, with a interesting conductor,etc. It has to travel at a ridiculous speed where everyone is flying around driven by a half blind guy, people actually sleep though it and Harry is treated like crap. Why would you want to be a part of this? Is it funny, no. Is it creative, no. Wouldn't it be easier to just drive the bus in a normal way then have to squeeze it and everyone in it to go between two other buses while going the wrong way???All I ask myself during these films is WHY? Why would they have a school book that tries to attack you, don't they have laptops in 2004 in wizard land? Why is there a maid, can't they just snap their fingers and clean the room? Why is everything so dirty and old, wouldn't wizards have the best of everything instead of no light bulbs? Why would anyone want to hang out in a world where everything breaks down, children aren't protected and even the simplest things can kill you and nothing is in the least predictable, wouldn't this world be incredibly retarded? Why would they put dangerous dementors in front of every door to protect the children, ever heard of security guards, and their the ones attacking Harry? Why is a teacher almost blind, couldn't one of the other wizards cure her? What teacher would allow a kid to fly on a giant wild chicken/horse, could you see a tiger being brought into class here?Everyone knows Serious Black is trying to kill Harry but they leave him alone by himself as they all go off on a class trip?In what world, wizard or not, would a school allow dozens of 12 year old boys and girls to all sleep together on the floor overnight? I can say I truly don't understand these movies, why are they playing a game in a lightning storm? These kids are not immortal and can be killed. It's just really dumb. And again this stupid game where you can win it completely away from the other game that's going on which really means nothing? There is a killer on the loose, dementors all over and yet the kids are all allowed to roam free where ever they want?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
202,Ronin47,"Wow, and I didn't even LIKE the first two (***1/2)",8,4 July 2004,"I was thoroughly lukewarm on the first two Harry Potter films, and though I was a little intrigued because this new installment was directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), I still wouldn't say I was looking FORWARD to it. Boy, am I glad I went. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is one of the most thrilling big-screen experiences I've had in quite a while. Harry (a quickly maturing Daniel Radcliffe, and all the better actor for it) is now in his third year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has just received word that a dangerous murderer named Sirius Black (an enjoyably berserk Gary Oldman) has escaped from prison. Black was a friend of Harry's parents who betrayed them, leading to their deaths, and now he's after Harry. That may sound like a pretty spare story, but it's all the movie needs. From beginning to end, it's one amazing, creative set-piece after another.
Maybe I just didn't notice before because I didn't really care for the films, but was Hogwarts School always this beautiful? The grounds of this school are absolutely breathtaking. I'd go to school there in a second.
Even though I was intrigued by Cuaron directing the film, I hadn't really expected his style (as opposed to the apple pie non-style of the previous director, Chris Columbus) to have an impact on such a mainstream, multi-million dollar commodity as a Harry Potter film, but I was thankfully wrong. In addition to the more whimsical and amazing visuals, Cuaron actually brings a lean and mean edge to the film. That's right, I said the new Harry Potter film actually has ""edge"". Not a whole lot, but certainly more than the previous films. The story moves quickly (even when it takes its time), it's genuinely exciting and sometimes scary, and what happens to the characters actually seems to MATTER. There's also a rather brilliantly done time-travel twist near the end, which is actually what's responsible for me raising the star rating by half a star. After this rip-roaring, exhilarant film, I'm actively looking forward to the next Harry Potter film, which has never happened before. At least I am if Cuaron's directing it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

No doubt the two of them will be setting teenage hearts fluttering worldwide this summer. Stand aside Orlando and Keira, you have competition.This was the first Harry Potter movie I watched after having read the book and unfortunately I feel the adaptation was poor. The story was told adequately enough but I feel that several events from the book that would have made for entertaining cinema were omitted and several interesting facts essential to addicts of all things Potter were also overlooked. Like the origins of The Marauders Map for instance.I also found that from out of nowhere we were onto the climax before we knew where we were and we had not yet managed to build up the suspense we should have been experiencing for Harry's first face to face meeting with Sirius Black.In the book, Rowling had used her story telling talents perfectly and by the time this meeting takes place we would all have rather died than to have put the book down. Here, I was startled when I realized what part of the story we were at and then tried to remember whether I had fallen asleep or not as it seemed a large proportion of the film appeared to be missing.Despite this it is every bit as fascinating and awe-inspiring as the other two offerings and if, like me you are a fan of Harry Potter and his magical world then you will not be disappointed.I was also impressed by the depiction of both The Dementors and Buckbeak and they were on film exactly as I had pictured them in my mind as I read, as was also the stag shaped patronus.Sir Micheal Gambon steps into the role of Prof. Albus Dumbledore and although he is an accomplished actor who adopts the role exceptionally well, one cannot help but miss the late, great Richard Harris. I'm sure that over the years and with four future Potter yarns planned, we will all grow accustomed to Gambon, but to me the role was haunted by Harris' ghost which therefore distracted me in my efforts to believe that this is supposed to be the same man from the previous two movies.Having logged on to IMDb I checked out the castlist and it is great to see a movie (an American movie mind you) filled almost entirely with home-grown talent. Gary Oldman is as dominating as ever and Alan Rickman is at his ""freak me out"" best. Also a return for the likes of Sir Robert Hardy and Dame Maggie Smith and the ever watchable Julie Walters are a blessing.Fans of British comedy will also be amused by the cameos made by the likes of Dawn French, Lenny Henry and Paul Whitehouse.To me however the best performances are made by David Thewlis as Prof. Remus Lupin, yet another Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, and Emma Thompson as the comical yet scatty Prof. Sybil Trelawney the Divination mistress. I have never really been a big fan of Thompson's in the past as I found her films a little to ""arty farty"" for my tastes, but her roles in Love Actually and Azkaban have lead me to believe that she is the possibly the most gifted and natural actress around today.Another hit for the series which leaves us awaiting Goblet of Fire (my favourite book) with an impatient lust.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
204,kuangzao,fantasy movie,9,1 April 2020,"Harry Potter is a fantasy movie, based on a book, directed by David Yates. We can see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The special effects are really realistic, and costumes match the characters.If you like magic, it is well worth seeing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
205,The_Orenda,Two Thumbs Up.,7,7 June 2004,"The first thing you will notice about the third Harry Potter movie is that the direction is completely different from the first two. Azkaban is much darker, more enchanted and, let's face it, a much more grown up movie than the previous two. Harry Potter is growing up! And whether this is a good or bad thing is left for the viewer to decide. One thing for certain is the series is truly going down a more darker, more sinister path.After exiling himself from his muggle family world, Harry finds his way back to Hogwarts with the knowledge that a prisoner of Azkaban escaped and is set to kill him. Harry learns more about himself and others as he deals with puberty and his newest opponents, the Dementors.If kids thought the Chamber of Secrets was dark and long, you haven't seen the Dementors yet. Prisoner carries a sort of dark artistry that enchants Harry Potter instead of taking it away from the movie. Where the first two were more plot-driven and focused solely on the characters, Azkaban concentrates a little bit more on the world of Hogwarts and assumes you probably know of Harry, his friends and his mainstay teachers. With a lot of patience, since the movie is long, and a fair grain of salt for the plot twists and time travel toward the end, Harry Potter 3 is a good movie that makes well use of Hogwarts that adds to the series more than taking away.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Everything in it is great, acting, costumes, production, cinematography, script, directing, and set decoration. The sky is awesome. All the other things were awesome too.In this installment Harry is sought and eventually found by his uncle and godfather Sirius Black, a man wrongfully imprisoned at Azkaban Prison for murdering 12 people. However, Harry and Sirius come to terms with their lost time and missed opportunities when they meet up with each other in the end. They discover that Peter Pettigrew is the true killer. Sirius escapes from Azkaban and has remained free ever since.My favorites parts are when aunt Marge blows up, the night bus, Hogwarts, etc.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
207,oshram-3,Not as charming as the first two,5,5 June 2004,"I like the Harry Potter books and so far I've liked the Potter films. The casting's been excellent, the realizing of the world has been deftly done, and the movies by and large have retained the flavor of the books while being enjoyable in their own right. When Chris Columbus announced he wouldn't be helming the third one (or exhaustion would have killed him), I was concerned because more or less I felt he was the primary factor in why these films so readily translated the magic of the novels. And while he's still involved with the new film, you can definitely tell someone else is doing the driving.There would have been more changes between this one and the last one at any rate; the cast no longer looks twelve, they look like they belong on The O.C. Richard Harris died, so you have a new Dumbledore, who is such a key player in the saga. And the third story is where things stop completely revolving around Harry and Hogwarts and we start to see the larger wizardly world. So Azkaban was going to feel different from its predecessors no matter what.But unlike the rest of the world, apparently, I'm not utterly thrilled with how different this movie is. Hogwarts has been completely rearranged; the kids only barely wear their uniforms, and only barely go to school; and characters who had been well handled up until now become doddering dunces.Which is not to say Azkaban is a bad film, because it's not; there is some excellent material in there. It's more to say Azkaban is a joyless film, one with little warmth or heart or humor. That's fine if you set out to make a movie like, say, Underworld, but it seems oddly out of place in the world of Hogwarts.The three leads are all fine, even if they look sixteen or seventeen now (save Watson, she looks a tad younger). No adult character should ever refer to their age in the script again, though; these kids can no more sell thirteen than Luke Perry could sell himself as a high schooler in 90210. I actually prefer the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who seems more like the sly old wizard in the books. Most of the supporting professors are given short shrift: Emma Thompson is fun but wasted in what amounts to little more than a cameo as Madame Trelawney, Maggie Smith gets her one scene to cluck at Harry and his pals, and even Alan Rickman's Snape seems to lack his usual menace. Newcomer Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) is perfunctory, never bad but never great. He lacks any sort of strong screen presence and does little more than fill his role ably. Compare any of these characters to the knockout showing by Ken Branagh last time as Lockhart and you come away woefully lacking.Director Alfonso Cuaron seems not to understand what makes these movies special; the whole point of Harry Potter is that it takes place in a world like ours but wonderfully removed from it. I was initially pleased that our time with the Dursleys was glossed over briefly (you can never leave Privet Drive too quickly, even in the books), but when the Weasley family was similarly relegated to the 'three minutes and out' rule after dad gets his obligatory expository scene, I began to worry. We return to a Hogwarts that looks and feels different from the one in the first two films, none of the kids wear their uniforms for more than a moment or two, and even the balance between the main trio is upset. Ron is reduced to a punchline, a moron who babbles 'brilliant' every other scene but is given little else to do. Draco Malfoy, so wonderful last time around, is there only to sneer and be spit upon. Harry is given proper treatment, and Hermione is so boosted up that her name should be in the title too. But nearly everyone else is poorly handled (other than Dumbledore), and most of the movie I felt like I was watching a clumsy amateur attempt at making a Harry Potter film than an actual part of the franchise.There are moments of magic in this movie, though. When Harry soars on the hippogriff, Cuaron allows us to feel some of the magic that should have infused the whole film. Harry's realization at the end about his own abilities is a nice moment as well, and the very few scenes with Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) are all extremely well done. The first scene  and only the first scene  with the dementor is extremely effective. And so on; little bits of sunshine in an otherwise murky effort.I won't belabor you with the details of everything I thought done poorly (though the quidditch match was a disappointment of Lucasian propriotions), because I didn't think this was an awful film (my words above notwithstanding), I just felt it lacked that certain special warmth and attraction that every Potter book and movie before it had in abundance. Honestly, I feel like this film is a shining example of 'it wasn't broken and you didn't need to fix it.' That doesn't make it a bad film, but it certainly pales in comparison to the first two. I would suggest a little more care but put into casting and staffing next time if Warner's wants to make sure the franchise lasts out the full seven books. Another downer like this one (and the fourth book will be a troublesome adaptation in any case) and people might not want to come back.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
208,joestank15,Decent fare for non-readers. Some fans will be disappointed.,7,5 July 2007,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) goes through his third year at Hogwarts and has to deal with convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison.Ironic that my favorite of the first three books should prove to be my least favorite movie. Whatever magic and energy is powering this film, it's not Rowling or British. Cuaron is a fine director, but was a bad choice for director. He's too breezy with the material and whips through the plot with not enough of the book's charm. Once the kids get to school, everything gets pretty not fun. The Dementors are wonderful creatures and are done to terrifying effect, but are not explained very coherently and some other vital stuff will be lost to people who didn't read the book.There's some fine humor and dark atmosphere, but a lot of the humor is gags and pratfalls. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Hermione Granger) are sidelined to doing this one routine and are both wasted. In fact a lot of the cast is criminally underused. True, Quidditch has been established as one of the ""gimmicks"" in the series, but this movie could've really been livened up had they included the fantastic Quidditch Final,but Cuaron couldn't be bothered. He was too busy doing long tracking shot after long tracking shot back to the Whomping Willow again and again. We REMEMBER, okay? A line of exposition would suffice to make everyone remember about it.The movie seemed like more of a companion guide to the book. Some of the best things in the book were absent and the magic had more of a creepy ""Day of the Dead"" quality (talking shrunken heads. Why are they all Jamaican?) The kids are acting better. Gary Oldman was good. The movie in general, was good, but disappointing for me as a fan. It seemed like Cuaron found it a chore to be dealt with. Some fans may not mind.

210,AnishMisra,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Review,10,6 July 2018,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a film directed by Alfosno Cuaron. I was curious before watching this film as many critics have noted this film a turning point in the series. After watching the film, I can say that this is by far my most favorite film of this series.Plot: Harry Potter is warned about Sirius Black, a prisoner who just escaped Azkaban prison in order to kill him.Story and direction: Taking the reins from one director to another is a very risky thing sicne you have to match the expectations of the audience as well as find a way to say your voice in the film. But this film has excelled in that department. Alfonso Cuaron is successful in providing a change of tone in the film. From scene one, you know the film is going to be different from the previous two. This is very clearly known from the lighting and camera work which is just awesome. The images of certain things like the tree or the flowers depict the kind of silence this film wants to convey. But the film doesn't seem boring for even a single moment. It is never dull because it has the series comedy that defines it. The comedy is very subtle and that says how good a director Alfonso is. Also we get to some new characters in this film, which are very interesting. I especially liked the bond formed between Lupin and Potter. He was just like a mentor to him helping him out in various odd situations. The music is also great and I can just go on about it. The VFX has improved from the previous two and even today it is very much relevant. The VFX feels real and just immerses you into the fictional world that is created. And for the first time, the Quiddicth scene was just to look out for. It was gorgeous. Also to be noted is some of the animal designs in the film. They are so life-like. You feel scared by some of them and also you feel that you want to own some of them. I liked the fact that the film is shorter than the previous two since it was a good move and a long film I guess wouldn't have worked. Steve Kloves deserves a pat on the back for adapting another chapter of Harry Potter successfully. Performances: The regular cast does their job just perfectly and also adapt to the new settings. Michael Gambon is great as the new Dumbledore. Never for a moment do you miss Richard Harris. This character also has a change of characterization from the previous two which I very much liked. David Thewlis is also great in donning the role of Remus Lupin. He is the new character that I liked the most. And finally, Gary Oldman: He is just awesome. Although his scenes are lesser than the rest, but he just leaves an impact on the mind.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where the kids go to Hogsmeade and Hermione and Ron see some building. Then Malfoy and gang come and begin to tease them. After that, Harry with the help of his invisible cloak scares Malfoy and gang away. After all, who doesn't want to see Malfoy beat up!!Verdict: This film is by far the best of Harry Potter. The film did everything for me that I wanted to see in this series. And also, it makes me anxious as I can't wait to see what else it has got to offer. This goes on to prove that when you tap on to the right content and know what your audience wants, I think you can make sequels even more successful than the originals (story wise). Sequels are never cursed. It is just that the makers should know how to handle the characters and give them the respect that they deserve.I am going with a perfect 10/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
211,Barky44,"OK, but could have been outstanding.",7,6 June 2004,"The film version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is not that bad. Acceptable, in fact. What upsets me is it could have been so much more.This is the first novel in JK Rowling's series that really delves in to who Harry Potter's parents are. It's the big mystery up to this point. Who were they? What was their life like, and why did they meet their end? These are the questions answered by this novel.Sadly, the movie does a terrible job answering these questions. There is so much rich dialogue between Harry and the adult characters in this book, yet the filmmakers have shortened it to such an extent the message is lost. There are such great scenes between Lupin, Sirius, Snape, Harry and other key characters in the novels that would have been stunning between these fine actors, but they don't get their chance. And those bits of dialogue that are included are not sold in their proper way, just not played as they should have been so their meaning is lost.The filmmakers did an outstanding job with the three young characters. Their respective actors are definitely improving, and they have been given some very good dialogue and good direction from Alfonso Cuaron. They are indeed the stars of the show.Not overly impressed with Gambon as the new Dumbledore. The stupid pajamas they had him wearing for the duration of the film took away his authority and power, the costume department did him a major injustice.The effects are excellent, but I'm not thrilled with the cinematography. The colors are washed out, it's very brown. I think that's part of the statement: the message of the film is darker. But they can have a dark film and still make it stunning as well. It's almost as if they stopped watering the grass at Hogwarts over the summer.Overall, I think the desire to go darker was wise, but they only did it in a visual sense. Dialogue-wise, they are still talking to children. They need to ramp it up in subsequent novels, and stop shooting for that PG rating.7 out of 10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
212,schroeder-gustavo,Things are getting pretty dark...,10,3 August 2015,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter film that is not directed by Chris Columbus. The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón and it really shows. This film no longer has that magical feeling throughout that the first two had. Instead, the characters are not always surprised and shocked when something magical happens and instead they act a lot like teenagers. The movie is dark, and it really shows how the characters begin to grow up as that magical feeling no longer exists. This is a good thing, in my opinion and this movie is superior than the first two as well. The story is deeper and we get to know some pretty cool characters, it is very dark and very well constructed. But what makes this the best Harry Potter entry so far is the cinematography and directing by Alfonso Cuarón. Every shot looks beautiful, raw and phenomenal. The special effects also get much better in this one and it's just a better movie overall. The pacing is great and the acting is very good as well. This is a great fantasy movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
213,Pavel-8,Exhilarating to the last shot.,9,4 June 2004,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (""PoA"") is a story identical in structure to the first two books/films. Harry makes a narrow escape to Hogwarts, where he is soon at the center of a complicated mystery. With the help of best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he resolves to unravel the perplexity, which leads to a dramatic and mesmerizing final act.""PoA"" is in a unique and tricky position for a literary sequel because not only will it be inevitably compared with the book, but because of a directorial change, the film will be more heavily contrasted with its predecessors. Fortunately Alfonso Cuaron (best known for Y Tu Mama Tambien, pardon the lack of accent marks) has helmed the best film of the series, even though it is the least similar to the source material.While Chris Columbus turned in workmanlike efforts in the first two movies, his primary error was in remaining too faithful to the text, resulting in too much content that slowed down the pacing. Conversely Cuaron has chiseled away at the third book (which is longer than the first two, although the film is shorter) to create his own handiwork that is faithful to the spirit of Rowling's writing, while clearly featuring his own artistic style.That style is what makes ""PoA"" so enjoyable to watch, even if, perhaps especially if you've read the book, as I have. Instead of simply waiting to see how the director's vision matched up with my own, I found myself eagerly anticipating not only the what but the how, as Cuaron's transitions, shots, and camera movements injected new life into the series. The Mexican featured wider and longer shots than most American directors, endowing Hogwarts with a different feeling, one more open and less ominous. His transitions also stood out, in contrast to Columbus' straightforward manner. Many vignettes opened or closed with stylish scene-setting shots, whether it be a freezing flower or a bird veering too close to the Whomping Willow. These transitions meshed with a more subdued color palette to give the film more of a human feel, reflecting the tumultuous times that the main characters were enduring. They also allowed the drama to build, which was important in a film that contained so many vignettes that could easily have felt much more unrelated. The humane aspect of ""PoA"" may be the core enhancement to the series. Cuaron's technical alterations aid this development, as does the maturation of the three children, both as characters and actors. Being clearly older, Harry, Hermione, and Ron have grown past the cute child actor stage and reached the teenage plateau, which for makes them easier to relate with for most of the audience. Additionally the trio is outfitted in normal clothes, rather than their school uniforms, much more often. Not everyone remembers what it was like being a preppy little kid, but everyone recalls life as a jeans-wearing teenager. The physical aspects would possibly be enough, but also the script contains more and better emotions, the three actors are better at portraying them, and the director is better at displaying them. That's a Murderer's Row of improvements that is impossible to overlook.Consistent with the first two films, the adult actors are stellar once more. >From Alan Rickman's permanent sneer as Snape to Maggie Smith's world-weary wisdom as Professor McGonagall to Robbie Coltrane's now-promoted-to-faculty Hagrid, all of the returnees slide effortlessly back into their parts. They are complemented by an equally talented group of newcomers. Michael Gambon performs admirably with the impossible task of replicating Richard Harris' gravitas, combining Harris' established character with his own interpretations. As the latter titular character, a frenetic Gary Oldman is deliriously watchable once he finally makes an appearance. Last but definitely not least is David Thewlis as R.J. Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He expertly works with Harry to supply several tender exposition scenes that don't slow down the movie. All in all, the adult cast shines as they relish their roles without chewing scenery.Special effects were at the center of the first two films, but in ""PoA"" they largely take a backseat to traditional dialogue scenes. That allows the fewer primary visual effects (not to be confused with the numerous background paintings, etc.) to range from solid to superb. Buckbeak looks perfect, while the Dementors quality tattered look will suffer from comparisons to the superior Ringwraiths of ""LOTR"". But due to sheer originality, the Knight Bus tops them all in an early thrill ride. Good stuff as usual from Industrial Light & Magic. Speaking of reliable technicians, John Williams has composed yet another excellent score. With the choral song Something Wicked This Way Comes, Williams has added another lingering tune to his already familiar work, allowing him to weave both themes throughout the film. The guy's a machine, and while he does occasionally produce some melodramatic scores, this is not one of them. Its tinges of darkness and minor keys (?) accurately mirror the action, soaring and subsiding as needed. Lest you think the movie was the greatest film ever, I should point out that because Cuaron trimmed so much from the book, the numerous scenes sometimes feel rushed and truncated, as though we are dashing through a museum in an effort to see everything as quickly as possible. The truncation did not bother me because I knew the omitted information, but the pace was too choppy over the middle portion of the film. I could also argue that if you haven't seen the others or read the books, then you won't fully understand everything, as characters and skills aren't entirely explained. But that's a minor complaint, because will anyone actually see this one who hasn't seen or read the others? Like it or not, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is clearly the most cinematic of the first three movies. Rather than simply churn out a live-action version of the book, director Alfonso Cuaron utilized tools like telescopic fades, zooms through clock towers, and additional character development as he adapted the book to fit the big screen. The result is a emotionally darker film with more humanity than the first two combined.Bottom Line: ""PoA"" was the best film I've seen so far this year. Thoroughly enjoyable to the last shot. A high 8 of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
214,jake-law123,A slight improvement over the second.,7,2 December 2010,"I liked this one better than the second one. I don't know what it was, but something about this movies tone and mood, as well as the way it was crafted together gave me a better feeling for it. Now directed by a new director, a lot of things have changed, including the cinematography, the visuals, the plots, and altogether the directing. This one is more adventurous, more loose, more fitting with the book, and a lot more progressing.Harry's third year consists of a serial killer whose escaped from Azkaban named Sirius Black, (Gary Oldman) trying to find and kill him. This causes Harry to be extra cautious this year, trying to avoid both him, and the dreadful dementors of Azkaban trying to find Sirius as well. Like I said, progresses the series quite well. The first two were very similar together, with similar looks, settings, and costumes. This one goes a little less decorative, but still exciting.The music score is still by John Williams, which will never die. The plot holes are a lot more clean, and the suspense is 10x bigger. Its also a lot more emotional, talking a lot about Harry's parents, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin, was a good friend of James and Lily Potter.Doesn't refer to the other as much, but maybe thats a good thing, to focus more on the main plot. Also has really cool new material in it, introducing us to new and magical things that you wish you could do.Still could have a little bit more to it. Still doesn't compete with the original one, but still one of the top ones of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

With there being 8 what can I say when I love them all equally, but here goes.This is the third instalment of J K Rowlings wonderful series and it's pretty darn exciting. It's based around a character named Serious Black who may have had a hand in the murder of Harry's parents some 11 years before.There are many things that Harry and his friends have to get through in this including the Dementors and a creature that looks like a huge flying turkey. Throw in a werewolf and a demonic tree and its fun fun fun.As usual we have an incredibly huge all star cast and a story which unfolds and from start to finish a great many special effects to wow you.A film of pure fantasy and not just for kids, I for one will always treasure these films and continue to rewatch them year after year.Overall a great story, great acting, a film that sets your imagination free.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The main person that is rightfully introduced in this movie was Lupin.

The make-up is really interesting and this film goes down as for having the best make-up in a film in my book.The rest of the production designs are very amazing. Overall, I like HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and this is the film that transformed this franchise from being a book adaptation franchise into a film franchise and PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a true example of a fantasy movie filmmaking.10/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
220,xlars,Sorely needed: An extended version,6,12 June 2004,"I had been looking forward to Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, since I saw the Chamber of Secrets ... and as the story goes, I was sorely disappointed. Having read the comments from ""movie specialist"" and critics in papers and on various TV-channels I had really high expectations - but I was let down. Why? Because although the movie had much better acting skills (at least from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint I was grieved to see Emma Thompsons characterization of professor Trelawney. Not good enough by a long shot. The editing was so so. The direction was probably very good from a movie technical point of view - but ...and it is a very big BUT:The film was not by a mile dark enough. The film was not by a hundred miles long enough. And the details were to scarce to get a real idea of the story.A personal message to Alfonso Cuaron? Make an extended version. At least 45 minutes longer. And the next time, if possible - make the werewolf believable. It was also a shock to see that the grounds of Hogwarts had changed as much as it had. Too much. This is lack of respect for those who've watched the first two movies. Continuity is vital. Even in such small matters. And it is vital to put further details in the plot... there is so much more to get from it than this.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

222,RCWjr,Darker isn't always better,8,16 July 2007,"I know that many of the readers of the books, those that post on IMDb anyway, and the critical mass hailed this as the first authentic recreation of the universe that Rowling created. Again, I come to these films totally ignorant of the books, however, for me, the criticism of Columbus' first 2 films in the franchise is nitpicking. Further, the praise given to this film I think is overdone.The kids are once again great, but the film to me is disjointed and a mess. Not sure if the book treats the Black character the same as the film, but when we FINALLY get to see him in the flesh, he is gone again. I thought the whole lead up to his reveal was overdone. Oldman plays the character fantastically, but the character is hyped so much in the film and then given very little in the end that I felt almost cheated.As for the darkness of the film, it works in furthering the story, but just because it is darker doesn't make it better. I still think Columbus did an excellent job with the first two films and I don't understand the criticism of his films and the lauding of this one.I was very disappointed that once again Snape, the Malfoy's and Dumbledore are all but absent here. Again, not sure if in the books these characters are thrown to the side, but they are characters I personally would like to see more time given to. Draco is turned into an absolute wimp this go around and I thought that totally discredited his character. Yes, he has the cowards personality shown in the first two films, but he is also seen as a serious threat to Harry. Now he is reduced to the clichéd wimpy bully here. Another major rub this time around is Dumbledore. He is reduced to a dismissive kindly old man. Is he not the headmaster? Yet he seems to have little to do from a leadership stand point. All in all, this was a good movie, but for me, the weakest in the franchise to date. There is a lot of good in it, but there is also a lot of negative, mainly with the characters I mentioned, and in the end made the film a disappointment for me.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
223,pritol,Best so far in the series....,8,16 April 2021,"Once again the expansion of the Potter Universe is brilliantly executed, showing more quirks and details in some of the magical ways in which wizards and witches get around in the ""normal world"".This has a slightly darker feel about it, as there appears to be an imminent threat to Harry Potter's life, and as Harry's wizarding skills improve, we learn a little more about his parents, and his nemesis...whose name no-one likes to say.It's hard to watch them all in sequence and try to come up with something unique to say about each one, but this has definitely been my favourite so far, compelling and gripping all the way through.... the change in Dumbledore is a shame, but Michael Gambon does a fantastic job of making the character his own following the tragic passing of the wonderful Richard Harris.Looking forward to watching the next one tonight...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
224,neenahhh,"Darker, but definitely more magical",9,10 July 2011,"I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.In the wizarding world, there is a criminal on the loose- Sirius Black. He has escaped from his imprisonment at Azkaban for the murder of Harry's parents and is looking for Harry. He is now at large and Dementors (soul-sucking guardians of Azkaban) are seen everywhere, searching for him.The plot may seem normally adequate, but I really think that this third installment was brilliant. This was a lot better than the first two movies. I loved the new characters who were introduced, especially Remus Lupin. I particularly liked the humor and sheer fun that this movie had. Yes, this movie was dark, but the touch of humor added here and there in dialogues, balanced the movie out.I remember when I first watched this movie, I thought that it was too long. I think it was because I was too young to actually understand what was happening. Now that I'm older, I can see why this film is a definite favorite amongst fans. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" really is magical. You can see it everywhere. There were so many things that were happening in this movie. But surprisingly, it worked. I never got the feeling that events were too fast paced. The flow was great. I don't know how they did that!Viewed on: July 10, 2011",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
225,athena24,For every kid,8,8 September 2005,"I didn't really wanted to see this movie. Why? Because I was 24 years old student who really grew up from this kind of movies. Luckily, that year I was involved in a project of helping problematic kids. So I had an eleven years old boy to look after. Naturally when we decided to go to the cinema together he was the one to choose the film. I won't describe the joy of the kid and just say that he loved it. As for me, I don't really remember when was the last time I liked a movie that was meant for kids. And maybe it's not because I grown up, but because of the movies that are made. To me this levels with such greats as ""Neverending Story"" ( Only the original) and ""Thursday after rain"". Of course the visual effects of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" are awesome, and the colors are very unique and interesting but these are not the main points. This movie shows creativeness, imagination and kindness of heart which most of the movies lacks. One of the best in it's kind.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
226,Jexxon,Strike three,4,19 December 2004,"The third of the Potter films is, by far, the visually most impressive one. The not-so-great effects from previous films are all gone, and replaced by some top notch work. Also, the overall look and feel of the film is darker and more interesting than before. That said, there are still huge problems.The plot is still virtually the same as the other two: Potter at home, mean foster family, some magic, meet up with Ron's family and off to school, a couple of new teachers, some new mysterious danger, nobody telling Potter anything, evil Malfoy brat bullying people, more talk about Harry's parents, Quidditch, and some incomprehensible talk leading up to yet another anti-climax. As before, it seems vital to have read the novels if you're going to get to grips with what's happening on screen.The acting is a bit better in this outing, but it's still far from perfect. And, the script is pretty messy, making little or no sense, and with some annoying things as well (Potter's fainting grows tiresome real fast). Now that they've got the film to look good, I'm just waiting for someone that dares to really adapt the book for the screen, making a ""real"" film out of it, rather than just an illustrated version of the book aimed squarely at the die-hard fans.

Cuarón was probably the best director this franchise had and it's a shame that he directed only one movie in the series because he captured the magic perfectly. This one was even darker than the 2nd one and I remember how dementors freaked me out as a kid but it's still nothing compared to sequels. Young actors are much better this time, especially Radcliffe. He really surprised me. Watson and Grint did a really good job too. And there is so much new actors in this movie and ,oh my god, they were brilliant. Emma Thompson was hilarious as prof. Trelawney, Timothy Spall in role I'm not gonna mention because, spoilers, and, man, Gary Oldman did such a brilliant job as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon was really good as Dumbledore but still not as good as Richard Harris (R.I.P.) who really was Dumbledore from the book. The effects also look much more realistic in this one and the flight scene with a hipogriff was spectacular and remains one of my favorite scenes in the entire series.

I even successfully got my mother into it was well. The magic of Harry Potter can be appreciated by anyone young and old alike. I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire fame, but this one surpassed both and even to this day I come back to this one more than even the sequels as well, courtesy of Alfonso Cuaron's masterful direction. He knows how to add what's both light and dark, young and mature into a perfect mixture. Michael Gambon is great as Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris, David Thewlis has that conviction as Professor Lupin, and Gary Oldman has that edge as Sirius Black. There are many great moments in this movie, almost too many to name! From Aunt Marge getting her (hilarious!) comeuppance, Harry's first flight on a fantastic creature that he and his friends later have to save and then it saves them, to Harry learning an important, though difficult spell that he will have to use against frightening, hooded, soul-sucking creatures, to many playfully mischievious moments inside a cloak of invisibility, trying animal candies and more.

229,haydenluz,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,9,18 August 2020,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, created the best film as of yet, and arguably the best film of the saga! Cuaron crafted some absolutely gorgeous shots, with beautiful cinematography, popping off the screen with a great color pallet. He brings a lot of style to this film, incorporating many long takes, emotional close ups, with seamless editing, that helped the film stand on it's own. Instead of keeping the film more lighthearted, Cuaron brings this darker tone, that elevates the saga to new heights! Chris Columbus seemed to have a tough time focusing on the premise, and fleshing it out, but Cuaron did a fantastic job keeping the narrative tight and cohesive, while still keeping the continuity of the saga. Cuaron utilized amazing imagery, to create a lot of suspense, and twists throughout the narrative, allowing for countless memorable moments! I really don't have many issues with the story or direction; the only nitpicks I have, is that they incorporated a few filler scenes and exposition dumps, but they made things as interesting and entertaining as possible.Even though, this is very much a story-driven film, Cuaron did not hold back on the amount of genuine character moments between everyone! Cuaron and Kloves did a very good job of balancing all of the characters, trying to give them all more development. Our three leads in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, all put on great performances, continuously working on their genuine chemistry. The new characters in Gary Oldman, David Thewill, Timothy Spall, and Michael Gambon were all great additions to the story, all putting on enthusiastic performances, fitting the scheme perfectly.The screenplay by Steve Kloves, was by far the best one yet! The script was written so well, having so much intricate detail. The comedy was interwoven beautifully, not being forced in and ruining the tone. You can tell that Kloves knows his Harry Potter, and continues on making great screenplays.The Prisoner of Azkaban took full advantage of fleshing out their world, and their magic! Cuaron digs deeper on the magic, giving us so many entertaining sequences! Cuaron and the art directors crafted so many brilliantly looking sets, looking completely authentic, with amazing detail, making you feel like you were actually at Hogwarts.Overall, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has so much to offer, with a brilliantly shot film, amazing characters, and beautiful looking set pieces!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
230,basilisksamuk,Improvement on the first two movies,7,1 February 2013,"By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.I liked the first two films but I thought that this was an improvement and acted and directed with much great assurance than its predecessors. The addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast gave the film greater gravitas. I also liked the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Bear in mind that I haven't read the books so I'm not obsessed about everyone being portrayed as they were in the books. Richard Harris was great and it's a tragedy he died when he did but Gambon makes a more convincing head in my eyes.The look of this film certainly lifts it above the previous two. Watching all the films literally one per day over a week, the changes to the geography of Hogwart's and the School itself was very obvious but I liked the new version. The creatures and the Dementors were realised very effectively.On the downside there is yet another boring Quidditch sequence but at least the dementors livened it up. It is also clear in the latter part of the film that the title should have been ""Harry Potter goes Back to the Future"" but the reworking was well done.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

This is an interesting fantasy wherein Harry and Hermoine dive into the past and help Buckbeak and Sirius Black. More interesting was Patronus charm in which Harry helps himself and Sirius. Magic with elements of friendship, sacrifice, betrayals give this movie a great stature. Enjoyed it all through.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
232,SeminolePhenom,The magic that I have been waiting for...,8,14 November 2005,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) leaves early for Hogwarts after blowing up his aunt (literally) and quickly finds out that a man named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from a high-security prison called Azkaban and may attempt to kill Harry. Harry also learns that Sirius Black is partly responsible for the murdering of his parents and was a big supporter of Lord Voldemort.Upon arrival Hogwarts, the students are greeted with a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher (this makes 3 in the past 3 years) named Professor Lupin (David Thawlis) and Death Eaters (The creatures that guard Azkaban who feed on emotion) who are now guarding the school grounds in search of Sirius Black. Harry quickly finds himself in another adventure with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).This is the best Harry Potter movie yet. Alfonso Cuaron was exactly what the Harry Potter movies needed. He brought darkness that the others lacked and ""Prisoner"" had possessed throughout the book. The adaptation of the four hundred page book was outstanding. I wish the movie was a little longer, but the movie included everything that was important except for the story on how the map came into being but that isn't desperately important.The acting was finally the caliber of acting that I wanted to see in the franchise. Daniel Radcliffe finally showed me the complexity that Harry showed throughout the novels and Gary Oldman was also incredible. I was really looking down to having a big name actor in the franchise, but he played it very well. I can't say that Michael Gambon did as good of a job as the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but he did a fair job and you can't really do anything about that. Overall, ""Prisoner"" had everything that the others lacked but is still not the perfection that I need to see from the Harry Potter Franchise. I can only hope that The Goblet of Fire can satisfy my need for the perfect Harry Potter film. This film is great, but I want incredible.I highly recommend this film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
233,InaneSwine,"This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too",9,27 November 2004,"Now we're getting to the meaty stuff. Harry cops an attitude! As the children become adolescents, the filmmaking skills surrounding them mature also. Alfonso Cuarón confidently adopts and revitalises a well established cinematic world designed by Chris Columbus. The visual effects are now tighter than ever; the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking; and Radcliffe and his teenage co-stars are now steady on their feet.What shines through in this third instalment that didn't quite make it in the first two is the rich and emotional story, as Harry struggles not only with new revelations about his past, but with ordinary life as a teenage boy as well. New recruits Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic together, and Gambon's turn as Dumbledore (after Richard Harris' regrettably short run) breathes new life into the character, and it's remarkable.Looking great and sounding great was accomplished by Columbus. This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
234,Doublej20005,The Best in the Series so far,9,7 February 2021,"This isn't my favourite story of the franchise - there are a few flaws with the Peter Pettigrew/Scabbers twist (why did Wormtail hide in such an obvious place, for example), and whilst I do like that Voldemort isn't included in any kind of physical form, you could essentially remove this film from the storyline and not that much would change. But this is definitely the most well made film of the franchise. Alfonso Cuaron is a great director, and his use of long takes as well as darker cinematography makes this a visual treat from start to finish. Whilst I would consider Goblet of Fire to be the first truly dark film in the franchise, this is definitely leaning towards that whilst keeping a lot of the fun aswell. The score is arguably the best in the franchise, Lupin is a great addition, the relationship between Sirius and Harry, despite them spending very little time together, is extremely well developed when they are on screen together, Snape has a great arc in this film - it's just the best made of the franchise by far. The performances from the lead three are finally legitimately good, and the effects are once again a big step up from Chamber of Secrets. I love the use of time travel here, which can feel like an excuse to change the past, but is used in the way that time travel would actually work in real life. The relationships between the characters are really well developed on the whole - I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love this film. As much as I love the rest of the franchise, I can't help but wonder what Cuaron would have done in the rest of the franchise, because he clearly shows here that he is a master of his craft. In conclusion, this is my favourite of the rewatch so far, and I would definitely recommend it.Also, I noticed that in the Boggart scene when Lupin stops the dementor, the Boggart (aka his greatest fear) briefly becomes a full moon, foreshadowing him being a werewolf. It's a really nice touch and is one of the small things that makes this film as fantastic as it is.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
235,colonel_green,"Rich, atmospheric, and one hell of a ride.",10,5 June 2004,"Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films were good, and they did a fine job of setting up the Harry Potter universe; but there was something missing from those films. They both lacked a style of their own. Now comes Alfonso Cuaron, whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has style to burn, as well as plenty of substance. Screenwriter Steven Kloves makes many noticeable changes to J.K. Rowling's masterful novel, and the result is a great script. Kloves brings in his own dialogue, and it works; there are plenty of great one-liners. Several subplots had to go to make the film fit (I missed the Quidditch Cup storyline most of all), but it was all for the best. Among the regular castmembers, Emma Watson continues to be the big discovery of this series. Hermione was already my favourite character in the books, but Watson takes the character several steps higher. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint also do great work here. Michael Gambon is great as Albus Dumbledore, bringing to the screen the quirkiness and uniqueness that was largely absent from Richard Harris's portrayal of the Headmaster (no offense is meant to Harris, who was in the twilight of his life at the time, and seemed too tired). David Thewlis is wonderful as Professor Remus Lupin, although I hadn't pictured Lupin as having a moustache.

There are some genuinely creepy moments here, certainly for any kids watching, and the plot is somewhat more complex than the earlier efforts, with double crosses and time travel elements. I have got say though, as much as I did enjoy this film, it felt very much part of a bigger picture as opposed to its own self contained entry, and as such as viewed as a standalone film struggles to work. It starts assuming you have seen the previous entries, and doesn't really end with any sort of payoff. Its better than chamber of secrets for sure, and an enjoyable watch as part of a saga, but on its own feels like a stepping stone to more. Still, the Dementers were cool, and the main trio are noticably becoming more confident with each film...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
238,etsm92,Not as good as the first two but still very imaginative and dark!,9,4 July 2006,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/2004/***1/2Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson David Thewlis Gary OldmanOnce again the magic of J.K. Rowling and the magic of film combine together to make another amazing Harry Potter film to be released in the theaters. The first two are still the best to let human eyes set upon. But, as usual, we wait for another Harry Potter film to beat the first two; yet still it has not come but it can still be possible because I've read all the Potter books and the fifth and sixth seem to be tied with impressiveness. The sixth has the best beginning. The fifth and sixth have the best middles. And the fifth has the best end. I would have to say all of Rowling's books are impressive and deeply interesting in, at least, most of the parts. So the third movie is finally released in theaters. I'm excited to see this one because it looked like the best one from what the previews showed. It wasn't the best but I was deeply immersed in the story. As usual, this Potter film had another major storyline behind it. The evil and crazy Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is the first to do it. This causes tensions and worries throughout not only Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but throughout all of London. Everyone's on the lookout for the supposed lunatic. Harry has a discussion with Mr. Weasley (Ron's dad) about Sirius Black and that Harry should keep a look out for the man. He tells Harry very firmly to not go looking for Black because he wants to kill him and Harry answers, ""Why would I go after a man who wants to kill me?"" You could see that Harry did not solemnly swear to not go looking for him. He actually wanted to after what information he overheard Professor McGonagall, Madam Rosmerta and Cornelius Fudge talking about in an upstairs room of Rosmerta's pub. But before this Professor Dumbledore (replaced by the gruff Michael Gambon) had warned each and every one of the Hogwarts students to be very cautious and said that dementors would be guarding the school. He said not to go near these creatures. They're very dangerous. And it turns out they were. School matters were mixed in with Sirius/dementor matters like the Quidditch Final. This turned out not to be like it was planned. However, school matters seem to wane when the film gets closer and closer to the dramatic ending which reveals many answers that refer to people's suspicious questions. Professor Remus Lupin caused a bit of uneasiness. As did Scabbers, Ron's rat. Harry, Ron and Hermione were the first to investigate. During the intense and adventurous scenes, John Williams was really going crazy with his orchestra to try to catch the moment. I have to say, he succeeded in doing it because William's music was definitely the most pronounced in this film especially during the parts with Sirius and Lupin and the rest of the gang and, of course, Quidditch. So if you haven't seen this very well done, dark and intense film yet, which I highly doubt, buy it (DO NOT RENT IT BUT BUY IT!) on DVD or VHS. But you should think of getting it on DVD. I enjoy it better at home because I saw it in the theaters the first day it came out. It wasn't very fun. We were supposed to go to an early showing. However, there was an idiotic woman in front of us in the ticket line fiddling with her purse. So it was SOLD OUT after five minutes. So, an hour and a half later, we see a later showing and we went inside the theater passing by two security guards with real guns in their pockets. I know the Potter films are popular but securing a theater so no one comes in without a ticket which only cost a maximum of ten dollars is pretty pathetic to me. And I just hope that purse woman had a bad dinner that evening if she had dinner at all. Movie directed by Alfonso Cuarón.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

240,Monotreme02,The least cartoon-like of the three films,8,27 October 2005,"Finally, an installment in the Harry Potter series that has a serious amount of intelligence. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the most film-like of the three movies, and definitely the least cartoon-like. It looks like Warner Brothers made a smart move by replacing the director with a professional: Alfonso Cuaron (the new director) sure gives the impression that he knows what he's doing, unlike Chris Columbus' clumsy work on the first two Harry Potter movies. Then again, Cuaron directed some great films, such as ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y tu mama tambien"", while Chris Colombus' major credits are Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. It is quite understandable (and obvious) that Cuaron is the more professional of the two.One of the things that annoyed me the most about the first two films is how pastoral the world looked, especially the Hogwarts grounds. I always thought that the Quiddich sequences in the first two films looked abnormally fake, and they were my least favorite parts of both films. I'm not sure why I thought they looked so fake, but it was probably a combination of the shiny, spotless witness stands, the smooth, bright green grass and the perfect blue sky, and a very ""fake"" filming style. Cuaron changes all this. His most obvious addition to the series is just how dark he managed to make the Harry Potter world. Quiddich never looked so real. Then again, in Prisoner of Azkaban you never really see the Quiddich field, as it's raining cats and dogs (not literally). The filming style of the Quiddich came, though, is so much better than that of the Quiddich games in the first two films. Also, the Hogwarts grounds are no longer so green and perfect: they are now very muddy, with ugly, pale weeds growing all over the place, and the entire place is littered with gray rocks and boulders. It just looks so much more real than the flawless, bright green grass in the first two films. Also, there is almost never a blue sky: it's always cloudy and very murky. This was a great touch, and it was a great decision to change the pastoral look of Hogwarts to a gloomier appearance.Another thing I must praise Cuaron for is the acting he managed to squeeze out of his actors: Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry) performance in the first two films always annoyed me, but Cuaron really managed to turn him into a pretty good actor. He does a great job in expressing Harry's emotions in this film, which was very important since this is when they really start getting turbulent. Rupert Grint (Ron) doesn't really have much to do except whine and look terrified, and Emma Watson's (Hermione) acting never really bothered me. But, as usual, the actors that really shine are the adults. Alan Rickman, as usual, is stunning in his role as Snape: he truly was the perfect choice. The three newcomers were also great. David Thewlis was good as Lupin, although I always imagined Lupin's character as a much more sympathetic one, but then again his condition probably really agitates him, so his attitude in some scenes is probably appropriate for his character. Gary Oldman, as usual, is excellent in his role as Sirius Black. While we're supposed to sympathize his character, at the end of the film he still looks ruddy, dirty and slightly crazy. And last but not least, Emma Thomson was excellent in her somewhat small role as Professor Trelawney: the filmmakers made her exactly how I imagined her to be.The main problem with the film is some bad storytelling at some points. For someone who read the books, watching the movie is really no problem, because they can fill in the gaps themselves according to what was in the book and not featured in the movie, but for people who haven't read the book, the movie looked to me as very difficult to understand. There were quite a few points that something wasn't explained on screen that made somewhat of a difference in the scene, and some cases in which I wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on unless I'd have read the book (which, as I mentioned before, I did). Bottom line is, it might be a bit difficult to see this film unless you know what's going on.To sum it all up, Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, certainly proved himself as someone who knows what he's doing. He's managed to improve this film from the first two in almost every aspect: acting, mood, production design, cinematography, visual effects, and of course, direction. It's really too bad that Cuaron's not directing the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (this is due to the fact that filming on Goblet of Fire began while Prisoner of Azkaban was still in post-production), and I really hope that the new director will take a few leafs out of Alfonso Cuaron's book. The great thing about this film is that he's so much of a professional, movie buffs (like me, for instance) who enjoy watching ""artsy"" movies, will probably like this one as well, for its artistic merits (check out some great use of time as an artistic tool near the end of the movie, mostly usage of the giant clock installed in the school in some shots I described before). But, a few things that bugged me about this movie lower its value a bit. Also, the fact that I just don't like J.K. Rowling lowered its value a bit. Final evaluation: definitely worth seeing, but it might be too complex (and quite scary, at times) for the younger ones.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
241,joshuafagan-64214,Best Film of the Series; One of the Best Films of All Time,10,4 September 2015,"I wish Alfonso Cuaron would come back to the franchise. I know that he probably won't, but I still hope. After all, as we float through this empty, depressing world, sometimes all we have is hope. He detached this film franchise from its safe-as-a-CIA-file roots and allowed it to grow wings and fly into a silver ether. To anyone who thinks franchise films cannot be art... check out LOTR. But once you are done, check out this film. It is both ironic and darkly appropriate that this is both the lowest grossing Harry Potter film and the one that many film critic types, such as myself, say is the greatest of the octology.The film starts off like do all Harry Potter books and most Harry Potter movies. Potter is at the house of his over-the-top, abusive, Muggle adopted family, getting tormented like he always does. Yes, I know it is explained in detail why he needs to stay with them, but such doesn't make it any less of a poor writing choice. But, when and if I do a full review of the Potter series, I'll go over those kinds of decisions. I only bring this up because it is a base line for these movies and such something I can use to show why this is the best one. In the Columbus films, it is played with a cheerful exaggeration that reminds me of many of his eighties movies. This is not a bad thing, but it is not brimming with greatness either. In the Yates films, it is downplayed as just a backdrop, a facade, if you will, to more serious matters. Cuaron manages to combine these approaches, which is expected, as both this and GOF are the 'transition movies', while adding both sophistication and a level of charged rawness, which is not expected.We get to see Harry's emotional landscape. Fragile but potent, unstable but unyielding, it is a sight to behold, one that belies the simpler character that we got in both the earlier and later movies. If Harry Potter developed along these lines, he might have actually been a great character instead of the flattest one among a crowd of interesting people.The scenes are magical, but not in the try-hard way of the first two films. Around the time that I first saw them, I declared myself a true blue of the series. I haven't looked back since. The shots are magical in a way that is both wispy and intense. This is the tone that these movies should have taken, and if they reboot them, something of I am not in favor but something that is a conceivable possibility in today's Hollywood climate, this is the tone I would like them to try to take. Just the thought of that sends chills down my spine. It might even be able to challenge LOTR for the crown of best fantasy series of all time. After that virtuoso opening, I kept waiting to be let down. I never was. Every new character introduced was interesting and every old character they excluded was not missed. The pacing is the best out of the movies; the first two were too slow and the other five were too fast. The plot was more personal to me than the other movies; this is the one movie in which Voldemort does not appear in some form or another. There is no direct end boss and so the plot has to be more creative. And so it is.Of course, more of the credit for this has to go Mrs. Rowling for writing the book on which this film was based. But the cinematography is all the work of Cuaron's team. And it is the best in the series by far. Not to say that the other movies are poorly shot; this is Britain, after all: things may be bad, but they are never badly done. But while the cinematography of the first few movies would perfectly fit a kid's fantasies, the cinematography of the fourth movie would perfectly fit a high class ball or gala, and the cinematography of the last four movies would perfectly fit a nature doc, the cinematography of this film perfectly fits the franchise. It is artful and well-done, but it is not show like an Oscarbaity period piece. The camera feels alive and coated with magic powder. It is exactly how I imagine the heartbeat of a troubled magic society to feel like. The music helps it out. If you listen to Window to the Past and are not sucked into the world Cuaron made for this film, then you just don't have a soul. It is introspective, ambient, immersive, and coated with the kind of cerebral wonder that I think makes life worth living. It is the best tune in the franchise. But do not think it is the only good tune in the movie. Buckbeak's Flight is a good second.While the characters in the series may never be willing/able to turn back time after this movie for reasons cheap and nonsensical and borderline nonexistent, I hope that you will be wiser. Come back in time with me to 2004. And let the emotional waves of this picture overtake you.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

243,pri_e,fantastic!,10,3 July 2004,"I was surely NOT disappointed when I saw this movie, I thought that the change of director was the best thing that happened to this series. He didn't rely on too many special effects to create such a wonderful adaptation of J.K Rowling's third novel. It's great to see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint have really grown into their roles and I think we can expect even more greater things as each novel is made in the future.
The only flaws that I can note is some of the important details from the book that they left out in the movie, I think they could have made it even more fantastic than it already is.Other than that, I'm looking forward to the next installment and the sixth novel!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
244,bosscain,not as good as the first,7,5 June 2004,"I thought this third installment of the Harry Potter movies was lacking. lacking of the charm that the first two movies had. The storyline was muddled and thrown together two quicklythe whole time traveling aspect of the movie was really bad and not well written. Im disapointed in this movie,since I looked forward to seeing itfor such a long time.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
245,walsh-22,My favourite so far,10,15 May 2007,"I was sad when Richard Harris died as I wondered what would happen to the series. I was glad when they said they were not going to stop filming them and had cast Michael Gambon in the role. He does an admirable job but I found his slight Irish twang to be odd, I know he is trying to be different from Richard Harris but it is a little bit silly as it comes and goes.What appeals to me about this story is we see Harry in his teens, changing from the very first movie, where he stands up to his horrible family. I have to say I cheered when the aunt blew up and then flew away.I'm glad that Gary Oldman was in this film because I regard him as one of the best actors to ever come out of Britain.I like the fact that this story was not so much focused on Voldemort as the others, this was more about Harry finding out about who betrayed his parents to Voldemort and that he had a godfather if he ever wanted to get away from the Dursleys. It was also interesting to have one plot line which involved going back in time. The special effects for this was amazing as Harry and Hermione have to hide from their past selves. The other special effect I thought was amazing was Lupin turning into a werewolf and then the way the werewolf was animated.I had read the book but was still surprised, probably as it so long ago that I read the book. The scene, in particular when the audience find out that the one that betrayed Harry's parents and framed Sirius Black was Ron's rat who has featured in the other films. I laughed at the scene where Harry is invisible and is throwing snow balls at Malfoy and his friends.My favourite of the series so far.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
246,abrafocus,Awful,3,8 March 2006,"Being a big fan of the third book, I had high expectations when I went to see this movie. Boy, was I ever disappointed! This movie has many flaws, but I'll name just a few.1. The werewolf was supposed to have hair and a tail, as it says clearly in the book.2. The dementors were not supposed to fly. Only float.3. The Firebolt that Harry received was given to him by Sirius. In the book, it was on Christmas. In the movie, it was the end of the year.4. The director failed to explain the Maruader's Map, like who wrote it, and the fact that Harry's father was one of them.5. Trelawney's prediction was not explained enough. Like that fact that it was her second prediction overall. This turns out to be important in the fifth book.6. The Knight Bus was not done the right way at all. (It wasn't supposed to squeeze through two vehicles.)7. In the book, Harry does not yell, ""Expecto Patronum."" 8. They didn't show the Quidditch Final, which Gryffindor won.9. The actor who played Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, was not right for the part.(See * below.) 10. Dumbledore should have talked to Harry more.Those are, like I said, only a few (*) I know that Richard Harris passed away in 2002, but someone else should have played Dumbledore. Michael Gambon just wasn't right.Like I said above, I loved the third book, but this film was my least favorite. I haven't seen the fourth movie, but I doubt it'll beat the second movie, which is my favorite one so far.Unless you're a die-hard fan, avoid this movie. If you must watch it, read the book first. Otherwwise, you'll be completely lost.My Score: 6/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
247,TheNabOwnzz,Emotionally rich & visually stunning,8,24 June 2018,"The sheer emotion and the fantastic visuals of this entry into the Harry Potter series alone is enough for me to consider The Prisoner of Azkaban as the best in the series. It has a stroke of genius in its immersion that cannot be matched by any other one of the films in the series.Admittedly Alfonso Cuaron changed a lot of things when compared to the first two films by Chris Columnbus. Cuaron wanted to create an extremely dark atmospheric experience that can strike the fear in the hearts of the audience by use of its visuals alone, and he succeeded. The film is much, much darker than the previous two, and while it still has its joyous moments due to the fact that this is only the mere transitioning of the series into more mature territory, it is mostly a very serious film. Like the previous two, the narrative is once again outstanding, its non linear storytelling and use of time travel makes me also consider this film as my personal favorite narrative in the series, and the time travel sequence is quite possibly the greatest sequence in the series too. The introduction of the characters Lupin ( David Thewles ) & Sirius Black ( Gary Oldman ) also proves that like in the previous film, the Chamber of Secrets, the series manages to add new characters that are once again extremely interesting.This truly is the transcending film in terms of the three leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson, as they have evolved into great actors by this film ( Except maybe Radcliffe, who was still lacking emotional intensity in certain scenes, such as the one where he breaks down after eavesdropping on McGonogall and the minister. ). Unfortunately Richard Harris passed away before being able to take part in this third entry and thus was replaced as Dumbledore by Michael Gambon, who is admittedly not as good as Richard Harris, whose soothing presence had no equal. Gambon is not a weak link however, and plays Dumbledore to the best of his ability. David Thewles as Lupin is an extremely likeable but as later discovered also quite a troubled character, but the friendly & kind nature of the way his character is played is simply brilliant. It is ofcourse always a great idea to cast Gary Oldman in a film, as he is one of the most versatile and talented actors to ever grace the screen, and his performance in this film is once again nothing short of spectacular, since the desperation and will for justice basically drips from his face.The cinematography was great in the first two films, but is even better in the third, as it focuses a lot more on outdoor shots and on connectivity of its world than its predecessors. Cuaron wanted to show the audience how the world is connected, with various shots of the bridge making clear that Hagrid's hut is beneath it, and the courtyard before it. It is the most immersive of the series because it makes you memorize the layout with its beautiful connecting cinematography. There are also a lot more shots of beautiful gorgeous scottish-esque natural backdrops of the green plains and mountains, a bit in Braveheart's style, resulting in a visually very pleasing film. The previous two films seemed to be filmed on flat pieces of land which focused more on the sets itself instead of its gorgeous backgrounds.John Williams's score is very different from the previous two films too, since he seems more focused on creating a couple of simple melodies instead of the gigantic orchestral scores in the first two films ( Such as the beautiful score when Lupin and Harry talk about his parents on the bridge ). Buckbeak's flight is also quite possibly the greatest scene in the series due to Williams's incredible score and the gorgeous grassy cinematography, being in stark contrast to Harry's previous life as a neglected cousin of the Dursley's, wheras now he can truly taste the freedom, and it results in a truly beautiful scene.Harry's interactions with Oldman & Thewles's characters are simply dripping of emotion due to its fantastic humane dialogue ( Result of a great screenplay ) and genuine character bonding, and it is truly wonderful how the series make you care about its characters, although The Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely the greatest entry of the series in this aspect.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
248,Sparrowmaniac,A Mature HP Movie,9,20 October 2004,"A great movie, by Cuaron. A mature tone setting which sets it out from its prequels. Although a major part from the book has been excluded, still the rest stands out as OUTSTANDING. Especially the scenes of the Marauder's Map. Also there are plenty of comedy in the movie. There is a hint of a budding romance between Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends. Also the sound and music of the movie is especially awesome. John Williams has left all of us spellbound by his ingenuinity. The portion where young Professor Lupin tells Potter about his parents is magnified by the outstanding slow background music. (A Window To The Past) And most important of all is the deadly ""villain"", Sirius Black, who also happens to Harry's godfather. Although this movie lacks Quidditch, it has Buckbeak the Hippogriff flying over the Lake in the Castle. Overall it's a definite must see for all HP fans.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
249,mcsheehey,The Best Potter Film: Alfonso Delivers,10,26 May 2007,"I had my doubts about this film when I learned that Alfonso Cuaron was to take the director's chair, but they proved to be completely irrational. This film is easily the best of the Potters, excelling in nearly every area. Alfonso brings a new, very spooky quality to the film franchise that was much needed. His new Hogwarts set is perfect for the third film, which was meant to be dark and different. For instance, the pumpkin patch and the ""floating"" walkway give off a very mystical and Halloween-ish aura. In addition, Cuaron and the set designers actually reinforced the themes of the film in every aspect. The newly designed gears and clock chime in the castle reinforce time, which is of utmost importance in the film. Also worth mentioning is the overall look of the characters and visuals.The special effects of the third film far surpass those of the first and second, erasing all traces of cheese and campiness. The Whomping Willow scene with Harry and Hermione looks incredibly real, and is very exciting. The dementors are also incredibly creepy looking, which is the perfect effect for them. I also liked what was done with the students themselves. Instead of walking around in their school robes and looking incredibly dorky, Harry, Hermione, and Ron dress and act like normal teens, simply thrust into the wizarding world. Their lines reinforce this as well. I found it especially comical when Hermione sees herself outside of Hagrid's hut, remarking ""Does my hair really look like that from the back?"" Overall, this third film is ingenious, blending fantasy spookiness with typical teen behavior. A masterpiece on nearly every level.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
250,thewillt08,Harry Potter 3 was Good Enough for Me,8,7 June 2013,"Part two of my Harry Potter reviews is a single review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie is very different from the previous two and also from the next five films. We have the same actors from the other two, the only real difference is the director. The director for this film is Alfonso Cuarón and he put his own directing style into the movie. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. He really is the major strength and weakness of the movie itself.Here we are, year three, and another year at Hogwarts is on the way, but a mass murderer named Sirius Black has escaped. Sirius Black is built as an evil character down to the core. You even see it in his name ""Black."" Black is a color that literally means evil and bad. He is accused of selling out the Potters to Voldemort. Now he is after Harry so Hogwarts is sort of on lockdown. That's our story but I think it was one of the most well written stories. In this movie we are introduced to a lot of new characters and animals. It is a different view of the magic world. There is a little less physical magic such as spells and potions and more of an abstract magic. We have Dementors, Buckbeak, the boggart, werewolves, and animagus' , and many other ways the magic world blows our minds. I like most of them but I have a few problems with the Dementors. First off, they are a complete rip off of the Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings. Rowling likes to take ideas from Tolkien and make a tiny difference. I don't like that and seeing it on screen just made me think of Frodo and the ring. Dementors are beings that wear all black and have a skeleton like appearance under the cloaks. They are really terrifying and symbolize fear and death. People feel cold when they are near and they suck the happy memories from people. It is a really good idea and it fits well with the film but the appearance could have been done differently. This is twice that Rowling rips off Tolkien and there are more on the way. Its frustrating to fans of movies and books. We are also introduced to Professor Lupin and he is one of my favorite characters throughout. He is a great character and a role model in Harry so in turn he is a role model to the audience. He was a childhood friend of the Potters and he teaches Harry how to fight the Dementors. He has a weird feeling and throughout the film I got the sense he was hiding something and he wasn't all he was showing. I knew this by following the pattern. All Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers have a major flaw and Lupin seemed too good to be true. This is the first movie not directed by Chris Columbus and this is almost a completely different movie. The color scheme is really different. It is very dark and most scenes are dark. He decides to have the kids wear regular street clothes a lot rather than the Hogwarts robes. He tries to be fun and funny a lot in the movie and most of the time it doesn't work. From the opening title sequence when Harry is trying to light up his wand and Uncle Vernon comes in and out of the room. It is supposed to be funny and I think he made too much of an effort to be comical in a simple title screen. We see it again with the shrunken head. Let's set the scene. Harry just made his aunt Marge into a balloon floating up in the sky, OK that was funny and I enjoyed it so touché, but Harry is emotionally torn and upset. He runs away from home and sees the creepy dog so he is sad, scared, and angry. Then the Knight Bus shows up and we hear about Sirius Black and how he is a murderer. All these negative emotions and feelings and it instantly turns to comedy with his one liners and unfunny comments to Ernie. The whole Knight Bus scene was a disaster and I wish it was done differently. Not all was a fail. I liked the scene when Marge was blown up and the buttons flew off and hit Dudley. It was funny and it worked. Same with Harry in the invisibility cloak and hitting Draco with snowballs and messing with Hermione and Ron. Little things like that made the movie better and added a nice touch to a very depressing and sad story arch. A big question in making the movie is how they will handle the big twist at the end and how mind bending the writing is. I think it was done brilliantly. Walking out it made me think how it actually happened. It was a different type of magic and the director nailed it perfectly. It had a plot hole or two but it makes the audience think and try to make sense of it so that's a good thing. The third book and movie is very significant in my opinion. It is different from all the rest mainly because Voldemort isn't that important. He is only mentioned a few times but he isn't a real threat. Sirius Black is the primary focus as the bad guy. I loved that. I like that there was another sense of evil in the world other than Voldemort. There was something else to fear and it made the world more real and believable. Overall, Harry Potter 3 is not a bad movie but it has a few flaws. The directing style is really well done but has a few things I did not like so Harry Potter 3 gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
251,bbbl67,"less comedic, more horrific",9,6 June 2004,"One thing that is immediately noticeable after the end of this third movie is that you just watched a movie with much less comedy in it. That's neither good nor bad, just different. Hope the kids don't get too scared.
A lot of stuff has been edited down to the bare minimum. One of the highlights of a Harry Potter movie is the Quidich match. In this one it is almost non-existent, none of the usual taunting that goes on between players on the opposite teams, etc. Just a very short scene concentrating on just the highlight battle of this match. Also a lot of the main supporting characters in the movie, the teachers, have much smaller roles here than before, such as Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Oh well, you can't always have every character show up all of the time.One highlight was the new Prof. Dumbledore, played this time by Michael Gambon. Gambon took over this role after the late Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the first two movies. Harris played Dumbledore like a kindly old grandfather. Gambon seems to play him more like a mischievous uncle. Different, yet still good.I think they did an excellent job with the time travel sequence at the end of the movie. I won't let too much more about it out, but they kept it very believable and consistent.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Harry Potter's universe was still full of surprises at this point and the films never failed to impress.

But it takes a bit of time till things really start moving. The final though is great, and full of good action.I had a problem with some weird scenes and conversations that simply did not make sense. I also found that the movie lacked a bit of atmosphere compared with some of the other parts. Also, I have been a bit disappointed that Voldemort has not been part of this movie. The big story around Harry Potter did barely move forward in this part. Beside that, the movie was less funny, and less witty than the 2nd part.

254,HanShotFirstGR,Mr. Cuaron's genius crafted a gem!,9,6 March 2021,"Plot:Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard.Analysis:Many years after I saw the first Harry Potter movie, I was still not a fan of what I saw and the second one although it was good, it didn't have anything to make me understand why this is such a popular franchise. Being 22 years old, I decided to give another chance to this whole universe and when I watched The Prisoner of Azkaban I was so glad about my choice. This is not just a good movie, it's a great one and a masterclass for directors. A dark themed, mature story, perfectly paced, well-acted from the majority of the cast and clearly a movie no one should miss. It's not a film to just convince you about Harry Potter franchise, but one to amaze you and earn your respect.Of course, a huge part of this success belongs to Alfonso Cuarón. This man directed only one Harry Potter movie and completely dominated the whole saga, this film is an example of perfect direction, it's beautiful, thrilling, intriguing and feels too perfect to be true. Every single second I was stunned by the amazing camerawork, the beautiful shots and the fascinating artistic choices mr. Cuarón did in this film. The dark tone is the most appropriate one to tell this story, cold colours and cloudy landscapes helped the movie have this serious, semi-depressing look to match the plot's theme. It's very hard to described something so beautiful and artistically precious that could make a boring screenplay into a cinematic success. With a little help from an interesting plot, Cuarón creates probably the best Harry Potter movie and sets the bar high for any other director who will try after his departure from the franchise. Much respect to a true artist who gave pure cinematic gold for the audience.The plot is quite interesting too, it's not mindblowing but it has a more personal connection to Harry and feels way more important than the previous ones. It's fast paced, well-developed and it doesn't feel confusing at all despite having very few filler scenes to give the audience time to process what is happenning. Every scene is meaningful, thrilling and there are no boring parts, the whole story has twists, action, clever thinking and some great character moments even for minor characters. Every little element proves that this one is definetely not a children's movie, the dementors that give the audience the essence of fear, the story about betrayal and someone who is looking for Harry, the constant feeling of uncertainty, this movie is one part fantasy-adventure and one part fantasy-thriller that brings out the best Harry Potter material possible.I am clearly not a fan of the books so I wouldn't be able to judge how accurate this film is, but adapting a book is always a tricky task, it needs someone very good to choose the most important parts, someone who can understand what details are important to maintain the continuity of the story and I can only guess that they did a very good job here. It doesn't even feel like a movie coming from a book, this could be the entire story and I would be totally satisfied. Their effort is a massive success and everyone that worked on this adaptation deserves the credits.The acting is constantly improving in these films, the kids are growing and getting better, Harry isn't an emotionless annoying child anymore and Daniel Radcliffe's age helped a lot, he studied and learned from his mistakes and his performance is much better and manages to not be anti climactic in a great movie. Emma Watson as always is fascinating, Rupert Grint was cool and Tom Felton was on point as he is in every single one of these films. But the older ones were once more the highlight, not just Michael Gambon's Dumbledore who really did everything correctly, but the magnificent Alan Rickman as professor Snape, Gary Oldman's breathtaking Sirius Black and David Thewlis as professor Lupin too. Fascinating work from a brilliant cast that definetely promises more great acting moments for the future.It's a movie that earned my respect and my attention for this franchise, it just feels totally right, it's entertaining and not childish at all, it develops the characters, it's funny and I can't help but be invested into this beauty of a film. It's not just J.K. Rowling's great imagination and Cuarón's talent in directing, but everyone's effort to produce a great result too.Conclusion:Definetely among the best Harry Potter films and although it's no Empire Strikes Back or The Return Of The King, it really shows why many people loved this universe and now I can understand and respect that. Although, some people might find some very few flaws I couldn't spot anything worth mentioning. It's a great movie and I can't wait to rewatch it many times.Rating: 9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
255,Soysoy,"Family movie with guts? Oh Oh, things look brighter...",8,23 April 2005,"I've read and heard many stories about Rowling wanting, before Columbus took charge, Gilliam as a director for a Harry Potter movie. Sure it would have been great... but didn't come true (as many dreams about the movie industry..).But hurray, miracles happen! With Alfonso Cuaron we have here the closest possible thing to a Gilliamesque version of HP given the circumstances. And the funny thing is it's not even with Gilliam's cinematographer Roger Pratt (who was actually responsible for the second HP's wonderful visuals, contrasting with the poor storytelling and awkward direction common to the first two movies). Michael Seresin (Alan Parker's cinematographer) was an excellent choice, and was quite up to the task. I was glad to see what he did with all these ambitious complicated ""dancing"" steadycam shots (very similar to Gilliam's and Jacksons') that Cuaron threw at him and the operators... The visuals are splendid. So is the pacing, which is the very best I've seen in a long time in a ""commercial"" movie. This pacing is like music. So much that Williams gives what may be his best work ever, probably because the editing had already done half the job for him... Excellent humour, too. This housekeeper at the door really got me, so did the ""book of monsters"", with a nod to Evil Dead III's ""flying Necronomicon""... Actually nods to cult movies are everywhere if you take the time to look for them (noticed the character out of ""Young Frankenstein"" for example?)...All in all a very, very enjoyable movie for almost everyone, pop-corn eaters and (non-snobbish) cinephiles alike.Are these cynical executives actually learning, at last? The mass-consumption movie production seems to make sensible steps towards a reasonably intelligent and tasteful approach of cinema for the masses... Jackson hired for LOTR, Raimi for Spiderman, Singer for X-men, Cuaron for HP, Gilliam for Brothers Grimm... signs of the times? I certainly hope so.It was more than time that real storytellers and real movie makers get these ""big money"" jobs. Now there is a -tiny- chance that the movie industry starts producing blockbusters with taste and brains.Cuaron, my god, such a gift for pacing and liveliness, for energy and precision, bravo, bravissimo, I'll go and rent every movie from this guy. Now to be a GREAT director, he should get more involved with the inner world of the characters... Here, only Thewlis really ""gets through"" (sorry: Pam Ferris does too actually). The rest of the cast, well, look like.. well... actors doing their job. Could be on purpose, though. I'll have to look at Cuaron's previous works to know for sure.8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
256,GTeixeira,Visually excellent book adaptation; a darker turn for the series,8,14 August 2013,"The third film of the 'Harry Potter' franchise, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a very good fantasy film dealing with wizardry (though, if you are to watch this, you already know what 'Harry Potter' is about). With the change in direction, this film marks a deviation from the more childish style of Chris Columbus first two films, with a darker, more sinister tone employed by Alfonso Cuaron.Following their tradition, however, HP3 is visually terrific and has excellent special effects; in addition to Hogwarts enchanting visage, we now also have the Hogsmeade village to thank for the good photography. Also, much more of Hogwarts is explored now too; even in the books it feels as if we know very little of the place, despite all that happens.The creatures, like Buckbeak and the wraith-like Dementors, bring an eerie brilliance to the screen whenever they appear. Some of their appearances late in the film are great to watch; actually, most of the late portion of the film is excellent.The adult cast is excellent. Michael Gambon respectfully stands to the task of substituting Richard Harris, and both David Thewlis and Gary Oldman (excellent casting choices, by the way) shine in their scenes. The returners from the first two (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffiths and Robbie Coltrane, among others) also bring good performances again. Alan Rickman, in special, is excellent; his interactions with Thewlis are some of the movie's best. Emma Thompson is also present now, though she adds little (her character was one of the least interesting to me, and her acting was rather uneventful).The younger cast is the same as before, though admittedly more mature (keeping to the tone of the film). Emma Watson is excellent as a more serious Hermione, a truly promising actress; Rupert Grint is likable and funny, truly capturing the book's image of Ron; and Tom Felton does a good job as Draco (the character's flaws are the same as the books, nothing he could correct).I am not as sure of Daniel Radcliffe, though. He is more mature, and by now it's difficult to think of Harry without thinking of him as the character, but he still lacks a lot in the acting department. There are many good moments that end up lacking in the emotional aspect thanks to his weak acting; he never makes it work on sad, emotional scenes (when he is supposed to be crying, for example), and his facial expressions are often too overdone to the point of hilarity.'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a remarkable screen adaptation that knows how to play the book's strengths while keeping true to its source (though unfortunately also keeping the book's weaknesses). Knowledge of the first two films/books of the franchise is needed, yes, but that is no problem as the franchise is a very enjoyable one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
257,Andreas_N,Highlight of the series,8,18 November 2005,"Another rating point above part two, so a solid 9 for me. This is my favorite movie of all four of the series. There are basically two main reasons for that. The time-travel sequence had me on the edge of my seat, I was stunned by the complexity and the brilliancy of how this aspect was presented, how it fitted to the scene before and how it was generally linked. That made it for me. The second reason was the complex storyline, in particular the new character of Mr. Lupin, Harry's teacher, and the way he and Sirius Black turned into animals as one of the movies highlights. Also the map of the castle with the mysterious footprints was just utter genius! Harry's fight against the ""Dementor""-guys was a very powerful sequence, when you consider him being emotionally so much involved here, when he created that shield with the memories of his parents. When I look into Harry's eyes there, I can almost feel how much he struggles with his fear and how powerful his magical skills are. Again, my favorite of the series. Just think of the wonderful animal Harry and Hermione save, what an eye-catcher.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
258,de_niro_2001,Getting Darker,10,1 December 2007,"When I first saw this, like most people I saw how the children are getting older. The first two films were good but this film is better. Some say that Harry shows his dark side when he takes revenge on Aunt Marge by blowing her up like a balloon but I personally was completely on his side after what she said about his parents. The scene with the Knight Bus is great. But the films are getting more sinister. A case in point is when the train is halted on the Glenfinnan Viaduct, everything goes dark and the Dementors are on the train. Harry's flight over Hogwarts and Loch Shiel on Buckbeak is spectacular. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot and the pace never flags. This film has definitely set the pattern for the rest of the series. A really good one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
259,MsMovie,A good movie  but it leaves out so much of the book!,9,5 June 2004,"If you are a Harry Potter fan without the benefit of reading the books, then I am sure you really enjoyed this latest movie, and perhaps thought it was the best of the trio so far. Most of the fans of the books have said the same thing to me, they were a little disappointed at how much was left out.Having said that I am not comparing the movie to a book for the purpose of this review, so I will say the special effects were outstanding as always  I don't know how they achieve a lot of what is on screen, especially the flying Hippogriff, but it is so seamless that you really don't think it's a special effect at the time, it's only after that you think back on how good the effects were.I would have preferred there to be more subplots in the story, as there certainly were more in the book, but for some reason they left them out.The young actors are growing up in their roles, and I didn't find there was anything wrong with their acting at all, although some people have made comments about their accents being hard to understand. Obviously these people are not British because the accents are not at all hard to understand, but to someone non-British they could be  much in the same way as I struggled to understand some of the accents in Cold Mountain, etc.I think in the next movie I would like there to be more interaction with the adult actors  especially the best ones, like Snape and Hagrid, and perhaps for it not to be quite so dark (I don't mean evil-dark, I just mean dull-dark!).I gave this movie a 9 out of 10  it was exactly what I wanted and expected, and I enjoyed it greatly, I can't wait for November 2005 now for The Goblet of Fire!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
260,Teknofobe70,The best one yet!,6,6 April 2005,"It's a peculiar thing. The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was written by the same author ... adapted by the same screenwriter ... played by the same cast ... so why the hell is it so much better than the previous two? The answer, of course, lies in the change of director. Mr Columbus, I don't want to hurt your feelings but ... you suck. The arrival of foreign director Alfonso Cuarón has saved the franchise for me, just when I was about ready to give up on the whole series of films. The problem was that I could see the potential of the books, which had thus far not been realised on film. They just had no magic about them at all. But this latest offering from Hogwarts has plenty of that magic to spare.The colour palette for the movie is suddenly all dark shades of blue and green, a stark contrast to the browney-orangey memories I have of the first two -- and it suits the mood of the film so much better. And remember all those tedious sequences that you hated in the other two movies (i.e. the Dursley household, Dumbledore's office)? Well, in this one either they're cut short or they're done in an interesting way.Also, the dialogue is considerably less clunky, even though it's written by the same people and spoken by the same actors. Either Cuarón fiddled with the script a little, or he taught the kids how to act. It certainly appears so, as the three child stars who failed to be convincing in the previous movies have suddenly learned their craft a whole lot better. The new arrivals, notably Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, are somewhat unusually cast in their roles, but both come off extremely well.One criticism of the film is that it may be a little confusing to those who haven't read the books. Whereas the previous two movies had those tedious dialogue sequences which explained everything that happened, this one sacrifices those to save the pace of the film. I only wish that Cuarón had signed on to direct the next installment, and then I could honestly say ""The Goblet of Fire"" is one of my most anticipated movies of the coming years.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
261,cwrdlylyn,"PRISONER OF AZKABAN : Stylistically Superior, Though The Storyline Underwhelms",8,26 May 2006,"HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN The third installment of the Harry Potter franchise represented a re-birth of sorts for the series b/c new creative blood was brought in. Alfonso Cuaron took over the director's chair from Christopher Columbus... resulting in the first Harry Potter ""film"", as opposed to the Harry Potter ""movies"" we'd seen already.With the new vision of Cuaron, the movie feels more magical and real. Columbus' films seemed to always pull back and capture Hogwarts on a grand, blockbuster scale. Any moment that called for special effects or some sort of magic, Christopher Columbus seems to fall to the predictable conclusion of tacking on special effects. In this film however, Cuaron finds a way to capture some of Hogwart's magic on a very personal, simplistic scale... and as a result it resonates in a much stronger way. For example, when a character turns into a werewolf at the very end (a scene that Colubmus would have filmed from a distance capturing the special effects) chooses to zoom in on the eye and have the transformation start there. It's a simple choice... however it is that kind of bold decision making that Columbus lacked in the first 2 films.PRISONER OF AZKABAN tells the story of Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts. When he arrives he discovers that Sirius Black, the man who killed his parents, is the first person to ever escape from Azkaban prison... and he is now out to kill Harry Potter. Do to the danger, Hogwarts is protected by Azkaban's guards... the Dementors... and the staff is on high alert. However, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermoine can not help but investigate the story behind Sirius Black and what they find isn't what the expected.As I've said already, the main strengths of this film lie in the direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Also enjoyable is the addition of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman as Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black. Their camaraderie especially in the final moments of the film is very compelling.Despite the film's superior direction, it still lags at points in the middle. This section spends a lot of time giving the younger actors and their characters more depth... exploring the tension Harry feels towards his parents' murdered, exploring Hermoine's situation as a Muggle. What hurts this section so much is that the young actors just don't deliver. While the performances were merely aspects of the spectacle in the earlier films... here, thanks to Cuaron's more introspective eye, the performances become more vital. Unfortunately, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermoine don't seem quite ready to play the scenes as naturally and realistically as they should be.Also, the storyline of PRISONER OF AZKABAN doesn't feel as complete as the earlier two films. AZKABAN works much better then the other two in terms of developing character and getting the ball rolling for more compelling films later in the series... however as a film it doesn't stand on it's own quite as well as the others.Despite that fact, HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is still a highly entertaining film. And once the action really gets rolling near the films climax it get really good. In the end, thanks to Cuaron, AZKABAN is a great improvement stylistically over the other films and a great transition into the next films.... B+ ...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
262,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,9,4 June 2004,"For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe  The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans.The story once again follows the adventures of young Harry Potter, now a teenager, just as he is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After an incident in which Mr. Dursley's snobbish sister, Marge, is blown up like a balloon after angering Harry, the wizard in training goes on the run and catches a ride aboard a bus, on which he hears about the new danger that threatens his life. For the first time, a man has escaped from Azkaban prison, the place where the wizardry world's most notorious criminals are held and Sirius Black is no different. Word going around was that he was once a trusted friend of the Potter family but unbeknownst to them he was following the dark path of Lord Voldemort, which led him to betray the Potters and reveal to the dark lord their whereabouts. Though Voldemort's following is long since disbanded, his time in Azkaban prison has led him to go mad, swearing to return to the wizard world and finish the task that his master was unable to do  by killing Harry Potter. With Black on the loose and young Harry attending school, dementors, evil creatures which guard Azkaban prison, have descended upon Hogwarts in an effort to capture the madman. But instead of presenting Harry with a finer sense of security, they present a darker threat to him, one in which he must find the light within himself to uncover additional clues needed to unlock his mysterious past. The story for Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban presents not only a continuation of the Harry Potter plot line but is successfully able to mature its stylization and atmosphere along the same lines as the series' continually aging audience. As with the previous two films, the Prisoner of Azkaban never once feels dragged on longer then it should or hurried up too quickly. It leaves the audience feeling at the end as it should, not longing to continue this particular storyline, but anticipating an entirely new adventure in the next adaptation.Though a considerable amount of the cast members from the previous two Potter outings have returned, the younger actors and actresses have gone through a considerable change, namely puberty. This doesn't hurt their performances in any way and actually contributes significantly to the idea of the series of films maturing along with its characters and audience. Daniel Radcliffe's performance will obviously be the one most critics will focus on out of all of the children and they should see a heightening sense of his acting abilities especially as he becomes ever more accustomed to the character he is playing. Depending on whether he will stick around or not, as well as the question of whether there will be, a seventh film, Radcliffe should be able to present one hell of a performance then and his maturing actions can be seen in this film. The most notable addition to the cast, at least to fans of the film series, would Michael Gambon taking on the role of Professor Dumbledore after the recent passing of venerable acting talent Richard Harris. Though his performance doesn't quite match up to Harris', Gambon gives it his best shot and maintains a certain level of charm about the character that had been seen in the previous features. Gary Oldman, notorious for his villainous roles in movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Air Force One, slips perfectly into the role of Sirius Black. The only disappointing aspect to his character is that not nearly enough of him is shown in the film as much as the advertisements imply. This isn't necessarily a bad mark against the film, it's actually quite reasonable considering the source on which the film is based on  it's just an annoyance. And Alan Rickman, reprising the role of Professor Snape, presents another amusing performance, though not as seen as the character had been in the previous features.Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron picks up right where Columbus left off but, in the process, stylizes the third adaptation to his own specifications and presents the most mature and darkly toned Potter film yet to grace the screen, which, in the end, makes it all the more spellbinding. With that in mind, those parents whose younger children were little more then skittish through Chamber of Secrets will have greater difficulty getting them through Prisoner of Azkaban despite the shorter time length. The best option is to view the film for yourself prior to finalizing a decision as to whether your child should see it in theaters or wait for them to mature and catch when it arrives on DVD over Christmas break. The dementors alone are enough to creep out even the most confident of adult viewers  what do you think they will do to a sensitive six year old? The rest of the film comes complete with 'jump' moments, murky atmosphere, and ominous musical score which are more then enough to set a little child up for some sleepless nights. So for the most beneficial viewing experience for both the child and the movie-going audience around them please take proper precautions prior to venturing out to the local Cineplex this summer. This is not to say that the film is a horribly frightful experience  in fact for teenagers and young adults it should be quite an entertaining film, with a wonderful blend of slight humor, eerie chills and whimsical fantasy. The only major flaw seen in the film is the level of confusion that is presented when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and the truth about Sirius Black is revealed. It's hard to describe without giving anything away but when it does appear in the film, relatively near the end, be sure to pay attention to details and actions of the characters or else it will leave slightly confused as to what is exactly going on. Other then that, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fails in its attempt at being one of the bigger surprises of the summer, especially for those who enjoyed the previous two films, but succeeds at being one of the more enjoyable experiences of the season.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
263,husnain_05,The best Harry Potter movie.,9,17 December 2005,"Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban is the best Harry Potter movie and the scariest as well. It was nice to hear that it won 9 awards (more than Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets as it was better).Harry Potter's godfather is in the prison of azkaban and people think he is bad when he is not.This movie was great and I love the part when Hermoine punches Malfoy and I also like the part when Harry Potter goes invisible and throws snowballs at Malfoy,Crabbe and Goyle because they are bullying Ronald Weasly and Hermoine Granger. My favourite characters are Ron and Harry and I think Malfoy is good at playing his part.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
264,FilmFan777,"Weak, Un-Enchanting",5,4 June 2004,"I'll simply say, the story was full of holes like a piece of swiss cheese... there was no feel or sense of danger, darkness, anticipation, worry or magical enchantment as the other's possessed before it.
The script was weak as well as the directing and I found myself looking far too much at my watch for when it was going to end. I really didnt feel any redeeming qualities for this film. The actors being a bit older having something to do with it? Different director? I'm not sure if the writer was the same or not yet I could really feel the difference in all aspects of the film. To be fair, there were a hefty handfull of others at the midnight showing and many of them were laughing. I dont know if it was due the booze or the dizzyness of being so late on a thursday night or if they are just die hard Potterins that anticipated so much that anything would have been entertaining for them. Yet there were a few we knew for sure that thought some of it to be lack luster and lifeless as we did. I believe that and other things had something to do with it, not being just one thing.
I believe overall, Harry Potter has lost it's magic.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It made the scenes such as Harry riding the hippogriff breathtaking.I've seen and enjoyed the first two movies of the ""Harry Potter"" series.  I haven't read one word of the books.  But after seeing ""POA"", I now want to read the books.  More so, I'm curious to know how author J.K. Rowling will finish the series.  I read speculation on the fate of Harry Potter and it got me to speculate too.I believe Emma Watson's performance as Hermione will influence Ms. Rowling in the direction she takes the rest of the books.  Hermione shows off ""grrl power"" far in excess of the often-played clip of her punching Malfoy.

267,kismit,More of the same,6,10 June 2004,A little disappointing after some of the really good reviews this film got. I saw it a week after Shrek 2 and it pales in comparison. The three main characters are a little older and instead of being impressive child actors they seem little more than average. By the next sequel the two boys will have trouble playing their characters ages. It really had the feel of a Walt Disney TV movie. Kind of a jazzed up Bednobs and Broomsticks. Still the demographic it is aimed at is 13 year olds and it should continue to impress that age group. I would still recommend it for 16 year olds and under but DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE! It is not as good as the first film and you will probably be disappointed if you go in expecting that.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

269,segacs,Good as a film but missing some crucial details,7,9 June 2004,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But the director had a monumental challenge in adapting a book that most fans have read dozens of times and memorized down to the tiniest detail. Of course, even the slightest deviation from the book was going to be met with aghast cries from the Potter-obsessed. So instead of trying to cram everything into the movie, Cuaron went for style instead and tried to transplant his own vision, instead of Rowlings's, to the screen.For the most part he succeeded. I especially liked how the three main characters - wearing street clothes - had more natural interaction and seemed more like regular teenagers. And the visual effects and scenery were stunning.But there were some major plot holes that weren't explained, namely, the history of the Maurauders' Map everything that goes along with that, including the friendship between Harry's father and the other three. I found that that alone stopped this movie from being as good as it could have been.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I sat through the first two movies and found them OK but in large I remained indifferent to them.BUT THIS MOVIE RULES!!!!!! It's hard to say what exactly I enjoyed about the movie. Quirky, offbeat characters brilliantly portrayed by the whole cast and a darker (but not too much) atmosphere about it along with great creatures (Do you know what a Hippogriff is? Neither did I!) and a clever story (one of the best time travel sequences I can remember, up there with BILL & TED) all contribute to a highly watchable, entertaining movie which I would highly recommend to anyone!!! To all the other Harry Potter dodgers: take a chance on this film, you won't regret it! MISCHIEF MANAGED!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
271,Tyson14,Magical,10,17 August 2014,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is easily my favourite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.With that in mind, ""Azkaban"" is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favourite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humour of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.In terms of the technical aspects, ""Azkaban"" also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for ""Azkaban"" is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for ""Azkaban,"" has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in ""Azkaban"" many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter. Part of the magic of the books is that they give us new wonders to enjoy, and finally we have a film that weaves the very same spell.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
272,dineshaishu,Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban,5,21 May 2019,"If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms.

275,RecoWilliams,Harry Potter and The Prisoner of ME!,6,1 July 2004,"I must say I expect a lot from the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. One thing that concerned me before I went that critics who gave HP1 and HP2 low ratings were now giving HP3 raving reviews.(To all of you Die Hard Harry Potter fans I warn you in advance that this review may be disturbing to your spirit) :)After seeing the movie I must say I was a little disappointed. I know that focus of this movie was a little more darker and now the kids of the movie were now going through puberty but this movie lacks something. First of all it was not as light as the first two movies. Even in scenes were the kids were simply having fun the movie was two dark. But I say it was too dark, because they went for the PG-13 rating (for the kids) instead of making it the fun loving Horror movie that this installment was crying out for.Another thing that concerned me was that J.K.R. gave this movie the thumbs up. Is she not as brilliant as we once assumed. Because as I writer I would have fough harder for the essence of the book to show through in this book.The absolute best thing about this movie was the justaposition of Harry dealing with his own personal demons (Dementors). This movie will do well, because HP has such a huge cult following. But one more movie like this and the HP fans will simply be nerds like the obsessed Stars Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek fans. God forbid that happens. This was the first franchise movie in a while that had a young and old multiracial following, but I felt that was neglected in this movie.I was honestly bored throughout parts of this movie. Oh my GOD they could have shelled out money for a good score. My little brother could have a better score with his 32 key keyboard. It's not liek they don't have the money. I've heard that this new director won 't be a part of HP4 so hopefully the new director doensn't choose to follow in his footsteps because of th critial acclaim.I give this movie a 6 out of 10.

Say, they did not like the strange werewolf, all sorts of jokes-jokes, interspersed by the director in addition to the script, and in addition to all the claims they discovered the disappearance of the atmosphere of magic, because of which the popular expression of ""Quaron in the furnace"" was born.The second group, on the contrary, furiously began to praise Cuaron, extolling him to the unprecedented pedestal of fame, thus creating almost a cult of personality. They liked everything that only they could like in the third film.Only now it became clear that both sides are not right in their convictions. So it should be, movies must be different in essence. The error crept in from the very beginning: Chris Columbus took the first two films, and this put the old debate on what kind of movies Harry Potter should be about. Columbus did not have to give the right to shoot two films, and one would suffice. Spectators are used to the atmosphere of the first two films, because most of the audience took the innovative approach of Quaron to the screen version of the third novel with bayonets. Now the producers make a mistake again - they give the right to shoot two films (The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince) to the new director David Yates. This should not be done in any case. It is necessary to preserve the diversity of director's visions. Hogwarts is not accidentally depicted in different ways in films, like Hogsmeade. Everything in novels is seen differently every time, because all the reader and viewer sees through the eyes of Harry Potter, and in films through the prism of the director's vision, the viewer must perceive the magical world through the eyes of a young wizard.
Alfonso Cuaron still hit the spot with his timely vision of the plot of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""He created a sparkling tragicomedy for the growing up of a young wizard.In general, Cuaron's film reminds me of our old Soviet films. For the reason that the whole film can be easily taken away on the shots, quotes, fragments, heroes, soundtracks, etc., etc.
Despite everything, this film is much kinder than the previous two, differing in their gloomy Gothic style. It's more fun, crazy, and it should be, because it's Sirius Black himself on the scene!For the whole of Rowling's novel, like the film of Quaron, is a tribute to the memory of the crazy, hooliganistic and such lonely Sirius Black ... Black, whose heart is beating violently, hot blood flows in his veins, and in the soul is truly dog devotion.
The third film, as well as the film, is dedicated to the looters - James Potter (= Harry Potter), Peter Pettigrew, Rimus Lupine and Sirius Black - a group of friends who used to be friends a long time ago ...The film ruthlessly shows how easy it is to lose friendship and how difficult it is to acquire a friend ...Thanks to Alfonso Cuaron, who did a talented work, showing in one stroke all the huge gallery of the characters of the magical world and their essence: the Minister of Magic plunges into a puddle; the soothsayer with big glasses on her nose stumbles on her own table; The evil teacher Severus Snape closes the children from the werewolf; eccentric Dumbledore slams his hand over Ron's gnarled leg; Remus Lupine, at the lesson, takes a snack with an apple; portraits of Hogwarts, it turns out, also like to sleep; Stan Shanpike with his brave words is not very strong in dragging student suitcases; Hagrid and ties are incompatible things; Tom from the Leaky Cauldron has a nehyl auto; Ernie, wearing spectacles with large lenses, is led by the ""Night Knight""; Sirius Black finally began to talk moral nonsense ...
Also it is necessary to thank the new actors, so successfully merged into the old line-up:Emma Thompson (Sibyl Trelawney); Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore); David Thulis (Remus Lupine); Julie Christie (Madame Rosmerta); Gary Oldman (Sirius Black); Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew) and many others. By the way, if my memory does not change me, then the two actors from the third film (cleaning woman in the bar ""Leaky Cauldron"" and Aunt Marge) Quaron quietly consigned to his other project - ""Child of Man"", but that's another story ...Let me love the fourth film about Harry Potter (director - Mike Newell), but I always revise the Curaron part - it is the brightest of all existing.In a word, long live Rowling and Cuaron!""Potter, come back!""

The plot isn't as riveting, the kids aren't as ""cute"", and the special effects start to get too ""digital"". And the magic isn't as plausible.As a fan of Robert Hardy, it was nice to see him as Fudge, even if his role was minor at this point. We knew Mark Williams from the ""Father Brown"" series, and liked him in his red hair! And I think I prefer Gambon as Dumbledore.So while not as strong as the first two films, not as depressing as the ones that follow.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
278,~AleXa~,Somewhat lacking,6,5 June 2004,"I went into this movie aware of the fact that the 3rd book was a bit darker and different than the first two, but I still came out disappointed. (And FYI, I haven't read any of the books, so please excuse my inability to compare.)As such, I had no qualms with the movie being a bit darker, for that was a welcome change and a way to take the series to a new level. But my first overwhelming thought was that the movie seemed very choppy, like a segment would start and I'd think it would be building to something and then it'd jump somewhere else, and I kept thinking, 'when is something significant going to happen?' It also seemed as if it was dumbed down a notch, almost as if several subplots were left out so as not to confuse us. But nonetheless, I still wound up being confusing with the whole 'Serious Black isn't actually the bad guy' reversal. It was so abrupt, if you blinked, you'd miss it. And personally, while the back-in-time thing was well-written, I felt it was a bit beneath the intelligence of the series (and yes, I realize it was in the book, so I don't suppose one can fault the movie for that).On the whole, there was nothing really extraordinary in the film. Sure, it had it's moments, such as the seasons changing as the owl's flying and I really liked the Hippogriff, but to me the CG looked a bit different and on the whole it had a very different feel, and while I'm sure that can be contributed to the new director having a different style, it didn't seem to encompass that lasting quality that the first two had.I think the biggest disappointed to me was that I was kinda glad when the movie was over. There weren't any parts that I particularly enjoyed, nothing that stood out. I think my biggest enjoyment was seeing the characters older and the young actors growing in their abilities. Ultimately, I went into the movie not expecting much and came out feeling like I'd done little more than see the characters two years older.6.5 out of 10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
279,Sparrow_in_flight,"A bit disappointing *spoilers, in a way*",9,12 June 2004,"First off, it was definitely not as creepy as the trailer made it seem. And secondly, I was a bit disappointed that the whole moral of this book seemed to have been lost in the writing of the script. What happened to Hagrid's talk to Harry and Ron about friends being more important than broomsticks or rats? I have nothing against the acting in this film, except for that of the man playing Pettigrew. Ugh. i couldn't wait for him to get off the screen. Partly because makeup had really overdone making him look like a rat, and partly because he just didn't make a great Wormtail in my eyes. Otherwise, great acting all around.What I disliked were the cuts from the book (better Marauder's Map explanation, Hagrid's lecture,Hermione and Harry fighting, etc), and the rearranging of scenes (like the Firebolt), as well as some of the building upon the book. What, may I ask, was the purpose of the shrunken heads? They became annoying very quickly, though I suppose some may find them funny. Just as the effects of the dementors was tiring after a bit. I realize that it was done to better convey the affect dementors have on living people, showing the iciness externally, since you can't really see the characters feeling it internally. But I'm sorry - it was used too much. And it wasn't too convincing when you realize that while the window on the train iced over and so did the flowers by the school, nothing iced or frosted over when the dementors attacked Harry and Sirius. Nothing.I did like the movie, for there were some creative additions (the candy, the clock and bridge, Hermione calling werewolf Lupin away). As a film, it was good. As an adaptation, it did a fairly poor job as it failed to capture the moral of the book, though it grasped the coming-of-age idea a bit, and failed to explain some things, leaving them instead to be done better in later films, thereby cutting time away from those plots.I would like to end with the statement that I think Micheal Gambon filled Dumbledore's shoes nicely.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
280,HollisWoods,All time Favorite in the Franchise!,10,12 August 2021,"Prisoner of Azkaban is a major fan favorite in the Harry Potter fandom. This is ultimately due to the godlike aesthetic the film has. The coloring has much darker and bluer tones than the first films. The lighting is also way darker, reflecting the darker tones of the story. The music carries a different kind of magical enchantment compared to John Williams' early work in the franchise. And the costumes are altered completely, also adding to a new freshness that we see in the 3rd movie.Alfonso Cuaron essentially delivers one of the most unique Harry Potter experiences we've ever witnessed. All the aesthetic came from his creative input. He understood that the 3rd installment needed to see character growth of the main characters, and he worked with the cast on that. He brought on the idea that each character has a specific design of wands, rather than all wands looking the same. Everything about Prisoner of Azkaban stands out against the other movies and is such a huge tonal shift in the series. I'm absolutely in love with it. Thank you, Alfonso!After carrying the first two chapters, Chris Columbus passes the torch onto Cuaron. He acts as a producer here, then departs from the franchise altogether. This is also the last we see of John Williams. Though he went out with a bang as this is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time from him. And Hedwig's theme, of course, continues it's reign as the iconic theme song in future installments.Prisoner of Azkaban also saw a few first appearances by some legendary actors portraying iconic characters. Now Remus Lupin is my favorite character of all time and I will never get over David Thewlis's portrayal of him. I read the books and all I hear is his voice. The Prisoner himself, Sirius Black, is played by none other than Gary Oldman. A dissertation can be written about his career and talent. It's such a joy seeing him in these movies. We also get a new Dumbledore, as unfortunately Richard Harris passed away between films. Harris was the calm and soft spoken Dumbledore we all know in love. However, Michael Gambon comes into the 3rd film and brings that sense of loony air that Harris didn't have. There's a big debate about Gambon's performance, which I'll bring up again in my Goblet of Fire review. But in Prisoner of Azkaban, Gambon is fantastic.Well Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite, not just in the films, but the books as well. This is the only year where some form of Voldemort isn't lurking in the background building up some diabolical way to kill Harry. It does, however, revolve around the story of the Marauders, which is the most heartbreaking tale of friendship ever (and a bit of inspiration to the folks of Tumblr). Just look at their story from Lupin's eyes, specifically, and then throw his friendship with Harry in the mix as he tries to learn more about what happened that one fateful night. Their story is legendary, and I still want to know more about it. Their mischief levels were apparently only rivaled by that of Fred and George. And in the middle was love and acceptance of each other. This is a common theme through Harry's story, a theme that begins in the generation before him.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
281,aingmire-26563,The best so far.,9,17 August 2021,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a great sequel and an improvement. The acting is a lot better and the ending is just so wholesome. The plot is very well structured and the pacing is great.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
282,Lee-107,Superbus Totalus! THE Best adaptation of a Harry Potter book!,10,30 November 2007,"I consider myself quite a Potter-maniac. I have seen each of the films based on the novels over and over again and I consider this adaptation of 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to be THE Best! Everything about this film just brings the world of Harry Potter to life more vividly, more convincingly and more movingly - from the Knight Bus, the Dementors, the Marauder's Map, Shrieking Shack, Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and of course, the eponymous Prisoner of Azkaban Sirius Black, is brought to life so well that it's an unforgettable experience! Of course, I do personally think that 'Azkaban' as a novel itself is leaps and bounds better than the previous two novels Rowling wrote. Compared to 'Sorcerer's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets', 'Azkaban' inherently is so fast-paced, action-packed and thrilling that a movie based on it HAD to be good! How could it not?! And yet, this film exceeds expectations... Even the soundtrack for 'Azkaban' is way better and plentiful than in the previous 2 films. The Harry Potter theme given by John Williams, the theme with which this film opens, is one of my most favorite movie themes. I cannot praise John Williams enough for composing that theme... The moment you hear it, you're just transported to that magical world of Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Hagrid and co! I don't think anyone could've composed a better theme to encapsulate the sheer magic of Harry Potter! One of the things that they brought really well to life was the Marauder's Map - it was just so well done! I mean, even when you read the novel you have a fair enough mental picture of the map, but when you see it in the film, you're like, ""Wow! Excellent!"" The Dementors were appropriately creepy and scary - the train sequence again was superb! The Harry, Ron, Hermoine trio was very good - Daniel, Rupert and Emma have all done very well. Both Daniel and Emma are especially brilliant in the entire time-turning sequence. Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney was just adorable! Great choice! Gary Oldman is superb as Sirius Black! Lupin is one of those characters every Potter fan has a soft corner for and fortunately David Thewlis as Lupin is very good and very Lupin-ish :) In all this is certainly my favorite adaptation of a HP novel. I had equal hopes from 'Goblet of Fire' and 'Order of the Phoenix' but was left quite disappointed. I just hope 'Half-blood Prince' is good... I wished Alfonso Cuaron directed one more Potter film. I wished they had given 'Half-blood Prince' to him instead of David Yates... For 'Deathly Hallows', they should have an online poll from fans about the choice of director and I really would not be surprised if most choose Alfanso Cuaron!

284,sourapple,"finally, a Harry Potter film with sense!",9,11 June 2004,"I am a Harry Potter book fan. And I also loved the first two movies. But the problem with the first two movies was that it was too detailed. I don't mind scriptwriters butchering a novel just as long as its justified. And this Harry Potter is a perfect example.It's a longer book, but Alfonso Cuaron has managed to cut it in 2 hours (and something minutes) with such beauty. While watching the film, I thought I was viewing a ""computer-graphics-infused art film"". Cinematography was brilliant. I wouldn't say Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a masterpiece, but it has shed it's child-like ""commercialized"" coating found on the first movie. Definitely a great improvement. It's darker, has more sense than the first two movies and definitely a feast for the eyes. And you have to admit, it's funnier!!!!The only problem is will the next director succeed in Mr. Cuaron's version of Harry Potter? Hopefully, it would meet the fans (especially MY) expectations :D (spoiler) One negative note is that there's too much chopping of scenes in the last part. I was extremely disappointed that they also left out the Quidditch championship. But in all, it was a good entertaining movie.Characters: They are such beautiful people. Great casting. This is what makes Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban stand out. The cast. Daniel Radcliffe has shown much growth in his acting. Compare his acting from Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, and you'll see what I mean. Maggie Smith's role was minimal. More on Snape, Lupin and Sirius.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
285,colettesplace,The best of the Harry Potter films so far,8,17 December 2004,"This third Harry Potter film is the best one yet. Director Alphonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, A Little Princess) has taken over from Chris Columbus and has stuck less slavishly to the original JK Rowling Books.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass.

Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.Great performances from Emma Thompson hamming it up as the ditsy professor of foretelling, Prof Trelawny, Michael Gambon as the new Professor Dumbledore (not as magical but good), David Thewliss as Prof Lupin, and Gary Oldman as the Prisoner of Azkhaban.Thrilling, complex, menacing, ****/***** stars.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
286,Snappy207,One of (if not) the Best!,9,14 August 2021,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a beautiful movie that perfectly encapsulates the wizarding world in which a constantly engaging story unfolds. The new director brought to the table was an amazing choice and not only did the CGI and cinematography improve to the ""good"" range, but the bad acting present in the first two films of the series is now almost completely gone.The pacing was jarringly better after coming from the chamber of secrets, constantly engaging although not necessarily action, and I think that's for the better. It gives time to understand more of the story and a breather in-between. (The long no-cut shots and editing were very nice too.)
The dementors are one of my favorite fictional creatures and through just looking at the logo change alone, you can tell the series has made a welcome, yet darker turn. The soundtrack brought in was amazing too, not as good as the goblet of fire but a nice change from the copious repeats in the second film.Although it is not perfect, small annoyances such as a comical tree scene (you will know what I am talking about when you see it) and one cliche bird flight with the addition of various unavoidable plot holes inbuilt to the foundations of the harry potter saga, all brought this from a 10/10 to 9/10.Overall a must watch if you have seen the first two harry potter movies even if you did not like them.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
287,sanddragon939,The best of the series so far...truly an 'atmospheric' film...,10,12 July 2009,"If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the true coming of age story for both Harry and for the series in general, then Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the spiritual coming of age for the series; something which the film adaptation emphasizes subtly but brilliantly. The story itself is a departure from the previous two books; both Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were all Harry and his friends exploring all the wonders of the wizarding world, specifically Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. True, there WERE villains to fight and challenges to overcome and danger, but basically, for all intents and purposes, the first two books are very well-written and elaborate children's fantasy books. Prisoner of Azkaban is different; there is a constant atmosphere of depression, of darkness and evil lingering in the air. Harry is no longer a small innocent child opened up to a world of wonder; he is instead a young teenager filled with emotion, at one point prepared to kill a man he is convinced was responsible for his parents death. Such fantastic elements and trappings as a flying car, a three-headed dog or a giant chessboard are traded in for werewolves and Dementors, the latter personifying the atmosphere of evil and darkness lurking over Hogwarts and over Harry in particular. If the book is a departure from its predecessors, the film is doubly so, for it deviates from the two previous Potter films directed by Columbus both in plot as well as in overall direction (not surprising since we have a new director at the helm, Alfonso Curaro). There is a marked stylistic difference from the previous films-Hogwarts is no longer a wonderland of magic and fantasy, it is a dark ancient castle bubbling with mysterious and invisible forces, some of them evil...danger may well lurk in its every shadow! This transformation is not just something you see, you feel it, quite literally! Add on to this the fact that Harry is the prime target of an escaped convict believed to be a vicious mass murderer, and that he is dogged by omens of death (the Grimm) everywhere he goes, not to mention being particularly susceptible to the despair spread by the Dementors and you get the idea of the atmosphere that is being skillfully and subtly crafted here. And yet, as Dumbledore rightly says early on in the film, 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places'. For it is in this films that Harry first truly finds a mentor (he and Dumbledore have barely shared any screen time at this point); in Remus Lupin, his new Defence Against the Dark teacher, who teaches him to combat his despair both literally by teaching him a spell to repel the Dementors, and figuratively by offering him moral support throughout the film. One of the few shortcomings about this film was that a lot of the expository dialogs from the book were left out, presumably to maintain a fast pace, in stark contrast to the previous films which were almost word to word adaptations in most regards; while these omissions do not ordinarily detract from the story in any way, die-hard fans may find their absence disquieting The performances are spot on, as expected in any Potter film, though Lupin comes across as being more confident and assertive than in the book (a small liberty) and Draco Malfoy seems reduced almost to comic relief. But overall, my review is an appreciation of the film as a whole. This is definitely the best film in the series too date...it clearly surpasses its otherwise excellent predecessors, and none of its successors have succeeded in coming close to matching it; though Half-Blood Prince may well be the one that beats it when it releases later this week.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
288,Baldrick44,The Best of a Great Series,9,30 July 2004,"Harry Potter 3 is the best of the series as it, like the book before it, takes on a much more darker tone as Harry finds himself the target of one of Voldemort's loyal supporters, the evil Sirius Black.This more than any in the series before it had the potential to go seriously wrong as this is the first of the Potter stories to really have more threads than the obvious ones of Harry's immediate quest. However Alfonso Cuaron has done a great job of making sure that these endings are ( mostly ) tied up while at the same time making sure that the main story is not slowed down or lagging.The performances of all of the children actors are good, but it is the supporting cast of the adults that really makes this shine. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are great in their return as the vindictive Snape and the rough diamond Hagrid respectively, while Michael Gambon, while not having the same presence as the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore, adds something of a twinkle that Harris seemed to struggle with in number two, perhaps because of his illness. Out of the newbies, David Thewlis is fantastic as Remus J Lupin and Gary Oldman is also very good as the enigmatic Sirius Black.Perhaps the last thing that lifts this movie over the others is the special effects, or rather the lack of them. Cuaron has made the use of magic in this one less like a laser show and it gives the whole thing a more intimate atmosphere instead of the slight heavy-handedness of the first two.Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie that is inundated with great performances that, coupled with great, subtle directing lifts it above the other two. I just hope Goblet of Fire is just as good.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Mysticism. The undead.  Aren't these supposed to be dark subjects?  School by itself can be a very dark subject.  This was a very light movie and is suitable for all but the most dangerously sheltered individuals.Things I liked:   Dogs and trees and pictures being intelligent - Emma Watson - Emma Thompson  only one forced smile out of Danny Radcliffe in the whole movie  many things happening in the frame besides what one would @ first notice.Things I had trouble with: Hagrid rolling over on the death of the hippogriff like it was nothing  the scar on the forehead moves  The Peeps in the audience feel somehow compelled to bring infants to the theater  the rat was not very rat like, and when he disappears over the cliff he looks a heck of a lot like a mouse  no foot prints in the snow when Harry attacks Malfoy.Just see it and make up your own mind.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

291,HBeachBabe,Easily the best one yet,8,4 June 2004,"For the first time I was actually entertained watching a Harry Potter film rather than just impressed.  The first two films in the series were certainly watchable but fatally flawed by their slavish devotion to the books on which they were based.  By trying to exactly replicate the novels, rather than be allowed to exist as movies, the first 2 were suffocated - not allowed to 'breath' as it were - and ended up coming across as merely mechanical exercises rather than entertainment in their own right.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first time that a Harry Potter film exists for it's own sake rather than as a copy of the book.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves and new director Alfonso Cuaron are clearly not afraid to alienate the 'fans' who can't stand even the slightest deviation.  Here, the story is compressed and details altered in order to make for a better film.  By treating the story as a film rather than an adapted novel, the film is allowed to live.  Scenes flow rather than feeling forced.The acting is uniformly strong, the cast once again made up of Britain best thespians and strong child (now adolecent) actors.The effects are the best yet, owing as much to advances in technology as to their unobtrusive uses here.  Often, effects are 'thrown away' in the background or to the side, rather than highlighted front and center.At times, the story may be too compressed for the uninitiated, but, speaking as a casual Potter fan, I highly enjoyed this film and look forward to the next provided this is the direction they are headed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
292,Clive-Silas,A more adult Harry Potter movie.,8,1 June 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban went on general release in the UK yesterday and I caught a late-night showing. This movie is a phenomenal addition to the series, very much darker both figuratively and literally, the child actors are really developing nicely (Grint, for example, is far better than he was in Chamber of Secrets) and director Cuaron put in lots of little visual touches that wouldn't have occurred to Chris Columbus in a million years. One strange thing is that the entire geography of Hogwarts has entirely changed. Both Hagrid's cottage and the Whomping Willow are in totally different places from the previous movie. However, this is not to denigrate the art direction which seems to be better than ever. One major addition to the general set is the workings of the giant Hogwarts Clock, used as a backdrop or for fly-through again and again, to great effect. Also notable is the bridge from the castle to Hagrid's cottage, a fine example of distressed woodwork.Atmospherically the movie is almost totally different from its predecessors. The colours are muted and the sky is always overcast, actually sometimes to a fault - the emotional involvement one should have felt when Harry was first riding Buckbeak was muted by the gunmetal tones of the landscape he was flying over. Beautiful indeed, but not in a ""children's fantasy film"" way. This is a quibble. Really the style absolutely suited the much darker ways of the plot. The Quidditch match, which takes place, as in the book, in a driving rainstorm, is an absolute tour-de-force of terror without the gimmicky camera-work prevalent in the first two films. The Dementors, in particular, are extremely well handled and are the backbone, to me, to what I found the most terrifying sequences in the whole Harry Potter saga so far. However, there are also fun parts - particularly the Knight Bus, beautifully translated from the description of Harry's nightmare journey in the book, and a brilliant piece of design in the bus itself. The book is followed almost too faithfully, resulting in little for the much-anticipated Gary Oldman to do as the mad, bad and dangerous to know Sirius Black. But David Thewlis very effectively fills in the void as Lupin. Michael Gambon has stepped so seamlessly into Richard Harris's shoes as Dumbledore that I never remotely thought of comparing their performances. Gambon is no less Dumbledore than Harris was ... in fact he might be a little better.One does hope, however, that when the DVD comes out, they make an ""Extended Edition"" rather than put the deleted scenes in a separate section as they have hitherto.

Quidditch is the love of Harry's life and Griffyndor finally wins the Quidditch Cup this year which is a huge and joyous occasion, but it's not even mentioned.  Dumbledore is fun and perfect, but too-seldom seen, as are McGonagall and Snape.  Even Hagrid is barely around.THIRD, Rupert Grint was vastly underused.

After seeing PoA and having time to consider it, I actually think the first two films are better.FIFTH, it's still a wonderful film and I enjoyed it thoroughly.SIXTH, I hope Chris Columbus comes back to direct the the last two.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
296,pwoods1,School Daze and Knowledge,9,5 December 2004,"Rowling's books, given their references to: English boarding schools; the problems of life in (apparently mundane and, at times, abusive) suburban and middle-class English life; the acquisition of knowledge regardless of cost; the shifting and unreliable input of adults per se; and, surely, the need for a child to believe in the sanctity of missing parent(s), were always going to be problematic when transferred to the ""big/silver screen"".Well, three films later, Alfonso Cuaron (sorry about the lack of diacritical mark) has fulfilled the promise! There has ever been a darker side to the texts and, finally, it has come to the fore. Cuaron has not lost the thread of the first two episodes - rather he has added to what at the moment, promises to become a remarkable teratology. And, of course, there is more to come from Rowling's pen.Steven Kloves has written a superb screenplay. The CGI and cinematography are, as usual, excellent: as is the casting.On a different note, there is, perhaps, too little attention given to the subtexts contained within Rowling's work. And, as mentioned in the opening paragraph, they seem specifically English. Obviously, with regard to publication of the books, this is not the case: translations and the move ""across the pond"" are reaping enormous awards. Regardless of this success, how do the films cross cultural barriers and appeal to children across the globe? Within reason, they don't.If there is a third-world audience of children (the US ""M"" classification and individual governance's may, in effect, ban them from seeing the film) they will, perhaps, understand only the references to magic.(In New Guinea, in 1974, ""Easy Rider"" was screened, for us, as Australian soldiers, on a bedsheet outside a tent. The interested indigenous people [viewing it from the obverse] were mesmerised - but only by the music and cinematography. None of them understood English and therefore the text. Oh, dear. They probably think, to this day, that slurred and misunderstood dialogue is ""the way to go"".) The appeal of the books AND the films can only be understood within the contexts of either an elite (yes, I know, diacritics) class who can attend boarding-schools, or those granted scholarships to attend same. Surely, this is the reason for the delineated antagonism between Draco, Potter et al. The notion that old money will buy a place in the ""academy"" (Draco), is offset by Potter (granted a scholarship), Hermione (innate esoteric intelligence), and Ron (perhaps second-banana to Harry) who also is there because his impoverished family has a ""free ticket-to-ride"". The only way that the reader/audience GAINS insights into these protagonists' characters is how they react to, and combine with, Harry.In some ways, the books/films are a ""rite-de-passage"". As the central characters gain knowledge, they also (perhaps) become world-weary. At the same time, however, their inter reaction with an unusual and magical world never ceases to delight. Like us, really.When is the bus due? There's something stirring in the bushes... Something wicked this way comes and it ain't a bad dream...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
297,CaptRon-2,Missing key elements,7,15 June 2004,"This is a good movie that Potter fans will enjoy but it is not up to the level of the previous two. Less time is spent with the adults and there is considerably less magic by everyone except Harry. Richard Harris' replacement seems lost in his role; is he wise or lost in the school? The answer isn't clear and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the time seeking the answer. The plot line is razor thin and the climax is a mere bump in the storyline. Lots of surprises as to why the second week ticket sales drops so sharply. Funny thing was is that I wasn't surprised as all. One can only hope this movie is a segway to something greater else this series has run its course. One last note, you can tell how much everyone has grown up since the last movie. Unfortunately, many of the classmates are not present in the background.

299,Scorching,"New Director, Same Old Fun",7,2 June 2004,"The third Harry Potter film has finally arrived in cinemas after a rather long two-year wait. Alfonso Cuaron takes over at the director's chair while erstwhile director Chris Columbus becomes a producer.  It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and this time he must face a new foe in the person of Sirius Black an escaped murderer from Azkaban prison who is out to get Harry.There is always a risk for a successful movie franchise to take on a new director especially if the previous one did a good job. Well I got to say that Cuaron has justified his hiring as he has done a great job in crafting this film. He was really able to capture the dark moments of the film and I as a viewer was able to feel feelings of fear and uneasiness. I also felt that some of his rather unique camera angles were really good. Really breathtaking stuff that added to the overall feel of the movie.  
I thought that the effects were great. The dementors looked really menacing and scary. The Hippogriffs also looked good. Even if the effects were not in a grand scale like ROTK, they still did great job in crafting these creatures and make him look real.In terms of its story I felt that it was much richer and deeper than the previous films. Definitely a much darker and deeper story, which really helped the film in the long run. I wasn't so convinced with the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore. I guess it may be because Richard Harris did such a great job in previous films that anyone who takes over pales in comparison. Harris' had a unique atmosphere which Gambon didn't have. Even though the story places the characters a year after the previous film some of the looks much older than that especially Daniel Radcliffe. I guess you really can't blame the cast, as they cannot film every year just to make the grade. I would be really interested to see how the cast look for the fourth film.    Overall Cuaron did a great job in creating a great film. I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie so far. It is really a shame that this will be the only HP film he will be able to direct. Based on what I have heard of the fourth book I must say that the next film promises to be even better than this film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
300,javaman-7,Magicians not to be messed with,9,16 July 2009,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2004.OVERVIEW Harry (Radcliffe) and his pals Hermione and Ron (Watson and Grint) are now in their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry when news arrives of the escape from prison of the notorious murderer Sirius Black (Oldman), who is after Harry. ""Protecting"" the students are the Dementors, sinister wraiths that can suck souls from the bodies of their victims. Harry acquires a marauder's map which has special powers that come in handy as the story progresses, especially when a werewolf begins to prowl the grounds. Hagrid (Coltrane) introduces the three friends to Buckbeak, a hippogriff (half bird, half horse), who may be a match for the nocturnal beast. Most of the Hogwarts faculty is back, with some new additions, including Professors Lupin (Thewlis) and Trelawney (Thompson).REVIEW: 3 1/2 Java Mugs out of 4 Harry Potter (Radcliffe) transforms an obnoxious dinner guest into a hot-air balloon. Hermione Granger (Watson) lands an uppercut to the jaw of the despicable Draco Malfoy (Felton). These aren't the well-behaved, precocious preteens of the first Harry Potter movie. They, along with their primary audience, are growing into teenagers -- and are not to be messed with.There's an edge to this movie, thanks to the brilliant direction of Cuaron, one of Mexico's bright young movie makers and director of one of the best films to cross the Rio Grande in recent years... Y Tu Mama Tambien.Though the story follows much of the formula of the first two episodes, sharp writing and directing elevate the material beyond author Rowling's rules of order. Especially effective are the tricks with time travel, which can be appreciated even more on a second viewing.Young performers Radcliffe and Grint continue their fine work, but the revelation this time is Watson's portrayal of the smart, assertive Hermione, a character who provides inspiration for young women in the audience and young actresses as well. There's been some talk of bringing on newer, younger child stars for future episodes, but I'd like to see these three actors take the characters into at least their late teens.As for the older players, there seems to be an endless supply of great British character actors who can be called upon to fill any vacancies among the Hogwarts staff. New for this outing is Gambon who capably fills the Dumbledorean robes of the late Richard Harris; Thompson as the hilariously nearsighted tea-leaf reading Sybill Trelawney; Thewlis as Professor Lupin, the Dark Arts Defense teacher with a suspicious surname; and Oldman as the dreaded Sirius Black who is in dogged pursuit of Harry.Shot in England and Scotland, the look of the film complements the mystical material very well, while the computer graphics, animation and the other cinematic ""magic"" add to an enjoyable experience for the entire family.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
301,sidneyleeberthier,The most intimate Potter,9,8 November 2020,"This is a movie which demonstrates big-budget special effects franchises can be about something more. Adolescent longing and the feeling of being trapped and misunderstood pervade this story. Although a tad too long, this might well be the richest of all Potter movies in terms of themes and characters.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
302,mrrockey,The First Harry Potter Movie that isn't Just an Adaptation,10,2 August 2013,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter movie that isn't just an adaptation, it's also a good movie on its own. Not that the first two were bad, but they felt more like adaptations than they do films. Why is this one better? Let's take a look, shall we?First of all, the technicals are far superior in this film than they were on both The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. The cinematography has a lot more style going on here than they did in the first two. Alfonso Cuaron is a very Gothic director and it shows here because there's so much more grey and darkness in the cinematography this time around and it looks beautiful. The special effects are also upgraded, while the first film had some great effects for the time, it's definitely aged. The second film had a much smoother look with its CGI but there's nothing terribly impressive about them. This film however, still looks excellent nine years later. All the creatures in this film have a lot more detail in their movements and design and Buckbeak(a hippogriff in this film) is probably the best example. During his introduction scene, he's always doing some sort of movement in the background. If you look carefully, you can actually see him taking a dump, I'm not kidding. There's also a lot more detail in each shot. Every time I watch this movie, I always see something in the background that I didn't notice before such as a certain prop or someone in the background doing something. Lastly, the score is even more beautiful and elegant in this film than the first two.Secondly, the story is a lot more engaging this time around. The first film had a fun, imaginative story but what it lacked was compelling human drama. Though, it definitely had its emotional moments. The second film had a little more human drama going on but there isn't any real character arcs for our three protagonists. This film in comparison, actually has adult themes and compelling character arcs. This movie is ultimately about confronting your past. Harry's character arc in this movie is about learning to get over his past. Throughout the film, he's haunted by his past. He has memories of his mother's scream as she's about to be killed by Voldemort, he wants to murder Sirius Black when he learns that he was the reason the Potters are dead, and he constantly gets attacked by Dementors whom sucks away his best memories and inflicts some of his darkest memories. But throughout the film, he gets over his past because he learns to remember who they were and what they stood for. The scene that illustrate his arc the most is when Sirius and Remus want to murder Peter Pettigrew, the real man who's responsible for the death of the Potters, but Harry tells them not to because his parents wouldn't have wanted them to become murderers. That scene shows that he remembers his parents for who they were and will do what they would've done.So there's some good character stuff in here but one thing I don't like is that there's this really cheesy speech given by Sirius Black at the end of the film that goes like "" Even though they're dead, they're still in your heart. "" Come on, was that speech necessary? Another thing I don't like is that Harry at the beginning of the film kinda looks like a murderer. He accidentally blows up Aunt Marge when she insulted his parents but he doesn't even think about trying to save her! That's just cruel!Some other things I want to touch upon is the shooting, acting, and writing. Cuaron has a very unconventional way of shooting. The dialogue scenes in this movie often are shot in one-take without any edits and that's pretty unusual for a movie today but I actually really like it! The acting from the adults are good as always, Emma Thompson is really funny here as Professor Trelawney but I think the showstealer is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. He has a warmth and wisdom to his performance that makes it believable why Harry latches onto him so much. The kids definitely show some improvement here compared to the first film where they were just kinda reading lines. Daniel Radcliffe kinda overacts here and there but he overall carries the film well. Rupert Grint doesn't do a whole lot but he interacts well with Emma Watson and there's some really funny moments with them together. And Emma seems a lot more natural this time around. This film is a lot less faithful to the book compared to the first two films but I actually think that's a good thing. The first two had somewhat stilted dialogue and awkward pacing here and there but this film fixes these problems because there's more attention to making a good movie rather than just being faithful to the book.Overall, this film is a huge improvement over the first two. Better acting, writing, and technicals make this film triumph over the first two. I am gonna give it a 8/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
303,stiva,Mischief Managed!,6,11 January 2008,"I gotta say, this movie is good, but not that good. I liked 1 & 2 both movies as well as books. But, here I prefer the book. There seems to be some plot holes. Like when Peter was discovered, they didn't go much deeper like Rowling did in the book. They made some modifications, but I didn't mind them that much. I feel bad Richard Harris died as he was perfect for the role of Dumbledore. Special effects are good. The whooping Willow's location in this movie is different that of the second movie, I guess. There is no final talk between Dumbledore and Harry where Dumbledore explains about Peter Pettigrew's bond and more into the love of Harry's parent's.I give this movie 6.5 for 10.My order of movie rating in HP Series:- 1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 3. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

305,Hellrazr360,"A Darker, More Mature Potter",8,5 May 2006,"While Chris Columbus did do his job making worthy adaptations of the first two Potter films and had the loyalty of fans of the book (myself included) they lacked much, entertainment being one of the biggest, as they felt more like a vision with people talking from the book rather than an actual movie. But the Harry Potter series has now met Alfonso Cauron, who proves to not only manage to give the Harry Potter series some much needed spunk and maturity, but also proves to make it a good movie on its own merits.Part what makes Prisoner of Azkaban such an improvement over its predecessors is that the young actors seem to have gotten the space they needed. It's hard to get young actors/actresses to get a particular role right and still make them feel comfortable with their career, but Cauron seems to have taken pressure off of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson's shoulders. The older performers in the movie are also given time to let the audience get acquainted with who they are.Prisoner of Azkaban is also much darker and mature but also more humorous than the previous installments. The mood of the story and movie not only looks dark but also feels dark and it helps to reflect on the younger roles of the movie by making them seem all the more mature. But even with this, the movie manages to crack a few jokes to make the viewer get a chuckle or two here and there and it helps to provide a brief relief from the seriousness from the film, and a little humor never hurt anyone right? But most of all, this third installment proves to be far more entertaining above all. Unlike Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, which felt much like a bunch of actors and actresses efficiently speaking word-for-word from the book , Prisoner of Azkaban liberates itself from the book but manages to keep much of the sufficient details from it in the movie and in the end it pays off as a much more fun to watch movie.Serious Harry Potter fans might feel somewhat betrayed by Prisoner of Azkaban and how it shares only the main plot details from the book, but casual movie goers will find a tasty and ultimately satisfying treat in it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
306,Niv-1,"Good, but not as good as the first two",6,27 June 2004,"What I thought was the highlight of the movie was the two scenes where Harry fights off all of the Dementors when they are attacking him and Sirius. Those scenes were incredible. The score in particular was amazing.
There is definitely more humor in Azkaban than the previous two movies, and while a lot of it is genuinely funny, I did not much like the shrunken heads. I think that Cauron contributed some fine things, but he rushed a lot of plot scenes to focus on humor and stylistic changes. The character of Ron went backwards. He was a third wheel. In the first two movies there was more of a balance between all the elements. Radcliffe gave his best performances so far. Watson is clearly the best actor of the bunch. Grint was good. I am not sure why Malfoy was so hysterical and wimpy in this movie.
With the new supporting characters Emma Thompson was fun as Professor Trelawney even if her big scene was rushed. The way Julie Christie was introduced as Madame Rosmerta was one of my favorite moments of the movie. David Thewlis was excellent as the scarred Professor Lupin. The scene on the bridge was a highlight. Gary Oldman was good, especially in his brief one-on-one scenes with Radcliffe. The whole scene in the shack was rushed. Oldman, Rickman, Thewlis are all good in the scene but I thought it was underdeveloped. I didn't like what they did with Pettigrew. I thought he would be more pathetic. Not pathetic so you laugh, but pathetic where you get angry. I thought Spall's performance as Pettigrew was off. Visually the movie is very impressive. The changing of the seasons using the Whomping Willow was a great idea. The radiating light around the wands was nice. The Shrieking Shack with its moving walls, the hippogriff (it was like its own character, one of the most impressive CGI/puppet creations I've seen), and the frightening dementors were all impressive technological achievements. Here I felt that the movie actually did seem longer than the previous two. I think that was largely because the time travel aspect of the plot. When Harry and Hermione sit down to wait, however briefly, the scene dragged.
Also the final credits are worth watching. They are really well designed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The reins are finally given to a real director, and the results are a dramatic improvement. Alfonso Cuaron gives the film an appealing visual style, brings the characters down to earth (with the help of the costume department – the clothes now look like they've actually been worn), while making the film's fantastical elements (the Dementors, the Whomping Willow) feel at once more real and truly magical.It also helps that the young actors have matured to a level where they've actually begun acting.

309,segratz,Not as fun as reading the book,7,7 June 2004,"Harry Potter 3 is really a good time at the movies, but just not as great as reading the book. Saying that, I did love the special effects, and the Dementors were just as I pictured in my imagination. The Griffin was REALLY well done but the flying scenes on him were a little 'The Neverending Story' for me and lasted too long. There has been talk that this movie is ""darker"" and that it may be too scary for kids, but I don't really find that is the case. None of the little kids in my theatre seemed to be upset over the scenes, and there really isn't ""jump-at-you"" moments that would make small children cry. Even Snape, one of my favorite characters, isn't that scary at all in this installment. There is plenty of silliness to appeal to kids, and I think they would love all the creatures and characters just as much as in the book. It is weird to see all the actors growing up though, with deeper voices and teenage bodies (complete with acne!) and that made a lot of people chatter at the beginning of the movie (""Listen to his voice!""""Ron looks so grown up""). Something though was just missing for me. I just feel like I didn't totally feel the magic like I had in the very first HP movie.

310,Fiona-39,Close...but no cigar (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),6,3 June 2004,"This was a fun film, well told. The change to a darker, more adult theme is set up from the start with grainy film and hand-held camera work (two Columbus no-nos). It is interesting to compare it to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The themes of growing up, leaving one's parents, the inevitability of fate, the possibility of glimpsing the future... it's all in the two of them. Some of the visual stuff is great: the train icing up when the Dementers appear for example. BUT, but - as so many have said, and I have to enter my ha'penneth - this cuts too much from the book. There needs to be more dialogue - difficult when the director obviously was trying to keep something visual and pacy. But so much was left out that is intrinsic to the wonder of the book, which is so moving and wise (yes, really!) The connections between Pettigrew (Wormtail), Lupin (Mooney), Black (Padfoot), and James Potter (Prongs) are not touched on in the film AT ALL. And Dumbledore's final conversation with Harry, when he says it is our choices as much as our abilities that determine who we are. I know that a film can't be a book, but sometimes, just sometimes, you can do something even better. This falls between two stools - too faithful to be a complete re-imagining, too faithless to fully convey the reason why the books are so successful.

312,shattenjager777,"""Tragically underused"" is becoming their mantra.",8,30 June 2004,"""Tragically underused"" is the first term that seems to come to mind for the Harry Potter films.  All three tragically underuse the charismatic and talented Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, the second and third tragically underuse Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, the second tragically underuses Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, and the third tragically underuses Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney.  They have still risen above these mistakes.This film is the best of the fine series and is markedly different.  The first was a fanciful introduction to this world and our hero characters; the second was an hour and a half of pure fun (mostly provided by Branagh and Watson) with an hour-long horror movie mixed in; and the third is a stylish, dark, more subtle drama with some excellent comic relief (which is, this time, truly relief).  Chris Columbus's ""Chamber of Secrets"" was not particularly visually stunning and was mostly carried by the wildly entertaining characters of Hermione Granger and Gilderoy Lockhart (both played brilliantly), but Alfonso Cuaron's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" very quickly makes the point that Cuaron is a master of lighting and has a penchant for the visual metaphor--something all-too-little-used in film.  *SMALL SPOILER* Harry runs away from his aunt and uncle and sits in front of a deserted playground (which is a wonderful image under any circumstances) that is lightly wetted with drops of water and is oh-so-beautiful, thanks to angles, the location, and, most noticeably, the lighting.  This scene sets us up for what is to come visually and thematically.  *SPOILER OVER*The best way to describe this new directoral direction is ""stylish.""  Where Chris Columbus was a classicist who never really stuck out, Cuaron shows us that he leans heavily toward the formalist side of the fence.  The only downside of this new direction is that it does place more pressure on Daniel Radcliffe, who does not appear up to the challenge.  The repeating clock imagery was a wonderful subtle use of visual metaphor and the quiet clock ticking during the ending was also a nice, subtle metaphor that added much to the experience.  Cuaron should be applauded for this film (honestly, an Oscar nod--not a win, mind you--is deserved)As for the acting, Daniel Radcliffe seems to be breaking under the strain of an increasingly deep and showy role under a more formalistic director. Meanwhile, the estimable supporting actors, from Emma Thompson to Gary Oldman, were solid as always.  Rupert Grint continues to be adequate in the worst role of all of the children, not able to show much but also not needing to.  Then there's Emma Watson--she was charismatic and had a wonderful presence from the first time she appeared on screen in ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" but as her character has become deeper she has only improved and I think that we are seeing a star grow before our eyes in her--especially if she grows up to be as attractive as it seems she will. She has been underused in all three films, but this one is getting it better.  While it is probably the most Harry-centric film of the series, Hermione does get a more significant role and the adults are much downplayed (including, unfortunately, the complete departure of John Cleese) in favor of allowing our heroes (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) to take over the film.All in all, this is a wonderful film and startlingly serious and powerful. Most of the acting is good, with only Daniel Radcliffe standing out as inadequate; the comedy, when it appears, is hilarious; and the film is, plainly and simply, beautiful.  It should have enough to keep the kids awake (and those in the theater when I went stayed awake--even though it didn't start until 9:15 PM), but it isn't overly loud and it really plays like a drama.  I highly recommend this one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
313,yespat,Read The Book,5,24 December 2007,"I think the only reason to watch any of the Harry Potter movies is to be able to hold on to that Potter ""magic"" a little longer and to be able to see the perfect casting that was done on all the films. The perfect cast only falls short on one occasion and that was the Dumbledore replacement. I just never believed he embodied the humor and deep strength required for that role.Anyway, that said, I saw this film before I read any of the books and walked away not having a clue of what it was about. I saw it twice and still couldn't figure out what it was about. After I finally got around to reading the books and saw it again, I was able to make some sense of it. The problem was, by then I saw how much they left out and so it was unsatisfying for that reason too. Of course, it looks great but that's as far as it goes, particularly if you've read the book.I cannot understand why, when these books and films are so enormously popular worldwide as they are, why the film makers are not willing to turn each book into 2 separate films? There is SO much material, so much that is vital to the story and then to cut it out just to keep the film around 2 hours in length is criminal. Given that the cast is so strong, I can't imagine a remake in years to come ever being better than this one. My fondest wish is that they will at least do this for the last 2 books. Make 4 films please!!! People will go and love them and the film makers will make tons of money. What's wrong with that?! Think ""Lord Of The Rings"" and all the Oscars they received.....

314,katydid4819,Better Than the First Two!!,8,6 November 2004,"J.K. Rowling showed the world the boy wizard on paper, a place where he could be whatever we wanted him to be. Now that he is on the silver screen, the audience is given a wonderful view of how one person sees the magical world of Hogwarts. However, for some people, if a director strays from the source material even a hair, the movie is immediately deemed a failure. What these people (fondly known as 'potheads') don't understand is that the books they love are many hours in length and the movies have a time crunch of 21/2 hours. And the movies are also based on the books. If a viewer can swallow that fact that movie is not the book, then The Prisoner of Azcaban will come off as an excellent film. If not, then the differences from the book will most likely distract from the fabulous scenery, the improved actors and the inspired vision of Alfonso Cuaron. Cuaron's credits include The Little Princess and Y Tu Mama Tambien. What this movie shows is a combination of Cauron's other directorial works. He captures both innocence and the lack there of in the life of thirteen year-olds. Not to say there is promiscuous sex between Ron and Hermione in every other scene (although there is foreshadowing of a future relationship) but Prisoner of Azkaban captures the actuality of life, unlike the cookie-cutter version Chris Columbus created in the first two installments of the series. All three of the principal actors have grown in their abilities since the last film. Perhaps it's the influence of a new director or maybe it's just that they've had four or five years to finally find the characters that they are playing. The whole cast, new and old, take their roles and give them the spike they need to stand out as their own. They are aided by a script that does not demand they recite such wooden dialogue as they did in the first two. The script is also much braver in cutting out material that would not have helped but just taken up time. This is where the potheads get angry but in fact this is just what the series needed.Of course, this is not a perfect movie. It still has a bit of the sense of being very rushed (although not nearly as bad as the first one) and it has some scenes that leave the viewer thinking 'What?'. For example, there are a couple points in the movie where story is going smoothly and then, we're walking in the garden with Lupin and Harry or we're in Lupin's office with Harry and the Professor. For a student-teacher relationship, they seem to be very good friends. Their friendship does exist in the book but not quite to the point where the movie uses it. Still, it's the only falture in the script to expand upon what's already there.It's a shame that Cuaron is not staying on, but with much of his crew and the whole cast are staying, perhaps the Potter films are headed for a bright future. Prisoner of Azkaben is a better film than both its predecessors. ***1/2/*****",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
315,Liam3011,"Good, but still the weakest of the franchise",7,21 February 2013,"Now I have watched this movie so many times and I have grew up with harry potter like most of you here have and I was disappointed with this movie. It was a good movie but also bad at the same time. Let me explainThe good: The movie still has it's humor which is great. It has the old Ron that was scared of everything. The enemies were a great addition to the franchise. Great acting that always impresses me when I watch these movies. Making Sirius Black act like a true criminal towards his first scenes.The bad: The movie gets boring. It drags on. Poor action sequences. And those annoying stalking moments with the map, too many of them moments.Overall I give it a 7/10 It is a good movie, but it needs work. The ones before and after it are much better than this one but that's my opinion. This movie remains the weakest of the entire franchise",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
316,joben-525-633946,From wizarding 11 year old to maturing teenager...Harry's just grown up.,8,21 December 2012,"When viewing 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', you really begin to see how much more mature the young casting members have become when you cast your mind back to 2001 when they made their Potter debut's, in the 'Philosopher's Stone'. As a member of this current generation, I can soundly say it was a privilege to have grown up with this consistently thrilling and entertaining series of movies - originating from the stimulus of author J.K Rowling.Anyway - enough off the topic - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now in his third year at Hogwarts. After reaching the end of his tether with the dreaded Dursley's, the teenage wizard flees the nest and soon realises he needs to watch his guard. This due to the fact Azkaban convict Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) - the murderer of Harry's parents - has escaped and is on the prowl for Harry. Also, the Dementors - new guards at Hogwarts - have a withdrawal effect towards Harry as he struggles to cope with all of his personal life, despite support from friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).An enforced casting change from the 'Chamber of Secrets' was required following the untimely death of acting great Richard Harris. However, filling his boots solidly was the more eccentric Michael Gambon. Although he's no Harris, Gambon's interpretations of the old wizard are easy to adapt to.Again, the dark ambiance/atmosphere is increased as Potter finally becomes more than just a children's wizarding fantasy - it becomes more appealing to older generations. Seriously though, if you thought 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was too dark for your child, they certainly shouldn't view the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as certain areas of the film can send a brief shiver down the spine of even the oldest of civilians. In brief, this is the best of the first three.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
317,Ajk2386,Great directing in this movie.,10,15 November 2018,"A lot of people will tell you this is the best Harry Potter movie, and there's a good reason for that. This is when the series went from enjoyable fun kids movies to a darker and more mature tone suited more for young adults.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
318,enigmaticmaniac,Surprisingly Awesome,9,17 July 2011,"I would like to mention that Alfonso Cuarón has done a great job. The treatment of the movie is totally different from the previous installments. The magical world has not only grown much darker but it has taken for of a thriller. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown not only in age but skills as well as they give a great performance.The movie has taken shape of a much more complexity.Its no longer just about the Quidditch matches or the menacing Malfoy but its much more than that. The whole movie has a suspenseful environment and it holds on to it from beginning to end. The climax especially is great and more mature than the previous installments. Overall I think this is the best installment from the three. Totally amazing experience and close to perfect.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
319,eldergod-1,the best of them so far.,10,23 October 2004,"I was very excited about this movies. I love the 3rd book of the series and the saga in general, I love the first two movies and so I was very eager to watch this movie. I expected from it to be great. But it was even better than expected. The new director, Alfonso Quaron created a new cool vision of the movie and the result was fascinating - the 3rd movie about Harry Potter looks even better than it's predecessors! Also the kids are playing their characters better and better, Daniel Radcliffe won my sincerest admiration as Harry Potter. The special effects are spectacular, especially the Dementors, which are, in my opinion, one of the coolest monsters in cinema. The film was also very touching, I almost cried in some parts and I'm quite old for this sort of things - 20 years. The movie was much quicker than the previous installments as action, but still, it tells the story from the book very well. I think that the part withSPOILER the time travel was better explained in the film, than in the book.END OF SPOILER In general, it is the best Harry Potter movie so far and my all-time favourite film. I can't wait for the next one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
320,kylopod,"Finally, a movie that captures the books' magic",8,25 June 2004,"If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.The only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn't what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.The virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book's events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book's delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.The movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione's overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder's Map, a scene that captures the twins' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie's loss in other areas.Certainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus's approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children's movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We're given a chance to think.But part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry's personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won't give anything away for those who aren't looking for the clues.I was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge's assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon's face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.Those complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn't live up to the book, so what? What's important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they're never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we're ever likely to see.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
321,anifanmc,Brilliantly done,9,13 March 2008,"Prizoner of Azkaban is definitely one of my favorites out of the seven Harry Potter novels, although perhaps not my favorite. However, I can say without reservation that until the next two films come out and I can pass judgment on them, this is my favorite of the film series. Cuaron's genius at direction and writing is easily tangible in this instant classic.Azkaban starts much the same way as the previous two films - at the Dursleys. It sticks to the plot of the books well, modifying it where necessary. He first manifests his latent anger and frustration as an abused orphan by blowing his aunt up into a helium saucer and letting her float out the door. He goes on the run and ends up being picked up by the Ministry of Magic, saying that for his safety, he'd best remain indoors and out of sight. Over the course of the film, he learns that an ex-convict and alleged Death Eater, Sirius Black, has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban - a feat which has never been accomplished before - and he's coming after Harry to kill him. As Harry further unravels the mystery surrounding Black's escape and why he's the target, he learns something about his legacy which changes his life forever and sets him out on a quest for vengeance.As a film, Azkaban doesn't disappoint when it comes to pacing and inclusion. Many fans were disappointed when certain things like the Quidditch matches were taken out of the book - I wasn't. The film did a fantastic job of following the plot essentials, showing us Hogwarts and its students, the everyday student life, while focusing heavily upon Harry's character development from a child into a teenager. His supporting actors are no less influential - Grint as Ron Weasley serves perfectly as a foil for both Harry and Hermione, with some hint of the romantic tension between the latter and himself. He also provides, as usual, a conclusive source of humor and lighthearted comedy.Watson's character takes a turn for the worse, however. The first two films accurately portrayed her as the young schoolgirl whose firsthand passion is studies and bookish knowledge, often at the expense of her social skills. At the time of Azkaban, she's not altogether different in the novels, but the film seems to make her more fashion-conscious and emotionally turbulent, a characteristic we don't really see come to fruition until the next novel. Nevertheless, her partnering with Harry is what fleshes out most of her determination - and that's what truly matters.If you haven't seen the film, I highly recommend it as indicative of the feel of the Harry Potter books. If anything it would serve as a ""gateway"" experience for reading the novels.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
322,Ellie-23,Good scarry film but Cuaron changed way to much.,9,7 June 2004,"I enjoyed the film because seeing the young actors and actresses is great fun and the movie was scarry as it should have been.  Things I liked and didn't like so much    SPOILLERSLiked All the children - Malfoy is a little to whiney. The night bus. Snape in Mrs. Longbottom's cloths. Buckbeak is cool. The big black dog was fabulous.  The execution scenes. Sirius Black was very good. Dementors were scarry, the kiss was well done. Lupin as a werewolf was scarry too, though a little weird looking.Didn't like: Peter Pettigrew was almost comical, not good in the middle of a scarry part. Dumbledore doesn't talk to Harry and Hermione about what happened in the shrieking shack. No end of the year ceremony or leaving school scene.

323,Bon_Jovi_chick,Good..... but it has nothing on the book.....,10,11 June 2005,"This is my ultimate favourite book of the Harry Potter series. Its a turning point in Harry's point and it contains two of the best new characters of the HP world: Sirius and Remus. These two characters are portrayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman and David Thewlis respectively.I think my biggest peeve over the film is that it doesn't stick too well with the book. The best scene in the whole book, The Shreiking Shack scene lasts at least 2 chapters in the book but it is cut down to a measley 5 minutes in the film. This scene tells a lot about the past and well it leaves a lot of holes for those who haven't read the book and this could cause a lot of headache trying to understand the next two books.If you have seen this film but not read the book, then read it. You may understand this film a bit better.8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
324,grumpyass,Awesome movie...maybe better the the first 2.,10,9 June 2004,"I thought the movie was spectacular.  I love how the director make it dark to sort of match the theme of this part of the series.  On that note of the director I would like to point of other than the way he shot the movie, I thought he sucked a a director.  For one I hated how he opted to have the movie short, and in the finished product he didn't put  little parts of the story in the correct sequence from the book, making it obvious.  I for one I wonder if the guy read the book and second cared if he was getting it right. I did love the movie but the way it was put together in some areas and especially the ending sucked.  Adding 10 to 15 more minutes would have done the movie a lot more good than harm.  What also bugged me were the fade ins and outs wit the hole circle to cut to another scene.  It worked for one part of the movie but then the others were just thrown in.  I am glad this guys is not directing the fourth film.  But  I thought the movie overall not looking at those aspects was brilliant.  I thought the character have improved a lot and found it nice to be more grown up, though I do still wish they would shoot back to back.  But I hope they keep one with the films so the main characters never become new actors.  These films kick butt!!!!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
325,NotAnotherMovieCritic,I Wish I Had Been in Azkaban Than Watching This Film :-(,7,4 March 2007,"Whatever was Warner Bros. Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me.First of all, the writer of the script, Steven Kloves, did not do a good job as he had with the previous films. He completely took the book and turned it into more of a Cliff Notes version of the book with leaving some important things out of the film.Now, don't get me wrong but the film is great as a movie, but as an adaption based upon the book it's horrible. It has many flaws, plot holes and worse of all the magic seems to be missing from this film. Not magic as in magic, but the presence of magic that the first two films brought into us fans of the books. Hogwarts even looked different to me.For people who have never read the books you'll love it, but for readers of the books you may have mixed emotions as I did. I liked the film, don't get me wrong, I was just disappointed as a fan of the book. However, I have to give some credit to this film. Since I didn't completely hate it but didn't completely love it.

The plot does not quite emphasize and skips over most of what the 3rd book was about.. I completely agree that Dumbledore did not possess that unique quality that made you fear nothing in his presence. He didn't make you feel AT ALL that he was the greatest wizard. They just skipped too many things. One thing I haven't heard too often was their trip to Hogsmeade... The person I went with never read the book and had no idea what Hogsmeade was, how important it was to the students, and why harry always had the cloak on him while he was there... I had to just about explain everything to her at the end.. If this director made all the HP movies, I would simply HAVE to read the book just to know what was going on....

329,vikitoria,Not wild about Harry,6,4 June 2004,"Harry Potter is a sequence of stories beginning with Harry as a child, and then growing up.  Nevertheless, it is a kids story, and this film lacks that kid element - unless we have demented kids running around.This particular story, The Prisoner of Azkaban, sets up Potter's mid-kid crisis so to say.  He finds a friend of the family, but realises his own magical strength as a wizard.  It's one of the most important stories in the series, but this film depicts a real dark side which I would never allow my kids to see.  Columbus did a great job in the first two movies, endearing us to characters such as Weasley, Malfoy, Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, et al. This director's version made it all about Potter.  One character can be a movie, but with the talented experienced theatrical actors such as Smith, Gambon, Rickman, and Thompson - they went to waste!  Potter's father, if you read the books, was a slime bag - an arrogant man with an ego bigger than Aunt Marge.  Sirius Black was his partner in crime, so birds of a feather flock together.Albeit it's a good series of reading, the movies need to bring some compassion of the characters, which the first two did.  It'll be interesting to see how the next director does with Goblet of Fire.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

331,Pilsung89,Decent third installment,8,17 August 2007,"It's year three at Hogwarts for Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Some may wonder how the trio has grown so much since the last movie. It's simple. While Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban are only one year apart in the story, the movies were filmed two years apart. In storyline the three kids are 13 years old.The acting is good, but not as good as the first two films. I think Emma Watson's acting in this one is somewhat rusty. Daniel Radcliffe also has a few rough spots. Maybe it's an age conflict or something. They're playing characters younger than themselves in the teen range. I will be fair and say they both have some good highlights in the film. Rupert Grint managed to keep his character well portrayed the best. Professor Dumbledore is being played by a new actor, since Richard Harris died after the second film. Whether the new actor is better or worse is really up to the viewer. I don't see much difference. Alan Rickman is doing a terrific job as the harsh professor Severus Snape, whose character is becoming more important.This installment is slightly awkward and can be confusing if you don't pay close attention. There are three new characters important to Harry's past: The new defense against the dark arts teacher(RJ Lupin), Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. There's also the introduction of more creatures, like werewolves and Hippogryphs. The plot is very confusing, so I'll only mention the easy parts. Sirius Black is a convicted murderer who has escaped from Azkaban, and it's believed he wants to destroy Harry Potter and revive Voldemort. Dementors, the creatures who guard Azkaban, are searching everywhere, and are for some reason drawn to Harry. Eventually Harry comes to believe that Sirius betrayed his parents, and only when the three new characters previously mentioned are brought together, does Harry learn the truth.Harry, Hermione, and Ron are definitely growing up and maturing in this third installment. You'll see the best-friend relationship between Hermione and Harry get a little stronger. Whenever Harry is in trouble or gets hurt, Hermione is right there with him. Whenever he passes out, he wakes up and Hermione is sitting next to him, wanting to know if he's all right. At one point she holds Harry and tells Siruis if he wants to kill Harry he'll have kill Hermione and Ron as well. You'll also see really clear evidence that Hermione and Ron like each other. There's a shot where they briefly hold hands and get embarrassed, and a scene where Hermione asks if they should move closer while observing a haunted building. This movie also introduces traveling back in time, and this is the first movie where Harry casts a spell that shows just how great his powers can be. A pretty good movie for the series, but pay attention or you may be confused.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
332,rneil95,Everything Has Changed,10,7 June 2008,"In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry becomes trapped in a much darker wizarding world where Harry is hunted after by an fearsome serial killer named Sirius Black, who sold his parents to Voldemort. Harry has a story that isn't as worried about the evil wizards, but more about past that is delved into even deeper because of Professor Lupin, the new DADA teacher, who is a brilliantly cast by David Thewlis. Gary Oldman is great as the dark on the outside, secretly good guy Sirius Black. Again, the trio's acting progresses. I think that this is the best movie in the series. Alfonso Cuaron's directing was pretty good, and change was only expected when they didn't do it in 2003, one year after the previous film like the first two. Change is good, and I think that this series is progressing constantly.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
333,elizabeth-12994,From here it got better,8,24 August 2018,"Prisoner of Azkaban, so far, is still my favourite Harry Potter film, still having not seen them all. This is where everything got better, the way the story was put into action and more importantly the acting from the three main characters. I'm going to admit the first two movies weren't great, particularly Harry, Ron and Hermione. It wasn't believable in the first two because those three characters had the majority amount of screen time. In this movie, the acting was so much better and you could believe it was real. The special effects were good but not brilliant by any means. I thought, mainly, Emma Watson stood out in this film and her acting was great along with Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. I'm on the Half Blood Prince and this is still my favourite Harry Potter movie. By choice, I'd rewatch this movie rather than the others. It's not one of my favourite films ever but it's still great. I still find Harry Potter fans slightly overrate these films and say everything is better than any other films and will not admit if there is a mistake in the film.

335,trixie-k-88,Fantastic Installment of Harry Potter,9,3 April 2012,"It's the third Harry Potter film and things are changing. Alfonso Cuarón has taken over directing, and as the characters get more mature, so too do the themes.It's summertime at the Dursleys again, and things only get harder for Harry when Uncle Vernon's dreadful sister Marge comes to visit. Harry is unable to control his emotions when she insults his parents, flies into a rage, and accidentally causes her to blow up like a balloon and float away. Still furious, Harry storms out and catches a ride on the night bus to the Leaky Cauldron. While on the bus he hears the latest wizarding news—mass murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry is even more alarmed when Ron's father tells him that Sirius Black was one of Voldemort's followers, and that he likely escaped to find and kill Harry. The whole if the wizarding world is on the lookout with dementors, the guards of Azkaban looking for Sirius and guarding Hogwarts. The dementors are dark, hooded creatures who drain all happiness from their victims. Harry learns first-hand how horrible they can be when one attacks him on the train to school; but luckily he is rescued by the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Professor Lupin proves to be the best teacher they have had in this subject, and even gives Harry private lessons to defend himself against dementors. Harry, Ron and Hermione try to go to their lessons, Quidditch, and on outings to Hogsmeade village as normally as possible with the constant search for Black going on. They manage well enough until it's rumored that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts, and the heroic trio go on their own personal mission to find him and discover what he really wants.This film is where the Harry Potter movies start to feel less like children's movies, and more like young adult movies. The tone and emotions are darker, the theme is more serious, and even the colors/lighting are darker. Cuarón did a good job on this film. Hogsmeade looks great, and the special effects with the hypogriff and patronus are really good. The only thing I don't really like about this movie is the wardrobe. In the first two films the students were almost always seen in wizard robes, but in this the students are always in normal ""muggle"" clothing during their free time. I feel that seeing a witch and wizard in a sweater, jeans and sneakers takes a bit of the magic away. Some of the more ""traditional"" wizard wardrobe has also changed, and looks more adult than in Columbus' designs. However, that probably is one of the only criticisms I have for this film. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have definitely learned to act better, and they have become Ron and Hermione, as Radcliffe has become Harry. Puberty is definitely setting in as the emotions for the characters (Harry especially) get more uncontrollable, and they seek more independence as well. Unlike the first or second film, we really get to see how emotionally damaged and traumatized Harry has been by witnessing his parents' death, and suffering a life of abuse and neglect. Some sexual/romantic tensions are also being strongly established between Ron and Hermione. Not to mention, this is the first film with Michael Gambon playing Dumbledore. Richard Harris was a hard act to follow, but Gambon has done a decent job. However, he is a very different Dumbledore—harsher, more serious, less whimsical. But the tone of this film being darker made the change (in both personality and actor) flow well. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis give good performances as well, with their characters filling in a good deal of information on the personal life of Harry's parents. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film with one thing for certain, our boy Harry is growing up!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The kids have really grown into mature actors and now that they have a bit more practice and experience, they looked and performed great. I haven't read the books, but I loved the story.

Also, this film is much more ""artistic"", if you want to put it that way; the seasons are represented colorfully and that sort of thing. But this isn't a bad thing, on the contrary, this film is pretty entertaining with the adult actors doing a good job, but the kids seriously getting on your nerves.

The tale opens with yet another killer title sequence, this time bringing the familiar Warner Bros. shield to light in spurts before focusing on Harry's 'homework assignment,' if you will --- the Lumos Maxima spell. After this, we come to the first segment of the story proper. Now aged 13, Harry is angrier, and more unsure of his destiny than in his previous adventures at Hogwarts. His rage against one of the Dursleys' relatives intensifies when he finally decides it's not worth it to remain there (""Anywhere's better than here,"" he complains to Uncle Vernon).A few moments later --- the Night Bus. What a ride, especially with British veteran comic Lenny Henry contributing the voice of the manic Shrunken Head! The film reaches its most beautiful moment, however, as Hagrid --- newly installed as Professor in Charge of the Care of Magical Creatures --- introduces his class, and us, to Buckbeak the Hippogriff. The haunting flight of Buckbeak, with Harry on his back, is complimented by a new theme from John Williams; and yes, Harry does the 'king-of-the-world' thing a la Leonardo DiCaprio (but that, of course, we can forgive).Director Alfonso Cuaron, who makes here a return to making films from family stories, provides us with as unexpected an ability to play mind games with the Potter legend's staunchest supporters (us, the audience) than even Chris Columbus did, when we discover at last what is really going on. That Sirius Black is Harry Potter's godfather, and would willingly sacrifice himself for Harry's honor, brings more sorrow than joy to our hero's emotional psyche, setting the stage for the major payoff sequence.How horrifying it is to learn that the rat you have loved and cared for for all of 12 years is no less than the traitor who brought Voldemort the means to slay James and Lilly! One can imagine what's going through Ron Weasley's mind as he, Harry, and Hermoine witness these bitter revelations.And finally, we have the theme of expressing freedom, as Harry sees himself, changed into a glowing stag, giving the evil Dementors what for, thus freeing both Sirius and Buckbeak --- two innocents who, like Hagrid himself, have been falsely accused and condemned. Alas, Sirius' destiny, as we know all too well, is to be a short-lived one.So, what did you love about the movie? I hear you asking. Well, aside from the usual smokin' performances from our regulars (and a jolly toast to Michael Gambon who, one hopes, will be given a bigger, cooler beard once Order of the Phoenix goes into principal photography), there is also the delightful spectre of darkness surrounding the story, and a ferocious bid for battling against revenge. And, for the first time, the inclusion of the Marauders' Map is not only emphasized, it also serves as the inspiration --- and literal setting --- for the movie's end-credit sequence.All in all, Prisoner of Azkaban brings the darker Potter power to light in ways one would not dare expect out of screenwriter Steve Kloves. Alas, they're saying that Steve will be leaving the production team after having completed the Goblet of Fire script; if another writer does Order of the Phoenix proper justice, they'll be hard-pressed to take on the search for one. That being the case, I sincerely hope our legions of fans will enjoy our film. Who knows? I may have to do this again three years from now when Half-Blood Prince gets the movie treatment! (Heh-heh!)

340,grkamerican1984,holy freakin god,1,29 September 2007,"this movie just sucked. the only decent harry potter films were 1 and 2. this one was unbelievable. what really annoyed me was the fact that dialogue was taken directly from the book, which is fine, but the character's say those lines (as a matter of fact ALL their lines) in a very boring and un-enthusiastic way, which brings me to my next point. this film was so depressing. just looking at it made me want to cut myself. not just because of the boring acting, but because of the color. THERE WAS SO MUCH GRAY! everything had a dark gray tint. the darkness level was so high, that the Ghostbusters game on Nintendo looks like a Van Gogh painting compared to this. the CGI is that bad, but could've been better. the only film that can use CGI and still be an awesome movie was 300. this film, had mediocre CGI. the only things that were even close to decent was the music and the special effects. that was probably their goal, to have all this CGI and great music to draw the audience away from such an awful film. WELL IT DIDN'T WORK ON ME WARNER BROS.! this film lacked what the two others had. originality. the two other films made up their own lines, amazing music, and they used CGI only when it was necessary. not this film. if you like this movie, fine, but i consider it an awful adaptation of such a great book in the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
341,wolverinesforever,"More than just the best ""Potter"" film (to date). It can also hold it's own against the best of fantasy entertainment.",10,27 October 2010,"If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff (""Don't pull out his feathers,"" warns Hagrid, ""cause he won't thank yer for that!""). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration.This scene is not only terrifically executed, but makes a great statement about the ""Harry Potter"" franchise in general. Under Columbus, the series was keen on observing its wondrous world, but not much else. But under Alfonso Cuaron, the series does more than observe. It flies and sails through all of the possibilities. Add to that an improved script from Steven Kloves, better performances from the main trio, and some welcome musical themes from John Williams, and you have what is, to date, the best ""Potter"" film yet.The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is Sirius Black, a mass murderer who has escaped. A former supporter of Lord Voldemort, Black is reportedly going after Harry to finish off the Dark Lord's work. Harry, of course, would much rather live out his third year at Hogwarts without unpredictable distractions. But more than Sirius Black is concerning Harry now. The guards of Azkaban, the dementors, are snooping around Hogwarts and forcing Harry to rehear his worst memories. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, is revealing that he had connections with Harry's father. And for all of the security around Hogwarts, how is Black breaching the castle walls and attacking portraits?Steven Kloves has written a far better script this time around, thanks in large part to a greater emotional heft he puts on the story. Harry's parents take on a greater importance this time, and they are the source for some of his motivations in dealing with the Dementors, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black. In fact, speaking of Lupin, I was quite impressed with how well Kloves wrote all of the interactions between Harry and Lupin. His manner reminded me of some of my favorite teachers from high school, and how they would sometimes care about more than just their students' academia, but their personal lives too.And not only is the script better, but so is the acting. Reportedly, director Cuaron had Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all had to write essays on their characters before filming began. Smart move. Racliffe, Grint, and Watson all interact with each other like there's real history between them, and don't just look like they're trying to hold their own while reciting lines. Several new casting choices are inspired as well. David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, and he brings humanity and compassion to the role. Gary Oldman is Sirius Black, and his interactions with Harry are not only credible, but you get a sense that he has truly cared for him for many years now. Emma Thompson is a hoot as Professor Trelawney, Harry's eccentric Divination teacher. Several have criticized Michael Gambon taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but I think he's fine for the role. He may not be the Albus Dumbledore of the book, but I bought into his more stern, yet still sensible portrayal of the revered Headmaster.I missed John Williams' film score in ""Chamber of Secrets"" because I rarely heard it. Here however, Cuaron lets him come back in full force. Time and time again, Williams comes up with other memorable theme, including ""Aunt Marge's Waltz,"" ""Buckbeak's Flight,"" and ""Double Trouble"" (the song the Hogwarts choir sings). This marked the last time Williams worked with ""Harry Potter,"" so it's good he went out on a high note.I don't know what I can add to the appraisal of Alfonso Cuaron's direction, but I'm going to try anyway. The guy nailed it. For the first thirty minutes, I had this big grin on my face as he took great fun in blowing up Aunt Marge, making Harry's ride on the Knight Bus as wild and face-flattening as possible, and having students eat candies that made them act like monkeys and lions (or in Harry's case, blow steam out of his ears). He employs several clever camera tricks, including gazing into a mirror and having the reflection become the dominant shot, and having the Whomping Willow shake snow off its branches and having the snow hit the camera lens. And he's not afraid to exploit Hogwarts darker side, from the sinister, soul- sucking dementors to Lupin's tense transformation. There are too many ""little touches"" he adds on for me to mention, but I think my favorite was that when Harry and Hermione travel back in time and attempt to save Buckbeak, Hermione sees herself, and questions, ""Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?"" You won't find that comment in the book. Not only does that line add humor, but it also shows how Cuaron was willing to separate this film from the book and make it its own entity.Does ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" deserve the 10 I bestow on it? Maybe, maybe not; I will not deny, I am a little biased when it comes to ""Harry Potter."" But I do believe it to be great filmmaking, and great entertainment. Practically all elements from the previous ""Potter"" pictures have been improved upon. The result is a film that can hold it's own against the best of fantasy entertainment, and it's also one of the rare strong 3rd installments of any given film series.(And one last note: I believe this film gets the award for ""weirdest ending to any 'Harry Potter' movie"")",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
342,karl_with-12,"Great movie, full of magic and excitement but sort of lost the essence of Harry Potter ***spoilers***",6,26 July 2009,"The Harry Potter Series pulled off to a great start, with two amazing adaptations created by our very own, Chris Columbus. Then I heard about this film and I was quite excited to see it and also very keen that this instalment is going to be better than the two movies I've already seen... after watching this film, I thought it was absolutely brilliant, but it could have been better. Many scenes were just too solid and dark. The new Dumbledore could have been casted better. His weirdness took hold off his warmth and calmness, which didn't give me a good impression on him.However, on the upper side, the action, adventure and magic scored points for this movie. It was a whole new side for Harry Potter, it was very unique and exceeded my expectations. The performances were top-notch, Oldman portrayed Black's character most splendidly and the talents just keep coming from Dan, Rup and Em!On the other hand, compared to the book, many significant parts were just torn off, which was a displeasure, such as Ron meeting with Black in the dormitory. And questions popped up as well (how did Sirius Black escape from Azkaban, why/how did Lupin end up as a werewolf, what happened to Pettigrew????? ) Though in summary, a fantastic movie, but sort of lost the feeling and essence of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is still Number 1 and I would strongly admit that if Columbus was directing this, it would have been better.******/**********(6/10 stars)~Kalendra",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
343,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,Alfonso is the right man,8,26 August 2014,"Chamber of Secrets and Philosopher Stone has been done back to back. After the amazing work Chris Columbus did for the Potter movies he was Physically and emotionally exhausted, there was no way he could do another Harry Potter film. Beside this fact I think the Potter universe also needed some changes. Because in the books from book 3 it is going to change something. We get some darker themes and I think it was the right thing to bring on a new director. 1 and 2 were true childish films and you could see that on the look of the film. Hogwarts is going to be darker. So the third one needed a new Director. The choice that Chris remained on in the crew to guide the new film crew onto the Post Chris era was really good.I understand that in first place there was some hesitation about having Alfonso Cuarón as the new director as there were so many other possibilities. But choosing Alfonso as Director was truly the best decision they could make for this film. Alfonso found the right balance in this film of darkness and emotion and children themes. Although 3th hasn't much children themes anymore. Cuarón decision to film in Scotland was one of those changes and I really liked that choice because he really seemed to understand the story and really had his own vision. I immediately became a fan of him. And the main reason was his way of filming. He takes the audience really into story like you really walk through the corridors of Hogwarts. And that was something I loved.Looking at casting he did a very good job. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are just made for their character. Gary can do anything , every role. He just brings this role over on screen on such an professional way, he became my #1 actor of all time. Now I've seen 17 movies of him. Because the death of Richard Harris there also needed to be a new Dumbledore and that was something really scary. Sir Michael Gambon did the role on his own way, and he had a very hard job because he could never do it better than Harris. So they could have asked Peter O'Toole or McKellen or Christopher Lee but it wouldn't matter. Harris played the role of Dumbledore on such a beautiful way. When I read about Dumbledore I keep seeing Richard. So at the casting I think Alfonso brought some international names into it. Looking at the movie as a whole Alfonso did an fantastic job with the right balance in the film. He brought the story over so well. There are certain moments in the film which he focused on. Emotional moments between Gary and Daniel and David and Daniel. Which are maybe the most beautiful moments of the whole series. And Alfonso can bring this over so beautifully that it really hits you.The acting in the film was amazing. Daniel Emma and Rupert really get better.I give this film 10/10 An amazing sequel to the start of Chris!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
344,Listen_to_the_Law,Director Curion is breathtaking,8,2 September 2007,"I really enjoyed watching the first 2 Pothead movies, so I got used to some stuff from the book to be left out. But this movie left out too much. What they should do is put out 2 parts of this movie, and make you see the first part first. That would work perfectly. Overall, a good movie!List of Negatives:  Hagrid's cabin isn't down that big hill.  Harry receives the broomstick in the middle of the book, but the movie has him getting it at the end.  A leaf falls, and more nature scenes. They're nice, but have nothing to do with the movie.  The Knight Bus never had that stupid talking head in the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
345,Freemheart,Tragedy of poor saga,1,25 July 2004,"I really cannot understand what's make so good to the critics this Harry Potter, it's the one of the worst movies I have seen this year (not so bad as Val Helsing). I know the cast and the acting is good, also is the soundtrack, but the story have nothing original and it's very predictable. Again we see Harry fighting VS the legacy of Voldemort who, as always, is trying to find a way to return. Only this time some new things of his past are revealed and a more sad Potter (but always the good guy, the same saint Potter of every book). Yeah, the story it's just a little more dark, with many monsters, but still too shallow, there's no real drama or realistic characters, as I said Potter is the same ""perfect"" good guy and the villains are always the baddest guys, for this reason he always receive special treatment (from the dumbledore and Hargrid, those who don't do it are the bad guys)to guarantee a forced happy ending, even when you know the next movie some little piece of the puzzle of Voldemort will appear. Some new elements have nothing new if you remember movies like Army of Darkness(the book of monsters) and the Frighteners(the dementors). I thought the end of the first movie was the worst I have seen in a film, but this one is the edge of stupidity. To those who want something more realistic and less shallow I recommend to read the masterpiece of Vertigo from DC comics ""The Books of magic"", and the Trilogy of books ""The Passing of the Technomages"", both have characters like Harry Potter, but the stories are very much better (in the trilogy of Technomage the first character have tragic past like Potter and even when is the hero of the story he never is well treated)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
346,adam_uk09,Truly Magical!,8,12 August 2007,"The 3rd instalment in J.K Rowlings multi-billion pound franchise is widely regarded as the best and most confusing of the entire series for people who haven't read the books thus far.It is certainly the best film, but by a clean mile. Alfonso Cuaron, the brainchild behind 'Taxi' is at the helm of the Prisoner of Azkaban which takes these films onto a whole new level.Cuaron has extracted some of the best sequences out of the book and used them to good effect; something which seems to have been amiss in the latest films; particularly the newest.Prisoner of Azkaban features an array of brilliant acting from all the major leads; Alan Rickman & Maggie Smith are as excellent as usual. The newcomers; Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is good, but perhaps not as lovable as the late Richard Harris. David Thewlis takes the role of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin who is simply spellbinding in his role.Of course, this wouldn't be a review without mentioning Gary Oldman as Harry's estranged Godfather Sirius Black; a monumental feat for Oldman to climb has been realised in one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in years.Prisoner of Azkaban is an excellent addition to the Harry Potter saga, excellent special effects, brilliant acting and a storyline that cannot be rivalled.

347,kalendra274,"Really good movie, with lots of energy - but still has some negative points",7,29 July 2008,"7.99/8 I was excepting high hopes for this movie, and was throughly impressed by this epic, but the thing that disappointed me, which made the movie lose three stars, was the plot, a bit too many plots which makes the movie boring and confusing, but thankfully it still had some energy left to bring back to entertained the audience, which is great, but it's still beside the point. And the other thing was the colour of it, too dark, perhaps they wanted to make this one the darkest one yet and they ended up going over the budget, so I was disappointed by that as well. But the movie was still good, really entertaining, with a few twists and turns, which keeps the audience captivated to watch more and I thought it was the best one yet.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but it didn't start well, as Harry blew up his aunt, who was being very mean to his parents and fainted on the train to Hogwarts. But that's not all, the school and including Harry is in danger as mass-murder (Sirius Black) broke out of Azkaban prison to come and find (possibly kill) Harry. And that's not all soul-sucking Demonters are guarding the school grounds, which Harry is scared to face against, next to Sirius. Harry doesn't know what's ahead of him, as he faces new challenges in his life.Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) stole the movie, as he shone throughout the movie and his performances were all out-of-this-world, so well done Gary. And also congratulations to the rest of the cast, as they all performed their role realistically and is one of the best things about this movie. 9.89/10 for the performances.Overall, a great movie, lots of energy to keep everyone entertained, but too many plots, which lets down the movie and perhaps it's too dark - brighten it a little!

When's the next one coming?,8,13 June 2004,"I don't know what people are complaining about; the feeling of ""kiddie movie"", with the fake, wide grins etc, is almost completely gone!I think that's just the reason why some of the previous reviewers were slightly disappointed with this one, because it's now become a ""real"" movie. As such, it's inevitably compared to for instance Lord of the Rings (which it is clearly influenced by; Galadriels polyvocal temptation speech, for instance, and some more, is reused here). And, of course, in that comparison, ""..Azkaban"" is bound to lose.Still, the new style of filming and the darker storyline finally gives us a ""Harry Potter""-movie with a real, eerie atmosphere. That's good. The use of magic feels far more ""real"" this time (less fairytale, if you get my meaning). It's good to see that the story-telling accomplishment of Peter Jackson has rubbed off on other directors!In the adaption process, I think the director actually tried to do a ""LOTR"" (= to make the movie good on it's own, AND get as much action from the book as possible), but it doesn't have as many minutes to tell the story as the ""LOTR""-films had. Because of that, this movie just gets going from the beginning, and from there on, there's almost no time for ""daily life"" descriptions, it's all action and plot, the story-pace at max all the time. Which, I understand, is quite different from the book.Although this movie wasn't perfect, I'm a bit intrigued now. I haven't read the books - at ""Harry Potter""-movies I've mostly come along with my girlfriend (who has read the books).. but now I've really got a feel of the characters, and I'm really beginning to look forward to seeing how the series turn out in the end.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

He pulls the film down. He improves with practise and with each film but his performances are always dire. 1- Dreadful 2- Poor and 3- Below Average. 4 was probably- Below Average. By the next film he should be Average. He is improving but the quality and lack of passion in his performance was a dread and a bore, quite frankly so get some acting tips and and use them.The bad aside, the film got 2 points because of the slight hitting, target audiences got and target genre got and because of the likes of Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith and their wonderful performances, I just wish the rest of the cast would jump into line and snap into line quickly or the film will get worse, just see they will.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Prisoner features a strong plot, neat dialogue and the usual powerful supporting cast to back up the child stars. I have not read any of the books, so am unable to comment as to whether the rather long time it takes to get to any action is due to the screenplay or source material. However, this more adult and darker episode (allowing Oldman, Thewlis and Rickman to up the dramatic ante) should please fans of the books and casual observers alike - plus, having well established Hogwarts in the first two films, little backfill is necessary.8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
355,rockproductions,By Far the Best Harry Potter!,9,6 June 2004,"First of all people lets stop comparing ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" to the novel, after all, how many movies are as good as the book? I've never read any of the books & in a way am glad I didn't, as it may have ruined this incredibly fine cinema experience, though I doubt it.Now, let's compare this film to the other two ""Harry Potter"" films, which is a much more fair comparison. For me, ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a far improvement over the first two. While the first two had their childlike fantasy charm for us grownups, there was nothing really in these rather thin films to keep anyone extremely interested over the age of 14 with their rather thin & banal plots & long running time. When making a child fantasy film that the adult child in me will love, I need a stronger & darker plot, characters filled with complexities, credible dialog, darker stronger special effects, more adult content, & a great sense of wonder. Here ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fulfill all these requirements in the same grand sense of the king of all child fantasy films ""The Wizard of Oz."" I'm not saying ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is near the masterpiece that ""The Wizard of Oz"" is, but just like that great film I had a great sense of wonderment as I watched the story unfold. Just like that great film there were dark & mysterious characters that were not at all quite what they seemed, & finally like that great film Harry just like Dorothy is searching for the way back home to his roots.I felt this film was an incredible improvement over the last two; much credit has to be given to the director who handled superbly the maturing Harry into a young man with real issues that we all can relate to. Even the look of the film has matured; the camera work was just incredible! The special effects fantastic! I've never seen Hogwarts look more real, wonderful yet foreboding at the same time. The creatures were done with a true sense of realism that is sooo needed for a film like this to succeed; my only complaint (Spoiler) was the rather weak & childish looking Werewolf. It reminded me of the Pink Panther. Maybe it was meant not to scare the kiddies to much, but then again the truly malevolent Dementors surely were enough to scare any 10 year old, so why make the Werewolf so...well...un-Werewolf like? Also one complaint about the plot is the character of Malfoy, he was just to weak & wimp like, it would of also been nice to see his father again in this picture, but with that said I can not really fault this film at all. ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" truly enthralled the child in this 43 year old body, I would highly recommend this film to other children of my age & younger & older. A truly magical experience, let the child out!****1/2",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
356,karenlynn1,"Excellent film, but see the first 2 first if you're a newbie",9,26 January 2006,"First of all, this is one of my favorite movies. I love reading about Harry Potter as much as watching his films. The only real criticism I have is that you may be a little confused about some of the elements if you haven't a) seen the first two films, or b) read the first three books. Harry's history is glossed over, and leaving Potter-heads to explain to their friends outside of the fandom the basics about Harry and his non-magical relatives. ""why does he live with them? Where is he going with that trunk?"" etc. The big picture becomes clearer, however when he threatens his ""muggle"" uncle with his wand, and heads for Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry once again. The Knight Bus scene is hysterical.However, Harry heads to his home-away-from-home and into unseen danger as murderous, wild-eyed wizard escapes from Azkaban Prison and (rhumor has it) is searching for Harry Potter. Harry teams up with his two best friends, lovable Ron Weasley and intelligent Hermione Granger once again. And this time their new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher knows more about Harry and the mysterious escaped prisoner than he lets on. Some moving scenes, excellent cinematography and Gary Oldman's portrayal as the infamous Sirius Black are just some of the things that make this one a must-see.

357,fshardlow,What a wonderful film,9,24 September 2019,"Just finished watching Azkaban for the first time in years (I'm 18, I think I watched Akzaban for the first time when I was about 12). I'm really surprised by how in-depth and detailed this movie is, considering how I thought that only the third film into the series, it would still be quite childish. However, I was proved wrong and left enchanted by a beautifully rich set design and intricate plot- one that in the final act, had me gobsmacked by how interesting and UNIQUE it was!Watching this film, sometimes you forget that it's one of the largest film franchises on Earth. Usually, with these big films, there's never any attention payed to how the film looks; it's all about big explosions and SFX. However, with Azkaban (and hopefully the rest of the series, that I'm going to binge after this review), the cinematography is STUNNING. The whole film is engrossed in such a mesmerising, fresh and vibrant British countryside, along with incredible architecture. I'm a sucker for gorgeous British settings in films, with 2005 Pride & Prejudice's own setting helping to make that movie one of my all time favourites, Azkaban has the same beauty that immediately pulls me into the film.Great plot, brilliant acting, especially from Rickman and Thewlis.9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
358,KDCarson,Should have stuck to the Book!,8,7 June 2004,"The simple and elegant formula of the first two movies was just that. Stick to the author's gay vision without any deviation and you'll have a great gay movie. This time they caved in to studio pressure (I'm sure) and produced the director's idea of the story. This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K. Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie. It could have been a 10 out of 10 if they had stuck to the Book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
359,Ashlevine,Imagination abound,9,17 November 2004,"From writing, acting, directing, production elements are all wonderfully melted together to create a brilliant continuation on the previous Potter series. Just the thought that this whole thing started from the point of view of a mother trying to enrich her child's life with more beauty and wonder is an astounding thought. She certainly deserves to be honored as the mother of a decade. My children and I were absolutely carried onto a journey of the mind and soul. Like all the Harry Potter series, you always felt safe knowing that no matter how tens it gets, the hero will once again emerge. But the greatness of the direction is to keep you at that edge, not to let you see the result but to enjoy the process and that was well done.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
360,regnarghost,a glimpse of what could have been...,9,2 February 2008,"This movie is so fresh... it flows easily are sprinkled with nice humor and is full of creative touches, the music is good, hell even the kids (especially Emma Watson) are good (well... Radclife is passable) and the direction is nothing short of mind blowing.Seriously, this is a glimpse of what could have been a great series if someone like Cuaron would have directed it. He seems to have a firm grasp of the humor and atmosphere of JKs universe and have distilled the book into a organic film instead of a bunch of stringed together scenes.Everything looks so much better then in previous entries. And there is a sensed of darkness here that could only been sensed before, now, if you read JKs novels you know that this darkness is in the books too, its that surrounding darkness that makes Hogwarts such a cosy place, Cuaron understands, look how he contrasts the dread of the dementers with the guys joking around in the tower. Its a knee-jerk reaction equating darkness with improvement, but Cuaron is much more then darkness, he instills real warmth and charm into his characters, contrasting that darkness, making it a cosy picture, Hagrid is especially endearing in this installment. His warmth is real, his sadness is real.David Thewlis as Lupin shines brightest though. The acting, the mustasche, its just comes together brilliantly.Cuaron also understands that Dumbledore isn't some Gandalf rip-off, he is this wise, but still genuinely eccentric wizard. And Finally we can sense that weird side of him to. (not that Richard Harris wasn't brilliant though... i just think he was a little to... tired) And in a stroke of genius Cuaron throws in this shrunken-talking- Jamaican head WOW... just WOW",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
361,rkeaney,great movie,9,30 January 2006,This movie is a refreshing new look at the world of harry potter and his friends with a new director it is perfect as it adds a different style and view of the book i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alfonso Cuaron on creating such a great movie the whole cast have grown up in appearance and in their roles from the very start you can see the cast as mature teenage actors Daniel Radcliffe delivers a good performance as Harry whereas Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint(Ron) are also very good.This darker and more exciting year at hogwarts is beautifully directed and the cgi is far superior to the first two movies maybe because they were a bit rushed.the time turner sequence is excellently executed i loved it.Harry is about to start an ordinary year at hogwarts(well ordinary to him)talk of a mysterious escapee from azkaban prison fills the air with this mysterious Sirius Black coming straight to hogwarts and Harry Potter and a new defence against the dark arts teacher this is going to be a eventful year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES...,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
362,laci-5,"Least magic, Most fun and content",9,14 June 2004,"Great movie, or should say, the first real movie of the series. Of Course darker but also has the most fun and laughter for balance. Some very personal details I loved; in the first movies you could not see something like ***SPOILER*** the students having fun with special candies or Hermione behaving like a young woman: ""does my hair really look like this from the backside??""***END OF SPOILER***The wonder is gone, as is from the book. Magic and special wizardry, creatures of Hogwarts are not the most important part of the story: just as Harry is not amazed by them anymore, nor we are. These are only the background for the most important story - the story that is told in 7 chapters, say, seven books. The first two were the introduction, but now the story really begins. The only thing I missed was the explanation of the 4 names on the map- the names of people who made it. With one or two explaining sentence we would also have understood the patronus creature in the end.But except from this I really loved it. It also had lots of little fun in the background just as the book or the original Star Wars trilogy. One more thing: the Hippogriff. Well the F/x could be seen sometimes but the concept was great, as the two different ""parts"" of it behaved just as they had to (the bird part as a bird, the horse part as a horse). Great!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The darker setting, the interesting storyline and the more mature kids surely helped a great deal.John Williams score was excellent as always.Pity that they keep changing directors for the next films.
Not that I plan to become a Potter fan, but (after a lame and pretty annoying beginning) I got hooked.Well done.This is the first Potter installment that showed me what all the fans love about it and weirdly, most fans DON'T like this one.Has the world turned upside down?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
364,firefox2k,Where is the magic? not in this movie!,1,10 June 2004,"This will be the definitive review for the movie.When doing a movie based on a book, you should make the movie follow the book as close as possible. granted you can not put everything in the book in a movie, but you do have to remember that a movie should and DOES tell a story. 4 crucial points which are VERY important to this movie being part of a 7 part series. A movie is plot, dialog, shooting, editing, wardrobe, scenery and most importantly supposed to stand alone. The first 2 movies by Chris do that. People say they were long, boring, and had no imagination. BUT they were the best movies made from a book. ( except LOTR and silence of the lambs )1. Who are the marauders? What is their importance in the next 4 movies? 2. Who is Prongs? what role does he play? 3. Why is hermonie's 'cat' important ? 4. who are cedric diggory and cho chang?Watching the movie, those will be things you can NOT answer. Being a reader of the books, you can. Why is this important? because they ALL play BIG ROLES in the next 2 movies!!The movie was sliced, diced, and minced. It looked like a stage play. or a rehearsal for a movie that wasn't finished. The edits were bad, the camera shook.It was a great creative art film, with great actors, and a nice LOOSE interpretation of the book. But as far as i am concerned, not a movie that should be considered part of the series. ( kind of like the second parts to the Wizard of Oz, or Gone with the Wind...LOL)P.S. - noticed the quotes around the word 'cat'... HINT! HINT! Do yourself a favor and read the books if you want to know how much you REALLY MISSED, and well as the director.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
365,three_am,liked it better than the first two movies ** slight spoilers,10,2 July 2004,"The first thing I'd like to say is I'm a huge fan of the books and after viewing the movie more than once, I am so happy with the final product. Prisoner is my favorite book our of the whole series. To be honest, I read everyone's review of the movie before actually seeing it and the basic message I got was to enjoy the movie as a movie and leave out all comparisons from the book. This worked and made me enjoy the movie.*On Acting* There were so many things to be happy about. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did an excellent job portraying Harry, Ron and Hermione. They were better this time around than in Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. I could feel the angst coming from Harry. I was surprised and glad with Radcliffe's screaming ""He was their friend!"" scene. Superb acting from David Thewliss and Gary Oldman - they nailed their parts down. Sirius's speech in the Shrieking shack was intense. I was glad the new Dumbledore was a little more ""mad"" this time round. Alan Rickman's Snape of course was true to form. If given a chance to show how unfair Snape really is in the books on screen, the audience will probably hate the character even more. Emma Thompson as Professor Trewlawney was perfect. Loved it.*On Directing* Enjoyed the directing. I was left with distinct images - the frozen and dying flowers as dementors passed, the transitions between scenes and the like. I liked the new look of Hogwarts even though it wasn't what I initially imagined when I read the books.On whole, the movie was a lot better than the first two with the directing and improved acting of the main characters. The special effects were average. I was glad everyone was using their wands for light. I was not exactly impressed with the Patronus and I thought the werewolf could have been done better. Perhaps I'm just spoiled with fantastic special effects from Lord of The Rings.I give the movie thumbs up. Looking forward to owning this on DVD as well as the 6th book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
366,siit,A darker offering but still as magical,7,21 January 2006,"I have to admit that when I first saw the PoA, I didn't receive it as warmly as the previous two outings. However after viewing PoA again at the cinema and subsequently on DVD, I tend to believe it virtually as well done as Chamber of Secrets and hence slightly less than Philosopher's Stone. There are still the little tricks and quirks that make it 'Harry Potter' and all characters returning are great... except one. It was with great sorrow I heard the passing of Richard Harris and therefore I tried to look with respect and allow that Dumbledore is replaced by Michael Gambon and give him the benefit of the doubt. However the shoes of Richard Harris are too big for him to fill. The majesty of Dumbledore is not the same and regardless of good intentions, it detracts from the movie.But the story is interesting and engaging, though sometimes had to be explained to a younger audience. The special effects are fantastic. The kids are growing up and a lot of the silliness is disappearing, but then again (apart from the constant Radcliffe cheesy smiles) was that silliness part of the magical innocence? PoA is another good solid episode for the Harry Potter empire. And I still find it refreshing to escape the Americanised offerings that is usually the norm.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

In another topic,I want to say that Michael Gambon's role as Albus Dumbledore was amazing, as we all know, Richard Harris sadly passed away,but you barely can see the difference between both of them. Also,thumbs up to Alfonso Cuaron a mexican director who directed this amazing movie.

I loved Marge blowing up like a balloon and then flying away, lol I always imagine how on Earth she was taken down every time I watch it, if she was at all. The Sirius Black part is epic, and the scene where Harry finds out from Cornelius Fudge and Three Broomsticks bartender that Sirius 'betrayed' his parents never fails to be so emotional for me. You can clearly see Harry's grief in that scene, terrific acting from Daniel Radcliffe.It had a lot of unexpected twists this movie. There was Ron's rat actually turning out to be Harry's father's school friend who betrayed James and Lily, framed Sirius and faked his death. Sirius turned out to be the one who betrayed his parents at first before being revealed he was innocent all along. And then there was hope Harry's Dad was still alive when a stag made the Dementor flee, but in yet another unexpected twists it turned out to be Harry all along.

370,ssc7,The only magic from this movie came from the wands!,9,7 June 2004,"As a Potter fan who has read all books and read them to my children, I was very disappointed in this film. It was made for adults and not for the children which it was intended. It felt like a bad 1970's art-house movie, scenes were uneven, lacked any explanation for those few people that never read the books (like my husband) and even felt amateurish. Who was the man handling the camera in some of these jerky shots? For as much money that these movies made, the special effects were pathetic. I mean look at the butterfly as a short example, this isn't IFC this is Hollywood, use that money!!!!!!!!! True many of the story lines were true to the book but so many that were used were not explained fully and became an inside joke to many that read it. I love the fact that everyone is growing and aging in real life and we can grow with them, but I felt Columbus gave us the magical sense from the books, wonder and awe. So much was filmed outside (yes Hogwarts castle was wonderful to see from all angles) but it seemed the basis of this movie was scenery rather than character depth. No blame to the characters in the movie they were awesome as usual, I feel the director was not the right choice for this film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
371,parallel_projection,Beautiful--absolutely breathtaking adaptation.,10,18 August 2012,"I might be the only one who thinks this, but in all honesty I think this is one of the best directed movies of all time. Alfonso Cuarón changed the Harry Potter series forever with his stunning, mature, and rather dark vision of Prisoner of Azkaban. Some of his shots are beautiful, especially when he zooms in and out through the clock tower when the go back in time. He is and extremely creative director and although he only did one Harry Potter movie, he has forever left his mark on the series. The acting from the young trio is also much improved--they seem more comfortable as students in their magical world, and definitely more comfortable as friends. They are growing up and dealing with many new issues and emotions, such as stress, despair, and anger, but also friendship and love. It is really amazing to just watch the entire young cast interact with each other in such a realistic way.The supporting cast is also great, especially the new additions of David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, who tries to be kind and helpful despite his inner torment, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, who, as usual, was flawless in his insane interpretation. Something must also be said for Michael Gamban, who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and seems to have added a level of seriousness and maturity that goes along with the kids' growing up. Everyone else does a fine job too, but some more that stood out were Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, and Fiona Shaw.However, I cannot say enough about the new vision this gives to the Harry Potter series. Even the landscape has changed to one that's much more wild and untamed, and the use of lighting made the entire film more grey. The costumes, too, are less childish, as the actors in a way got to dress themselves, and it definitely shows. This movie is really fantastic--there's just something about the story that gets to you. It's so imaginative, and really in the end the only enemy is fear itself. Nothing is necessarily defeated, just overcome, yet it is all the satisfying because of this.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
372,Devil_Boy_80,Keep Them Coming...,8,10 July 2005,"This is my most favorite sequel so far, dark like the second film...and we sort of take a break from voldemort trying to kill harry! and we are introduced to another great character Sirius Black...Harry Potter's Godfather (but people and read and own the books like me knew that ages ago)...and the bit with aunt Marge is terrific...here's the plot...For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard ""accidentally"" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the non-magic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? The best sequel so far and i have i high expectations for the next film...the only disappointing part was Richard Harris passing away and now a new actor plays dumbledore...sure he ain't as good as Richard...but i still think this new actor does a great job.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

375,fha-2,A Garbled Tale  A Lot of Fluff,5,2 June 2004,"So here we are with number three in the series of a now older 13 year-old Harry Potter that badly limps in story content.  Sure, the movie is full of neat special effects, cute scenarios, and spectacular sets; however, as far as a good tale is concerned, this screenwriter must have been absent during writing 101.  This fable keeps bouncing around from one implausible and twisted situation to another without rhyme nor reason to fortify its transitions.  If I wasn't enthralled by the effects presented on the giant IMAX screen at the Loew's IMAX, I probably would have spent considerably more time at the snack bar and the restroom.Many of the special effects seem to be a rip-off of the Lord of the Ring's last adventure.  Especially the Werewolf whose face, color and body is virtually identical to the incoherent, naked dwarf in LOTR who if you remember treks along with the heroes throughout the other movie.  The `Hippogriff', half bird and half horse, also seems similar to some creatures featured in LOTR.  Frankly, I was not too impressed with the rest of the CGI monsters made for the film.  The dreaded `Dementors', who ostensibly suck the soul out their victims, never seemed to be able to accomplish that task. They seem far better suited for an animated film than a feature.There were some funny moments, especially at the beginning when Harry casts a spell on his shrew of an Aunt by causing her to inflated grotesquely and float off into the sky over London.  His antagonists were lamely presented without nearly the intensity of the prior Potters.  In this muddled presentation it was difficult to establish who in fact the actual heavies were.  The movie jerks you back and forth until you don't know whom to hiss at any more, nor do you care.Had this film been better crafted, it would have been quite memorable in the IMAX format.  Now the format and the scenery are the star, leaving the film a mediocre children's tale.  I query whether even a child would be entertained by the confusion and ambiguity.  The stunning scenery and special sets are a delight to see; nevertheless, I would still pass on this puppy, unless of course you get to see it on the IMAX screen.Opens June 4th, 2004.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
376,Frogfisher,"Wonderful skilled directing and incredible film, but missing plot and story.",8,5 March 2005,"I love Harry Potter, and ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favourite book. The series has taken a large step in a new direction, from the two first Columbus made films. An understandable choice.What's wonderful about the stories is the way things are introduced as one thing and often turns out to be something else or have a significant role later on. A wonderful thing about the books, and therefor saying ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best is not saying that much. But ""Azkaban"" has some more important elements of seriousness and it is where, for me, the real story starts, where the fight between good and evil really starts. The two prior stories is an introduction to persons, with Harry and Tom Riddle as the most important. So I had some what high expectations to the film. They where mostly fulfilled, although I found quit a lot of holes. The news of Cuaron as Director had me some concerned, although it didn't scare me off, far from it. But when I heard of his work with Practical Magic on set, I actually found my self looking forward to the film. As always the film has the same magic to it as the books, the locations, sets and magic is fantastic, but by now that shouldn't be a problem for them. Rather what is the problem is story and acting. For once the acting is of a quality seldom seen in family films. Cuaron has made a great job with the young actors, and some of the scenes actually out matches the good old thesps. Incredible to see the actors growth that way, how they evolve into the characters. This is something I really appreciate. It makes this much darker installment of the series more realistic and gives a feel of the story, that to some degree lacked in the two prior. The cast is good and solid, really works out fine, although Gambon as Dumbledore is a hard one to swallow after Harris' take on the role. But the rest is great, and most of all believable in their role, even Thewlis works as Lupin, although it is quit another direction from anything else i've seen him in.Cuaron's feel is in the movie. It is a director movie if anything, the use of cameras and it's movements, symbols and images that is repeated through out the films, long shots rather than fast editing and it work so well, it looks amazing, Prisoner is an example of what you get if a director is taken from the smaller movies where he had artistic liberty to the major films in Hollywood, would love if more films where like that. It is something few still possesses in Hollywood, like David Fincher and others. The long shots with dialog are impressive, and explains quit a large deal of the background of Harry and therefor some plots of the future films. And they again show the work between director and actors. The story is quit a problem, the important stories are as they are in the books, but being a director with his own ideas, Cuaron has changed some smaller parts to fit his vision and the movie, a shame, cuz somethings have a innocence in the book that the movie hasn't, and somethings are much more significant to the story than the film implies. They are the animagus-plot, Snapes connection to Black and co., some of the ""erotic"" feelings between the three friends, to soon in my opinion, and the fact that scenes are cut, most likely due to time constrains, fulfilling Trelawney's prophecy.As a fan I know much of the background and plot, but I figure that people who haven't read the books doesn't get the whole picture, a shame, cuz in Prisoner there lies so many things that explains who Harry's parents is and who his parents friends is. Guess they have to read the books then. As a series fan i'm sad that many things are missing, as a movie fan i'm impressed with the treatment of the media, which looks so great it blows me away, as a fan of both I'll give it 9, for the effort and the feel of the film, and because I know i'll be watching it again and again and again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
377,nbwritersinbox,JK And The Film World At Its Best,9,21 January 2011,"I liked this film so much, I read as many of the negative reviews as possible. (In an attempt to remain balanced!) Here, JK is at the height of her literary powers. So, I can completely sympathise with the dedicated book fans who shout loudly regarding the curse of film-making... Plot editing and adaptation.Despite the limitations of filming, one has to remember just how successful a writer Jo has become. A quick glance at her book sales will inform you of an astonishing achievement. To date: 400 million copies sold ... We may not be able to turn out a well-appointed table lamp in England anymore, but we sure produce the occasional literary genius.Am I wrong? Let's examine The Prisoner Of Azkaban's gorgeous list of well-drawn characters for a moment. There's the flawed, but caring Remus who takes Harry under his wing. There's the misunderstood, yet poignant outsider, Mr Sirius Black. There's a new, more determined and stronger Harry, a shining model of boyhood in a world where boys often remain maligned, or sidelined. (In this way, JK brilliantly punctures the absurd reverse-sexism that blights society).But let's not forget the girls..! Here, Hermione is redrawn as a courageous, chin-thumping adventurer. She takes the initiative, disseminates common sense with easy candour, makes intelligent decisions while the wizarding world dissembles. And most of all, she's a fierce friend. Every boy's dream? Almost certainly...But back to the film... The plotting here is immaculate. We're on a poignant journey with Harry from the moment he steps aboard that incredible bus. There's humour, there's suspense, there's a feeling of movement (so hard to capture with genuine precision on film). There's the brilliant casting decision to appoint Mr Oldman as Sirius. (He's played difficult parts before, namely his extraordinary portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK). In this sense, the casting choice is inspired.Emma Thompson's wonderful Professor Trelawney served as an enjoyable comic counterpoint in a film that was layered with foreboding. Emma is clearly enjoying herself as the bespectacled diviner. A small part for one of our finest English actresses, but By George, she makes the most of it! And let's not forget Timothy Spall. His sudden transformation into the crumbling, scabbed Wormtail lifts the film just at the right moment, due entirely to Spall's notable acting abilities. The other actors suddenly have opportunity aplenty to react and carry the narrative forward.Not only this, but we have the rarest of rare finales. A movie that makes us all feel better. Sirius wins his freedom. The true betrayer is unmasked! The Fab Three have matured and earned their stripes. Harry even has the semblance of a real family once more.Thank you J K Rowling. The fans may be correct that your story was mutilated, the hogwart's crowd may no longer be in uniform, the school and its grounds may have changed beyond all recognition, but these minor elements did nothing to detract from a thrilling, absorbing tale well told.Highlights:Fudge: ""Come now Harry, we don't send people to Azkaban for blowing-up their aunts!"" (This gem could have a double meaning, if we weren't immersed in the Wizarding World!)Hippogriff: Could you see the pixels? Every feather looked real...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
378,michael-turner13,Prisoner to the Series,9,3 October 2008,"The Harry Potter books and films have entranced people all over the world and it is easy to see why.Again they have stuck to the books which is a great decision. The darker atmosphere is very prominent, which I think is helped by the main characters entering Pubity.The Acting is superb just like the two previous instalments, most of the actors and actresses are able to capture the essence of the character.Next on the list is the soundtrack. This aspect of the film is splendid and adds to the dark tone of the storyline.On the other side of the coin are a couple of problems. One. the design of the werewolf. To me it was designed to look purely cruel and evil without any animal instincts whatsoever. Two, the choice of Michael Gambon as Dumbuldore. He seemed unable to get into the character as Richard Harris was.My last word is wonderful.

379,kwongers,easily the best movie so far in the series,10,1 July 2004,"""Azkaban"" was VERY impressive...I loved it.  Of course, it wasn't as good as the book, and the 3rd book is my absolute favorite in the series.  But still, enchanting and wonderful all the same.  (I can't believe what Roger Ebert wrote in his review; he wrote some crazy stuff about this 3rd movie not being as good as the first two.  I disagree completely; this 3rd movie is easily the best.  Lots of heart.) Mind you, it will probably be difficult to follow if you haven't read the book, but if you have, this is what the movies are supposed to be about.  Great, impressive acting in this movie, from all the adult actors (props especially to the new people Emma Thompson (Trelawney), David Thewlis (Lupin) and the always wonderful Gary Oldman (Sirius Black)...they were great) and surprisingly from all the kid actors too.  I think Hermione and Harry are hot; whereas they were kids in the first two movies, they are turning into physically beautiful/handsome teens.  Ron was good as always and is responsible for some of the funniest moments in the film.  What I also liked about this movie was that a lot of it dealt with the kids going through puberty and their fears/pains of being 13.  It was very sexually-loaded...there are some scenes between Hermione and Ron and Harry that are incredible to watch, not because I'm a kinky person, but because it was so beautiful.  The look and feel of this movie are also wonderful.  The setting (using cooler, blue and gray shades) and cinematography are totally awesome...it's a darker, scarier Harry Potter world, but still with a lot of charm.  This movie is also far funnier than the other two, even though it deals with a lot more serious stuff.  Also impressive: the CGI was neato.  There's this cool thing that the Whomping Willow does that jockeys at the use of the CGI. (And a lot of it looks real...there's none of the fakey, used-car salesman kind of thing that they used in ""Troy"" with those terrible CGI armies.) 
In short, ""Azkaban"" ROCKS!!!!  It's a wonderful movie and you should see it at least once on the big screen.  Nothing short of magical.  10/10, definitely.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I reckon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is much more action packed than the first two films which to me made it more enjoyable. The ""scary moments"" really helped the story flow, and gave older viewers a break from the more childish moments. The scene where Harry and the gang go back in time worked out well and is understandable, the other good news is that there is not too much magical jargon appearing in your brain as you watch the movie. Better still were guaranteed at least two more Harry potter films, which means Harry and Hermione will most certainly being going out, maybe we can even expect a end of year prom...?Such is magic 9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Cuaron definitely makes a better fist of it than Chris Columbus, and the appearance of the film is good. All the other parts are played well, even Gary Oldman manages to restrain himself for once.The funniest thing for me was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and his bizarre choice of accent. He sounded like Dennis Taylor (the snooker player). I couldn't help but snigger.Overall, not a bad kid's (but not too young) film, I'd say.

387,Boromir28,Thought I hated it...,8,29 July 2009,"...turns out I love it!For a very long time this movie was my absolute least favorite of all the HP films. It has largely to do with the fact that the cinematography changed massively from the first two to this one and I had trouble adapting to this new cinematic style.However, after a recent HP marathon I came to the conclusion that Alfonso Cuarón was able to capture the darker mood of the book much better than Chris Columbus ever would have been able to, and in fact seems to have a better grip on the universe than the following directors (read David Yates). In Columbus' movies the childlike innocence worked as Harry hasn't begun to fathom the elements of his life and his parents death, but he would not have been able to turn this book into the great movie it is. Although Cuarón changed a lot of the ways Hogwarts looks it actually is better as in this way the wildness of the Scotish mountainside really becomes much more profound.The elements of the book that were significant for understanding the story were well explained and as a coherent story it works very well. The actors all did a really good job and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton all showed that they have grown since the first two films and particularly Emma Watson was allowed to show her qualities as an actress (a feat she has been so incredibly denied since David Yates took over).The new characters introduced were also great casted David Thewliss as the soft spoken, haunted Remus Lupin quite simply stole every scene he had on screen with his underplaying. He fitted the part perfectly and he really conveyed the love he had for Harry's parents as well as the affection he has for Harry with exceptional artistic quality. As for the rugged and insane Sirius Black, no one else could have played the part as well as Gary Oldman. Unfortnately he isn't on screen much, but in the few scenes he has he really nails the essence of his character. Now Michael Gambon had some pretty big shoes to fill, and I feel that he never completely steps out of the shadow of Harris (which also is felt in the sequels) however I must say that he is far more like the Rowling Dumbledore in this one than in the next three films. Also Timothy Spall shows his quality as the loathsome, pitiful Peter Pettigrew and you feel that the casting director had the best luck in the world with these positions (which I generally feel as not one single character within the entire HP universe could have been played by others than those who play them). All in all Harry Potter and Prizoner of Azkaban is probably my favorite so far, tied maybe with Goblet of Fire, and I (unlike previously) would have liked to see Alfonso Cuarón finish the series as I think he would have done a far better job than David Yates.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

389,mary-262,EH...ho hum,6,5 June 2004,"My family saw this movie...my husband and two young children. There were scary parts of this movie that my toddler did not like atall, so first off be wary of taking very young children to this movie. My 8 year old loved the movie.  We've seen the first two moviesprobably 40 times each [no joke]...we are huge fans of the booksand movies.  This movie was really hyped by critics who didn't like the firstmovies.  Frankly, I was hyped myself to see the third installment,as I had hoped for an edgier film.  It is an edgier film.  But most ofthe camera angles left me feeling as if I'd just watched a homemovie...you know how you get that feeling of vertigo?  Sort ofmotion sickness?  That's what I came away with, and found outlater that my eldest child and husband came away that way too. So, be forewarned.  If you are a ""slave to the story"" the way Rowling wrote it, you will bedisappointed.  There are scenes in it that are completely rewritingthe book.  Many things were cut out.  And I can respect that, due tothe sheer length of Rowling's recent HP books.  Understandableindeed.  However, it seems that a little too much trimming tookplace, and part of the joy of watching the characters interact waslost.  And I suppose in a sad way that's how it will continue giventhe length of the following HP books.  If they are to be adapted tothe screen, cutting will have to be done.  Also, did it strike anyone else as odd that the characters,especially ""Harry Potter"" himself Daniel Radcliffe, grew so quickly? His physical growth was really representative of the othercharacters quick physical growth as well....many actors grewconsiderably from a physical standpoint.  And then it hit me...thiswhole series will be over so quickly...and then they will be nomore.  What will we ever do without Harry Potter and that wonderfulworld that Rowling created.  Frankly, she is a master at characterdevelopment, and I'll miss that when she writes her last on thisseries.  All the things you read/hear about this movie are true:  The movieis edgier, darker, more mature in nature, and downright scarier foryounger children.  Something wicked this way comes....and I wish it would havestayed around a little longer.  I gave it a 6 out of 10.  The filming left something to be desired.  Alittle too much liberty taken with the actual story.  Not enoughcharacter development where you actually cared for the charactersthis time around.  And the background renderings left you wantingto hurl at particular points.  Go and see it.  Just leave yourexpectations lower than before with the other two.  And let's praythat they don't fire the younger actors for looking too ""old.""",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
390,sdillon-1,Not as good as the book,6,7 June 2004,"Widely considered the best book in the series, Harry Potter part three is cracking read.  A darker addition to the Potter canon, it deals with the escape of murderer Sirius Black from Azkaban (not a middle eastern country but a wizard prison).  Apparently responsible for betraying Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, Black is now after Harry too.  His friends and teachers all want to protect him, but Harry has something else on his mind: revenge.It's therefore a great shame to report that this instalment, despite a visual makeover, a new director, and better performances from the lead actors, remains depressingly pedestrian in comparison to the novel.  All the keystone events of the book are present, yet the screenplay shows undue reverence to the source material, again forgetting the adage `Show, don't tell'.  For example, just as the first film ought to have opened with the murder of Harry's parents, this one ought to have opened with Black's dramatic arrest after his apparent murder of Peter Pettigrew.The Dementors, Ringwraith-like guardians of Azkaban prison, are initially frightening but fail to remain menacing as the film progresses.  Not enough effort is made to make us afraid of Black.  Key moments of emotional weight from the book are skimmed over, especially in the finale.  The performances are OK, especially from Daniel Radcliffe who has improved tremendously, and Gary Oldman is well cast as Sirius Black, but one expects better from Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.  The only really memorable turn comes from David Thewlis' Professor Lupin.On the plus side, John Williams' music score is very good; building nicely on his outstanding score for the first film he contributes some fine new themes here.  Special effects look great too, especially Buckbeak the Hippogriff, a bizarre cross between an eagle and a horse.  The cinematography is fine, with the Glen Coe locations looking very beautiful. And director Alfonso Cuaron gives the whole piece a stylish makeover, clearly taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book.That said, this is not a huge improvement on films one and two, and given the source material should have been far better.  The real problem with the Harry Potter films is they still feel like a franchise following a formula, which is remarkable considering their unpredictable plots.  The old cliché is once again true; it's not as good as the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
391,MovieMaddis,Decent direction can't turn this movie into anything but a big game of Clue.,6,7 June 2004,"Not being one of the hoards of pre-teen Harry Potter fans wanting to jump back into Hogwarts for another round of magic and mayhem, I was probably one of the few who went to see what acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" fame had done with the story.  Would Harry and Ron take Hermione on a fun filled road trip to the beach having various erotic encounters along the way?  Not likely.What I found was more of the same from the other pictures.  If you are a fan and have read everything about the young wizard, you are sure to find a treat in seeing it play out on the big screen.  However as just another muggle with a penchant for movie watching, the story line can be a bit boring and dare I say soap operish at times.  As with the end of the last film, I felt like we were in the middle of a big game of Clue, with the Prisoner of Azkaban in the cabin with the candlestick as one of the many possible scenarios.Visually stunning and special effect full, this latest entry was a pleasure to enjoy.  The camera shots are far superior to the work from the first two and you couldn't ask for better back drops for Harry and friends to fly, run, fight, and frolic as we wind down another chapter in Who Dun It mystery theater.Like Chinese food it's a fun ride but at the end a little unfulfilling.  How this film avoided PG-13 for scare and violence is beyond me.  6/10 Maddis.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
392,Moonhawk1975,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,10,7 April 2005,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his third year at Hogwarts, amid perceived threats to his life from the man (Gary Oldman) who escaped from wizard prison.Finally, after two movies they got it right. This chapter catches the spirit of the novels almost perfectly and far better than the previous adaptations. The cast is coming into their characters perfectly, the performances are getting better with each film. The scenes are edited together with much more fluidity than before. This feels like an actual movie and not a screening of scenes from the book. And this film has style; the camera no longer just sits still but moves all over the place. Credit must go to new director, Alfonso Cuaron. Taking over from Chris Columbus, he has succeeded at making a fantasy book look like a fantasy movie and not just a movie with fantasy elements. I hate to see him step down; hopefully he will return for another one. Another welcome addition is Oldman; he is a wonderful actor who plays his few scenes perfectly. My only complaint is the young actor's costumes. It's a bit jarring to see private school students in normal, everyday teen wear. In the years to come, this will probably date the movie more than the other two.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
393,shobill,Darker but still magical,8,19 September 2004,"If this third installment of the Harry Potter series doesn't quite match the magic of the first, it's because - well, this is a sequel, and the 'magic"" no longer surprises quite as much. While it has to be selective due to the fact the novels progressively get longer, this production remains faithful to the book. Alfonso Cuaron as the new series director has been given credit for adding a more substantive darker side and concentrating a bit less on special effects. Regarding the former, the material itself calls for a more grown-up story: the kid characters along with the actors are maturing, and their coming into full-fledged adolescence demands sterner character. There are humorous scenes, but the general tone is more serious, as in fact it must needs be, and Daniel Radcliffe, for one, shows himself quite capable of serious acting as Harry continues to discover his identity. And isn't that Eriksonian quest of youth in fact the real theme of Rowling's series? It looks like most of the cast will be back for the fourth installment: we'll get to see them grow up at least once more.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
394,Shrykespeare,"Better, Worse... Or Just Different?",7,8 June 2004,"I am a little ambivalent when I think about how this movie affected me. I left the theater having not enjoyed myself nearly as much as the first two, that's for sure... but there was a lot to enjoy about the movie anyway.Let me start by saying that I have not read any of the books; take that in any way you want.If I didn't already know that there was a different director this time out, it would have been apparent immediately. Chris Columbus did such a magnificent job of translating the first two books to the screen that I expected something very similar here, but that's not the impression POA left on me.The whole tone of the story was so much darker and scarier than the first two stories, I wasn't sure how to react: it wasn't really scary enough to be called a ""scary"" movie, but it was also not ""fun"" enough to really call it enjoyable. Maybe that was the point, because I've been told that the books are the same way.Let me list the things that I enjoyed the most:1. The acting jobs of Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Those three have become the embodiment of their characters, so much so that I hope they won't be typecast once the HP movies are over and done with.2. Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape. He exudes arrogance and disdain but I am convinced deep down he feels admiration and protective of Harry. I have a feeling that something big will brew between them down the line.3. The overall atmosphere at Hogwart's. This is a place where supernatural and otherworldly things happen hourly, but until now the place has seemed like a funfair haunted house. Kudos to Cuaron for doing that, although I did miss John Cleese's character!4. The Dementors - a truly scary sight, and well realized.What I didn't like:1. What made the first two movies ""fun"" were the parts that could be described as ""kid stuff"" - the innocence and inexperience with doing magic, the Quiddich matches, etc. All of that was missing here. Yes, I know the kids are older and more experienced, but they are STILL KIDS. Emma Thompson's character said it best when she told Hermione that she had the heart of an old maid (or words to that effect). Kids are most enjoyable to watch when they having FUN being kids. Even the Quiddich match in this movie was dreary, an extension of the seriousness of the plot rather than a break from it.2. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - granted, stepping into Richard Harris's shoes is a very tall order (no pun intended), and I have nothing against Michael as an actor, but I have come to think of Dumbledore as a warm, charming, kindly character, rather like Santa Claus with magical powers. Michael tried his best to pull it off, but some of the warmth was just missing.3. The omittance of Maggie Smith's character - it was her matronly demeanor, so typical of schoolmarms the world over, that added such as sense of believability to the first two movies. In this movie, she was practically a non-entity. Let's get this straight; Maggie Smith is a classically-trained, experienced actress with an acting resume that stretches back decades, and I applaud whoever convinced here to play this role, and keep playing it. Again, maybe her diminished role in this movie was in keeping with the book, which I haven't read, but I was very disappointed in her absence.4. The ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" Teacher - three movies, three teachers, with yet another one coming in the fourth installment. It's almost become a running joke that whoever takes the position will not last the movie, rather like the drummers in Spinal Tap!I don't know in what direction this series is headed; the fourth installment, ""The Goblet of Fire"", is being filmed as we speak and will probably be released next summer. I am glad that they handed the reins over to Mike Newell, a veteran director with a proved track record for hits. For those who don't know, he has directed such films as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""Enchanted April"", and going further back, the ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" on TV. I think that this is an excellent choice - I am hoping that he can infuse some of the ""fun"" back into the series without taking away from the more serious overtones of it.Just as we enjoy kids grow up on TV, I too enjoy watching these kids grow up on the screen. Next time out, I understand that for the first time there will be romantic interests for both Harry and Hermione. In Harry's case, it will be with an Asian character whose name I don't know; the actress playing her will be a complete unknown, which is just what the director wanted. As for Hermione, maybe she'll hook up with Ron - if she and Harry are not going to become involved, Ron would be the next best choice! The other supporting kids probably won't change their characters much; Neville will still be a bit of a weenie, Draco will be an arrogant prick, etc.For those reading this who skipped over the body of this review and are only reading the final line, I'll just say this - if you are a stalwart Harry Potter fan, you must see this movie. If you enjoy fantasy movies where kids are the stars, you should see this movie. But if you go expecting the same kind of movie as the first two, you will be disappointed.My score: 7 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Favourite bit: boys dormitory scene (not for that reason!)It seemed very rushed though, when you know the original so well it's hard to leapfrog through the story like that.Gary Oldman was great, David Thewlis was perfectly good acting wise but not quite right for me as Lupin. The new Dumbledore had two problems; his accent was a bit distracting and he had a McGonagall clone thing going on in his mannerisms. Hermione was no longer irritating, a feat I did not think was possible, although she did rather take over the story towards the end of the movie. Ron was sweet, Harry was better though still shaky in places and Malfoy was hot. Neville looks really different and both Seamus and the Weasley twins were leaps and bounds better acting wise. Crookshanks was perfect. The set and style were really really good. The Dementors were awesome and scary and Buckbeak was pretty cool. The werewolf effects were pretty good too.The new direction has improved the film by leaps and bounds from the previous two, most particularly by improving all of the children's acting.

Hopefully, the probability of a Harry IV are very thin, thanks to the fact that everyone grows up, as in this movie the aging of faces and ideas clearly shows up.

397,puiu,what about the plot holes?,5,9 December 2004,"I thought this was the best of the series so far, until it got to the ""back in time"" sequence, when Harry and Hermione try to save the day. Now, let's see: I hate it when a film leaves interesting questions unanswered, or worse, forgets about them on the way. 1. How did Sirius escape from Azkaban and tricked the dormentors? (I hope that's what they're called :) 2. Indeed, Harry has a point towards the end of the movie: nothing is changed with Sirius's escape. Everybody would think he's a murderer who managed to flee. The truth that the 3 little wizards and us know about Sirius is still unknown to the rest of the world (fictional one, that is). 3. And now, here comes the best one, which i think has to do with the way the screenwriters and the director understand the notion of TIME. Or it's sheer stupidity... Let's say that the action of the movie, the way we see it, is a perpetuous present. When Harry and Hermione mess with the time artifact, they go back in the past to modify the future. The problem is some actions we see in the present (the stones thrown in Hagrid's hut, Hermione calling the werewolf, Harry performing the superspell) are coming from the future (the moment when Harry goes back in time comes after those three moments mentioned above, therefore it is the future on the axis of time). What I mean is this: how could the characters hear the stones, the werewolf shout, or see the spell, if these actions never took place? They will take place in the future (of course, by going back in time) It's a little bit tricky and maybe i don't make it clear, but this is a huge plot hole. Maybe someone else tries to explain this better than I? Or at least is there somebody out here who agrees with me?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

This movie was amazing...the cinematography was the most stunning work i have ever seen on film(and i'm a movie buff and photographer)! It was a visual feast for the eyes...the other potter movies never gave the feel of a magical environment,this did.The night scenes were so beautifully shot that that you felt immersed in an outerworldly realm of magic both good and bad every second.The overall story telling was brilliant and well paced, and i found the story to be very dark and mature.Some moments are a bit too scary for small children ,but everyone should find something to like.This one was about maturing as people and wizards.....and the 3 kids have matured as actors as much as there characters have on screen.It is a travesty that this director doesn't continue with the series.

I never thought he was bad as Harry, but he plays him best here. Probably because he has had two movies to practice. Rupert Grint as Ron is very funny, and Emma Watson plays Hermione perfectly.

400,Perdicus,Too much change,10,5 June 2004,"I agree 100% with the other critics in this forum; the director changed too much from the book; this was butchery, not editing. Hardly any character development, no real explanation of the relationship between Moony/Padfoot/Wormtail/Prongs, Dumbledore, McGonagall & Snape reduced to almost nothing...well I could go on and on, but it's been said already.I loved ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", but the quirky, offbeat humor & charm of that movie (not to mention the previous two HP movies) is entirely missing here. The director wanted ""darker"", and he got it, but ""better""? Um, no.
Good points; lots of screen time for Prof. Lupin (possibly why other, established characters got such short shrift), Honeydukes & Hogsmeade (brief glimpse of both), Malfoy & co. get whupped--twice!--and the Dementors were truly terrifying.

I have not read the book, nor I have read any HP book, BTW, but I think this desserved to last at least 90 more minutes. Many events such as the quidditsch match or HP adoptive family have been neglected. Actually, there were lenghty moments as well, like the bus ballad or Harry flying across the lake but I can accept these part were that lenghty (not long). So, the perfect Harry Potter would be as dense as the second one, as magic as the first (which benefitted from the surprise effect) and as intimate as this one. I also loved the fact it didn't have a real climax but rather soemthing really cleverly put together instead, I won't spoil around but I liked the way Harry could get two views of the same scene. Anyway, it was good enough to get a respectable 7.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
402,Jonny-ironica,Good but disappointing,5,7 June 2004,"I have read all 5 Harry Potter books that are out at the time and so far, number 3 is my favorite. You can imagine my excitement in wanting to see this movie. The first one was okay and the second one was much better. Learning a new director was behind this one thrilled me even more, thinking 'Excellent, it'll appear new and be the best movie too'. Wrong. Very wrong. *May contain Spoilers after here* Okay, what enraged me the most was the sudden handgrabbing with Hermione and Ron. That was never even thought of in the book because they fought through almost the entire thing! How dare the stupid movie makers/writers even try to give people that haven't read the book that idea! Another quality I disliked was that they rarely showed teachers from previous movies, it showed not one Charms, Transfiguration, or Potions class. Find that alittle odd? You see Professor McGonagal and Dumbledore maybe three times throughout the film. Next, I must be angry with the wardrobers! Why were they in normal clothing almost throughout the entire thing! We even saw before that outside of classes they still had to wear uniforms! Another thing is the explanation of things. The pace of this movie was too fast and they never explained that Moony was Remus Lupin, Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew, Padfoot was Sirius Black, and Prongs was James Potter. They also didn't explain how Sirius escaped from Azkaban. Other various things were left out. The ending, which usually has Harry leaving the train was left out completely(I mean, all the books ended that way, the movie should've too). Instead we get a shot of Harry trying out his Firebolt...Overall, this movie was worse than the first two but, thankfully, the idiot director will not be returning for the fourth, they've gotten someone else.There were some good things in the movie but not enough to save it overall. Buckbeak was cute and real looking which gave the film a bonus of noncrappy special effects. The dementors were awesome even though I never pictured them flying but that made it scarier. As usual, the use of magic was good and the acting improved.I give the film a 6 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
403,Seamus-25,"Darker, slightly rushed - but still great fun",8,6 June 2004,"Start off by saying this was my favourite book of the 5 released so far. The first two are a little bit childish (as is their intention - no problem with that) the last two are a little bit padded. Prisoner of Azkaban the book had the perfect blend of active story and back story (for me). So I was really looking forward to the film but was a little bit dubious about the running time, fearing that essential elements of the book would be cut. My fears were realised when seeing the film. Several important elements of the book were removed or shortened to fit into the film's running time which I feel detracted from the film a little bit, including the origin of the Marauders Map, the relationship between all the parties involved etc. The pace of the film was very fast as it tried to cram in as much as possible leaving no time to pause and reflect on the characters. The character of Sirius, although played well by Gary Oldman, was not on screen enough and the fear of his impending presence was not put across well enough (in the books he is so feared that even the ""muggle"" police have heard of him).The three main characters did a reasonable job again - especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson who I feel are getting better each film.Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was a little under used as he was important character in the book and was terrific in the first 2 films.Good things. special effects were, as expected, excellent. Buck Beak looked awesome. The Dementors looked pretty good as well. The Dementor ""Effect"" was well realised and did a pretty good job of visualising the slightly difficult concept of having your happiness sucked out of you.For all the minor niggles i raised earlier i still loved this film - great fun, a little scary in parts for younger children (the werewolf scenes were excellent).8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

405,dmbjam29,The Best Harry Potter Film So Far,8,12 June 2007,"As many fans of the series will agree the third book, 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" is the best book. Similar to its literary counterpart, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies is also the best so far!Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and gang are in their third year at Hogwarts and new dangers and adventures lie around the corner. Primarily, Sirius Black (Gary Oldham) is a prisoner who has escaped Azkaban prison and is believed to be after Harry. This is because Sirius supposedly played an integral part in the death of Harry's parents.The film-making, along with the plot, become considerably darker. Many scenes occur through thunderstorms and ominous dark clouds. The lighting hardly ever gets light or happy, but rather filled with an abundance of black and gray tones.But what makes this movie the best is the plot. You must compliment the director completely for letting the amazing plot and storyline carry the movie. He does not try to overact, overproduce or over-do any scenes. He just lets the characters develop in the scenes and the plot carries the story from there.This is the best of the first 3 Harry Potter films and contains a more mature watch-ability level than the two previous films. This is a movie that older children, young adults and parents will all enjoy.8 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
406,godzillandg,It's not that it was bad...,6,22 October 2007,"Just that it wasn't the movie we wanted it to be. It was inevitable that the movie wouldn't as good as it predecessors, because we lost Dumbledore. Richard Harris was Dumbledore. Soft spoken, yet very firm. Gentle, but also powerful. And he just looked like the most brilliant man on Earth. The second reason was that we had a new director with a new vision of how the movie would look. Now on to what worked. The dementors, looked good. The sets, incredible. The scenery, amazing. And the acting, better. But the most amazing thing is the producers, and others, who find the actors to play these characters. Gary Oldman, perfect. Timothy Spall, well chosen. And forgive me I forgot his name but the man who play Lupin, is spot on.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
407,dark_elf02,"The third film darker, but better",10,4 June 2005,"I'm a big fan of all of the harry potter films, but I have found this one to be the best of all. First off I would like to mention how much I admire Michael Gambons performance as Dumbledore. I think I admired it because he didn't try to duplicate the late Richard Harris's dead on creation of Dumbledore. He instead showed how he perceived Dumbledore to be and while it is not quite as perfect as Harris's it is his own.The film was also much darker but I liked that. I feel like the films are getting darker because Harry is maturing while facing dangers that get darker as each book and films goes by. I also liked how the film wasn't a perfect carbon copy of the book, and that some liberties were taken.I feel like the actors really know their characters now, and have grown in talent as well. You have to remember that for the three main leads these movies pretty much are their whole list of movies they have acted in. They are getting better with each film. In particular Emma Watson has made her character into the strongest of the three.I see great things to come in future films and I eagerly anticipate Goblet of Fire coming towards the end of the year. As for this one I say darker is better(and yes there were light-hearted moments to lighten the mood)so keep it going.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
408,SrCAPnCDLvl99,Could this be the worst book-to-film translation ever?,6,9 June 2004,"Could it be? This is so far from the source material that you must ask yourself what happened. Someone in the long order of crewpeople involved with this film must've gotten something terribly wrong for it to turn into this. Sure the main plot and all the most important scenes are there, but the end product here feels like a film where they've taken parts from one half of the book, placed it in the wrong order and then thrown in a little action from the other half of the book. I'm sure most of you agree with this? At least those of you that read the book. Some short 20 minutes or so into the film we're already more than halfway through the book and many key scenes have been dropped. And what's with the ending? Are they serious? This is from the middle of the book if I don't remember something completely wrong here, and the fact that they actually skipped almost everything quidditch, which is one of the most beloved ingredients of the Harry Potter books puzzles me. This is something that will disappoint a lot of children during the week.Don't get me wrong. I DO understand that sometimes drastic measures has to be taken in order for the film version of a book to not be overly long. I also understand that some scenes that are less important has to be thrown out and other scenes altered or sized up. However, it has been done far better before, and I just can't help that the disappointment feels more bitter that ever before. I sure hope Columbus is back for the next one. I want the MAGIC!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
409,gercs,"Wasn't able to capture the book's power, but technically remarkable Potter film",8,25 December 2014,"As an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, I'm a bit disappointed the very first time I saw it. At first, I find the minimalist approach rather awkward given the ""loud"" first two films. When compared to the experience I had with the book, it lacked the powerful drive of the story. It was also disappointing to find out that they excluded many twists and other amusing details that were found in the book. I thought that the film brought injustice to an avid reader, but I also thought that it was also unjust to undermine the film's quality. The visuals were impressive, and the unique storytelling was a breakthrough in the series. It was certainly better than the first two because it was a sublime Potter movie, a film that may be enjoyed both by children and adults alike. It's quality is close to the films that you see in a critic's top ten of the year; and yes, it can be a critic's fave.I watched the film for the second time, no longer as an avid reader; thereby watching the film just the way it was, as a standalone film without any comparison to the book. The experience was much better this time. Disappointment transformed into amusement and even admiration. There were lots of humor ""bits"" in it and most of them were not easily noticed (some were rather dry actually). They could be found even in scenes where they were least expected. Just let the director take you, and you may find amusement in many of its details. I think that Harry Potter was at last given a chance to show its magnificent and competitive side in this adaptation.Relative to the performances in the first two films, the acting has improved. Harry, Ron, and Hermione owned their characters more. The new Dumbledore was energetic, and I thought he was fascinating although he wasn't able to get the mysterious and gentle side of the late Richard Harris' Dumbledore. Not all acting were very convincing for me, but at least it was much better this time. The direction was great. Alfonso Cuaron gave a sophisticated approach to the film; it was also a film that adults may enjoy too. The musical score was minimalist, and it had many ""little"" tunes in it. Additional themes were composed by John Williams, and I could remember best the music during Buckbeak's flight and the theme during the time when Harry and Lupin were talking about Harry's parents. What I find lacking in the score, however, was a unifying theme given a more varied landscape of music. Speaking of the effects, Buckbeak, the Whooping Willow, and the dementors were the most impressive creations. The downside, however, happened during the werewolf scene. Other than that, the scenes looked vibrant, and they were colored such that they looked less monotonous, as opposed to the palette of the first two films. Hogwarts and the surroundings looked better in this film. The third film improved many things about a Potter movie. It was not close to the book's power but it managed to capture its essence. As a film, it was a bit short to be called a masterpiece, but the production quality was already remarkable for a Potter movie. It could disappoint as many fans as it could, but I think it was generally a good movie to watch. To the avid readers, may a modified viewing approach work on you; but I think this movie will work best on those who have not yet read the book but who have seen the first two films already.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
410,2001mmFilm,8 Great Movies. 1 True Masterpiece.,10,8 December 2020,"You really get a sense of the filmmaker behind the movie here. Chris Columbus's films were brilliant in their warmth and whimsy, but you never got the sheer stylistic watermark present here. Alfonso Curaon's Prisoner of Azkaban can be isolated from the remaining 7 Harry Potter's, and standing alone you'd still have a piece of movie magic.The approach this time round was to ground the fantastical story in raw human emotion. You don't find scenes like Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) talking to Harry on the bridge about his parents, teaching him how to conjure a Patronus, or Buckbeak soaring across the castle (during either night or day) anywhere in the other films... These are powerful images, no doubt reinforced by John Williams final musical contribution to the series. The score here is near his best work, and for a composer like John, that really IS saying something. There's these jaunty, folklorish melodies coupled with the standard grandiose orchestrations we've grown accustomed to. As a result, the atmosphere of 'Prisoner' is bar-none. Alfonso called the film a transitional piece, between childhood and teenage years for our three protagonists. We see it. We feel it. ""HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!"" Daniel Radcliffe shouts, with real conviction in his voice. Or when he stands up for his father's sullied name against the despicable Aunt Marge. This isn't the same boy from the preceding films. He is growing. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) adorably struggle to contain their affection toward one another. It's all rather beautiful, and again, rather real. Moreover, and this again may be mainly compliments of John Williams, the entire film has this tremendous sense of scope and romanticism, even if it is the third part of a franchise. It's been treated as a singular entity.Prisoner of Azkaban still retains some of that jolly atmosphere leftover from Christopher Columbus's films. The balance between this and the newly introduced tone is perfect, while later entries gradually tended to lean more towards all dark. There's still fun to be had here, (Aunt Marge blowing up, the Knight Bus, the Ridiculous lesson) and even some subtle humour between Harry and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Michael Gambon is a completely amicable replacement for the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; a little more cheeky in his portrayal. Still, you can always sense the eminent power beneath these demeanours. It's the closest Gambon ever came to JK Rowling's vision of the character.There are moments in The Prisoner of Azkaban which never fail to remind me why it's a masterpiece. Lupin and Harry discussing Lily and James Potter, (somehow creating history and texture for these people we've never met before on the spot). Harry shouting ""WHOO!"" atop Buckbeak, flying over Hogwarts' majestic vistas, free of Privet Drive and finally back home. His heartfelt, one-off time travelling adventure with Hermione. Casting the Patronus to save his Godfather's life, and Sirius's parting words to them...This movie is resonant like a high-voltage cable.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
411,Pegapus,Quite excellent with a great visual sense,9,6 June 2004,"Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids ""in the novel"" ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his ""A Little Princess"" from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. ""Princess"" is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just ""actors"" like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
412,mei_ling0215,Best adaptation of Harry Potter films,10,5 June 2004,"Today I saw Prisoner of Azkaban, it's a wonderful adaptation movie! Though many plots in the novel did really cut, Alfonso Cuaron did a great job to make story for reasonable connection for running time less than 2 hours and a half. Especially he mix humor into fantasy very naturally and made us laughed heartily. Not like Columbus first two films, we just felt awkward laugh! And Daniel's Harry, we can feel his performance is a great impovement. His face expression show the frightening and a little bit hatred. Finally the movie become self-contained story, no need to be compared by the books.

413,whistlestop,Definitely better!,6,2 June 2004,"Contains NOT spoilers, but important background info for anyone who hasn't read the book!!Saw this yesterday, loved it - always my favourite book of the five so far. Just wondered WHY they didn't explain the extremely important significance of the identity of the ""Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs"" characters - I thought this was one of the central points of the book, that the marauders map was made by James Potter, Lupin, Pettigrew and Sirius Black when they were at Hogwarts. We were all amazed that it wasn't included.Apart from that, the whole package is better than the previous two films - the kids have matured as actors, although now they look a little too mature to be thirteen-year-olds, and the special effects are just brilliant - loved the Knight Bus, Buckbeak, and Aunt Marge getting blown up, though the werewolf wasn't quite as convincing. Michael Gambon seems to rejuvenated Dumbledore, making him speak faster (thank goodness!) and giving him a sprightly mischieviousness. I loved Harris but this is good too.

When faced with the boggart, the greatest fear is fear itself. In the face of fear, escape is useless, only true happiness, strong positive energy, can resist.

415,cinna665,Magnificent magic!,8,9 June 2004,"I saw this movie yesterday and it was exactly as good as I was hoping it to be! I love Harry Potter's story and Azkaban is my favourite of the books - and Cuaron really made the story a magical experience.Chris Columbus made a good work with Potters 1 and 2, but the movies were more children's fairy tales. Cuaron really cathces the dark mood of the third book and brings all magic to life without using fancy ""wizardy"" clothes - he puts the magic in the persons and the world.The new Hogwarts is placed in a beautiful location - I truly loved the gothic style buildings and the way the camera was used behind and around the beautiful objects.The CG in the animagi was brilliant. Nothing too fancy, but more realistic and especially creepy and disturbing, like the book is.The young actors have really grown during the time, just like their characters. They have also grown as actors and were much more comfortable in front of the camera this time. I also liked the new Dumbledore: Gambon actually made this character somehow stronger, like he is in the book, as Harris always seemed so fragile... Gary Oldman was awesome as Sirius Black - everything I was hoping for my favourite character!There were of course changes from the original story, but most of those did not really matter. The book and the movie are after all different media. I was hoping more clarification about the Marauder's Map, as well as Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs.Despite the small flaws this was a magnificent experience!I give it a full 10 points :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
416,maatmouse,A tough third year for Harry,7,6 September 2005,"Following both the Harry Potter books and the progress made on the films has been fascinating, not least in guessing what will remain in the film and what won't.It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and already there he is in trouble both with his horrible adopted family (the dreadful Dursleys) and with the Ministry of Magic for finally getting fed of them and leaving but not before swelling his aunt to the size of a small air balloon and sending her flying. Picked up by the Knights Bus (I wish we had one of those), Harry finds himself back into the world he knows and loves much sooner. But, unlike other children, there is trouble in his direction - in the form of Sirius Black, escaped convict and possible traitor to Harry's dead parents.The film concentrates quite well on the key points: the dementors (shades of Tolkien's ringwraiths creeping in here) and Sirius Black as well as Harry's struggles with his life situation (Voldemort wants him dead and he has to live in the holidays with the Dursleys). All this and Quidditch and, of course, growing up.This film is considerably more grown up than the other two. Radcliffe is able to give the character a much needed shot of teenage stroppiness and inject some frustration as Harry realises that he has much to overcome as well. He is helped in his task by Professor Lupin, his new Defence against the dark arts teacher who helps Harry considerably against the dementors and gives him more much needed insights into his parents' own characters by revealing what his father really was like. Added to that, Gary Oldman is perfect as escaped convict and would be murderer Sirius Black.My only disappointment is that Gambon was perhaps not the right choice for Professor Dumbledore, playing him more like an elderly old hippy grandfather given to muttering strange stuff than the old, wise grandfather Dumbledore which was Harris'. Hopefully after the Goblet of Fire - he can settle into the role.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
417,gollumsmeagolrocks,Mischief has finally been managed with this one!,10,28 May 2016,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban is a stunning shift for the franchise's structure and longevity. While The Chamber Of Secrets kept the aesthetic of the first but improved upon it with additions to the aesthetic, the Prisoner of Azkaban decided to make the successfully prestigious choice of continuing that trend but on a more extreme level and in a way that has since lasted with each installment after in the franchise, most definitely for the better.This shift in aesthetic is simple: only keep the new parts of the aesthetic of the previous entry and add more. Chamber barely did this, keeping the adventurous tone of the previous entry but raising the stakes and featuring more of the Wizarding World's involvement as a whole. Thus, keeping the new parts, Azkaban features the Wizarding World as a whole and the high stakes, but adds the menace and frightful tone of the enemies. This starts the trend of making each film a hybrid of the film before it and the film after it, which works to make each film transition the series further away from the lighthearted start and closer to the dark, Gothic ending without the shift feeling too abrupt.Most notably, this film feels like the first film where we truly see the Wizarding World as a whole, something that was missing from the earlier two films. Yes, the magic was introduced and magic as a whole was explained and explored, but not this world it existed in or the culture around it very much. The early films were very isolated to just Hogwartz and some alley, not showing us very much of the Wizarding World in the scheme of things. This movie is the best at enriching the fictional universe without a doubt, really accomplishing some great world-building while not suffering from the flaw of the first film which had the world-building so present it overshadowed the main plot of the film.In fact, this is one of the most compelling of the narratives that plague Harry each year. We feel so much genuine suspense and tension, something that was distinctly not present at all in the threat of the first film, again as it hardly paid any attention to its main plot, and was not really ever accomplished with the second film because every time the villain tried to do something sinister he was thwarted in doing so, never able to impress his power upon the audience as a result. Here, Sirius is built up perfectly. Mentioning actual things he did, rather than just being told he's bad and so we should be afraid of him. There was no terror in this series so great as being told that all that was left of the man he destroyed was a finger.This series has been imprisoned by its own lack of confidence until this entry and thus it played it safe, giving us two good films. But now we have a great one, and thus the prisoner that is this franchise has finally escaped.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

421,palaste,Seemed to be a little cut short (mild spoilers),7,9 August 2004,"Warning: Review includes some mild spoilers.As before, I have never read any Harry Potter book. Thus I didn't have the faintest idea what ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" would be about until I saw the movie. Perhaps this way is better, as I can focus on following the story and not complaining about details such as the wrong number of hairs on Hagrid's head.As with the previous movies, I went to see this movie with my sister and my brother. My brother had read the book at school and had told me in advance that Sirius Black was related to Harry Potter, but I didn't know any more than that. I didn't even know what it should mean in regard to the plot.The movie felt overall less like an effects show and more character-developing than the previous movies. Of course, there were some excellent special effects, such as the dementors, or flying with the hippogriff, but they seemed to be fewer and less focused-on than in the previous movies.In contrast to that, we got to hear what had happened in Harry Potter's past, and how Sirius Black was supposed to have murdered his parents and wanted revenge on him. The plot didn't develop much until we actually got to meet Sirius Black.When R.J.Lupin arrived in Sirius Black's hideout, I thought he was a villain in disguise, just like professor Quirrel in the first movie. But then when we found out that Sirius Black was on ""our side"", that meant R.J.Lupin was, too. When they pointed out the real criminal, I think I knew who it was several minutes in advance. Stupid Ron Weasley couldn't have realised it even if it bit him (quite literally).The most clever part of the plot, in my opinion, was the time travel. Overuse of time travel can spoil a series but this was the first time it was used in Harry Potter, and so far it worked out well.My biggest gripe about the movie was that it seemed to be cut short in the middle of the plot. The real killer was still on the loose, but then the movie ended as soon as Harry, Ron and Hermione got back to Hogwarts. I would have wanted to seem him hunted down and brought to justice.Overall, I don't think this movie was much better than the previous one. It is still an excellent movie but I think ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is the best one so far.PS.

I really enjoy all the movies that come out and feel very attatched to it all. This movie as a movie itself is very good. Has all the effects you would want, they look brilliant surreal and so beautiful. As a movie compared to the book like all others, was missing stuff. It does not matter much. The parts that needed to be said were so magically put on screen it brought tears to my eyes, made me smile so happily, and with all the gloomy things going on i still laughed. This is such a great movie. I dont see why anyone wouldnt love Harry Potter. I think that this movie deserves to be seen by everyone, it has so many elements that are touching, elegant, charming and they all take you away.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
425,cestlavie03,Disappointing for HP fans... confusing for others - some spoilers,5,6 June 2004,"I'm going to cut to the chase and save all those who know the demographics and story from hearing what they already know.Now I wasn't impressed with the first 2 films and was a bit annoyed with Chris Columbus as a director, but at least those 2 movies left me satisfied. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book and perhaps that's why I'm taking this movie to heart, but honestly the mistakes made in this film are so annoying that even if I hadn't had high hopes, I'd be let down.Some good things! I love how the characters have grown and how the actors have begun to mature. There are powerful scenes in this movie and lots of good laughs (added by the way). I even found myself smiling at a couple bits like the budding ""relationship"" between Ron and Hermoine and a funny scene in which Ron wakes up from a nightmare about spiders. The scenery is very different, but nice. It may be extremely hard to follow where they are and what's going on at time because of different sets. Two main things I am very pleased with are the dementors and the scene with Buckbeak the hippogriff. The dementors do seem to ""suck"" happiness from you and swarm you when it's least convenient. The scene with Buckbeak was nearly perfect. It was very close to how it's described in the book and it's one of the scenes that just blow you away, maybe because of the visuals.However, all these fun and beautiful elements hardly surpass the bad. The film felt so rushed and kept jumping from scene to scene so abruptly that if you hadn't read the book you'd be lost. It'd look like these random bits being thrown together. A couple things occur and non-HP readers wouldn't know why. Such as who Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are and why Lupin magically knows how to use the map when Snape doesn't. They would also be confused as to what happened to Trewlawney. The movie never explains what happened or why. It's all just too rushed and confusing. I having read the book countless times even found myself thinking ""Ok, now what part is this? What's going on?"". Even if one had seen the previous movies and not read the books it's like ""Where'd this cat come from?"" and you barely have time to register what a Grim is, what it looks like, and connect the dots. The dialogue is so quick that I could barely catch what was being said half the time! In my opinion this was is simply poorly done. I would still watch it though due to the fact that, hey, it's Harry Potter! If you must calm your curiousity then go see it. Otherwise it can wait till DVD.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
426,smit815,Did not enjoy as much as the first 2,7,19 June 2004,"I would prefer Chris Columbus to direct the next Harry Potter installment. I found this installment slow and plodding. Everyone says that this installment is darker - well - Duh! - the third book is darker. I found the actors less like they are making new discoveries about themselves as budding wizards and more like bored old pros. Because of this shift, the devil-may-care feel of the first 2 seems to be lost.What seem to be a balance in the first 2 movies between what appealed to adults and to younger viewers was skewed in this movie toward adults.
I found myself several times bored and falling asleep during this movie. I look forward to the next episode of Harry Potter - Hope Chris is back.Andy Smith",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
427,jiujitsu_jesus,All grown up,9,15 December 2004,"The third installment in the Harry Potter series sees a significant progression from the cinematic style established in the first two films. Not only is the overall storyline much more dark and sinister, but Alfonso Cuaron, who has replaced Chris Columbus as director for the third film, has revamped the entire Harry Potter ambiance and presentation style.Cuaron's intensely emotional, visually-oriented, darkly humorous style gives lends the production the air of an adult film; it could not be further divorced from Columbus' perky, energetic, vapidly funny touch that moulded the first two installments as family movies. Understandably, this will upset many fans of the first two, but what has really thrown the viewer base is that Cuaron is not afraid to play fast and loose with the plot in order to better synthesise the film's overall image, continuity and message, which, while it makes for a better film, alienates fans of the novels looking for a flawless adaption.I personally believe, however, that to truly appreciate the movie, one needs to simply forget the book that inspired it, and attempt to enjoy the show. Cuaron's direction, despite his disregard for the traditional adaption style, is superb, with brilliantly atmospheric cinematography, mise-en-scene, emotion, and subtle humour. The talented cast rises splendidly to the challenge of the film's new style (with the exception of Michael Gambon, who is woefully unconvincing as Dumbledore), with great performances from Emma Thompson, Rupert Grint and Gary Oldman. It's disappointing as an adaption of the book - but, as a stand-alone film, it shines. 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
428,TomiusJ,"Good, really good, but not as good as the first two...",8,6 August 2005,"Don't get me wrong, I do think this is a very good movie. It's well directed, the music is excellent, the acting is great; however, I don't feel as though it's got the same ""Harry Potter"" feel as the first two, Columbus's two.For me, the first two Harry Potter movies ""felt"" perfect, they felt right. To be frank, they felt like Harry Potter! I've read the books a dozen times each, and from what I read, I had my own vision of what Harry's world would be like. Chris captured it amazingly, exactly as I'd imagined it. Alfonso's was OK, but he seems to have changed an awful lot and tried too hard to get the movie into a ""new"" style, his style. This, I feel, is why I'm opposed to his version to Chris's. However, despite all that, the movie is very good (excellent for the last 30 minutes). The acting is good, and the movie moves at a great pace; you really feel it has been a year at Hogwarts. There are a handful of ""cringe-worthy"" moments, which really bug me. You'll know them when you see them, trust me.Anyway, definitely see this movie and form your own opinion. It's not all bad, seriously. I just wish Chris had directed it, I have the strange feeling it would of been better and ""fitted"" in with the first two.(4/5)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
429,dis-6,Very much better Potter,10,31 May 2004,"This is a different type of film than the first 2 Potter movies. There are a few deft comedic sections at the start ( watch out for the bus ride through London ) before the dramatic heart of the film swings into gear.The director (Alfonso Cuarón) has pulled some great performances from the teenage leads and shows an eye for details that Mr Columbus could learn from - especially in the village scenes - and some great landscape shots in the flying sequences. Of the Hogwarts staff, McGonagle ( Maggie Smith ) is woefully underused, Snape ( Alan Rickman ) is excellent as always, Hagrid ( Robbie Coltrane ) is allowed to act and Dumbledore ( Michael Gambon ) is Dumbledorish. Lupin ( David Thewlis ) is outstanding and Trelawney ( Emma Thomson ) is wasted in 2 short cameos.Sirius ( Gary Oldman ) is only really in the film near the end but the screen comes alive when he's in the frame !Of the cameos, two stand out - Julie Christie as Madame Rosmerta and Dawn French as the Fat Lady.

434,marioonline,A rather good Harry Potter movie (at last),7,8 June 2004,"After seeing ""The Chamber of Secrets"" I promised myself not to see another HP movie in my life again.I'm not among those great fans that get angry at the huge but inevitable cuts that transform the very long HP books into an affordable screenplay. That's absolutely fine with me.But I have to say I'm among those people that do not like Chris Columbus's (er) talent as a director.This new HP by Cuaron is rather different, in that you get a lot of beautiful images, as Hogwarts is presented in a darker, yet more elegant way. The special effects look better, maybe because there is no 'final monster' to spend gazillions of money for, and so they could concentrate on those effects that are throughout the movie.The new characters add a new interesting twist, especially Prof. Lupin, whose final lines seem to allude at things that are definitely not meant for kids.

435,Mystical_lonewolf,what a great movie this was.,8,6 January 2005,"Ah, watching this was very much like the book's lines were mended into pictures. Well... almost most, they are indeed a great film.Shortly before this film was made, i was worried that the new director will kill off Harry Potter and turn this into some ""Dangerous mind on magical school of death."" but i was wrong. The director was good. Not brilliant, good. but that's still good.The personality of the cast was magnificent. And the Hippogriff, oh my god, he looked so real. I mean really, real. As if he existed. Not some phony graphics you see on computers that looked clunky and cheesy with no personality. This bests the graphics along with Gollum and Dobby the house elf.I never expect Gary Old man or the other guy who plays Remus, sorry Remus, but these two are my most favorite characters in the existence. i always picture Remus as a great father figure. I always wished he were my dad. but that ain't happening folks. Not that i don't like my dad.Sirius Black, i pictured him more handsome but frightening looking because be has been sent to azkaban for twelve years.Remus Lupin, i was thinking of young Obi Wan Kenobi. But hey, it wasn't that bad. Sure i mean, the mustache thing? Bad. get rid of it next time. But they were great. Their acting was great. I was afraid that this actor who portrays Remus would act like Lockhart or Quirrell. But he was close to what i pictured him.now, the thing i love the director about, he got rid of some scenes that seems too repulsive in the book. Sorry JK Rowling, but your story had bits of nauseating moments. But love them all to death still.Well... i hope the next sequel will be the biggest hit than this. Let's hope. but not too high.

Cuarón is a great director, and I thought he could improve the movie (compared to the previous films). Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban is definitely different compared to the previous films. In positive factors, this film performances are better (but still can satisfy my expectations), the scenery is better, but Cuaron's desire to change everything and brake Rollwin's traditional books is quite daring. Harry Potter and the sorceress's stone and Harry potter and the chamber of secrets are literal adaptations of the books (which are quite bad, boring and lame) some of the plot in the film is shattered by Cuaron's idea to do some changes. The 3 main actors look to old to be playing 13-year-old teens (Except Hermione). Gary Oldman's performance was insufficient and lame. The visual effects are quite bad compared to other features such as the Lord of the Rings and The perfect Storm. The costumes are not loyal to the book, and in my opinion, the changes of setting was very good. I was glad to find some references to Mexico. When at Hogsmade, Harry enters the sweet shop, you can see some colourful and attractive sugar `calacas' skeletons (Which are traditionally used in Mexico at Dia de Muertos, Mexican celebration of Halloween).

441,surreyhill,Spoilers! I've a love/hate relationship with this film,8,6 June 2004,"Viewed purely as a piece of visual cinema, this is an outstanding film. Alfonso Cuarón's direction is inspired. Magic, in this installment of the series, is handled matter-of-factually, except when there is something beyond the common, such as the flight of a hippogriff. It's no longer like watching a guided tour of Hogwarts-=finally, the characters are fully-integrated into their magical world. There were many things that were handled much better in this movie than in the first few films, particularly with regard to the prickly and confusing feelings that arise in person of Harry's age. Dumbledore's superficial doddering whimsy serves to camouflage a penetrating and perspicacious mind, just as in the novels. Snape was an apparent villain, and yet, one which made you wonder what unknown qualities made him a trusted confederate of Dumbledore-this is really interesting to watch in the context of what we now know about him from Book 5. Hagrid has been consistently lovable in all three movies, though is sadly underused in this film-where are the Flobberworms? But most of all, the magical elements in this movie were given personality and life beyond anything one saw in the first two films. The Whomping Willow managed to serve as both a menacing antagonist AND comic relief, an impressive achievement considering the WW had to accomplish this feat without benefit of dialogue and facial expressions. And as for Buckbeak, he was a truly realistic creation. I cut my eyeteeth on Ray Harryhausen's work, and one of the things I do NOT like about most CGI is that the creatures don't really move like anatomically-realistic creations and appear not to be subject to the same gravitational forces and physical laws as the live-action characters they are supposed to be interacting with. This, however, was not the case with Buckbeak. The hippogriff was a perfect blend of equine and avian characteristics, and the jerky and awkward movements of the hippogriff while on land contrasted pleasingly with its grace and power aloft. And speaking of realistically-blending awkwardness and grace, the performances coaxed from the three young leads in this installment really did portray adolescence in a way that should be recognizable to anyone who experienced it, or is in the process, thereof. From the way Hermione, so sure of herself in most situations, clung to the unlikely (for now) Ron when she was feeling frightened, to the way Harry showed the back of his head to annoying adults who didn't understand him, to the different ways that the kids walked down a hill--Ron shambling and slouching round-shouldered in the way of a boy who has grown a bit faster than his classmates and is self-conscious about it because his clothes don't quite fit, Hermione, swinging her arms and light on her feet like a real girl, and Harry, with the coltish grace of the natural athlete who moves without thinking how he must look to others---everything was true to the age group.As for Dan Radcliffe, he IS Harry Potter and I hope they can get the production schedule speeded up so that he can continue to play the lead role in the remaining four movies. I don't see how any other actor could now be acceptable in this role. Gary Oldman isn't physically the look I envisioned for Sirius Black, but he does a fine job with the limited amount of screen time he has. Sirius has a virile presence, for all his shattering experiences in Azkaban, and Oldman managed to portray this. I was less than enchanted with his CGI'ed 'Grim'-which I felt looked more like a werewolf than the Shepherd/Lab mix of my imaginings. My reactions to David Thewlis were more complicated. I felt his acting captured the essence of Rowlings' lonely and shabby Lupin, who is also mysterious, courageous, and exceptionally sensitive and kind. I liked his performance very much. But I was distracted the whole time by his look. He was a bit too well-fed, too smooth-cheeked--not wolfen enough. And his CGI'd werewolf form was anatomically-disturbing. I can't believe the same designer who created Buckbeak could also have created the werewolf, and I hope I find out it was indeed a different person. Which brings me to my real nitpicks-one purely movie-related, and the rest book-based.The cinematic nitpick is that the whole mystery surrounding the identity of Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs was not given sufficient exposition at any point to be understandable to those audience members who had not actually read the novel. This is such a serious problem that it rises above the level of a nitpick, to a major, major flaw. I think it should be addressed by adding footage to the DVD release, or getting the movie back into theaters again in the form of a 'Director's Cut' in a few years.I really do not like what they are doing with Movie!Ron, though I appreciate what Rupert Grint has been able to do with what he's been given. He is not JUST the screwup pal and the comic relief. Ron. Is. Brave. He is also fiercely loyal to his family and his friends. I really hope the upcoming screenplays get closer to Rowling's version. Rowling has telegraphed so clearly that Hermione and Ron are going to end up as a couple that all but the most die-hard Harry/Hermione 'shippers can see it coming, and so it behooves the script to adhere to her concept of Ron a little more closely so that this becomes a believable pairing. Since she won't be falling for him for his family's money or his scholarly mind or for being the handsomest boy in school, they'd better do a great job of showing that he has oodles and oodles of heart.So, I say-keep the actors, bring back Cuarón for OOTP, and can the screenwriter. And for pity's sake, do SOMETHING about that DORKY Moustache on Lupin!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
442,shervinv,This movie was awful,4,11 June 2004,"I liked the first two potter movies.  They had poor acting from the kids, and mediocre plots, but they were visually entertaining and there was a silly adventure that you could follow and be entertained by.  This movie was terrible.  The child actors are better now, however, considering the depths of badness they started from their new levels are nowhere near ""good"".  The movie was visually interesting with the fades, but otherwise had lost it's ""magical"" appearance that was so appealing in the other movies.  I can honestly say that there wasn't a single moment in this film that I wasn't bored or wondering when it will all end.  Finally, the plot can be summarized in one word:  pointless.  What is really bad is that movie franchizes like this will make money no matter what.  We're all going to go see it regardless and it will send all the wrong messages to the producers and studio.  If you are a purist and have more self-control than I did, don't go see this movie, make a statement!  :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
443,polkadotlegwarmers,new improved formula,9,7 June 2004,"I thought this was by far the best of the three Potter films. The last two were distinctly average and while they remained true to the books in practically every way, I felt they did not do justice to the stories. This film took a different approach which worked much better.
This film as with the book has a slightly darker tone; it takes a slightly less child like approach than the last two films, with less cheesy lines and much improved acting from Daniel Radcliffe among others.
I thought the new layout for Hogwarts was much better than the fairy story perfect school of before, the over grown grounds and steep hills were much more how I pictured the school to be. Cuaron has taken the films that Columbus started and in a sense made it grow up, I especially loved the way in which the shots were connected by showing the time passing either through the clock or by the Womping willow tree.The special effects used in this film were great, the Hippogriff Buckbeak was particularly good, and I loved the scene where it flew over the great lake with Harry. The Dementors were also good, providing the film with a scary darker element than previously.the only bad points that I could find with this film was that for die hard potter fans who know the books inside out there were several storylines which were left out. Secondly the scene after Harry's found out about Sirius ""betraying"" his parents where he is crying brought the memories of the previous films screaming back.Overall Cuaron has made a much improved version of Harry Potter, taking a slightly darker approach than before, this film seemed to flow much better than the first two, and while still providing the fun element of the first films. Provided a more mature approach from both the actors and the way in which the film was presented. I was a bit annoyed that several storylines and characters e.g. Oliver wood from the books got the chop, but the main story remained the same.For die hard Potter fans looking for the book to be played out exactly down to the last detail on screen you will be slightly disappointed. But this potter film holds much more for teenagers and adults than the last two. Cuaron deserved a round of applause for this film. I'm looking forward to seeing what the 2005 installment has in store for us.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
444,BeckyKmovieluver,Simply magical! The best Harry Potter movie yet!,10,21 October 2005,"I would like to begin by saying that I am not generally a backwards person but to all you Harry Potter fans out there who got into the movies by first reading the books I may appear rather strange because I got into the books many years after being a fan of the movies! I must admit that I was never able to get into Harry Potter until the release of The Order of the Pheonix, I didn't even know much about the books until I brought the third instalment The Prisoner of Azkaban. Obviously I had a vague idea that Harry Potter existed because I had been to see the first film and thought it was quite good but nothing to get too exited about... or so I thought. All I knew at that time was that I couldn't get into the series so why should I bother? Well how wrong was I? I can't remember exactly how I finally got into the books, I think it was something that just gradually crept up on me but after reading Order of the Pheonox I got into it so much that I read the books backwards! Thats right... backwards, and oh how confusing that was, and yet oh how fantastic and enjoyable! Well reading over this I must admit that so far I don't seem to have said a great deal about the film do I? Well lets start by saying that not only is Azkaban my favourite film but it is also my favourite book of the trilogy. I have read it over and over again and I never seem to tire of it. Lupin is great and by far my favourite character! David Thewlis was (in my opinion) simply made for the part! This movie far exceeds the other two! The character of Sirius Black is really brought to life in this movie! The magic of it is that he appears genuinely evil at the start (even though we all know he's not) but by the end we all realise him to be a helpless victim of the murderous so called friend of James and Lily Potter Wormtail. Call me a woos but I must admit that I did cry at the end scene between Sirius and Harry and again between Lupin and Harry. They are both such amazing characters and the actors are all amazing especially Alan Rickman who has played Snape with what appears to be such an understanding of the character from the beginning that to many fans I think it is safe to presume that he is the Severus Snape! This movie is definitely a 10/10. Simply magical!!!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
445,lazarou789,Thank God Potter exists,8,29 November 2005,"Hollywood film-making has become a very well orchestrated business with movies being done to satisfy ""market-groups"" and not to satisfy artistic values. Well, the market-group that has emerged as the most powerful is the under 14 years old, as opposed to some years back where teenagers where the group to target.This said, its obvious why kid's books and comic books are made in movies and that all movies have become more light hearted - more kid-friendly. Harry Potter may be a direct commercial effort to drain the pocket-money of the under-14s that already have spent most of it on the books, but it (the whole movie series) stands as a nice example of film-making with a heart, resulting in very watchable and enjoyable adventures - even if you haven't read the books.Thank God we have the Potter movies - at least they are imaginative, original and not dull and predictive like any other film nowadays.As for ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" its obviously the movie (and book) where Rowling is the most inventive (with the cool time travel).

448,boomcoach,"Solid, but uneven",6,7 June 2004,"I saw this with my family on Saturday.  We all enjoyed the first two movies, and have read the book.  The movie was enjoyable, parts of it were excellent, but there was certainly a feeling of deflation when leaving.First for the best part of the movie, the new cast members, David Thewlis, as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore. Thewlis was excellent, showing a great empathy and friendship for Harry. The scene of Lupin and Harry on the bridge was perfect.  Emma Thompson was spot-on as Trelawney, a role that had to be fun to play.  Michael Gambon took over the role of Dumbledore seamlessly.  Except for his first appearance, when I was specifically looking for the change, throughout the movie he was simply Dumbledore.  Dawn French as the Fat Lady, was also fun especially for Brit-com fans.The pacing of the movie seemed odd, and there did not seem to be the attention to detail that there was in the previous movies.  Previous movies had you looking in the nooks and crannies for things you might miss, this one seemed more barren.  The movie leaped from introduction to conclusion in a jarringly short time.  It felt like it should have been about 30 minutes longer.  I don't expect every detail from the books to be included, especially in light of Rowlings increasingly bloated prose, as the series has progressed, but we got very little ""life in Hogwarts"" and almost no real look at Hogsmeade.The biggest losers in this rush to the finish line were two of the best cast characters though this series, Maggie Smith's Minerva McGonagall is almost completely absent, and Alan Rickman's Snape is only shown when absolutely necessary to the plot.In the end, we gave the movie a 7, but it was much closer to sliding to a 6 than it was to an 8.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

451,humbleradio,Harry Potter and The Fight Club,5,6 March 2005,"I have not read the book. I have seen all three movies. I did enjoy PoA. With that said, I really did not like it as a part of the series. As a film, in its own right, it's not bad. Way too stylish for my tastes, however. Too many wide angle, fish-eye lens shots, way, way too much color alteration. Result: a very MTV look. I'm not impressed by these devices. They only detract from the story. As a filmmaker myself, I'm very familiar with the techniques used in the film to achieve that look. I don't dislike them. I just don't care for them in this series. Overall, the film was enjoyable as a stand alone film, not as a part of the Harry Potter FILMS. Notice I didn't say ""BOOKS"". Films and Books are two different media. Incomparable. But adaptations of books to film, DO have to maintain consistency in the message and theme. I did notice some annoying things, the obvious deletion, or alteration of certain characters, items, places, locations. Now, not having read the book, perhaps most of my criticisms/observations are unfounded, since, many of these points might be explained in the book. Here's a somewhat humorous (i hope) list of things I found distracting. Here we go. Enjoy...Why does the headmaster's nails look so dirty, long, and sinister now? Where's little sister Weasley who had a crush on Harry?Where's Q coach Wood?Where's Colin? Why the increase in ""minority"" students when they weren't there in such numbers before? They should have been there from the beginning. To change it now, seems like the director is making a racial statement. Too obviously well placed in each shot. It felt like a political campaign photo-op. Distracting. Why did Hagg's house move location down the hill away from the castle? To seem much more sinister?Why did Hogwarts move location? Again, to seem much more sinister?Where did the Stonehenge druid stones come from, making Hogwarts and Hagg's house seem much more sinister?Why did the Womping Willow move location conveniently away from the school (and help from teachers) during the attack?Why did we need to see the relocated Womping WIllow smote birds all the time? Again, more sinister? What happened to Percy? He's now a whiny wimp nobody listens to in the hallway, as opposed to a whiny wimp people listened to previously. Why are the students not wearing their uniforms or wearing them in a very hip-hop, ""progressively"" sloppy way? What's the statement the director is trying to make, that they're more ""mature"" and ""cool""? On a related note, why is Malfoy, alone, wearing his uniform correctly? Is this clear difference in the book? Are those really Malfoy's two friends from the previous films, or did one of them get replaced? Why does Hagg's cry at the lakeside seem so poorly acted? And why is his hair a continuity mistake no one noticed? Why does the word ""brilliant"", as in, ""... it's brilliant"" get constantly uttered? Where did Prof. Snape come from during the full moon event? He suddenly shows up, starting to scold Potter, not noticing an 8 foot tall werewolf transforming two meters away. Why do so many of the sets and locations look more like something out of Fight Club than a British boarding school, magic or otherwise?With that said, I did like the ending, and the whole time travel bit. It was cleverly done.Is it a prerequisite for the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor to be the crux and/or villain of the story? This makes 3 for 3 doesn't it? Also, it's annoying when characters or plot points are introduced and then dropped off quickly after their ""gimmick"" is done. This is particularly obvious in sequels and/or series films. Examples I noticed were: the girl ghost in the bathroom, the House selection ceremony, Harry's aunt and uncle having personalities, Headmaster's phoenix, Prof. Mag having more than one speaking scene, The appearance of a music teacher who is not introduced but is seen in the great hall, the divination prof. who is not seen in the great hall but is seen in her classes, the mandrake growing prof from HP2, who is not seen in the great hall, in her greenhouse, or anywhere else in the film, the magic car, Ron's broken wand, the hydraulic Loader Ripley uses to defeat the Alien Queen. oops, sorry, wrong film. I don't want the film to explain everything. Of course not. But there are certain ""beats"" to every story that must be shown or given some treatment, however brief, to let the audience in on the act. (Pun intended)Now, I know different directors have different takes on the same story. And characters are supposed to develop, and all. But there seemed to be a concerted effort to make this one very different from the previous two. It was a daring risk to take, when the previous two were beloved by millions. Comments by some of those millions who were not pleased with the changes in tone and approach are right here on IMDb. Multiply them by hundreds of thousands, and you get the idea. Personally, I hope the next installment will resemble the first two more than the third. And will somebody please move Haggards house back up the mysteriously appearing hill, and put it near the castle again. Those mudslides must be murder!HR",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
452,krissikrissa,Another great addition to the franchise!,9,24 July 2010,"Firstly i have too say that Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book of all of them (I haven't read the first) in the Harry Potter series and I am very pleased how they put this story on screen. First and naturally right decision was too replace Chris Columbus because we are getting into a darker times in the series. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón chances the whole atmosphere that Columbus had created, he goes deeper into the mysterious world and creates this wonderfully fresh and magical style that fits the movie 100%. He has also put a stop to most of the warmth and Sugary sweet attitude that the other two movies had, but that's only to show how much this story has matured. The characters have also grown up a lot and with that comes obviously new darker adventures then before.Prisoner of Azkaban was exactly one of the darkest (except for the final one) and the director is able to bring moments from the book so completely on screen that it gave me goosebumps but that is something you don't see often. Watch your kids because Dementors and werewolves are no teletubbies.The actors have also grown and Daniel Radcliff is again the man who grows the most from the second one but he has really grown as an actor since the first one. He could have practiced his crying a little bit better because his crying scene seemed a little forced. Emma Watson does her character ones again justice and brings to life the wonderful Hermione who has grown into a mature women. Rupert Grint keeps on getting better and better and his future looks quite promising. Michael Gambon takes the role of Dumbledore and does it very well but Richard Harris had made a wonderful character in Dumbledore, so entertaining and likable. Gambon gives his own style of the old headmaster and does it very well, he doesn't mimic Harris, he rather makes him his own. David Thewlis is also fantastic's Remus Lupin and Gary Oldman is also amazing in his role has Sirius Black, even though he has limited screen time.Everything involving the style was flawless -- but I am not going to drag this review for to long so I try to keep it short. From the technical side of it to the wonderful music from John Williams, it's all great and there is nothing really to complain about but all this is also getting darker and darker with every movie.There are some flaws I would like to talk about. My biggest complain is that there are a couple little holes that aren't filled from the book, like who made the map, how did Sirius escape and I wanted to see also them going more into Harry's past but unfortunately that happens when you are making a movie from a book, there will always be something that had too be left out.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban could easily stand on his own as a really entertaining and well made adventure-film that goes really fast through those 135 minutes; I mean it feels like an hour. Even for a couple of small flaws, this one is better then the other two (the other two are also really good by the way) and it seems every movie is better then it's predecessor.9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
453,dainty_cates,whole new world of potter,9,4 June 2004,"the most amazing thing about cuaron's stab at the hp series is the new world that he creates for potter and gang to live in. the atmosphere is one with hints of fear and danger. it is shadowy, obscure. lost is the wide-eyed idealism of columbus' films. these are not children coming for the first time to the magical world of hogwarts, these are adolescents who, being accustomed to seeing magic around them, are beginning to understand the potential danger of their craft. the cinematography and camera work are outstanding in this movie. cuaron is able to communicate visually to the audience about the uncertainty of coming-of-age, the danger amidst the beauty in the real world, and the way that cross gender relationships can become uncomfortable when one is coming into their own body and sexuality. a lot of the camera work seems to be shot on hand-helds and even what is not seems closer to the cast, more personal. the kind of direction that cuaron imposes on the cast makes them better actors. the movie, from a solely cinematic perspective, probably deserves a ten score. however, as a fan of the novel, there are some gaps in storytelling that are almost unforgivable. ***SPOILERS*** certain things seem just plain wrong for the avid hp reader. for instance, in conversation with harry, lupin makes reference to lily potter in a way to suggest that he had a sort of ""special"" friendship that is never alluded to in the books. similarly, all the talk of lupin's closeness to james potter almost vanishes from the dialog. if i had never read the book (as my friend who went to see it with me hadn't), i would have thought potter stole lupin's girlfriend, who would become lily potter, and that lupin was still resentful for it. one of the most endearing things about the Prisoner story is the way it sheds light on the harry's parent's lives--adds humanity and color to the dead family. the screenplay here doesn't deliver that and, truthfully, i don't think it wanted to. another clencher is that the identities of moony, wormail, padfoot, and prongs are never revealed. neither is an explanation for harry's stag-shaped patronus. this is the real pity because there is ample opportunity to have done it in merely fifteen added minutes worth of time. it is a real shame because at least i feel (and from what i heard from the crowds after the movie let out) that it is integral to the story both dramatically and emotionally. even i could think of a way to put that stuff in. ***SPOILERS OVER***all in all, as an hp fan (book 3 being my fave) i give the movie an 8 1/2, but as a moviegoer and filmfan, i give it an astounding 10*.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
454,brandonennals,"Once again, Harry makes a great movie",9,17 December 2004,"have been a fan of Harry Potter movies ever since they came out. I really knew nothing of the books, but the trailers had me curious. I loved the first two, and this one is just as good. Some of the movie I actually like even better then the first two. The story isn't as strong, but the direction is great. I love the style of the film. The movie just seems darker, more dangerous, dirtier. The first two movies really seemed like movies made from books. This movie seems as though it was written to be a movie. ALl of the characters are getting older and learning more so I think the change in tones and feel of the movie were appropriate. Really the one thing that makes the Potter movies are the stories. Every story is well written and so are the screen plays. This is a movie for kids as well as adults. Everyone can enjoy this movie. It was one of my favorite movies of '04.

455,esc_oblivion,The best yet - totally engrossing!,9,1 July 2004,"Now, I'm a total fantasy junky, but I didn't think the last two Harry Potter films were all that good. I enjoyed them, but I felt like they were slightly detached and not as fluid and magnetic as they could've been. I'm totally disappointed that they released this film when they did because I'm positive that the release date is the only thing that caused it to open poorer than the previous two. This film is far superior to the other two in every respect. The story is more intelligently translated to screen, the characters more genuine, the effects superb, etc. In short I find myself jaw on the floor, in rapt attention for the entire duration - which is pretty dam good considering I'm a 26 year old guy. I might even go so far as to say that it exceeds even the beloved Lord of the Rings series in fantasy accomplishment. It's truly awesome. The pace is nearly breakneck, the creatures utterly terrifying (yep, even to a 26 year old guy) and believable, the magic magical, and I could go on and on. I just adore this film. I really hope that this new director returns for some of the future ones. He - more than Chris Colombus - has an incredibly visceral style that you can't help but be drawn in by. He doesn't move the camera just for kicks, but he also doesn't leave it completely static for every scene either. His style is mature and effortless. If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to catch it on the bigscreen. I'd really like to see it again, perhaps even above seeing some of the new highly anticipated films. A++++++++",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
456,ryanh-00630,Something wicked this way comes,10,18 August 2019,"If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff (""Don't pull out his feathers,"" warns Hagrid, ""cause he won't thank yer for that!""). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration.This scene is not only terrifically executed, but makes a great statement about the ""Harry Potter"" franchise in general. Under Columbus, the series was keen on observing its wondrous world, but not much else. But under Alfonso Cuaron, the series does more than observe. It flies and sails through all of the possibilities. Add to that an improved script from Steven Kloves, better performances from the main trio, and some welcome musical themes from John Williams, and you have what is, to date, the best ""Potter"" film yet.The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is Sirius Black, a mass murderer who has escaped. A former supporter of Lord Voldemort, Black is reportedly going after Harry to finish off the Dark Lord's work. Harry, of course, would much rather live out his third year at Hogwarts without unpredictable distractions. But more than Sirius Black is concerning Harry now. The guards of Azkaban, the dementors, are snooping around Hogwarts and forcing Harry to rehear his worst memories. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, is revealing that he had connections with Harry's father. And for all of the security around Hogwarts, how is Black breaching the castle walls and attacking portraits?Steven Kloves has written a far better script this time around, thanks in large part to a greater emotional heft he puts on the story. Harry's parents take on a greater importance this time, and they are the source for some of his motivations in dealing with the Dementors, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black. In fact, speaking of Lupin, I was quite impressed with how well Kloves wrote all of the interactions between Harry and Lupin. His manner reminded me of some of my favorite teachers from high school, and how they would sometimes care about more than just their students' academia, but their personal lives too.And not only is the script better, but so is the acting. Reportedly, director Cuaron had Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all had to write essays on their characters before filming began. Smart move. Racliffe, Grint, and Watson all interact with each other like there's real history between them, and don't just look like they're trying to hold their own while reciting lines. Several new casting choices are inspired as well. David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, and he brings humanity and compassion to the role. Gary Oldman is Sirius Black, and his interactions with Harry are not only credible, but you get a sense that he has truly cared for him for many years now. Emma Thompson is a hoot as Professor Trelawney, Harry's eccentric Divination teacher. Several have criticized Michael Gambon taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but I think he's fine for the role. He may not be the Albus Dumbledore of the book, but I bought into his more stern, yet still sensible portrayal of the revered Headmaster.I liked John Williams' film score in ""Chamber of Secrets"", here however, Cuaron lets him come back in full force. Time and time again, Williams comes up with other memorable themes, including ""Aunt Marge's Waltz,"" ""Buckbeak's Flight,"" and ""Double Trouble"" (the song the Hogwarts choir sings). This marked the last time Williams worked with ""Harry Potter,"" so it's good he went out on a high note.I don't know what I can add to the appraisal of Alfonso Cuaron's direction, but I'm going to try anyway. The guy nailed it. For the first thirty minutes, I had this big grin on my face as he took great fun in blowing up Aunt Marge, making Harry's ride on the Knight Bus as wild and face-flattening as possible, and having students eat candies that made them act like monkeys and lions (or in Harry's case, blow steam out of his ears). He employs several clever camera tricks, including gazing into a mirror and having the reflection become the dominant shot, and having the Whomping Willow shake snow off its branches and having the snow hit the camera lens. And he's not afraid to exploit Hogwarts darker side, from the sinister, soul- sucking dementors to Lupin's tense transformation. There are too many ""little touches"" he adds on for me to mention, but I think my favorite was that when Harry and Hermione travel back in time and attempt to save Buckbeak, Hermione sees herself, and questions, ""Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?"" You won't find that comment in the book. Not only does that line add humor, but it also shows how Cuaron was willing to separate this film from the book and make it its own entity.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

458,AdderCowley,Funny and imaginative but not harry potter,6,17 February 2008,"I totally agree with every positive review of this film. It is both funny and imaginative as well as entertaining however it does not capture the magic of the first two films.As with every director Alfonso Cuaron wanted to put his own mark on his work and thus this film is incredibly different from the first two films directed by Christopher Columbus. It seems that while Columbus preferred to focus on the actual book and narrative, sticking jealously to the plot, Cuaron preferred to branch out from the norm which had a positive and negative effect on the film.The film is as I said very enjoyable, entertaining, thrilling and in most cases downright funny. However the negative part is that there was a loss of continuity. This means that basically for me the film no longer felt like the books. Things like the animal sweets, the big swinging pendulum and the toads singing seemed completely out of place.Another example of lack of continuity was Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore, who's almost energetic performance is in stark contrast to the wise, plodding Richard Harris who captured Dumbeldore perfectly. Gambon is less convincing. By contrast David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are great in their respective roles.All in all this is not a bad film, however it fails quite badly to capture the magic of the first two films of the books",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Everything seemed true to the story.And now for the criticism:  NOT ENOUGH.  We NEED an extended version, too much of the book was lost, I know the flow of the movie was terrific, but we lost so many little cute, fun, interesting scenes.  The Directing was so well done, I would personally pay double for an extended version.  If anyone connected with the movie reads this, please pass on the lesson of Lord of the Rings.

There are a couple very important details in the book that would have given this film much more emotional depth.1) The history of the Marauders Map. Why skip this? The film never even bothers to tell you who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prongs are!!
Connecting Remus, Sirius and James as boyhood pals is essential to our emotional connection to them. The fact that Sirius, James and Peter taught themselves to become Animagus to show solidarity with Remus and his curse is such a deep show of fealty in the book. Why leave that out? Without that, nobody knows who Prongs is or why that's significant to Harry's patronus.2) Crookshanks assisting in catching scabbers/Peter, as well as helping them get into the Womping Willow. Hedwig is the only familiar that ever got any true attention in the films after all was said and done.

461,tony-mastrogiorgio,"Far and Away, the Best of the Three",10,5 June 2004,"If the only criteria you have for a Harry Potter movie is absolute fidelity to the book, then you will be disappointed in this one. But if you understand that the filmmakers (especially screenwriter Steve Kloves) need to condense the increasingly long novels into acceptable screen time while preserving their essence, then you are at the right stating point.
They condense and take some liberties, but this movie looks and feels like Hogwarts in a way that the first two never did. It has a beautiful texture and look. The film is content to let magical things happen along the edges and the background without having to land heavily on each moment. The result is that you feel so much more a part of this world then you did previously. The three leads have improved wonderfully and I can now imagine them having post-Potter careers. There is no point in recapping the plot. If you are interested in the movie you no doubt read the book. Accept some differences from the sources, however, and you will enjoy the best Otter yet.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
462,Biodigital_Jazzman,They got it right,10,22 February 2010,"After all these years since it was released, this has become one of my all-time favorite movies. It took a while to grow on me. I appreciate the artistry and detail that Cuaron and Kloves brought to the adaptation of Rowling's book.The opening of the film establishes the importance of light, a visual theme that carries through the whole film. It's a metaphor for Harry's own search for clarity about his past, a search that ends with the ultimate light of the patronus. Harry grows up over the course of the story. He discovers that he must be strong and self-reliant.Another visual theme is the passing of time, which becomes an important plot device. There are repeated shots of the huge clock and its gears in Hogwarts' castle. There are lots of ticking sounds and the deep ringing of the clock bells, ominously signifying the fleeting hours as they slip through Harry's grasp.John Williams created one of his most impressive musical scores for Azkaban. Buckbeak's flight is one of the emotional high points of the film, a soaring exuberant theme that perfectly enhances Harry's feeling of freedom and release. I also really liked the little harpsichord motif that signaled the presence of Peter Pettigrew, a motif that cleverly sneaks back in at the very end of film's credits.All of the actors are in top form. Daniel Radcliffe really came into his own and showed a strong command of his character. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also grew tremendously as actors. Alan Rickman, as always, showed masterful control of Snape. The only actor that I still am ambivalent toward is Michael Gambon. As others have mentioned, Richard Harris really captured that ""twinkle in the eye"" that Dumbledore needs. Although I appreciated subtle techniques that Gambon incorporated (a slightly stuffed sound to reflect Dumbledore's broken nose and a slight Irish lilt), I never got that sense of Dumbledore's mischievous nature. Gambon's character certainly looked eccentric, with a bow in his beard and sporting a tam. And there were a few nice moments near the end with Harry and Hermione where he seemed more relaxed. But I wish he had taken that further.I also agree with others who say that to fully capture the nuances of the book, the movie would have had to be a mini-series. Rowling writes with such attention to detail, that a single movie could never capture the beauty of her prose. I think Cuaron and Kloves came as close as they could to maintaining the spirit of the book while creating a unique and beautiful two-and-a-half hour movie. It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over and enjoy even more than the first time I saw it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
463,wessel-1,Not what you might expect from the book,2,3 June 2004,"One should never judge a book by its movie or vice versa, this makes rating ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" very difficult. Having read books one to five and being somewhat of a fan of the series, the movies naturally are always worse than the books. Rowling brings so many details, so many sidelines to the story which later reappear or converge to the final act. This and the sheer size of the books make the adaption for the cinema very difficult (perhaps a four-to-eight-hours-miniseries per book would be more effective).PoA is no different, and being the book I liked the most, I was not sure what to expect. The first two movies tried to show as much as possible (with an incredible pace in the second movie which ruined a lot of moments - like the shown winter's day which was over in a few seconds), but the third one tried to steamline the story and rewrite it at some points. They even brought in new scenes which were not part of the book (where did they find the time for that - well, they've cut a lot of other scenes). So, the third movie is ... difficult to describe. There are some surprising scenes, but most of the story stays the same, so it is very predictable if you know the books but perhaps incomprehensible if you don't.Overall it is visually stunning (especially the Dementors and the Hyppogriff), so it's worth for that, the actors however ... for Hermione and Snape they were brilliant, for Harry and Ron they were ok, for Dumbledore not as good as the old one, but I was disappointed with Lupin. One of the effects of the books was, that you build up an image of a character. Lupin always seemed to me as a good-hearted person, which was forced by circumstances outside of his control to live a life of an outsider, thus being forced to be very poor although he is capable of so much more, which he can rarely show - but even with this burden he always seems to look on the positive side, never giving up. The Lupin in the movie just didn't have this battered but fighting style. At the moment I am not sure if I want to see the next movies. Seeing one and two was like reading the books a page per second, seeing the third was like reading the story retold by a stranger (recognizable, same plot, but different), and I wonder how the next one turns out.I suppose I'll stay with the books and let the story play in my head, using some of the actors of the first movies to flash it out (nope, not Lupin), but without the cuts or funny but meaningless additions of the movies. So, if you do not know the books, shame on you but you'll probably enjoy the movie, if you know the books and liked them, be wary, the movie might not be what you would have expected from the book.All in all, I would only give the movie a 2/10 - sorry, but if you know the source it was not a good adaption (although perhaps no good adaption is possible).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
464,RadioactiveRat,Above Average Except For Plot Exceptions,8,20 January 2005,"It is said that all knowledge comes from introspection. If viewed from the original novel, the movie's screenplay is very incomplete. Given, it is a story about magic! But its explanations as to how many of its important events occurred are impoverished. First and foremost, Mr. Black's escape from the prison of Azkaban isn't explained. Nor is how Miss. Granger came to be in possession of a time-travel device called a time-turner. In retrospect, the primary theme of the entire movie amounted to the belief that Mr. Black wanted Potter dead. Moving on, the production of the film was very good. The special effects captured the events as I expect the writer Rowlings intended. The performance of the actors was sufficient, but not great. Well, whoever plays Granger is nearly as annoying as the fictional one in the original text. The guy who plays Snape is also nearly as creepy as the fictional one. The beginning of the film is excellent, and quite hilarious. It also seemed as if the entire story could have been told in a film three quarters as long, including the omissions as mentioned above. Overall, I give it a 8 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
465,mrforgetful,"If you insult a hippogriff, it will kick you",8,31 July 2005,"Gone is Chris Columbus and so enters Alfonso Cuaron. Strike up the band, paint a banner, and the parade will be here in a few minutes.I have nothing against Columbus (haha thats where i live), but from the way chamber of secrets was going, it looked like the franchise was going to get a little stale. So gone are the bright colors and blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects of the first two movies and in comes the new artsy, darker look of Prizoner of Azkaban.Cuaron wasted no time in changing things to suit his needs however. Gone are the gentle rolling hills surrounding Hogwarts and in place of them are more extreme mountains. Hagrid's hut is down a hill that was nonexistent in the other movies, and the castle now includes a courtyard, a giant clock, and a large elevated walkway that leads to seemingly no where. These changes aren't necessarily bad, but they hurt the continuity of the series. Also, the entire tone of the movie is different, as the kids grow older and more mature.At first viewing, I didn't really like this movie as much as the other ones, mostly Sorceror's Stone. But when I thought about it, and as I read the 6th book, I realized that Harry's world isn't always a bright and colorful world with a blockbuster soundtrack and cheap special effects. So in a way, this movie provides a nice transition between the first books of the series and the later more darker ones, at least for the movies.Personally, I loved the new sound of the soundtrack. John Williams remains as fresh as ever and the medieval styled music is very good and appropriate, combined with the old themes.Some things are sorely missed though. One thing in particular, is Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is by no means a bad actor, but him as Dumbledore wearing a beanie just doesn't work. Richard Harris' dumbledore had that warmth and authority that perfectly caught the essence of the character portrayed in the books. There's nothing they can do about it, but I think Ian McKellen would have been a better choice, or maybe even Patrick Stewart.The only thing that makes this movie a little subordinate to the Sorceror's Stone is the end, which i thought lacked a little substance and could have been better given how the book ended. There were just a few little things that it could have added to make it that much more powerful, but they decided to make the movie that much shorter. Still, this is a very good movie and I eagerly anticipate the next movie. Mischief managed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
466,ronaldosievert,The best in the entire series!,9,16 January 2020,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was directed by Alfonso Cuarón and is the third entry in the Harry Potter franchise. After the second movie, ""Chamber of Secrets"" felt just as childish and very similar to its predecessor, the decision was made to hire a new director for the next instalment. This was not only justified but also much needed for the series, as this is the first movie that is a lot more dedicated to its characters and generally feels much more suited for adults through its dark themes.This flick features amazing cinematography, unbelievable art-direction with immaculate framing and scenery, great performances by the entire cast and probably Steve Kloves' best screenplay of the entire series. What stands out most about this movie though is Cuarón's inspiring direction and how everything comes together greatly in this transcendent cinematic adventure.I haven't seen ""Y Tu Mamá También"" yet, but I am a big fan of Cuaron's work so far. His work in this movie is great, however he still improved significantly in his later projects. His (at least in my opinion) best work so far and science-fiction masterpiece ""Children or Men"", his space adventure bursting with groundbreaking cinematography ""Gravity"" that led to many oscars for its technical achievements, including best director and his latest feature ""Roma"", which Cuaron did not only get his second oscar as a direction, but also for his production and as director of photography.Anyways, back to the subject. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is not only my favourite Harry Potter movie by a long shot, but it is actually so good, that it can easily hold up with the best of the genre. This is probably due to its dark and gritty themes, which make the movie feel so adult like. This is actually the reason why the next film ""Goblet of Fire"" is my least favorite of the entire series, but more on that in my next review.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
467,Shazia_de_Sousa,Disappointed,7,27 April 2019,"The PoA was my favourite book, with all of the underlying stories of the 4 mischief makers, but none of that was brought out here. There was so much scope for this movie but it failed to reach even close to it's potential.I was disappointed by Sirius's acting, and most of the other cast as well.Once again, I don't FEEL the character, like I did in CoS. The acting didn't round of the character.Most of the plot remained accurate, but sometimes, silly things that didn't make sense at all happened.
Like Harry seeing Peter Pettigrew on the map. I suppose it was difficult to let an unknowing viewer know about the whole history of the situation, but this part could have been done better.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
468,has_no_pseudonym,Dissatisfied (some SPOILERS ahead),6,6 June 2004,"Comparing this movie with the previous two might seem a little ludicrous considering the different director and the general tone of the movie and book, but after seeing this you can't but long for the bustling hubbub of The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets.I have read all the books, reread the Prisoner of Azkaban most recently, but I'll try to leave off comparisons for now.As a movie itself it was unsatisfactory, and when you've read the book, it makes it that much worse. The scenes were rushed and felt contrived. No sooner where you emotionally in a scene then it hopped to another one with nothing to bridge that emotion. In what appeared to be an attempt to instill the darkness of the third book the director, and everyone else, accidentally left all the emotion behind. I felt no true sympathy for the tense and constant fear of his life that Harry had to go through during that year. It didn't seem at all apparent that he was. Though Rupert, Daniel and Emma have grown physically and as actors their performances felt wasted because of this rushing desperate need to pack as much of the action of the latter part into the book into the movie.I think one the biggest flaws was the movie was not grounded. Since this is the third movie in a series it was a ghastly mistake to introduce so many new sets and change the location of previously fixed items. However beautiful they were, it caused confusion. Very little of the movie was set in familiar scenes. A lot of what should have been crucial dialogue was set in random locations out of doors, which made little sense. With the change in location of the Whomping Willow, Hagrid's hut, the change in actress and location for the Fat Lady, with new courtyards and other new sets, if felt like a whole different place. And when you throw in the abruptness of scene transitions, it gives you a very strong feeling of being lost. There was no ""home again"" feeling upon returning to Hogwarts. It barely felt like Harry was at a school at all with the time they spent inside the school itself. That was one of my bigger disappointments with the movie.If they had stuck a little more to the castle and tried to instill some of the darkness there I would have felt better about it. Otherwise I was left being confused with the changes and where they were, and trying to keep track of the plot, which was not strung together well or edited. There was also little sense of time. They used the owl and the Whomping Willow to great effect to show this, but it didn't seem to ""effect"" much else. The whole passage of time was streamlined and gone through with a quickness that boggled the mind and made it impossible to understand where the plot was heading. There were no key ups or downs in the plot since so much was cut out that was present in the book.((SPOILERS))The Dementors, I went into this movie hearing how frightening they were. I was not frightened nor even moved. Dementors can't fly...yet they do in this movie and that steals away much of their looming, glooming, happiness sucking fear. Having something on the ground looming in closer and surrounding you, leaning over you, unable to escape by foot, then yes that would have scared the heck out of me. But having them fly made them comical in my eyes. It also causes changes to the end of the movie. Since the Dementors can fly then Harry's stag patronus has to pulse out light rather than charge them. Which steals a lot from that scene that they could have had if they had stuck a little closer to the book.((End SPOILERs))It seems the moviemakers went out of their way to be different from the first two and thereby stripped it of all the charms the book and the previous two movies had. They added in their own material, and considering the bountiful detail that Rowling instills in her books, leaving out so much original material and adding in so much new was rather inconsiderate to the fans. The more new you add the less time you have for the little things that fans of the book were hoping to get a glimpse of and never did.I've heard Chris Columbus criticized for being so slavish in keeping close to the book, but I see no fault in this. Though not perfect, by no means, he managed to capture Harry Potter in a way that Alfonso Cuarón failed miserably at. I've heard Columbus lost the subtleness of the undercurrents in the books, but now that I look back on it I think that's wrong. By recreating the books so closely those undercurrents were created as a side effect, they were not affected or forced. Cuarón's method seemed to be the opposite and it didn't work. All the whimsy of Rowling's story telling was completely and utterly lost in this new addition. Which is a sad loss for those fans who so looked forward to The Prisoner of Azkaban.The Chamber of Secrets and its themes and events (both book and movie) were dark, much darker than The Prisoner of Azkaban in truth and done to greater effect by Columbus. I think Cuarón and Steven Kloves latched onto the darkness that was present in the book and blew it out of proportion and to the detriment of the film. They also seemed to have forgotten they were making a child's film...and more disturbing yet, that they were making a Harry Potter movie...As a film: 7/10As an adaptation: 5/10As an interpretation: 1/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
469,l-51071,this one is the best,8,16 May 2020,"I like this one best because it is full of imagination, and the hair and clothes of the three children are very casual and lively.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
470,rokomo,Dark,9,22 January 2021,"I liked the first two Harry Potter films very much, they were as cheerful and entertaining as their literary templates, and exactly when the novels got darker, so did the films, but in order to make it completely possible, the director had to change. So instead of Chris Columbs, the director became Alfonso Cuaráron, because Chris Columbs is objectively simply unable to adapt Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. This HP film is therefore extremely dark, we have excellent time-back concepts and balancing these events that were subsequently done with what happened then. We also have Gary Oldman who embodied Sirius Black superbly. The film is mysterious and actually the colors of the film are much grayer and washed away than what we've seen before probably to match the tone of the film. Otherwise a great movie, significantly better than the first two as good as they are. But like the first two, worth watching.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
471,raimi3,Harry at age 13,8,24 November 2005,"First off, I'm a fan of the books. I have read this particular chapter, or should I say year, several times. My feelings on the film are as follows:There are many new things to talk about this time out. First, Dumbledore's replacement. For those not in the know, Richard Harris passed shortly after the second film was finished. To me, he was the perfect Dumbledore right from the beginning and I had a hard time seeing a new face in the role. Michael Gambon was satisfactory but too many key elements from the character are missing. Instead of playing Dumbledore as a wise, kind and somewhat tired old wizard as Harris did, Gambon seems more energetic and detached from the main characters. I felt as though he and Harry's relationship took a step backwards from the previous movies. I felt as though Harris' performance was closer to Dumbledore as written in the books. Second, we have a new director. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron steps in and to my delight has given the series a fresh and interesting approach. He approaches the darker tones found in the book with vigor and panache. I was very happy with his visual style. It was very bold and edgy, yet full of emotion. Yeah ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" dude. Way to step up. Great job with the dementors and Sirius Black.This is what I consider the turning point towards maturity for the characters in the books. I was very happy to see that this transition was also made in the film version. 8/10Also, I would like it to be known that this is one of John Williams' very best film scores, and that's saying a lot. He was robbed at the Oscars. Oh well. He has 5 already.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

473,nikhoenorh,The turn of the genre,7,12 January 2019,"This movie feels like the movie where harry potter transitioned from being family movie to being more of an adult action movie. They are not young children anymore and here they start to learn more about all the serious trouble in the world and how you sometimes cant fix them, but at the same time it denies this by allowing them to go back and fix their past.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
474,Sterling52,Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban,8,31 August 2008,"After a start of pathetically bad proportions, HP is back, and they actually did a good job this time. After Chris Columbus was gone (thank God) the HP franchise got Alfonso Cauron. Alfonso got it right. The sets were great, the screenplay was awesome, the directing fantastic, the acting, very good. While this movie is not perfect, it still amounts to a recommended film on my list. The film has a much darker tone than the last two, this tone helps the film a lot, it's much more easy to take seriously. John Williams cooks up his best score of the series, making it moodie, creepie, happy, and at points terrifying, the best of this score is probably the children's choir singing ""Double Trouble"". I highly recommend this film, for me, it is currently (December '07) the second best film of the franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
475,alden1010,The weakest of the three to date,6,12 October 2005,"The Prisoner of Azkaban tries to dazzle us with action, suspense, and special effects. These elements, I believe, take away from the character development that made the first two Harry Potter movies worth watching. This one feels a bit more like a video game than a movie, trying to cram as much excitement in as little space as possible. This is probably a great movie for children, but it fails to draw in discriminating adults the way the previous installments had. In the next installments, I can only hope the director reduces the tempo and pays more attention to the individual characters. I know this is difficult considering the length of the books they are drawing from. Nevertheless, cutting vast sections of the book's plot may make for a stronger, more intelligent film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
476,Winters_Spirit,Different...but still great. *SPOILERS*,10,17 August 2004,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan so naturally I went to see this pretty much the day it came out in Canada. I would say it's different, but still great. Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) did an excellent job of directing Dan, Emma and Rupert (Harry, Hermione and Ron respectively). Unlike in the previous two movies, Cuaron filmed these three in normal 'Muggle' clothes at times and not just in their robes.The young cast of Dan, Rupert and Emma were joined again by Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Devon Murray (Seamus Finnigan), among others. The older cast once again included Dame Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, again among many others. Newcomers this time 'round included Gary Oldman as the escaped criminal and accused murderer Sirius Black. Also new, replacing the late, great Richard Harris, is Michael Gambon, playing Headmaster of Hogwarts, Professor Albus Dumbledore. In my opinion, no one will be able to replace Mr. Harris and no one but Mr. Harris is Dumbledore. This may be just because he is new we will see.The movie was very good if not missing out on a number of things. One thing that disappointed me was the fact they didn't do much on the Shrieking Shack. That is a major plot point.Based on this and the fact that the next movie 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005) has a new director, it will be interesting to see how the next movie goes, if it carries on the great legacy and the legendary boy wizard's greatness that J.K. Rowling's fantasy world is made up of.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
477,Halfwaytoheaven,a perfunctory mess,7,3 September 2004,"This time around, I feel that too much of the story was sacrificed in making the film shorter. Characters, especially new ones, are not as fully developed as they should be, and explanations of past events are hurried. Also, I don't feel that enough time was taken to build a feeling of suspense and mystery. I was glad that I had read the book beforehand; otherwise I might have been confused about just who had done what to whom. On the other hand, the film had a darker tone, which will serve its maturing audience (and cast) well. Alfonso Cuaron is a skilled director, and I only wish that he takes more control of his mainstream films in the future.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
478,keith96778,Unremarkable,5,13 June 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a very ordinary movie with little save an undeserved reputation to explain its widespread attraction at the box office.  The kids can't act.  The special effects are nothing special.  You'd think with money that pored in from the 1st two movies that someone could have at least invested in some 1st rate effects and a couple acting lessons for the cast.  What are the producers doing with all their money???  The storyline is silly and riddled with plot holes. Children of gullible years will likely be amused.   Smaller kids will be traumatized by the dark mood and some really ugly people.  Adults will be traumatized by the cheap effects ad the really ugly dialogue.  The good news is that it really IS better than Potter #2; the bad news is that it is still a wretchedly boring and nonsensical mess. 
I rate it 5 of 10.  I'm generous by nature.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
479,ChrisQ,Like the Curate's Egg - Good in Parts,5,2 June 2004,"In my view ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is J K Rowling's best work. From what I had read, I expected that Alfonso Cuaron would scrap the ""Hollywood"" style and his film would reflect the darker nature of this story.He certainly did achieve that. The film was beautifully filmed and was genuinely eerie in places. His animation of the Hippogriff was fantastic - most believable.Of his actors - David Thewlis as Lupin was not as I pictured the character but did an admirable job. Gary Oldman as Sirius however was woefully under-used. Michael Gambon was an excellent replacement Dumbledore and all three central characters turned in fine performances.Nevertheless I left the cinema feeling disappointed. I had a feeling that the POA should have been a great film - but wasn't!! If I hadn't read the book, I think a number of scenes would have completely baffled me.My prime objection was that I felt I had just been watching a 4 hour film in Fast-forward mode. Every scene was pared to the bone and over in 90 seconds or less. With the exception of Harry, Hermione, Ron and Lupin all other characters were reduced to mere 3 line cameos.Also what happened to the continuity? - ""The Leaky Cauldron"", is now presided over by ""Igor the Truly Terrible"" and has been transported next to a railway terminus. A landslide has caused Hagrid's cottage to end up at the bottom of a hill. Lakes appeared to expand and contract from scene to scene.Because of Cuaron's mad rush to produce a shorter film from a much longer book, many essential plot items disappeared. Did I miss an explanation of the Marauders Mapmaker's names? That surely was essential to the story. Harry needs to know this to believe his father saved him by using a Stag Patronus. Another key element of the book was Hermione's need to obtain the Time Turner so she should get to all her lessons. The film barely touched on Hermione's impossible school timetable.Obviously a scriptwriter's job must be to condense - but I felt the essential feel of the book was lost somewhere in the translation. With this in mind, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing any slimmed-down version of the next couple of books. I might just give their films a miss.I hope that the distributors will follow the LOTR example and the fully-extended 4 hour version of this film will shortly be available on DVD.Score 5/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
480,AdamWhite1421,The best Harry Potter film so far,9,11 July 2004,"By far the best Harry Potter film yet, but it still left me feeling disappointed. Cuaron has taken the franchise and improved it, he has made it grow up along with the characters. The film was scary at times and moving at others. The special effects where the best yet and very rarely looked CGI which was surprising. The acting was a mixed bag however. Only a few stood out; Oldman was brilliant if a little underused, Emma Watson was outstanding and a talent to watch but poor Harry Potter can no longer carry a film, the scenes with other people in were more entertaining. It's also a big shame that there was only one Quidditch match in this one, also how long would it have taken to explain the authors behind the Maurauders Map?8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

If you've read the book then you'll be outraged at how different and wrong it is and if you haven't then you won't have a clue what's going on and you will most likely fall asleep. Mind you, falling asleep in the nice warmth and comfort of a cinema may sound quite appealing to some what with the rush and business of every day life. I was thoroughly disappointed. I had already seen the first two films and not really enjoyed them much and with the new director I thought that this one might be different and might surprise me. I was surprised at how bad it was. The Lord of the Rings films are so much better in comparison as a novel-based film. I think they need a new, better director who has actually read the books and a new cast of people who actually know how to act. And really... the werewolf at the end was just awful.

However, 'Azkaban', the screenwriter and director chose to remove HUGE chunks of the plot, which rendered much of the movie unclear to anyone who has not read the book. They also chose to insert some much unneeded slapstick (Harry gets plastered on bus window, Hermione gets flung by tree) instead of the far superior humor already provided by JKR. I would have happily lost all the 'new material' to get back the scene where Ron and Harry are working on their Trellawny homework.

484,Mr_Spiffy,"Finally, a film worth Rowling's Vision",10,4 June 2004,"The title says it all.  This episode, when seen through the eyes of Alfonso Cuarón, is finally what the previous two films should have been.  Chris Columbus can make a pretty Hollywood film, but he's best in the producer's chair.  He doesn't have the vision of Alfonso.  While Chris was busy showing pretty scenes, Alfonso draws a tight story.  The new director has made all the difference in the world.  Especially interesting is that Hogwarts is FINALLY a multi-racial school.  In other films, all the students were caucasian.  And Harry interacts with different races, which is interesting.You will notice some casting changes -- at least I did, especially of Cornelius Fudge and the Fat Lady.  Additionally, the geographic location of some places, especially The Whomping Willow and Hargrid's house have moved.You will quickly notice that the cast is growing up.  Neville Longbottom is certainly growing.  He lost all of his baby fat.  I had to take a double look to ensure I was looking at the same person!  The acting ability is growing with age, like a fine wine.  Dan Radcliffe is finally given a chance to show his true talent, especially in the Dursley's house.The character of Snape finally develops to show his hatred of Harry. I was a bit concerned about the casting of Lupin, but it comes out fine.Be prepared for some cuts and unusual additions.  The second Sirius Black attack is missing.  The relationship between Crookshanks and animagus Sirius is gone as well.  Watch the film and you will see that the spirit of the film is there (albeit with ""flying dementors""), even though Alfonso altered it a bit.

485,Sinth01,A positive comeback.,7,2 August 2013,"I am uneasy person with long sequels and I was prepared for a disaster when I started to watch the movie. I am not Harry Potter fan either so after the over-boring Chamber of secrets, my expectations towards this one were even lower. Luckily this part was a positive surprise. It was but a darker and more exciting sequel it was also funny to watch. It seems the creator team really paid attention to the details and didn't rush with this part same way as with the previous part.The new creatures, ""the demendors"", were very interesting and frightening and gave the movie totally new power and danger. The overall tension of the film was also way darker than in the first two. This time the danger was something real and in presence all the time.On the other hand the movie had not forgotten the humor either. The first episode in ""real"" world was refreshing and very fun to watch.In the Chamber of secrets, the wonderful outdoors were more forgotten and we spent unnecessary long time inside the dark halls with little of interesting details. One of the few scenes outside in that one were actually inside a greenhouse which points out how forgotten the outside world really was. This time we will see the wonderful visual side of Hogwarts once more and it is even more detailed than in the first one. The creator team seemed to have realized the infinite possibilities what kind of a world they can create and how well the nature can be combined with it. Along with the nature we will be introduced with several new interesting creatures of the wild too that all have their meaning and part in the movie.The growing up of the actors bring the own spice to the movie. It opens up the chance for elements which were not possible with the children. It seems the old actors are starting to get used to with their roles since they felt more comfortable and seemed to handle their characters better than previously.The biggest flaw with the old movies was the way most students were left behind and the ""hero trio"" seemed to have the spotlight on all the time although the events were supposed to affect the entire Hogwarts. This time that matter feels more logical because the danger is more centered to Harry Potter, not to the overall school life. Also the teachers seem to be more alive and actually take a contact with the events and the students. In the first movies they seemed to wish someone would get hurt.It still doesn't mean the movie is perfect. It has its own flaws with some of its illogical and slightly paradoxical scenes. Also although the movie lasts for nearby 2½ hours, it still feels like it needed something more. It doesn't fill the idea of a complete feature film with the beginning, the halfway and the ending. To be honest the sign ""to be continued"" would have suited to the ending very well.Overall the movie is a refreshing return to Hogwarts. The story has gained a new strength the actors are more confident with their characters. Also the atmosphere of the magical world lingers in the movie again. As a non-fan, I found this movie to be a far more successful sequel than the previous Chamber of Secrets.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

488,bloodbathcat,Great stuff !,8,10 September 2005,"While the first two Harry Potter movies were fun and entertaining The Prisonner of Azkaban gives you something more substantial. Watching the movie really gives you the feeling of being immersed in the magical world created by J.K.Rowling. I've read the book a couple of years ago and it was a true pleasure to see the people, monsters and artifacts of Hogwarts (all of which I had already almost forgot). The script of The Prisoner of Azkaban is tight and does a good job of bringing together the best elements of the novel. Sure the director has taken a few liberties ( notably with the dialogs ) but unless you are a Potter maniac chances are it won't bother you. As a result the movie is well balanced ( this time, thankfully, we don't have to go through an over-long Quidditch match...). The rhythm of the movie is flawless : after a long enough first part which lets you appreciate the depth of Rowling's imagination, the action gets rolling and don't let go. The special effects are mostly of great quality, my favorite being the talking paintings and the Marauder's map. The animation in the sequence where Hermione gets molested by a tree is way too blurry, though. A weakness of the movie, in my opinion, is that the Harry Potter character, seems a bit flat. With all the wonders around him I didn't care much what happened to him. Maybe it's also got to do with the somewhat flat acting of Radcliff. And the girl playing Hermione gives a poor performance : the only time I liked her acting was when she was running.. But Ron is great so it evens out !So The Prisoner of Azkaban is a great adventure movie in the same way Indiana Jones 2 and The Goonies were more than a decade ago (Ah those glorious movies of my youth !). They are thrilling and exotic teen movies and that's a nice combination. When the 7 Potter movies are complete I'm sure the third one will stand out. 8/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
489,gary-1234,One of the best,9,18 August 2019,"As for me and many of my friends this is one of the best of the series. It is the first movie with a new Director after Chris Columbus directed the first two and is also the first with Sir Michael Gambon as Dumbledore replacing deceased Richard Harris.So Director Alfonso Cuaron is faced with the reality of providing continuity for the much beloved series while having to blend in a new actor for one of the primary roles. The other reality is taking the third book which is approximately 150 pages longer than the first and 100 pages longer than the second and keeping it within a reasonable length without cleaving too much. He accomplishes this while trimming run time by approximately 15 minutes.Again, each movie has to undergo the often harsh reviews of faithful readers who have their own ingrained bias regarding how the film should have portrayed characters and scenes. Having watched the movies before attacking the books I can say that I have my own feelings on how well these transitions were accomplished. However, having seen the movies prior to reading the books, I was free to judge movies as they are...movies.The last thing I will add is just a personal note. I felt the performances of Ekow Quartey and LeeIngleby to be magnificent. In Ekow's small speaking roles he delivers each convincingly and in my opinion greatly portrays the severity of the issues at hand. Lee, who i remember from ""Master and Commander"" does a great job as Stan Shunpike. Sometimes these small roles enhance the overall movie viewer's experience and theirs certainly did for me.As I have stated, to me and many others as evidenced by the ratings, this is one of the best.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
490,jholtz,Disappointing for all but a few...(possible spoilers),8,6 June 2004,"Yes, the movie was fast paced; yes, it held my attention; yes, it was more mature than the first two. That said, it was sadly disappointing.I've read all the books and saw the first two movies. I went to this movie with two children who saw the first two movies, and their parents, one of whom knew nothing about the books or the movies. No one but I understood the movie. No one could follow it, beyond the surface story.Too much essential detail was left out, evidenced by the questions I heard afterwards: What are the dementors doing when they do that sucking thing? Why did they keep going after Harry and not the other students? Why didn't Harry get in trouble for zapping Snape? Why did Sirius Black break out now? How did they know which animal was involved? What happened to Trelawney? Why didn't McGonigle know what was going on? More important, why didn't Snape know what was going on?? On a different level, why not a bit more attention to making Dumbledore look more similar to Richard Harris? A little more hair, a little more beard would have done wonders. No, that might not matter to adults, but it matters to children!I can only hope that a Director's Cut exists, and that IT will be what's on the DVD when it's released.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
491,farne,Returns to Hogwarts,7,27 January 2005,"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, brings the usual assorted hazards, challenges and life-threatening scrapes we've come to expect from this series. This time Potter is under threat from Sirius Black, an escapee from Azkaban Prison., who is apparently intent on murdering our hero and prematurely ending one of the most successful film series of all time. Along the way Harry must also face the frightening Dementor (the spectral guards of Azkaban Prison), get the better of Draco Malfoy, and save Hagrid's new pet from a sticky end.Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is as well-produced as its predecessors, and atmospherically (if gloomily) photographed by Michael Seresin, with the usual excellent set designs (by Stuart Craig), impressively-realised visual effects and another good score from John Williams. There's also the usual excellent supporting cast, and the roll-call of Potter cast members is approaching a who's-who of British acting talent. This time Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis and Julie Christie join series regulars Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Julie Walters and others. If nothing else, these films are at least keeping half of Equity in employment.I have to admit to being a little disappointed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which stuck too closely to the formula of the first film, but The Prisoner of Azkaban at least introduces some new elements in the plot department. As in the previous two films, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts master plays an important role in the story. This time, however, the plot is a bit less predictable, and the audience is kept guessing which side Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and some of the other characters are on. But there is also some evidence of sloppy writing, particularly with the ""time turner"" device, which is conveniently produced to save the day at one point.Of the new cast members, only David Thewlis really gets that much of a part. Gary Oldman is very under-used as the prisoner Sirius Black, and Julie Christie barely appears. Michael Gambon meanwhile, does a decent enough job as the late Richard Harris's replacement as Professor Dumbledore. Tom Felton (as Potter's schoolboy nemesis Draco Malfoy) is also improved. In the first couple of films he seemed hopelessly miscast, but this time the makers seem to have realised his portrayal of Malfoy is more snivelling than threatening, and he seems more convincing.A lot has been made of the frightening nature of some of the scenes in the film, particularly the Dementors. However, if you could take the hordes of giant spiders in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets you'll probably be fine here too. More to the point is whether children will really have the patience to sit through another two hour plus Harry Potter epic. Like its predecessors, The Prisoner of Azkaban could go with cutting by about 10-15 minutes and will seem long even for adult audiences. Sometimes these films have seemed a little too faithful and reverential to their source material, hence the impressive running times. As the books The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are twice the length of their predecessors, the film-makers will have to lose their excessive caution and do some serious cutting and refashioning of the story if the next two films are to be a manageable length.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
492,negativec07,Totally uninteresting,5,1 June 2004,"****possible spoilers****I will admit beforehand that I have not seen the other 2 films, or read any of the books. Also, I went into the cinema fulling expecting not to like this film at all (but then again I thought that with Lord of the Rings and ended up loving it.) However, having just got back from watching the film, my over-riding emotion is one of confusion.Even my friend who's read the books agreed that the film made no sense. One moment Black is an evil scheming baddie, the next he's a hero. Eh? What was the point in that glowing horse? How did Black manage to escape and remain undetected in the first place? Does that bully actually have anything useful to do? If you've read the book then you'll know the answers. If you haven't, you'll sit there wondering just what the hell is going on.My main gripe against the film is that nothing ever actually happens. A few under-developed plot strings amble on towards the (anti) climax, with an especially lame werewolf making its not-so-scary appearance towards the end. Put simply, the film goes nowhere and has nothing to say - characters are barely developed at all. By the way, its blatantly obvious who the werewolf is - just listen out for the characters surnames.Being boring is perhaps the worst crime any film can commit, especially one that is aimed at kids. Yes I know I'm a 21 year old male and hence not in the films target demographics. But the secret of good kids movies is that they are enjoyable to all ages (for example Finding Nemo or Ice Age). Harry Potter is just plain dull. Poorly scripted, poorly acted (apart from Alan Rickman - who is always brilliant per se) and poorly edited. If you're a 10 year old Harry Potter fanatic I guess you might enjoy it a bit more, but then again you'll see the movie regardless of what anyone says. I wish I could've spent my money seeing Troy or the Day After Tomorrow again. I'm sure Harry Potter and it's inevitable sequels will do just fine at the box office though. Now, where did I leave my Return of the King DVD........",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
493,john3-2,Entertaining for someone who didn't read the books,8,6 June 2005,"This is the best of the Harry Potter films thus far, but as other have pointed out it's a bit dark and scary for younger children (10 and younger). Some of the scenes are pretty intense, especially the scene where a man transforms into a werewolf. The actors all seem to be growing into the roles, especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). The special effects are impressive and are well integrated into the film. The film runs long (2-1/2 hours) but it's fast paced and doesn't drag at any point. My one complaint is that the plot is a bit confusing at times if you haven't read the books. My daughters helped answer some of my questions as I watched, and maybe the target audience is readers of the books, so it's a minor complaint.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
494,Dannov747,Best in the series,9,4 January 2013,"Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter film. It is the only one in the series that shows the magic of the HP universe while presenting a film mature enough for adults but fun enough for children. Where this film completely beats the others though, is the pacing. Excluding the Shrieking Shack scene, the film never seems rushed. And unlike the films following this one, at no point does a non-fan sit and wonder whats going on. The directors and writers of later HP films trip fail to explain simple plots, but PoA does it with little fuss. Little scenes relevant to the main story appear in between classes, so that the plot keeps moving, something that a film like the Order of the Phoenix, failed at completely. The director in this does very well. The awkwardness present in some scenes in other HP movies is not present here. Scenes are shot through nice camera angles, and the director takes full advantage of the brilliant setting by showing quite a few long shots of the castle. The audio is quite great as well.The acting is an improvement over the last two films, but not great. The only other complain I have is the rushed climactic scene where the trio meet the antagonist. They do a poor job of explaining the twist in the story. One does wonder why the producers spent so much time on classes and then rushed the main part.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
495,uckpshh,The best harry potter movie so far: which isn't saying much,1,3 February 2005,"I want to say that I'm giving this movie a one because I think it deserves less than whatever the average currently is at IMDb. However, if this review had nothing to do with averaging out the score, I would give it a five. Firstly, ""Something wicked this way comes"", grammatically it makes no sense, it would make sense if you said, ""something wicked comes this way"". Special effects are still bad, but they take a small step up, Cuaron seems to know what he's doing. At least better than Chris Columbus, who only got the job because he was prepared to be Rowling's tool. Then we come to the acting, though there seems to be a love interest brewing between Ron and Hermione, the ugliest two individuals to ever appear on screen at the same time, I can't help but feel that Ron is in the closet but trying desperately to leap out. None of these actors are charming, and furthermore Richard Harris passed away, probably the most talented of the cast from before. They were smart in cutting out a few scenes and it works well as a two hour movie. A step up from the past two films and hopefully a saving grace in the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
496,chaz_burgess,Don't expect sugar and spice,9,23 August 2005,"As a true Potter addict, this is by far my favourite of the three. But don't expect any nice sugariness as we saw in the first two. With Columbus gone, we are left with the darker effects of Mr Caurons direction, which makes for a more grown up and serious Harry Potter. Viewers will note that the pictures might seem a bit cold and blue and that some of the original set has been moved around, just some little touches added by Cauron. Gone are the cheesy lines from the first books such as Harmiones obsession with Harry's broken glasses. The young actors seem far more at ease with themselves in the skin of their characters, showing greater maturity and understanding. You will also notice the humour that comes under the hand of Cauron. The new soundtrack, again by master of film scores John Williams, is very different from the often repetitive music from the first two films in the series, not as catchy but more devisive. Fans of the book will not be disappointed with this reproduction, but be warned that some scenes are a little disturbing, even for some sensitive adults, and not all children will be impressed. If you are lucky enough to have your hands on the DVD, don't forget to check out the extras disc for some truly entertaining moments with the Shrunken Head, engaging interviews and fun games.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
497,swansongang,Harry Potter and the Spanish Inquisition,8,28 May 2005,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS! I could type a very short commentary about the fact that over Summer Break, the Spanish have conquered England, Hogwarts has been used as a bomb-testing site (don't worry, they rebuilt it, and it has a clock tower, too), and my uneasiness about having a breath mint passed off as a soul. But I won't. I am going to type a very long commentary about one of the WORST book-to-movie adaptations of all time. Please note that the 5 is only given from a MOVIE standpoint; to be fair to all those fools who have not read the books, I will not give it the 2 I so dearly desire. Check the threads later for a complete review of my rants, but here are a few. One: If they were not sure about what souls look like, DON'T HAVE THEM SHOW IT! The book doesn't have it--the dementors are pretty lame in the movie in that scene. Two: WHERE ARE THE ROBES!? They are wizards, they wear robes, not...not...MUGGLE GARMENTS! I think Alfonso or someone just wanted Hermione to show off more. You'll notice that she is center on some of the posters, and very prominent. Three: Er, where's the backstory? Ron doesn't seem too angry at Hermione for having her cat eat his pet. In the book, they argue. Not here. Now,they all just are a happy bunch, and getting very mushy, too.Four: WHAT HAPPENED TO HOGWARTS!? It is not the same castle--and why is there a pendulum? Poor Neville is going to get clobbered by that thing!Five: Speaking of Neville, where is he? And Goyle? And everyone else? Wood? Nope. Cedric? I think he gets roasted by a lightning bolt. Malfoy? Where is that evil-looking, arrogant, cold, smooth villain, anyway? He seems to be missing. There's only an ugly meanie who looks similar.Six: Does it disturb anyone that there are shrunken heads everywhere? Consider: where do they get these heads? Think of that. Seven: How did Sirius escape? They kind of forget to say that. Plot hole, right there. Also on plot holes, the thestrals are invisible, despite the fact that Harry saw Quirrel die in #1. (This is not a mistake in the books). And might I inquire WHY there are so many weirdos who sing with TOADS? Also, Harry is a nobody, it seems--he has never won a Quidditch cup...but another key plot hole: wouldn't it be proof that Peter was alive if they found his CLOTHES on the GROUND!? Eight: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! IT'S THE KILLER BIPEDAL GREYHOUND! Nine: Does a pathetic howl really sound like a werewolf, or is that just because it was the killer bipedal greyhound? Ten: The school is not safe. Our dear headmaster Dumbledore thinks hitting Ron on the leg is amusing! And he saves Harry when he falls, but lets the Hufflepuff seeker get blasted out of the sky!Eleven: In the book, Harry never sees a Grim. He only sees Sirius. What is that cloud formation? Twelve: The final shot is kind of freaky.Actually, though, there were one or two good parts. Buckbeak looked awesome, and some of the magic usage was cool (no longer flashy, but actually magical). And Lupin and Sirius were great, though Sirius did seem a little happy for being in a soul-sucking prison for twelve years. And John Williams is good once more. But seriously, this movie was the biggest letdown I have had. Check the post ""100 Complaints about the Movie,"" coming soon, for a list of book-related comments. Most of the above concerned the movie. Thank you for your patience, and watch the fourth one...AND READ THE BOOKS!

498,Ross16,The best Harry Potter film yet!,6,3 September 2008,"I remember seeing the all of the Harry Potter films in theaters. The first one I saw twice in the theater, the fifth one I saw only once. The rest I saw three times, however, the third Harry Potter film is the only one that I saw in the IMAX theater. And not to say is that because I saw it in IMAX, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" remains my favorite of the Harry Potter series. And while at that, I thought the series has gotten better as the time goes along. Harry Potter and all of his friends are on their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This time around, Harry Potter hears that a deadly prisoner escapee has escaped from Azkaban prison and Harry Potter is afraid that Sirius Black (that's the name of the escapee) wants to kill him. But as soon as Harry Potter meets Sirius Black, he actually turns out to be his godfather. Sure, the story was short to explain, but on the other hand, I actually didn't mind that at all. However, be warned a lot of stuff gets left out of the book. What I would say is the worst change of all is that Harry Potter gets his broomstick at the very end. But for some reason, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" did manage to not follow-up from the book but made it in a way where it can be turned into a great movie. Overall, I thought ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was the best Harry Potter film. But that's just my honest opinion.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
499,Shiloh-3,This is the best yet,10,15 June 2004,"This film is wonderful.  It is a very faithful adaptation of the book - with all the time limitations of conversion to film duly considered.  I love the acting and I am pleased to see that the story leaned more to the characters and relationships that Harry forges through his years at Hogwarts.  There is a sense of beginning and growth in this film and not a total focus on special effects and visuals, which by the way are fabulous. The time shifting element is handled perfectly and the whole film is just a delight. I hope the trend continues to the next film which represents the jewel in the crown so far as the books go up to now. Please see this film and enjoy it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
500,cookedw,"Overly dramatic, the latest Potter flick fails because of direction",6,5 June 2004,"From the get-go, it's clear that the latest Harry Potter film was directed by someone else.  Unlike the first two, which do their damnedest to mimic Rawling's magical and slightly whimsical portrayal of the world she creates, Cuaron's interpretation focuses on a much darker element that is barely evident in the story.  Aside from a few forced jokes, there is very little whimsy in his take on the book, which is a travesty.One of the clearest problems in Cuaron's direction is the overly fluid way in which he moves the film.  There are no stepping stones or key events which really stick with the viewer.  Instead, he spends a good chunk of the movie showing the passage of time, which is just downright silly.  This changes a bit in the last twenty minutes, but by that point I just wanted the film to end already...it had run its course.  I didn't care about the characters because, apart from a few choice lines by Emma Watson, there was very little depth to the characters -- they were devices to move a simplified plot.Apart from pacing, Cuaron also flops in his misunderstanding of the material he has to work with.  Though he may have taken the song from Macbeth, I have a feeling Cuaron felt he was dealing with something more akin to Bradbury's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"".  This is just not the case.  The Harry Potter books, even as the story becomes darker, just do not have that dark, haunting tone.  Between the music (say it isn't so, John Williams!), the darkened visuals, and the over-use of the grim reaper characters, he tries to infuse Rawling's tale with something that just isn't there, turning a story which is very clearly made for kids into something that is clearly not aimed at children but far beneath what any adult moviegoer would have any desire to see.  It's an unnecessary seriousness that just doesn't work.  If you've seen Y Tu Mama Tambien, however, you shouldn't really be all that surprised, for there, too, he tried to make something out of nothing (or rather, too much out of not much, since he had three separate themes that diluted each other).Hopefully the return of a less serious director (Mike Newell) will set the Harry Potter series back on course.  As much as J.K. Rawling would like to take herself seriously, these are still just kids books -- Cuaron should have recognized that.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
501,shea_bennett,Excellent,9,31 May 2004,"Darker and a lot more magical than the two previous movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban comes highly recommended. The three main actors have all aged but this works better with the heavier subject matter of the third installment of the Potter franchise. Michael Gambon is excellent as Richard Harris' replacement for Dumbeldore and after about half of the movie you fail to notice the actor has been changed. Emma Thompson and Dawn French are amusing in supporting roles. My only gripe is that the excellent Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was once again criminally unused, and overall it's astonishing how little screentime the A-list actors receive! Draco Malfoy is also totally useless in this movie - what happened to that boy? I figured by now he'd been inspiring fear, not laughs. Perhaps not suitable for very younger children - my 3 1/2 year old found the werewolf scenes a bit tense, to say the least. My eight-year old loved it, however. Overall, a strong 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
502,wmnapolita,"A Great Movie, But Not As Good As The Book (SPOILERS)",9,13 June 2004,"SPOILERS ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban"" so far is my favorite book in the series.  I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I saw the first one.  I went to see it yesterday, and I must admit, I think I liked the book a little better. The movie left a lot out, such as the origins of Harry's father's Animagi talent, why Snape went to the shrieking shack to save them, etc. I read the book four years ago, and didn't remember that much. My friend was talking about all the stuff the movie left out, and I was like ""Wow, yeah"". Don't get me wrong, though, I still enjoyed this movie. The first arrival of the Dementor was awesome, and I liked the werewolf because it was a kind of new idea for one. They did the whole time-turner thing great, but I felt that Ron, Hermione, McGonagall, Malfoy, and others weren't really in this movie too much; they were more prominent in the other films. Still, this was a very good movie. You probably want to avoid bringing really young kids to this, as it may scare them a bit. But other than that, this was a wonderful movie. 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
503,Animal89,much better than the other two,8,5 June 2004,"WARNING: contains very minor SPOILERSThis is the best Harry Potter film so far and beats the other films by 100 miles. This film is a lot less plastic than the other two especially the first and has a much simpler but solid story line, it also doesn't confuse you by showing all the lessons which have nothing to with the story. It also has a less clear line between goody and bady and lets you have the freedom to make up your own mind. The special effects are finally starting to get better as well. My only criticism of this film is that in the first half it rushes right to the last few chapters of the book and a lot of important information either goes past to fast to notice or isn't there at all.Recommended: to anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series in books or films or likes fantasy in general. Or is a fan of anyone in the cast.Not recommended: maybe to young kids, this one is scarier than the other twoWatch this if you liked: The other 2 Harry Potter films, the Harry Potter books, lord of the rings, the worst witch (TV)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
504,FairiShadows,A different spin (possible plot spoilers),9,5 June 2004,"Well, I gotta say, I enjoyed it. Probably not as much as I thought I would, but I'd definitely see it again. It was everything I expected and yet not at all.Cuaron definitely brought a new spin to the wonderful world of Potter with a darker, more serious spin on an enchanting tale. There is however, just enough whimsy to let you know you are indeed watching a Harry Potter film. I don't know if it was Klove's writing or Cuaron's direction, but there is a definite growth of the characters and in the story telling. While the first two films matched closely to the book, deviating only a little the third film makes it known that this is an adaptation not a recreation. There is definitely a change of focus in that it is not on the overall story, but on one main event. In doing so, there is something reminiscent of M. Knight Shamalan's 'The Sixth Sense'.  I gotta say I liked that. The characters themselves have grown and you can see that. There are also times when you look at all of them and say: yeah, these are real kids. They could be your own kids or the kids next door. In that alone, you can almost forget they're at a school for witchcraft and there are flying fantasy creatures carrying them about. The movie like the books takes the more serious darker spin and runs with it. I truly did enjoy the film, but unlike Chamber of Secrets, I didn't entirely know what I was getting into. The formula was discarded and we had to begin again. My fear would be that people will see this film with the first two in mind and be left shell-shocked or disgusted. The differences are like night and day. It's like going to into an ice cream shop and ordering the pink ice cream assuming it must be strawberry and finding out it's lemon. Lemon's a good flavor, but it's just not what you expected and quite possibly wanted. There were children in the theater younger than 8 years old, and if the film were more like the first two, I wouldn't have been bothered, but for me, this film is perhaps a little too dark and scary and a bit above their heads. The more I think about it, the more I love this film, but as I feel with the books, the films are entering times that are not necessarily suitable for younger viewers. All in all though, it was quite enjoyable and I'd see it again. My only advice is that no one see the film expecting anything. Just go in and enjoy!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
505,madam_Q,A visual feast with bite,8,13 June 2004,"Harry Potter is growing up! The voice is deepening, the shoulders are broadening and...hurray! You no longer feel like a creep for having a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe...whoops, did I say that out loud? Say what you will, I see him making the jump from child star to adult actor in a way that Haley Joel Osment only dreams of.Appropriately, this third film in the Harry Potter series has matured along with it's young stars. At first glance the storyline itself is relatively simple - Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and young Harry is on his hit list. But the reality is that this movie is about being a teenager and all the trials and tribulations that go with it. On one level, Harry is like any other kid at school - he puts up with torment from bullies, gets into scrapes with his teachers and hangs out with his friends. But this is not just any school. This is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry has a whole OTHER set of problems. Like an escaped madman who may just want to kill him, for example.The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. The focus is on Harry's past - Sirius Black was his godfather but just may have been in league with he who's name cannot be mentioned. There is the usual game of 'are they or aren't they?' when it comes to deciding which characters are really the baddies. Alan Rickman continues to walk the finest of lines between good and bad with his marvelous performance as Professor Snape. Has there ever been a better match of actor and character? Snape shows again that, while he may take occasional delight in making his students' lives difficult, he does have their best interests at heart - like any good teacher. Other plot quirks worked well - I enjoyed the way the time travel angle was worked in and the map showing the location of everyone in Hogwarts was a delight.Visually, this is a much darker film and it is a sumptuous treat for the eyes. There is so much incredible detail in the sets that it's impossible to absorb it all in one sitting. All the staples from the other films are there - the paintings talk, the staircases move, ghosts roam the halls - watch out for the knights on horseback crashing through windows! The special effects are all top notch. A word of caution for any parents - there are some genuine scares here. The Dementors are particularly nasty, and I would certainly think twice about letting very young children watch this film. This is without even considering it's running time - two and a half hours - which is a very long time to expect some children to sit still.One of the most impressive things about this film is the way that the young cast are more sure of themselves. As Hermione, Emma Watson grated in the first film with her occasional woodenness. Pleasingly, she has grown into herself as an actor and her performance here is much more mature. A leading lady of the future, perhaps? Hermione is growing up and is tired of being taken for an irritating goody-two shoes know it all. Rupert Grint provides comic relief and Daniel Radcliffe gives an outstanding performance, considering the whole film rests on his shoulders. Harry is the hero - the audience needs to identify with him. By the end of this film teenage girls will want to take him home to mother, while their mothers will just want to take him home and adopt him!New cast members acquit themselves well. The role of Sirius Black was tailor made for Gary Oldman - he has a requisite creepiness with just a dose of humanity to bring the character to life. Daniel Thewlis is good as Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts master who takes Harry under his wing. Emma Thompson is amusing as a Divinination professor with bad eyesight. She can see into the future but can't tell which students are falling asleep in her class! Many have criticised Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore. While it's true that he is no Richard Harris, I personally was pleased that he didn't attempt to imitate his predecessor. Gambon is accomplished enough a performer to stay true to the character while at the same time putting his own stamp on it.Take away the magic and monsters, and what you have is a coming of age movie. Harry is forced to grow up and confront both his past and his future, and come to terms with the reality that he is no ordinary wizard. With the spectra of 'you know who' continuing to loom on the horizon, roll on film four!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
506,em_1986,you really need to look at the book and the film seperately,10,9 June 2004,"When i went to see this movie, i had not read any of the Harry Potter books, although i had seen both of the previous movies.I thought that the film was totally amazing, and thought that so much had improved. Dan Radcliffe seemed much more at ease, Emma Watson wasnt over acting nearly as much and Rupert Grint was as good as in the previous two.Through out the movie, it seemed much more school like. The students seemed more like students than actors, perhaps owing to the fact that they have grown up considerably since the last two films. Professor Snape is still my favourite character and i thought that although he was meant to be menacing, Alan Rickman was also hilarious and really seemed to be enjoying the performance. After seeing this movie, i went out the nest day and brought the first three books, and am planning on buying the next two on Friday! having now read them, i noticed that there are far more departures from the books, which at time does not work that well. However, the most annoying thing is that they totally left things out, like the explanation about the map.
However, having seen the movie first, i believe that you will enjoy each as much as the other if you look at them seperately. i found both thoroughly enjoyable and cant wait to get on with reading the next two books!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

508,planetp,"Too fast, Too cut, Too short",10,5 June 2004,"This is hard to post this, but I'm disappointed with the third film. Oh, don't get me wrong, the style, the acting, the mood, the intensity and visauls... all were simply awesome, best yet in fact! I was even able to get past some of the major discontinuities. However, this film was paced too fast, almost as if everyone was over caffienated. All the scenes felt rushed. Very little was explained, too little detail, too many jumps from one scene to another - disjointed, not smooth.I mean, the film went from fall to spring (as evidenced by the Womping willow dropping, and then getting its leaves back) in less than 15 minutes by the clock! Think about it, 6 months of the school year went by in 1/8 of the film!! Rushed, rushed, rushed.They also changed the ambient ""situationals"" of several of the scenes, apparently all in an effort to get through this film as fast as possible.And finally, I think the smoking gun, is this film is 15 minutes shorter than the first two films, yet the story is longer and more complex. Why did they cut out so much? What were they thinking?No mention of Moony Padfoot, Wormtail?!!From what I can tell, this film basically went from the highlights of every OTHER chapter.Hopefully, upon repeated viewings this film will grow on me. But unlike the first two films, I walked out of the theatre feeling cheated. This film deserved to be 30 minutes longer. When the film came to an end.. my feeling was, ""that's it, it's over?""I think it obviously comes down to a combination of direction and editing. Was Alfonso on speed? Sure seems like it to me.Hopefully, they will come out with an extended version at some point, assuming they filmed more critical scenes. Please oh please, lets pray they did!Hopefully the new director, Mike Newell will do a better job for the fourth film, which is even more demanding of complexity, detail, pacing, and length.P.S. Gary Oldman was brilliant!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
509,TwzzlrFrk,"Wildly entertaining, totally fun, very dark and enthralling. Like a great ride at an amusement park . . . I wouldn't mind doing it over again.",9,5 June 2004,"So . . . where to begin? Honestly, I think this is the hardest review I've ever written. It is now two hours after the curtain closed on my first viewing of the most recent entry in the Harry Potter film franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"". Numerous thoughts are rushing through my head, some contradictory. I don't think I have yet grasped the full impact of the movie on me, but hopefully, I will know by the time I'm finished writing.Okay, before entering the movie theatre there are a few things you have to know.1) This is the third movie . . . based on the third book . . . and if you haven't read and/or seen the first two movies/books, get a refund on your ticket and get to the nearest Chapters or Blockbuster. Caurón wastes no time in explaining characters backgrounds, or explaining situations. For this, I am very grateful. Indeed it is not necessary to once again give the background on these characters. The first two movies have thrown us into this magical world that we must now accept. The focus is no longer on what in this magical world is new and exciting, but rather on how our beloved characters function within their environment. Nonetheless, we are still treated to some tremendous introductions - the purple triple-decker Knight Bus and the extraordinary hippogriff, Buckbeak, just to name a few.2) Please do accept the world that has been created for us by former director Chris Columbus, but also accept that things are different. If you go in to the theatre expecting a style similar to the first two movies, you will be extremely disappointed. Be prepared for freshness, for a completely different feel. We know much about Hogwarts now, and we no longer need wide sweeping views of its magical contents that last for a long periods of time, allowing us take in the remarkable scenery. We are happy to settle for a quicker pace, faster advancement of plot and more focus on the emotional state of the characters being viewed.3) This movie is darker . . . much darker. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was considerably darker than its predecessor, "". . . Philosopher's Stone"", but Caurón's work makes Columbus' efforts seem like ""Barney and Friends"". I am not saying that children should be barred from seeing this film. I think we underestimated children's abilities some times. ""The Wizard of Oz"", a film I compared the first in the Potter series to, has very many dark moments in it; so does Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" for that matter . . . but children are able to handle it. In fact, I dare say they enjoy a bit of fright at times. On that note, I would say that children who have read the book should see the movie. This movie is not for those who are not old enough to understand the themes, complex plot and dark nature of Book 3.So . . . what do I think? In short . . . I like it. I like it very much actually. While the first two movies seem like graphic depictions of J.K. Rowling's works, this third installment appears, to me at least, to be the first real cinematic adaptation. The movies of ""Philosopher's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" do just what the books do - paint the picture of Hogwarts in our minds - establish the scene. In ""Azkaban"", Rowling finally begins to advance the main story which ties together all seven works in the set (two of which are still to be published). The third book thus serves a very different function from the first two books, and so, the third movie fulfils the same function. As mentioned before, the focus is taken away from ""setting the scene"" and the result is a fast-paced, action-packed, fun-filled (wow, three hyphenated terms in a row!) drama, truly befitting of the character of the novel. Columbus stayed true to the first two novels by reproducing Rowling's wonderland. This task is much harder for Caurón as he has to deal with a much larger book (exceeding Book 2 by approximately 100 pages). Instead, Caurón stays true to Rowling's work by adopting the character of ""Azkaban"" and transforming it into a cinematic masterpiece.The film is visually stunning, perhaps one of the greatest visual achievements of this decade (second only to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in my opinion). While Quidditch was the triumph of ""Philosopher's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" was revered for its recreation of both Dobby and the basilisk, the CGI masterpiece of ""Azkaban"" is Buckbeak, the friendly hippogriff (friendly if your name isn't Draco Malfoy). Seldom is a CGI figure's character (I mean to say ""personality"" but it perhaps is not the most appropriate term since we are dealing with a half-eagle, half-horse) allowed to shine through. Most CGI animators focus on producing the requested image, but don't worry about portraying the character's persona. We truly feel for Buckbeak in this film; he is perhaps one of the greatest things in it. We do have the customary ""boy riding on animal"" scene (which to me was overly reminiscent of ""Free Willy"") but Caurón avoids the potential cheesiness of this scene by neglecting conventional close-ups of Harry smiling, in favour or showing the beauty of the hippogriff's flight. We experience Harry's emotion not through an extra-long close-up of his beaming face, but through our own reactions to the beauty of the moment. This shows that Caurón puts a lot of faith in his audience, and I admire that.The one CGI moment I found out-of-place was the werewolf scene. I found it look rather fake, and not nearly frightening enough. He seemed like a shaved dog howling because he was too cold and wanted to borrow somebody's coat. Nonetheless, this disappointment was quickly overcome once more scenes with the werewolf were introduced - frightening scenes which capture the viewer's complete attention.The acting in this film far supersedes its predecessors. For starters, the main trio has grown up, and they have grown considerably in their talents. For the first time, I sensed a genuine understanding of the role from Daniel Radcliffe, who plays the infamous boy wizard. Radcliffe shows great depth in some particular scenes and great chemistry with all the actors her interacts with, particularly David Thewlis, who plays the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin. (Look up the root of ""Lupin"" and try to figure out what CGI character he might relate to.) I could have done without a particular scene featuring Harry and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), but I understand it's importance to the plot. Nonetheless, the scene seemed like an anomalie in this film. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley provides the perfect amount of comic relief and I think he has established himself as the most lovable character of all in this film. Easily, the most despicable character is Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) who, though he seems to have worsened in his contemptuous attitude towards muggle borns and their friends, appears wimpy when faced with unflattering circumstances. Among the child actors, the highlight is Emma Watson, who plays Hermione. From the very first film I pinned her the best of the three, and now I know that I was right from the start. Watson exhibits are star quality not as easily apparent in the others. She has big things ahead of her. Grint's Weasley and Watson's Grainger have an adorable chemistry on screen and I look forward to seeing it develop, particularly in the fourth movie with the introduction of Bulgarian seeker Viktor Krum.The adult cast is to be admired as well, though they are sadly, yet understandably, underused. Thewlis is splendid in his performance as Lupin while Alan Rickman's Snape is as vicious as ever. It is only our knowledge that he is indeed on 'the good side' prevents us from hating him with all our being. Emma Thompson has to be one of my favourite actresses and I absolutely love her in this film. Though her scenes are short, she commands the screen whenever she is on it. Her final scene is not particularly how I imagined it, but is effective nonetheless, and she concludes it with the perfect amount of humour.Most impressive in the new cast is newcomer Michael Gambon. While I enjoyed Richard Harris' brilliant portrayal, I admire the direction Caurón has decided to take with the character, as opposed to Columbus' interpretation. I also found the character of Dumbledore lacking in the first two films. The movies seemed to capture his brilliance and his compassion, but never his eccentricity, which I also considered to be the quality that made him most appealing. Columbus opted to portray an old, wise Dumbledore, always there to offer insight to a young up-and-coming wizard. I find this new 'hippie' Dumbledore a much more accurate portrayal of what Dumbledore ought to be.This is my favourite of the five books published, but I am hesitant to call it my favourite movie. It is hard enough for me to discern which is my favourite out of the first two films. I find the cinematic achievements behind 'Chamber of Secrets' more fulfilling, but the story behind 'Philosopher's Stone' is more appealing. I now struggle with whether I even want to compare Potter No. 3 to its older siblings. It differs in appearance, mood, character and plot. Yet, if I take it upon myself to draw up a list of my ten favourite films each year among a wide array of film styles, I should be able to choose between three films based on the same theme.I think it all comes down to this . . .'Philosopher's Stone' is purely magical and, in my opinion, is destined to become a classic - a film that children will watch for ages to come. 'Chamber of Secrets' is a step up in cinematic technique, and a thrilling sequel, much like 'Empire Strikes Back' is to 'Star Wars'. 'Azkaban' is a cinematic achievement far surpassing the efforts of the first two film. In fact, it is essentially the first real cinematic venture in the franchise. The first two films still seem to me to Chris Columbus' depiction of J.K. Rowling's universe, while this third film is Alfonso Caurón's theatrical rendition of Rowling's masterpiece. I think it is a damn good film.I do not think that 'Azkaban' will enjoy the same treatment that will be given to 'Philosopher's Stone' in the future. It will not be considered a classic. It will be just one film in a series of seven. Nonetheless, when it is all said and done, and all seven movies have been made, 'Azkaban' will be looked upon as the one that changed the franchise; the one where everything matured. I for one hope that Warner Bros. continues the trend of finding new directors for each entry. I think it will add so much to series. I look forward for Mike Newell's 'Goblet of Fire'. I do hope, however, that he takes more pages from Caurón's book than he does from Columbus'. While Columbus' style is so appropriate for the first two films, it would ruin the fate of the other books. The future of the Harry Potter franchise lies within building upon what Caurón has done.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
510,mannix-6,Fanfiction at best,3,21 June 2004,"After seeing the net flooded with Harry Potter fanfiction I can honestly say that the stories Rowling writes seem like nothing BUT fan-fiction. (Perhaps she plays too much fluffy dungeons and dragons) Harry Potter and the Plot of Holes perhaps.  A couple neat innovations and the filmmaking was good but the story and characters are barely watchable with the exception of David Thewlis who absolutely shines as Lupis. He seemd to be the only one given any meaty acting things to do. But when he's not there, there's little else of interest apart from the CGI creatures. (The Grim is probably the best of these)There's so much deus ex machina in the stories however because everything is solved by these really powerful magic items that these kids just ""happen"" to find or be given. Now I can accept that I suppose, but the thing I still can't buy is the illogic that hese young wizards, in all the history of Hogwart's, acquire these really powerful items yet all the adults who are all really powerful wizards and witches not only don't have any of these kinds of things but they are absolutely oblivious to items such as this and that the kids are using them. This is impossible to swallow. Since the entire plot is based on magical gadgets solving all the kids' problems, obviously there isn't much to see except special effects.Save your money and go see Shrek 2 again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
511,e_tippett,Relationship between Lupin and Sirius,9,7 June 2004,"Maybe I am right out to lunch but did anyone else catch an idea that Lupin and Sirius were more than friends? They seemed very close (that was a really tight hug when they first saw each other again) and the comment about ""did you take your potion today"" sounded very much like an old couple where one person asks the spouse if they took their blood pressure pills today. Also when Snape burst in and said they were quarreling like an old married couple... And lets not forget that Lupin was leaving conveniently when Sirius was on the run. Who else could have told Sirius that Harry's broom got trashed so he would send a new one with a Buckbeak feather?  Why would Sirius care about quidditch? Only a person close to Harry like his teacher would have known how much he loved the game. {and I am SO not getting into the scene where Lupin is packing because ""parents wouldn't want someone like me teaching their kids--so so SO not going there, nice substitution of the werewolf allegory}I'm not trying to get dirty minded about this, it just seemed to me like they were close. I have to admit I haven't read the book yet but I will.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
512,ScarletSwimmer,One of my favorite books...not my favorite movie.,8,14 April 2007,"Like many Potter fans, I felt that after number two much magic was lost in the series. However, JK Rowlings ever increasingly better plot lines make up what the movie lacks. This was one of my favorite books, so despite a lot quirky things added(hem hem, shrunken heads anyone??), I still found ways to enjoy this movie.The actors have grown up a lot, not completely for the best. Dan Radcliff is not yet good at pulling off emotional scenes-I sincerely hope he gets better as he matures. And I found Emma Watson rather annoying, to be honest. However, Rupert Gint as well as the Weasly twins have matured well, and I feel are absolutely perfect for their roles.The adult actors are also wonderful-Alan Rickman is still brilliant as Snape, Gary Oldman was cast well as Sirius, Lupin, McGonagall...Alas, Alan Rickman no longer can bring his magic to the movies. I really didn't feel any connection to Michael Gambon, but maybe with time..Not the best movie, but very good actors and plot make up for the set/director changes.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
513,jermdown,Great! Loved it!,10,12 June 2004,"Loved th first two, but found that they included just too much of the books. It just shows how a film can become a bit boring if you try and include everything (even though I loved every part of the book).This film is excellent.Pure magic (excuse the pun). Word of caution though, I went along with my friends (we're 17) and even I was a bit freaked. My friend, Monique, was looking out through her fingers at some parts.Great movie though. Kids film?.....dunno, teen film....YES!Film adults?...probably. If you liked the first two and love the books, then be prepared for a different Potter film but a better Potter film.

514,chrysalis_writter,"JK Rowling says ""Best one yet"" and I agree!!!",10,10 September 2004,"You want to slam the director for cutting, cutting, cutting, go for it. I agree, it's painful sometimes to watch a film based on a book and notice the missing pieces everywhere.Now, get over it. Put the freakin' book down, clear your head and watch the film.That's right, the film, not the book, the film.First, let's get Chris Columbus out of the way. He's one of the blandest, clumsiest directors out there. Don't forget, this man forever left us with that damned us with that Home Alone film and I will never for give him. The first two Potter films were slow, episodic dribble that while holding the story of the book together where tedious and uninvolving to those who had not read it, and those who had. I dreaded the films from the minute I heard he was helming them and hoped beyond hope they would. Well they did.Second, let's talk about what was done right. The dialogue is honest, the acting is ten-fold better, the special effects near perfect, the lighting brilliant, the tone flawless and the camera never stagnant and always involving. Third, the story; the point is there. Don't argue that he cut stuff out because the Author okayed it and I think she would know what has to be there! Finally; JK Rowling approves the film and proclaimed it the Best of the Three! Okay, the author herself, the person who penned those books you lonely fanatics hold so dear signed off on it and showered it with praise.So there, detractors, take that.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Generally I think they did well, I do worry however about their ability to continue to do the movies if they continually leave out ""small"" things in the movie that come back to be ""big"" things later. Casting is, as it was for the others, near perfect. When I read the books the characters look almost to a tee like the actors. The acting is good, Gary Oldman and the actor who plays Lupin do an especially good job. Buckbeak is better than I would have expected as is most of the magic effects. The patronus is the exception here and in general I thought that was lousy. All in all above my expectations but below the standard of the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
517,Pulpmariachi,"Excellent Film, Very Well Done by Cuaron (Maybe Some Spoilers)",10,29 November 2004,"I love the Harry Potter books a lot, they're really fun to read and have some good suspenseful moments (except for the end of Book Five, which only really evoked anger. Thank God for Fred and George) and great images that you can think of in your mind. Are the books the best thing ever written? No. Not even close, but they're still great. And my favorite one so far (waiting in anticipation for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and whatever Book Seven will be) is Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. Don't get me wrong, the first two were great, but Book Three took the cake.I really like the books, but am not the biggest fan of the franchise.I was disappointed in the first two films. Film One wasn't very good at all, too much CGI and the kids weren't really working their characters Film Two was much better, but again, the kids weren't the characters and there was way too much CGI camera effects. So what did I expect about Film Three? First, I was stoked to see that Chris Colombus wasn't going to direct these films, and when I found out that Alfonso Cuaron (from Y Tu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess fame) was helming this project I was psyched out of my mind and I probably anticipated this film more than any other this summer (and third for the entire year, after The Incredibles and Kill Bill Volume 2).Was I let down?No. First of all, Cuaron says a nice ""Screw You"" to Colombus's vision of a happy castle where everyone gets along and little furry woodland creatures come up and sing songs. Hogwarts is now dark and mysterious, now maliciously lurking in the shadows. More like the Hogwarts I pictured while reading the books. And then there's this cool bridge thingy that stretches out, which is one of my favorite editions, along with the clocktower. If not for anything else, check out this film for its amazing cinematography and superb direction by Cuaron.The actors finally come into their characters. And Emma Watson becomes a total hottie. I think what helped a lot is the focus more on entering puberty and growing up rather than playing with magic. On a sidenote, Cuaron had the kids write an essay about their characters. Daniel Radcliff turned in one about 3 pages long, Emma Watson turned one in 16 pages long, and Rupert Grint didn't even do it. But the kids are now the characters and you're totally engrossed by the story.Which is: Harry Potter is going back to Hogwarts, but is being pursued by this escaped convict from the wizard version of Alcatraz, Azkaban. Everyone is scared pantsless and dementors (basically Ringwraiths that can fly and suck out your soul, but are still cool nonetheless) patrol the school grounds. We find out that the convict is Sirius Black, a friend of the Potters who betrayed them and wants to kill Harry because he wants Voldemort to go back to power (or does he?). Harry gets pissed and wants to kill him for doing what he did. I did have a few problems with the film, that kept it from being perfect. I thought the confrontation with Sirius Black was a little TOO rushed. And the werewolf really didn't do anything for me.But those problems are cancelled out by the best time-travel scene so far and the wonderful acting and cinematography. Not to mention the CGI effects are mainly thrown in the background, since Cuaron wisely wants to focus more on the characters, something that I think Colombus would have never done. That's not to say there aren't any. But they look good and fit with everything else in the film. Like Buckbeak, who is very well done, and then the return of the Whomping Willow, now more as a character rather than a prop. Still, this film also has my favorite CGI camera work, when we go through this clocktower...So awesome. I saw this with a friend and he had more problems than I did and complained about them before saying he overall liked the movie. I really only had those two problems so I really, really enjoyed it. With the fans of the books this is either their favorite (as in my case) or their least favorite, and from what I've seen on message boards and stuff, it seems to be the same for the films. I say check it out, because it's really worth it. I give it 3.5/4.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
518,peegeedee3,Harry Potter!!!!!,10,23 March 2005,"Hey there. I've read all of the current Harry Potter books, and being in my late 50s didn't spoil the fun for me one bit. In fact I have a huge crush on Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Oh, I love Harry too, Daniel is a real cutey but, I feel so much for the Weasleys, all of them, because of how the horribleMalfoys treat all. It was like when I was a little girl and watched ""Peter Pan"" on TV for the first time, it was a play, and Mary Martin played Peter. That didn't matter, it was the adventure of it all that got me into wanting to read everything and anything I could on those sorts of adventures. Anything that took you away from everyday reality and lead you into another world! I never thought that I would actually get hooked on the Harry Potter books, but a young boy that I was baby-sitting for had gotten the book I think it was ""The Goblet of Fire"", for a Christmas present, and left it over my house for me to read. After I was through, I was thoroughly hooked. I had a sad feeling that the production wouldn't, no, couldn't be as magical as the books were. I thank heaven that I was wrong! To me it is right up there with the thrilling ""Matrix"" series. Yes, I say honestly that I love the Harry Potter movies, and I have seen them all to date, just as much as I loved, ""The Jungle Book"", the ""Star Trek"" series and the movies, the ""Star Wars"" movies, ""Blade Runner"", The TV series, ""Farscape"", ""The X-Files"", ""Star-Gate"", the movie and the series! I could go on and on, 'cause I am a SciFi fanatic! I even loved ""A Wrinkle in Time"", and if you haven't read that book, I really think that you should!!! You wouldn't be sorry! I loved Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula, of course, but even more, I loved him in ""The Fifth Element""!!! Zorg was a fantastic character for him to play, and he played him to the hilt! I watch any movie that he is in, when it comes on TV, (He is one of my favorite actors, next to Mickey Rourke, you know)? I also love Jason Isaacs in his part, Malfoy, he is so sleazy, and mean. So different than he was as Mr. Darling and so good as Captain Hook! Or in Resident Evil, which are the only other parts I remember him in! Oh my daughter, Cherokee just told me he was in Elektra!!! Another great movie. I loved Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'll miss him. I do think that Michael Gambon is doing a wonderful job replacing him. Many people I talked to didn't know the difference, but then they aren't videophiles, like my three children and I am!!! Anyway, I just wanted to give ""Kudos"" to the entire cast of all of the Harry Potter movies!!! You've made me so happy to be able to ""get away from it all"" in your cinema world. Thanks J.K. Rowling for the books. True gifts at ten times the price!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
519,KaDaWe,"Completely Different Style Than The First Two, But Still Great",9,19 August 2013,"Sadly Chris Columbus stopped with the directing of the ""Harry Potter"" movies after ""The Chamber of Secrets"". In my opinion, he was by far the best director of the saga. He was replaced by Alfonso Cuarón, who, I think so, wasn't a well known director at that point. What you can say from the first seconds on is that his style of adaptating ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is completely different than Columbus did it.Even though it seems like another ""Harry Potter"" series, it's still great. The story is very dark, and Cuarón captures it wonderfully. The look of Hogwarts Castle is also a lot different - sadly I don't like it very much. Even the kids look a lot different. In this case it's a great idea to change it, because they look like they have a lot more freedom. They don't wear the Hogwarts cloaks in their free time anymore, but normal clothing.The story itself is fantastic and one of the best of ""Harry Potter"".

I definitely recommend this movie",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
521,Simlady,Not the best of the series,7,23 November 2005,"I must say, I cannot understand those who say this one is the best of the Harry Potters. To me, it is clearly my least favorite. I don't understand, really, how anyone can want *less*. And this is less in every way.What, exactly, is wrong with being faithful to the books? They are GOOD books! I can understand cutting some things for time, but really - how can you leave out all of the relationships with Harry's parents? How can you leave out who made the map? I've read the books, but a friend of mine did not, and is going *only* by the movies. She was completely confused by this lack, which IMO should have been in the movie.It's not like this one was running three hours, so let's cut. It barely made two. And honestly, the one that went long - the second one - is my favorite to date. I am hoping the next one (I see it Friday) will be better than this one, and back to up to the first two's standards.Why did I dislike this one? Firstly, it was a GREAT shock to me to find this was actually about becoming a teenager. When I read it, it seemed to be about Harry's family background, and his parents' old friends. These books are very well written, with puzzle pieces all coming together, and this one was especially fun in that way. I read it to my son, who had NO idea of the surprises that came out at the end. Yes, the Scabbers surprise was still in the movie, but Peter Pettigrew was merely explained as a kid who followed Sirius Black around all the time. We needed to know about Moony, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail. It was vital. Magazines I've read have pointed out that some things can be cut without taking from the story, and some things cannot - and the author of the article (I believe he was the guy with the Harry Potter Lexicon) was specifically writing about this cut.Next, I really did not like that they changed the grounds of Hogwarts. I know they had to recast Dumbledore, and for the most part I am okay with that (I had wanted Richard Briers, who would have brought more humor to it, I think. More of the, say a few words: Idiot! Pumpkin! sort of thing from the books), but changing how the place looks suddenly is a little unnerving. If it had to be done, it should have been more subtle. It's almost like starting from scratch this way.Reading reviews of Goblet of Fire, most said they thought it to be the best of all the Harry Potter movies, but one said no, Azkaban is best. I cannot agree. I will watch it, and enjoy bits of it, but overall I was unsatisfied at the time, and eager to be on with the others the minute it was over (which, to me, was too soon). Of the ones up to Goblet, I will re watch Chamber of Secrets more often that the others, but something tells me, with Ralph Fiennes playing Voldemort, that from Goblet on I won't be looking back!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
522,chocolate_frog,"It's meaner, it's darker...but is it better?- SPOILERS",6,1 June 2004,"After a lovely hour queuing together with three year olds on sugar high,yesterday I have seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As this is the movie version of my favourite of the HP books so far, I had great expectations and couldn't wait to finally see it...So what's it like? I think it's one of the most frustrating movie I have ever seen!!! The fact that it is extraordinarily good in some things, and terribly bad in others made me feel a bit strange all the way through. I'll explain... On the production side, the movie is a gem: dark, stark and un-disneyish. Also the actors have improved and the new characters are quite impressively played by the likes of David Thewlis, Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. Also, theunderlying moods of the movie have ""grown up"" since its predecessors. I haveenjoyed how the director plays with themes such as time (a strong element inthe whole HP series, related to Harry growing up, his past and his future) and Harry's perception of himself. BUT these great features are undermined by the huge cuts that the booksuffered when transposed to screenplay, mostly at the expense of characterdevelopment and tension build-up...Watching the movie you realise the climaxof the story has arrived and you have kind of missed how you got there!!! Also, the cuts mean that the audience never gets to hear why Snape hates Lupin andBlack so much, who the hell Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are, howdoes Lupin know that the Marauder map is indeed a map, why Harry is soobsessed by his fate and by dark omens, why cats, rats and dogs don't like each other, why Professor Trelawney prediction is so important, etc etc etc...I'll stop here! There's quite a lot left out, clearly, and sometimes I wondered if people who haven't read the book could actually understand what was going on. With the movie being so good in other respects, it's frustrating to see the story butchered and the characters thinned so much...The scene with Snape (AlanRickman is excellent...wish there was more of him), Lupin and Sirius in theShrieking Shack is so bloody brilliant that you wish it didn't last only 30 seconds, but that it were faithful to the book! You only get to see a spark of the hatred, recriminations and deceit that run among them...But then again, you only about this if you've read the book... So, in conclusion, go and see the movie for some good moments and for finally seeing some of your fantasies of POA represented on screen (Hogsmeade,Buckbeak, the Marauders Map)...But for story, pathos and greatcharacters...Stick to the book!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
523,ratpac03,Absolutely fantastic. But not 100% faithful to the book.,7,7 June 2004,"When I saw previews calling PoA one of the ""best films of all time"", I was worried. Since then, I've seen the movie twice, and could easily go a third.There are those who will watch the movie and realize a lot was left out, and complain that the chronology was changed. And yes, it was, but the movie was beautifully streamlined and devoid of the plot-cramming that plagued Chamber of Secrets. This time around, the plot was coherent, although did move along at a good clip.I'm continually impressed by the casting, I hope for big things from the main three. Even the new man for Dumbledore did a fantastic job. I can't complain in the least. Again, those overly faithful to the book will complain about this and that, but realize their complaints are not that the movie was bad, just not the same. On film, things need to change, and no crucial story elements were lost.The mood change between the second and third films is stark. Whereas the first two had a very jocular feel to them throughout, PoA maintains a steady grasp on the darker side. And although it's a minor point, the small things such as scene transitions and the movements from location to location are beautiful (the scene in Lupin's class with the mirrored closet particularly). Even the smallest details were tended to.Again, it doesn't follow the book exactly, which helps more than anything. Go see the movie, it's amazing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
524,kelc_mishthegreat_02,Third Time Lucky,10,16 June 2007,"We all know the saying: third time lucky! Well this film is living proof of that.Prisoner of Azkaban comes the closest to depicting the story of the book so far. Azkaban seems to really go that level further than COS or PS in so many ways (special effects, mood, narrative style, performance from the actors and storyline in general) and it seems in this case the book was definitely suited to the director (Alfonso Cuaron).This film has such a richness to it, and it's easy to see that this book is easily the most cinematic from the series. POA flows so much more smoothly than PS and COS, which seem to have more of a repetitive structure to them. POA has a freer structure and style, which is really symbolic of the characters, whom are now teenagers.Which brings me to the actors. Well, they all seem to be maturing not only physically but in their performances too. Danile Radcliffe is transforming into quite the spunk; his transition from a child to a young adult is truly amazing to watch. He brings a more nuanced performance to this film, exploring more emotional territories.Rupert Grint gives his best performance to date, playing an awkward and comical Ronald Weasley. He has good on screen chemistry with Watson and we see the first pangs of romance between Ron and Hermione kick in. It doesn't help that Grint is becoming more handsome...Full marks also to Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Watson has proved herself more than capable once again to display the real human emotion in these films. She is maturing into quite a beauty and has excellent screen presence. I especially liked her performance in the Time-Turner sequence. She led and dominated the scenes with such procession and style while still being true to the clever Hermoine. She brings insecurity to the character, while delivering a rather gutsy performance. As always, the adult cast of Harry Potter deserve a huge mention. Gary Oldman was a perfect choice as Sirius Black, David Thewlis as Professor Lupin gave a sensitive performance as a father figure to Harry. The rest of the cast (Sir Micheal Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Emma Thompson)all step up to the mark as the films are heading in a more mature direction.The thing I really loved about this film and that I feel separates it from it's predecessors was the Gothic style visuals that Cuaron brought to the film. The dramatic and beautiful landscape of Scotland, with it's mountains and valleys, really symbolize the emotions you feel when you are 13 years old. This stunning cinematography makes the characters, events and all of the quirks and emotions felt by all in the Potter world leap off of the screen. These dark and eerie sights are matched with humour and the occasional romantic emphasis between the trio. Cuaron has a true sense of humour and infuses a slight sexual tension between the main characters into the story.While the three are obviously maturing, Hermione as the only girl, is usually caught in the middle of all of this sexual tension. (And when I say sexual tension I mean it's very subtle and you can read into it any way you want, but it is in no way inappropriate). Cleverly with Watson though, Cuaron makes the wise play of acknowledging her development without drawing perverse attention to it.There's the obvious signs like an awkward glance here and there, a consoling hug that lasts a little too long, the awkward flouncing around of Watson and her co-stars in the action parts of the film, in which they are usually bent awkwardly and breathing heavily as they try to escape/set things right, the odd hand grabbing and odd touch or unaware brush, just small things like that.Cuaron uses tight framing in these shots to suggest intimacy (the scene where the trio hug when Buckbeak is slaughtered, the quick close up of Harry reaching his arm around Hermione's behind to take her wand out of her pocket, the awkward moment when Hermione grabs Ron's hand when Harry is trying to tame Buckbeak, when Harry is conveniently behind Hermione when they are riding Buckbeak to save Sirius, etc).As I said before, Cuaron tries not to draw perverse attention to it, by deliberately (I would say accentuating) the awkward moments so as to not draw bad attention to the young stars's obvious maturity.On a different note, the special effects are really something in this film. There's the beautiful Buckbeak, the frightening and splendidly eerie Dementors, the hilarious Knight Bus sequence, all of the special effects have really improved. Everything looks so realistic yet still retains an old-school magical look and feeling.Another thing I have to mention is the Hogwarts castle and the musical score. All of the things in the castle, the props (especially the divination room) has such a beautiful but old-style look to it; it's really a visual feast for your eyes. The musical score infuses a little 40's big-band pizazz (think the Knight Bus scene and the Boggart scene) and the general score is very grandiose old-school but with a modern sound. It somehow seems to retain earthiness at the same time. One special piece of music that deserves recognition is the Irish style music (think medieval pan flutes and strings) that plays over some of the really touching and heartbreaking moments in Azkaban.Azkaban is essentially a coming of age story, that really has such a mature look and feel to it that it will attract a larger Potter audience. It really is just one big exhilarating adventure with highs and lows and I truly believe that no other director but Cuaron could have mastered this.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
525,gandalfwiz10,Something Wicked This Way Comes...,10,10 July 2007,"The Prisoner of Azkaban draws quite a different line than the Chamber of Secrets or the Philosopher's Stone. Most of it is summed up in the tag-line 'something wicked this way comes.' The first two installments were pretty light, but relatively long, viewing, introducing you to the world of Harry Potter and its delightful characters and their antagonists. But as Harry grows older, the world grows darker. When Harry's third year at Hogwarts dawns, the news is all aplomb with news of the recently escaped Sirius Black, a supporter of Lord Voldemort and murderer of many people, and for some reason is coming after Harry. Hogwarts, because of this danger, is being protected by evil shrouded Dementors, who guard the wizard prison Azkaban. They affect Harry especially, but he is helped along by his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), along with his new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, the shabby looking but very nice Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) As the story progresses, Harry learns just why Sirius is coming for him, and in a magnificent intricate climax, he learns the truth.Absolutely stunning, the dark tone is immediately set. Begone be the kiddie wizard robes and hats, and gone are the child-like themes. These are growing young people, in a world growing rapidly more wicked. Bravo to Alfonso Cuaron. Probably the best Harry Potter yet. The acting is as well done as I can expect it to be by the main three characters, but the supporting characters hold up the movie, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Chambon. Brilliant. The plot is extremely well done, is not stretched. Does not seem like too little or too much. The best Harry Potter yet. 10/10 ""Something Wicked this Way Comes...""",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
526,Chandler81,"Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous - Spoilers",9,8 December 2004,"If you're anti-Potter you owe it to yourself to see this film. Get past the issues you might have with the immense hype around the franchise and sit down for two hours to be captivated by this creepy, quirky and beautiful film. If you're a Potter-fan and you're unhappy with the film, the novel is probably on the table in front of you and you're better off reading it again. This is a wonderful film despite your expectations or opinions as to how it 'should have been done'.This review contains spoilers pertaining to the novel version of The Prisoner of Azkaban; if you haven't read the book, you have been warned.What makes this film work far more than the previous films are three key aspects - the acting, the screenplay, and the production design/cinematography - and all of them I credit directly to Cuaron's new vision. Suppsedly it was Cuaron's work on A Little Princess that won him the gig to direct this film, but I would honestly say that Y Tu Mama Tambien is equally if not more to credit. While he doesn't get the caliber of Tambien's performances in the young Potter stars, Cuaron does far better than his predecessor Chris Columbus. Most importantly, this film features a far more relaxed performance from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. His confidence, surely thanks to Cuaron's demonstrated ability to direct young actors, lets him speak and react in a far more genuine manner than we saw in the previous films and helps the film enormously. Hopefully Dan continues to improve with each film.With the more assured Radcliffe able to hold a scene together, Rupert Grint matches him admirably. Having been relieved of the Culkin Syndrome he was afflicted with in the first two films (the fault of Columbus, no doubt), he brings a more entertaining and believable Ron to the screen; both a joker and a noble soul as he is portrayed in the novels. It's wonderful to see that Grint has a genuine sense of comedy about him, and has made Ron more than the one-dimensional, face-pulling joke Columbus would have him. Emma Watson holds her own with the boys, giving a fantastic performance, and importantly bringing a lot of needed emotion to the central characters. Hermione now feels like the glue in the trio rather than the outsider.The new Dumbledore is a little uncomfortable, simply for the fact that he has a very small role in the film, and we don't have enough time to entirely digest this new portrayal. Richard Harris brought a wise kind of grace to the character, but perhaps in his physical state the character did come across as a little too frail. There is nothing wrong with Michael Gambon in this role, and I believe with his increased parts in the next film he will prove to be a satisfying replacement. I was wary of casting for Remus Lupin, one of my favourite characters of the novels, but David Thewlis makes this role his own with a delightful portrayal. Likewise, Oldman is perfectly cast as Black.There are edits and reshuffles with regard to the Azkaban's story compared to the book, both in terms of how the story fits together, and what information from the overall seven novel arc is in the film. I don't see how these changes matter much, the identity of the Marauders will undoubtedly be revealed, and potentially in a fashion that has a greater impact than it did in the novels. The reshuffling improves the pace in a huge way compared to the Columbus films which were quite plodding in parts because of their tenacious grip on remaining accurate to the novels. The dialogue is similar to the previous films. The ""sudden"" ending is satisfying enough; there really isn't any need for the over-done end of year banquet scenes, and seeing Harry happy at the end of the film is all I think we need.Some have complained that the continuity between the first two films and the third one has been spoiled by changes in the production design. I really can't see the problem here, the look of Hogwarts is far more immersive and emotive in Azkaban than it was in either The Philosopher's Stone or The Chamber of Secrets. Cuaron brings a twisted visual style to the screen and draws on his Mexican heritage to add further layers of interest to the look of the film. He could be called overly indulgent, but rather than being distracting, these additions simply bring more life to the screen, making Azkaban a gorgeously vibrant film. The production design is simply oozing with the filmmaker's obvious delight in creating the creepy magical atmosphere that this darker story requires. If after all that you still can't accept the changes to the production design, think simply of this; ""The stairs like to change"". If the stairs at Hogwarts like to change, why not the rest of it? It is a magical place, after all.The cinematography though, is what makes the film so beautiful. There's barely a shot in the film which isn't utterly gorgeous. The scenes of the Dementors floating outside Hogwarts are inspired, the moonlight scene after the return from the Shrieking Shack, the flight scenes with Buckbeak, the first Dementor scene on the train; all are captured beautifully and put Columbus with his squeaky clean vanilla take on everything in first two films to shame.This film was one of the highlights out of Hollywood in the last year. It's, dare I say it, compelling and well acted in a beautifully realized and shot fantasy world. You owe it to yourself to see it once; and if you're a fan holding a grudge, maybe you should give it another try.And pray to your Gods that George Lucas never gets his hands on the reigns to a Potter film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Then again, you can't expect the movie to be just like the book. Yes some parts are missing but if you want to literally translate the book into a movie it would take 6 hours. I think a lot of fans don't understand you have to make changes to the book to make a good movie.The fact that the setting is different than the previous two movies is a little disorienting, but I think it looks better. The special effects rule and the scenery is beautiful. Our little kids are growing up and you can see they're becoming better actors.In my opinion this one is the best out of three!

531,elandyll,Better than the first two...,8,14 June 2004,"In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was in fact better than the first two movies. The Sorcerer Stone was not bad at all as it was putting the set for the characters. Lots of CGs, kind of a 'kid' movie with lots of ""oooh"" scenes like the Quidditch match or the Troll rampage.The second movie was a big disappointment, at least for me. Almost all the same recipes from the first were used again (and I do know it's sort of a ""ritual"" in the Potter books, at least the first four, to start at Harry's Uncle house, then trip to Hogwarth, then something ominous happens, Harry and Ron goof around while Hermione reads, they confront the evil, they win) but bringing nothing new really. The tone was a bit darker -leading some kids to be scared, sorry guys, it seems the franchise will address its protagonist's age, which means it could get darker and darker- but nothing was done to go beyond the first movie as for the character's psychological development.This new Harry Potter redeems the serie in my eyes, as obviously the director has chosen to not only respect the key elements of the books (Quidditch game, Hogwarth studies, opening scene at Harry's uncle, etc.) but added a lot of wonderful scenes that were lacking in the first two episodes (Fantasy'ish landscape surrounding Hogwarth, The Hyppogriph flight scene, the bus scene, the inn, the village under the snow etc.)This is where I realized that the first two movies were so centered around Hogwarth and diagon alley, that you could have believed all the existing wizards lived in those two places. This movie definitely expands the scope of the serie, and brings the best epic finale scene yet, while having a much darker tone as well. Kudos to Daniel Radcliff also for bringing a darker side to Teen Harry Potter at the beginning of the movie. No more Oliver Twist clone ;)I give this opus a 8/10. Good film, not just a good Harry Potter :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
532,Kempywood,Harry 3 the rough version,7,31 March 2005,"Anybody who has read the books will be able to tell you just how good the Prisoner of Azkaban was, and how good the movie really should have been. POA is by far my favorite of the five books that have been so far released and to say I was excited to watch this movie doesn't even come close. This was the first of the Potter movies that I went to see on the big screen and although I did enjoy the amount of information and aspects that made the book so good were sadly missing from this adaptation. Add the fact that due to a new director the grounds were completely changed and you find more reasons for me being upset at Alfonso Cuaron. Richard Harris being replaced didn't help either but that couldn't be changed unfortunately. Harris was the best person for the job and although Gambon did an almighty job in the role there really was no way to replace the man who many people will now see as the face of Albus Dumbeldore.But anyway enough with the critical side of things, I'm not paid to do that. (I'm obviously not paid enough to do my actually job either since I'm doing this whilst in the office! Oops) Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwarts but all is not well. His Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), although not his actual aunt he still had to call her that under strict orders from Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), is coming to stay and she's brought her dog with her too. All sorts of antics occur and eventually her bad mouthing of Harry's parents (James and Lily) leads to her blowing up, not in an explosive way but a floating away sort of way. Which forces Harry to leave his summer home and take to the road, enter the Knight Bus which takes him to the leaky cauldron in London and all sorts of hectic adventures can start right there. The introduction of several new characters occurs in this latest episode of the boy wizard including Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and the maniacal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and there former friend Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) these three actors I believe did there parts tremendously and although the relinquishing of the directors title of Chris Columbus I did enjoy this movie, here's hoping that Goblet of Fire is better. I guess that depends on Mike Newell however.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
533,MissDev,Fabulous Filming Amidst the Fatal Flubs,7,14 August 2004,"I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter. I probably have the books memorized. And ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favorite of the books. So I was well psyched for the movie. And it didn't disappoint. For the most part. The actual cinematography was so much cleaner and better than the first two films. The visual effects were also much tighter and more believable. Sirius as Snuffles was so well done, with a nice tip of the hat to ""The Nothing"" from ""The Neverending Story."" Lupin as a werewolf was pretty cool, not because it was necessarily well done, but because he was clearly a werewolf and not a regular wolf or dog. The new look of the Hogwarts castle and grounds was really more with the mood of the books, if not consistent with the other movies. My main complaints are that the director (Alfonso Cuaron) had never even read the books before being approached about directing ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", so he didn't have any investment in the series or any passion for it. Also, he took a lot of the fun and humor out of the story and kept in things that were unnecessary or lingered too long on certain subjects. The scene where Malfoy, Crab, and Goyle dress as a dementor to scare Harry is one of the most hilarious parts of the book, and I was incredibly disappointed about its disclusion. Finally, why why, oh why, did they change Lupin's relationship from being best friends with Harry's dad to Harry's mom. Lupin's friendship with James Potter, and thus with Sirius and Wormtail is MASSIVELY important to ""The Order of the Pheonix"" and it is just stupid and confusing that the relationship was changed. Although I like Cuaron as a director, these films would benefit more from someone intimately acquainted with these books and the story, and someone who would keep in the important bits, trim out the unnecessary stuff, all the while keeping the humor and essential story details intact.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
534,spencerallred,a film that has very good solid filmaking,9,26 November 2014,the third installment of harry potter franchise as the kids grow older into their teenage hood i would have to say that this film has some good solid filmaking to the point where it is so solid that when i watch it it makes me tear in proudness of the good work that is put into this film Alfonso Caron the director is one of the directors to choose from if u want a good movie. And again the leading actors are once again solid acting as teenagers who play it well. the special and visual effects are not great but its passable for this type of solid filmaking. in my opinion and reaction of the film is that its a film with great solidness and great acting that this movie should be looked at as examples from other directors i would give this movie a low B+ to a high A-,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
535,newton7,A darker Potter,8,10 July 2004,"The third Harry Potter adaptation is rather darker and more brooding than the previous ones, although the plot is less convoluted. A number of episodes from the book have been deleted, enabling the director to concentrate upon the basic narrative. The young stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have certainly found their feet, each giving a polished performance far in advance of their previous efforts. The real coup of this film is, however, the supporting cast, if one can describe the superb actors Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman in such inadequate terms. Their portrayals are, to a man, completely convincing. Of the new members of Hogwarts staff, only Michael Gambon doesn't perhaps quite hit the mark, lacking the mystic air of his predecessor. Emma Thompson is spot-on with other celebrity character-actor cameos effectively inserted. The only drawback is that the unrelenting bad weather at Hogwarts will do little for our tourist trade!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

This was a really popular one. Luckily I arrived early, and had to wait only about an hour.If you want a good movie to see, I encourage you to rent this movie. Most of you will probably buy it after.

In fact I had some friends who refused to watch anymore Harry films after seeing this one. I had to convince them that the others were better. The arrogance of Sir Michael Gambon knows no bounds. I just read in the trivia that he never read any of the books to get an idea of who Dumbledore is because he just always puts himself into the role. Yes that's right, I really go to the movies just to see home movies of Michael Gambon, not the Harry Potter movies with the wonderful, in control, Albus Dumbledore. The Dumbledore who would never have manhandled Harry in the next movie. My mistake for thinking that I was there to see characters written by J. K. Rowling instead of a piece on Michael Gambon's own ""perfection."" No wonder he always seemed like a weak ghost of the character he was supposed to play.I did not like Alfonso Cuarun's addition of shrunken heads that are in fact a part of Voodoo, as I understand it. It did not fit in with Harry Potter. They spent so much time on those ridiculous heads and no time explaining how the Marauders Map came to be. Apparently we have to give up wonderful parts of the book in order to put up with stuff that was never part of the story.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
538,hall10000,The prisoner,10,5 June 2004,"THE prisoner OF AZKABAN by Alfonso Cuaron.A little punk going to magic school with his friends, been there, done that, not interested thank you very much. Hogwart can feel a little bit claustrophobic when you have a fantasy background and the limitations to the story are obvious, the first two movies have the traces of the same draw and the main plots have been seen a billion times so I promised myself I will never touch a Harry Potter book in my life, now after seeing the third in the series I'm struggling to compose myself not to. This has become overnight high quality fantasy because of the story and the magical artifacts we are presented, we still have to endure the cheap sense of humor and certain sequences that only slow things down, like the compulsory opening with uncle Monty that is a perfect example of both. But there is some progress like the Riditch scene (the stupid game yes), the have followed the master rule get in late leave early and put it in the context of the story with the Dementors as the quarter backs, plus comes with a surprise... brilliant. The main plot is now the big attraction, this is superb storytelling, this movie can challenge the alltime fantasy favourite THE PRINCESS BRIDE any day and Willliam Goldman knows one or two things about his craft, the things get darker up three gears bordering the genius of Poe and we are introduced to new lectures essential to walk the streets safely in today's world, the dark arts and the monster class. Interesting characters lager than life, developed backstories, twist and turns and the biggest payoff in cinema history that does more for time travel than the whole TERMINATOR trilogy combined. Cuaron is in the driving seat, strange choice, anyway in this kind of productions I wonder if if matters at all, the final product is so precisely calculated that he probably only said two words, ""action"" and ""cut"", we will only be able to judge his work when THE GOBLET OF FIRE is released next year. Mike Newell will be the only one to put things in perspective and he's another strange choice and what's worse he's an outsider, let's see how he deals with what everyone reckons is the best book published to date.I like the Shakespearian casting of the movie, British actors make terrific villains and they master confusion. Harry Potter universe is like the Hong Kong portrait in INFERNAL AFFAIRS where nobody is really who it seems to be and the line between GOOD and EVIL is obscure when you approach the edges, the best sample of this is Allan Rickman's character Snape, yo never quite know where he's coming from and he plays the part to perfection, when he's not in the scene you miss him. THe other big player is Sirius Black AKA the prisoner of Azkaban, as Claude Rains is ""unavailable"" the natural choice is the chameleon of the silver screen, Mr Gary Oldman. Altough he claims that he did the movie for the money for and he's not really interested in the project he mesmerize the audience and outplays everyone else in the movie with his performance, always a good run for your money he's the best actor you can hire these days, some might say a small mistake was not bringing him earlier in the story but that kind of build to the monet he's presented and make it even more intense. He was not welcomed by the aficionados in the internet forums but then their major concern is the detail that Coltrane's hut has been located down hill from the castle, poor devils, and finally I challenge everyone to spot the cameo of the former lider of the Stone Roses. One thing that worries me is the appetite of people to make things darker, dark is better, there is definitely a darker approach to the material visually and story wise which is probably the reason that makes the movie more appealing for adults although I'm not so sure how are all the six year olds that fill the theaters around the globe going to chew this heavy load. This demand for the dark stuff left me completely puzzle when the darkest film in years, DONNIE DARKO fails to generate any interest and went unnoticed on release, the fill noir for the playstation generation, now re-released after Gary Jules hit the Christmas number one with ""Mad World"" beating The Darkness, bizarre. Not VAN HELSING neither TROY, THE prisoner OF AZKABAN is not only the best blockbuster of the year so far but is also the best movie, SPIDERMAN comes crawling HARRY... altogether SPECTOR PATRONAS.****",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

540,gswanson17,Harry's Even More Magical World,8,19 April 2007,"Alfonso Cuarón is probably one of the most eclectic directors in all of Hollywood. I first became interested in him after viewing the film Y Tu Mamá También, and began to devour his other works including Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Every film of his is a gem, and completely different from the previous, but the one film that really stood out in my mind as a showcase of his work was, incredibly enough, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I am by no means a very big Harry Potter fan. Yes, I've read the books, and yes I've seen the movies, but they were never really a very big deal for me, like they were for some of my peers. What drew my attention to the film was the attachment of Alfonso Cuarón to the job of directing.After two financially successful Harry Potter films, Chris Columbus called it quits, and in 2003, the job was up for grabs. Columbus, after a string a very successful family films including Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, had developed a very predictable way of directing, which, for me, made the first two Harry Potter films incredibly dull. When I became aware that Cuarón was taking the job, I grew very excited for the release of the film. In his other works, Cuarón had found a way of completely opening up the film to let the audience be entirely immersed in a world they are not part of. He gives the audience room to imagine what is beyond the scope of the camera and the walls of Hogwarts. I love everything about this technique because it gives such a sense of possibility and limitlessness.While many cynics, especially kids who have read the book, as it's likely the only book they've read which has been made into a movie, object to the removal of subplots in the film, they are missing the overall aesthetic and feel of the film. The third movie feels more like a Harry Potter book. While only focusing on the linear events of Harry Potter, Columbus missed out on the broad world of Harry Potter, which is exactly what Cuarón provided. Cuarón spent a great deal of time showcasing the lusciousness of the castle, the beauty of the grounds, and the overall quirkiness of everyday objects in this world. He paid extra special attention to the colors that were placed in the film, green for jealousy, and red for warning. Cuarón managed to set up incredibly complicated camera shots that weave in and out of rooms, over turrets, and across lakes. These small touches are what emphasize the magic of Harry's world, and not the actual events that happen in the narrative. Everybody knows they can do magic and everybody knows the invisibility cloak works. It's how the director engages the audience by the use of camera movement that the audience feels that they too, can be a part of this.Cuarón also binds magical elements to the elements of the real world. Like in A Little Princess, the audience is not quite sure how all of those food and luxury items appeared in Sara's room, but they like it just the same. In Great Expectations it's quite unrealistic to believe that Fin gets this remarkable chance to display his art and become famous, but it is bound with very realistic elements such as poverty, and heart brokenness, that makes the audience come to believe that this could really happen. Cuarón uses the same techniques in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Throughout most of the film, the main characters are never seen with their robes on, yet appear performing magic all the time. Having these two elements juxtaposed together engages the audience even more, because these are kids who wear the same clothes, talk about the same things, and have the same problems that everyone does. The audience can relate to the characters, and feel like they area part of the story, rather than idly watching. Cuarón emulates what J.K. Rowling's books were trying to invoke in readersa sense of belonging.A well directed film will not necessarily leave the viewer continuing to think about the plot of the film, or even its social implications, but a well directed film will make you think in terms of the world it was set in. After The Prisoner of Azkaban, the audience wants to know what else is going in this world. They want to know what lies deep in the forbidden forest; they want to know the ins and outs of the castle; and because of the omnipotence of the camera, the audience believes that they are entitled and have the ability to know more. This was not a film told in a linear way, but in an incredibly 3-dimensional world, where anything is possible, and it is they way that Cuarón illustrates this with his techniques that makes this film amazing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

542,shadownlite,Disjointed and Lame,2,7 June 2004,"I admit to not being a Harry Potter fan but I have seen the other two movies, and found them enjoyable so went to see the new film today.My main problem with the movie is it is so disjointed. It doesn't have a good, steady flow to storyline and jumps around way too much. You never get to see anything in the film play out from beginning to end....you suddenly join the action in progress or jump out of the action right in the middle and are suddenly at the end. I found that extremely annoying and it really hurt the film. Shoe me the whole Quiddich match...don't just join it in progress and stop it when Harry falls without showing how everyone reacted to Harry's fall. Things like this just ruined the flow and made it seem like there were huge plot holes in the film.They also didn't explain things fully in the film. They left out key parts of the book...like why the map was so important...and then would give you a rushed explanation later through character dialogue. If they had explained the map earlier, as well as the adult characters relationships to one another through their history, all the adult characters wouldn't have had to spout, in rapid fire delivery, loads of dialogue to explain their relationships with one another in the Shreiking Shack. Which left many adults in the movie theatre actually saying out loud, ""What the hell?"" and looking confused. If I hadn't read the book I would have been very confused as well which is a problem, you shouldn't have to read the book to enjoy the film. You should be able to at least get an idea of what is going on so you can enjoy it without prior knowledge of the story. Malfoy got very little screen time this time around and I seem to remember him having a lot more to do with the story in the book. The way that this movie made the relationship to Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione and Malfoy look pathetic. It truly made it look like the three were bullying Malfoy and not the other way around. This is not a good thing and I really feel it did his character a dis-service. He doesn't seem as menacing now and you actually start to feel a bit sorry for him because he appears so picked on.I did like the way it showed the surroundings of Hogwarts. The hillsides, lakes, and forests were stunning though, I kept expecting to hear the ""The King from the Golden Hall"", complete with Norwegian fiddle, from the LOTR soundtrack to start playing as the camera swept over the hillsides and forests or orcs to attack them in the forest. I think the director did steal a bit of the countryside idea from LOTR. It was nice to finally see the surroundings of the school because it explained what was so special about it.I also liked the transitions that showed the passing of time. It was done in a really nice way...the owl flying into snowflakes which turn to snow covering the ground....the tree losing one leaf and then suddenly dropping them all. That was well done.The kids playing Potter, Hermione, and Ron are starting to really relax in their roles and grow a little as actors. Especially Daniel Radcliff. I think that they should try to keep the kids in the roles they have as long as they can because it would be a bit jarring to have to recast them. I know that they are quickly growing up so this may be impossible.The Dementors were cool and would appear very scary to small children. The effect of ""sucking the soul"" out of people that they do would also scare small children a lot so it really surprised me that many adults brought their small children to this film. The Dementors and the werewolf would definitely not be good for small children to watch and may give them nightmares. It will be interesting to see where this series goes and how the, even longer, next book will be brought to film. Hopefully, it will not be as disjointed as this one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
543,film_am_03,The best Harry Potter movie to date!,8,20 February 2007,"*** The review assumes familiarity with the Harry Potter canon *** This isn't the perfect movie by any means. I'll grant that. For one, I'd definitely have liked more about Marauders and a much better clarification of how they were all related to Harry, especially Lupin. (This would've explained so much, like how Lupin could read the map while Snape couldn't and the significance of the stag patronus.) This is also the movie that deviates significantly (for the first time; the earlier two were rather slavish adaptations) from the book. But the differences are what I cherished the most. The whole time turner sequence is quite brilliant IMHO, cheesy but brilliant. There's absolutely no way Rowling could have written in all the visual flourishes and Kloves and Cuaron take full advantage of the possibilities presented with the whole time turner sequence. Sure it's sort of deus ex machina but that's the way it was written in the book and they couldn't possibly alter it entirely. For one, Harry, Ron and Hermoine aren't nearly quite magically or emotionally ready to do the whole thing right in the first go. So, while the deus ex machina weakens the whole plot a bit, this is about the best movie one can come up with, within the plot. Another small distraction is the very first scene when Harry obviously performs magic during summer, which he's not allowed to do. (And it gets stated explicitly multiple times in the movie!) That was a fairly major goof.Now about the rest of the movie. It's the most visually sumptuous HP movie I've seen so far, even narrowly better than Goblet of Fire. The only sequence I can think of where special effects were below par was the knight bus sequence. I also like this movie's score more than the rest so far. Some of the sets could be better but overall they're great. Cinematography is easily the best I've seen in HP movies so far. Darkening of the visual palette was done brilliantly and set the stage for the rest of the movies.Performances wise, the three leads are still finding their way. They each had good moments and clunkers - Harry when he cries at Hogsmeade, Hermoine when she greets Harry at Leaky Cauldron, and Ron when he freaks out in many scenes, for instance. Gambon was good as Dumbledore but there are portents of the disaster that came in Goblet of Fire. (IMHO, Gambon's performance was the single most disappointing feature of GoF. He just shrieks and shrieks some more. Whereas Richard Harris was delightfully understated, bringing out Dumbledore's experience, maturity, wisdom and humor, I don't even know who the guy Gambon plays is in GoF! Read the book and watch the movie - what a contrast!) Gambon was already showing a few signs of 'panic' in this movie. Then there are the three best perfs of the movie and how brilliant they are - Thewlis as Lupin, Oldman as Black and Rickman as Snape! They outdo each other and act circles around the rest of the cast each time. Alan Rickman, in particular, deserved some sort of nomination for his perf. Watch the scene when he finally asks Harry to turn to page 394 in the book. Years after watching the movie, I still remember the way his nose twitches then. I doubt he will ever play a role better than Snape's. William Hurt was given a supporting actor Oscar nomination in ""A History of Violence"" for a travesty (over-over-over-over-the-toooop) much shorter than the brilliance of Rickman in this movie. While I don't claim Alan Rickman was robbed of a nomination, I definitely would not have complained one bit if he'd gotten one.Alfonso Cuaron has made absolutely fascinating movies, and in particular, movies with tremendous repeat value. He's someone to watch out for. I wish he'd come back and direct another HP movie.All in all, a good and worthy addition to the HP sequence. 8.5 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
544,scarlet478,Interesting...,9,4 June 2004,"Seems like there are already two camps forming around this movie; the people who like the changes, and the ones who end up missing Columbus. I, for one, do not approve of all of the things Alfonso Cuaron has done but I still think it's a good movie.Well, good if you are familiar with the book. Some of the nuances in the script are likely to be lost to people who haven't read it. There are a number of things left out, so I ended up using what I knew to fill in the holes. Also, some transitions were really awkward. The one that got me the most was a sudden switching to the Hagrid/Buckbeak storyline in the lake. I was a little disoriented.Visually, this movie tops the other two. The redesigned sets are wonderful, just like what I imagine when I read the books. The placement of Gryffindor tower is bothersome, along with the placement of the house tables. However, the castle as a whole is great. While I felt the castle from the first two had a but of a...plastic...vibe to it, this one didn't. You can really get a sense of the kids growing up-different hairstyles, for one thing. It underscores the time theme running through the movie. I've always had problems with the casting choices in the Harry Potter movies, and this one is no different. Perhaps they'll eventually come to grow on me, perhaps they won't and I'll just grudgingly accept them.  I can't decide whether I like Micheal Gambon as the new Dumbledore, but I'm glad he put his own spin on the character. Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny, however, was brilliant. Quite dead-on.Dan, Emma and Rupert get more and more comfortable being the trio with every movie, I think. Their acting is loads better, and it's easy to see the compatibility of the three. They way they interact is very cute and natural. They share lots of really good friendship-type moments, but they are noticeably split into Harry and Hermione or Ron and Hermione...it makes a love triangle easy to realize with the later movies. The ending left something to be desired. It was so...unresolved. The final scene was cheesy beyond words, as if they suddenly ran out of ideas and just put something together to meet the deadline.Favorite line: ""My way, I'm Head Boy!"" Haha...such a Percy moment.
Biggest peeve: The patronus, also Harry practicing magic in his room, only to have it made quite clear ten minutes later that it's not allowed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
545,pinkflamingo1102,"Outstanding....If you thought the first 2 were good then you Have to see this one, it is incredibly good. I loved it!!!",9,2 November 2004,"This movie was outstanding! I absolutely loved it. I recommend it to anyone who is in for an exciting hilarious film, but also has enough time to spare, because it is nearly 3 hours, but it well worth the time. I will have to say that the book is better, because the movie left out many things (such as who actually made the mauanders map and other things), but the director did ant excellent job without making it like 10 hours long.In this movie everyone is getting better and better looking I was like OMG all the guys are hot! (the twins are hot, Harry is so hot, Ron got hot, Draco is super sexy etc.) Harry's voice has deepened and he has gotten taller and i have to admit I've formed a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton, along with many of the other characters. To all you guys out there Hermione (Emma Watson) has gotten very pretty.I thought that this movie was an improvement from the other 2 films (which is saying a whole lot because the other 2 films very excellent also.) I like this one in particular because the acting skills have increased a lot (by all the actors), and this was my favorite book out of the whole series, but i also really like the 4th book, so I really recommend this book to anyone who liked the first 2 films. I give it 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
546,wangdichaoyang,Childhood Revisited,10,4 January 2015,"I can't believe how good this film is. I have always thought Goblet of Fire was the best of the series. But today that title has officially gone to Prisoner of Azkaban.A kid as I was almost a decade ago could never understand how this film is well-plotted and masterly directed. It is a long movie and requires a long attention span, a good long term memory, and a profound knowledge of the world of Hogwarts to understand the brilliance of this movie. To look at it, it's about being better than the you a few hours ago. Nothing could be more inspirational than that. It's about seeing truth and making friend. Rowling's writing has always been about magic and love, but this particular episode is the last of the three thin books, and it reserved all the magical and mysterious sparks that defined ""Harry Potter"". There are a huge amount of lovely details in this movie, the tree playing with four seasons, the fact that walking through a ghost makes you chilly and uncomfortable... This movie reminds me of the pure pleasure of reading Ms. Rowling's books when I was in elementary school.Surprising, after 10 years, this time I recognized the director of the movie in end credit. Last year when I saw Mr. Cuarón receiving Oscar on live TV I didn't realize he was the one who realized my childhood dream. The Patronus Charm and Dementor visual is extremely well done that it exceeds almost all other attempts at dreamy scenes. Professor Lupin's office setting, the look of the map, the music accompanying Lupin's teaching... The magic is in every dot of detail and Cuarón's magic reacted in every right way to Ms. Rowling's. I love Harry Potter. But I just realized I would never loved it so much if it were not for this movie. It's magic to experience.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
547,jscrump-1,O .k .,5,16 March 2005,"The only thing I hated about this movie was how fast it went. I can understand them rushing the film till we get inside the Shrieking Shack. However, when Lupin and Black are explaining everything they needed to slow down. It was like bang, bang, bang Sirius is innocent. How did that happened ? Now I loved everything else. Yes , I'm looking forward to the next one. I wonder if Ron and Hermione are going to get together. I'm also wondering if something is going to happened between Harry and Jenny. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I wonder what Percy would do if Harry and Jenny got engaged. I love to see his face.

This HP movie has a vivid sense of humour playing against the rapid plot, and a screenplay that does a brilliant job of pulling together all the critical elements of Rowling's story. It's a daunting task to recreate something that has played through so many people's imaginations, but Prisoner has done a fantastic job.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

550,jtrpop,New Director Invigorates the Potter Series.,9,6 June 2004,"(No spoilers review)First off, I have read all of the books and seen all of the movies. I followed development of this movie closely, as there was a new director, and this being one of my favorite Potter books. I was both excited and worried with the new director, his new vision, and some of the Internet news and first pictures to be released had me scared.I had nothing to worry about.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an amazing book, and has been turned into an excellent movie! The new director is exactly what the series needed. Christopher Columbus (director of the first two movies) did an amazing job bringing Potter to the screen with the first two movies, and is to be praised for his work. Yet the second movie was lacking. It didn't have the same energy, and if it continued down this path, the movies could become very stale. Christopher knew this as he admitted he was exhausted, and I don't blame him. So Alfonso Cuarón was hired as the new director, but Chris still stood on as producer.With Harry and his friends now teenagers, they are experiencing new emotions and feelings, and Alfonzo captures them in just the right amount. In the first major scene, you truly saw Harry angry, you knew he would not back down, as well as the motives behind it, and it was done oh so well. The movie was freed by using more hand-held steadicam shots, and one nice long tracking shot I wished was even longer. Film is a visual medium, and this movie does not disappoint visually. The way the camera moved in and out of objects, up and down, and the use of more perspective angles brought so much more life and feeling to the movie, and it was never overused. Special effects are used all throughout the movie to further the story and draw you into the world even more. Buckbeak the Hippogriff was astounding, blending in so seamlessly with the actors and environment, realistic movements, and truly felt like a real creature and not a special effect. When you have an excellent cast, and great direction, you only get great performances. Each character was played with realism and true human emotion. The Harry Potter series is not a kid's book, as it is a book for all ages to enjoy, many times with mature and complex subjects. Alfonzo invigorated the Harry Potter movie series with new life, allowed it to grow and mature like the characters are, and brought it back to the level it should be, and then some.I loved the new ideas for their clothes. When in classes, they wore their uniforms. But they are teenagers wanting to be unique, original, and stand out, so it is only natural they would have their shirts untucked and ties loose. Some conformed with their attire and wore it properly, others did not. When not in classes they wore normal street clothes. What a brilliant move! This alone made the characters real teenagers, each one with a voice that wanted to be heard.Is it exactly like the book? No, and that's a good thing when it comes to a movie. Most people do not understand that books and movies are two different mediums. If you translate a book literally, word for word, scene by scene into a movie, it may be very accurate, but it will be a long and boring movie. Peter Jackson knew this, and Lord of the Rings trilogy was chopped up and rearranged a lot, but it made such a great movie. The first Potter movie followed the book very faithfully, but also remember, it was the shortest of the books and the future books don't get any smaller. It is the screenwriter's job to translate a book into a good movie by making a 'screenplay' by changing dialogue, moving scenes around, even taking out scenes and characters that do not further the story. Steven Kloves (the screenwriter on all three Potter movies) has done an excellent job, and I am glad he is working on the fourth & fifth movies. The movie pacing does go quick, but remember, this is a book that took many hours to read condensed into a 2 hour 19 minute movie. I feel that the pace was good and the editing was smooth.J.K. Rowling (the writer of the Potter series) even told Alfonzo to not literally follow the book, but follow the spirit of the book. By doing this, he is accurate to the Potter's universe, but not dragged down by having to do everything literally. She even encouraged him to create and throw around ideas. Sure some things were added and changed. Some scenes and characters were taken out or moved around. But did this hurt the movie?Not at all. In fact, it freed it. The screenwriter has to take out scenes or characters that do not move the story forward, alter scenes, add things, and condense for pacing, all to make a better movie.After seeing the movie twice, I only have a few minor complaints. One complaint makes a plot line of the story way to obvious to the audience, but with a second viewing, it serves as a misdirection. My other complaint was that something was not explained in this movie that maybe should have been, but can be easily explained in the 4th movie. My third, and maybe biggest complaint was right when the movie started out, he was practicing magic outside of school, something he is forbidden to do, and didn't do in the book. But did I let these complaints of mine destroy the entire movie? Not at all!I have read many negative (as well as positive) reviews of this movie. Not once has anyone who criticizes this movie and writes it off completely with one of their 'reviews' been logical or made sense. If you are going to put down this movie, at least make some valid points. Some of them were so wrong with their reviews, I wonder if they had their eyes open when they watched the movie, or even watched the movie at all!If you want a rehash of the first two movies, which apparently the negative reviewers want, then go watch them again. If you want a literal translation of the book, have someone stand in front of you for many many hours reading the book while you sit and eat popcorn. If you want a great movie based off of a great book, filled with emotion, fear, tension, friendship, and wonder, go see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
551,flwerpwered,Harry is growing up,9,6 April 2019,This Harry has a new director in Alfonso Cuarón and a bit of a moodier look. The characters are also growing up and becoming teenagers now with a bit of angst. It all lends to a darker turn in this third installment that also sees the arrival of two fan favorite characters: Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Brilliant acting by the new additions adds to the unique directing and makes this a turning point in the Harry Potter movies.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
552,marvinrajofficial,Azkaban's Prisoner almost ruined Harry Potter's magic.,7,7 April 2020,"Reviewing in 2020 , Harry Potter third magical outing is very different from first two films which contains more as drama magical mystery movie. There has some controversial issues for this movie i have heard before but myself realize the fans can be satisfied at the end of the film. Overall it's slowly paced engaging Young Potter's drama in his third year with some horrific visuals and excellence of Young Hermione survive to great film.The story starts as Harry Potter as usual starts from his uncle house but he get from the house this time more earlier fashion reason of some wizard work from him and he really forced to get out as himself , there has some fast introduction of the prisoner of azkaban who is Sirius Black and wizard transportation make so wild as early start up. Moreover he met up his two best friends and the trio making way of return the Hogwarts for third year . Dementors to suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out, but new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin repels the dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large and Hogwarts groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Without any spoiler to revealed Harry Potter will have to learned about Sirius , who is really he is , what more problems happening in Hogwarts and how he overcome from the Prisoner of Azkaban.The director Alfonso Cuarón has delivered decent job in this film with directing this trilogy .Steve Kloves screenplay has been questioned in first an half but he really nailed to second half of film which really makes great at end. John Williams music and background is key role in this film too as previous outing . Michael Seresin is Cinematographer done basic and good job but with sometimes dull but it's neat. Steven Weisberg cuts was brilliant . Overall the technical of films makes running time of movie fair with 142 minutes.Characters such as Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin has decent performance which major for the screenplay of film. Michael Gambon first outing as Albus Dumbledore does great replace for the role never felt mischief anywhere, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley really was bonding in support of the movie and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger really has more adventurous show she more then enough for the role more then Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in the film but anyhow he is starman for the show .Overall not best of trilogy but it's among fantastic second half screenplay.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
553,Blackavaar,I don't get it.,4,23 April 2018,"Why do so many people hail Cuarón as if he's doing something genius with this film? He altered the beginning to add some stupid joke with the wand lighting under the covers (Lumos Maximo would shoot a flare out of the wand. Lumos simply lights it up. - Read the books). And as a 3rd year Harry shouldn't have any trouble with the spell to light his damn wand. It's a dumb joke and it's not even funny when old man Dursly comes in grunting with his weird splotchy cheeks. Who did the make-up on this, btw? This is the worst make up job on everyone except the main cast that I have ever seen in a Harry Potter film. Really, except for the kids and the main teachers everyone seems like they are just plastered on and shoved into the background. Just keep them out of focus. It'll be fine. Sorry, nope. I noticed.Next, let's talk about the annoying change of Tom the barman/innkeeper at the Leaky Cauldron from a mild mannered Englishman to a weird jokey hunchback. Again, Mr. French, this is not funny. I don't know who you are trying to amuse but this is just sad. You don't make fun of the physical disabled anymore. Don't you know that? And then there's the Knight Bus shrunken heads with Jamaican accents. Yes, because you're not being racist at all by assuming all shrunken heads would come from places with people of darker skin. And did you read the books? This scene wasn't supposed to be about comedy. It was more about the dread of being completely alone with no one to help. Instead Cuarón again chooses to add some more awkward humor that simply isn't funny and is really just as offensive as Jar Jar Binks.And then there's the change to the Fat Lady. Suddenly she's become a wanna-be opera singer who can't sing and breaks a glass just to pretend she can? What? That's not funny and it's not even focusing on the discussion between the kids, which should be the focus instead of this unfunny change to a painting that's already been established in the series. No. Just, no. That's poor direction, even if it was just written on the script he was working from. Sorry, but any good director would actually at least take the time to watch the first two movies as part of their research and to at least try to make his movie match the first two for continuity. I mean, for cripes sake we have continuity directors listed among the crew. Tell me what do you guys do? Because it doesn't seem to be working here at all. And again, right after the Fat Lady, another annoying thing added for a stupid reason. Apparently the director found it necessary to show that all the paintings were connected by adding a giant snake slithering through all of them. Just one thing. Who painted a picture of a giant snake and where is that hung in the damn castle? No one! That's who. And nowhere! Seriously? And why is there a painting of a monkey in a cage. Who paints a monkey in a cage and hangs it in Hoggwarts Castle? Oh, I know. Some weird Mexican director who thinks he is more clever than he really is. Come on, man.Okay, okay. I've been harping on the affects and comedic changes a bit. Lets switch gears here for a sec and I'll tell you a few things I did like. The acting was very good, apart from Tom that is. And the director's work with Oldman, Thewlis and Gambon was remarkable. I really loved the new iteration of Dumbledore. And all the Professor Lupin stuff was great, right up until he turned into the dumbest looking werewolf I've ever seen on film. And this was after such a great addition with the Dementors. Really, the version in this film was better than any of the following films. I don't know why they decided to go more standard ""grim reaper"" in the rest. The look of the Hoggsmead and the Shrieking Shack were spot on, right up until they again showed some stupid shrunken heads, This time a parody of the Fates from Hercules. Do you have any jokes that are your own, Cuarón?Oh, I must mention Buckbeak, the Hippogriff. This looked great and was all well done right up until we do the magical ride around Hoggwarts part just for the sake of adding some fast moving adventure to the scene. I mean, it's fine. It was fun and looked great, but it made no sense and when you think about it it's the worst teaching ever. Really? A teacher just has you put your hand out to greet him then just lumps you up on a flying creature's back and shoos you off like you've ever even ridden a horse before? Harry hasn't, btw. He hasn't ridden anything but a bus and a train in his whole life and you're letting him take off on a dangerous creature he just met and could easily fall to his death from at heights of up to 200 feet over the damn school grounds? Are you freaking insane? You are so fired it's ridiculous and it wouldn't take Malfoy's insipid whinging to make it possible. Seriously, it also totally breaks up the continuity of the scene. I mean, he takes off flies around, comes back down and Malfoy says, ""I can do that!"" and gets bitten? I mean, come on. Oh yeah, and those dumb Monstrous Book of Monsters. LOL :D I don't get it. You're trying to give this a darker tone and then you're filling it with jokes intended for a five year old? Couldn't have the scene as it was in the book been enough, instead of the goofy chasing it around and stomping on it crap? And why was it spouting pieces of paper everywhere it went? Was it eating itself? Gah!This brings me to one of my favorite additions made with this movie, which is a bit of a blunder in itself at points when you think about things in later films (I won't get into that), but the Marauder's Map was just beautifully done, with the multi-fold pages and the pop-outs and the moving ink it was exactly as it was described in the books. I don't know if the director had much to do with that though. I'm pretty sure those effects would have been the same regardless.And then another complaint, the Whomping Willow. While I like that it changed with the seasons and began using it's growing willow vines as whips, I think the whole riding the tree crap was overplayed and ham-handed. A simple chase and dodge would have made more sense than the wild ride followed by a very convenient or extremely lucky drop into exactly where you wanted to go by the whipping tree branch you're holding onto.And then we get to that dumb looking were-wolf again. Man, is that thing horrible. It doesn't even look like a wolf. It hardly has any fur. It's all skinny and gaunt. I mean, wth is that? It looks like a were-weasel. And let's not forget he completely changed the layout of Hoggwarts for no reason just too add all kinds of stupid clock references. Hello, we know the time turner is a big thing in this film you don't need to keep pointing it out to us like we're a bunch of 5 year olds.Some say all these decisions were artistic and that makes this the best of the Harry Potter films, but I'm sorry. I completely disagree. Changing things in a film that is supposed to fit in with a series for the sake of your own art is not a good thing for the series. It doesn't work. It doesn't fit and it doesn't make for a good part in a series. You don't have a guy come in to do an addition on your home and let him run wild with the design just because he has a vision and end up with this weird slat roofed, brick thing sticking out of your hard tile roofed, stucco house. It's the same with film. Look at what you're working with. Make it match that. You wanna make art? Make your own stand alone films. Don't try to play with a team if you're not a team player.And then I come finally to the last badness. The worst scene in the film and simultaneous one of the most important. That part where Daniel Radcliff said to the director ""I wanna try something my way."" And the director said, ""Okay."" And then actually used that cut. OMG it's horrible. He looks horrible. It makes him look like the worst actor in a B movie and this is not a B movie. The scene, can you guess it? It goes like this.Hermione: ""Harry, what is it?""
Harry: ""He was their friend.. and he betrayed them. HE WAS THEIR FRIEND! I hope he finds me. 'Cause when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"" And then he does this stupid lip thing and heavy breathing, which is supposed to read as anger but reads more of overacting. Really, you should have shot more than one take Cuarón.That's all. I'm sorry, but I disagree with the majority on this one. This was not a good Harry Potter movie. It was barely acceptable and obviously the studio agreed because Cuarón was not asked to continue working on the films.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
554,elenaiulianaaldea,After all this time this is still my favorite!,10,17 October 2020,"This is the best movie from all the Harry Potter series. Alfonso Cuaron captured the magic and so many little details from the book perfectly. When I miss Harry Potter, I always come back to this movie. I absolutely adore it! Although my favorite HP book is The Half Blood Prince, my favorite movie is this one! After this, the movies started going downhill.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

556,yayagirl14,oh no,3,20 December 2006,"Well, this movie may be the ""best"" movie of the Harry Potter movies, but it is the most untrue to the book. Sure in the 4th one the maze was all wrong, and in the 1st they left out trials before Harry gets to the stone. But in the 3rd, not only are some characters just portrayed incorrectly, the plot is twisted, and many things are not explained. For example, if you have not read the book, you don't understand anything about Sirius and why he really isn't guilty (my brother was super confused for example). Also there was barely any quidditch, quidditch is one of the most important aspects in the book. On that note, Sirius was supposed to send Harry his fire bolt in the middle of the book, and there was a big conflict about if the broom is bewitched. Also, it says specifically in the book that the students at Hogwarts don't know how to dress in the ""current styles"" because they only wear their robes, that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie. Also the dementors are wrong, they don't fly, they float, the kiss was not them attacking you and pulling your face off, they was supposed to be huge lips somewhere, i didn't see any. Also i cant seem to decide whether Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are good actors or not, in the 4th they are fine, no overacting or anything, but in the 3rd, i don't know what to think, for example, when Harry finds out about SIrius and his parents, he does some sort of cry thing, that looks like he is having an asthma attack. Also, this isn't really any ones fault, but Emma Watson is way too gorgeous for her character, i mean, Hermione is supposed to have bushy hair and buck teeth, Emma Watson has perfect teeth and amazing hair. The movie was disappointing, when you have a Harry Potter marathon, watch 1, 2, and 4. because the only reason you should watch 3 is when you are in a ""omg this movie is wrong"" mood, and want to point out everything incorrect in the movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
557,senlac,Disappointing,5,22 January 2005,"Purists will be muttering about the departures from the book (check out some of the other reviews); while no purist myself I am puzzled about one or two of the changes in the setting and direction. What has not been mentioned is the location of Hagrids cottage. It has suddenly jumped from being just outside the main gate of Hogwarts (and adjacent to the Haunted Forest) to a wooded valley and reached by a path down a stony hillside. I believe that the castle was also visible in the background on a hill top. What was the point of that, I wonder? I also found the whole film entirely lacking the feel of the first two. OK, new Director wanting to put his own stamp on the series, I can understand that, but the film has suffered. It compares badly (in my opinion) with the others - sadly, it was mostly dull with definitely a touch of the ""ho hum"" factor. Michael Gambon is a damn good actor - why was his character so low key? As it was, you are reminded that Richard Harris is dead and this is the replacement, instead of just presenting Dumbledore as a lead part. Sorry, but I can only give this a 5 out of 10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
558,wortwart,"Too much, too fast",3,20 December 2004,"Harry Potter goes to Hollywood ... this movie is a two-hour-rush full of ""special"" effects. Large parts of it have the tempo of advertising or music videos. Alas, Harry Potter III lacks the charm of the books, it lacks the wonderful atmosphere of Old England so beautifully captured in the first two movies -- it lacks everything that made the previous films of the series something special, lovely. I would not recommend this movie to a 12- or 13-year-old, not only because of the many horror scenes (don't know what they watch on children TV today, but I think this is way too much for a child) but also because I wonder how many of the young watchers who are so keen on Harry Potter get the story right (if they didn't read the book which should not be a prerequisite for watching the film) -- e.g. the side-story of Harry not being allowed to go to the village and getting the map as a help.My conclusion: the director was not interested in the story, not in the characters, not in the atmosphere. All he tried is to make you shed as much adrenaline as possible. I hope they will make a more old-fashioned movie next time. It would suit Harry Potter much better.3/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
559,Aeirould,The best of its type,10,7 June 2005,"I watched this again on HBO tonight, and am quite content to state that this is the best movie of its type since the Wizard of Oz.The subtle introduction of the *massive* clock to indicate the time theme, the Whomping Willow interstitials, the interaction of the amazing adult cast, the growth of Hermione's actress, the structure of the timeloop... the only thing I'd've hoped for more from was Radcliffe's performance. It was serviceable, or I'd've had to knock it down to a 9, but there were still some moments I could've done without.Still, I have hope for the future, as girls do mature faster than boys, so he might not be a total waste in the future films.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
560,The_StickMen,Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...,10,6 June 2004,"First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is getting much better as the kids age. We can expect that as they mature, their acting will as well. It is a lot of fun to look at how the three have changed over the films and I hope they don't replace them for the last 4 films (Emma Watson is going to be hot when she's older...).The creatures are getting a lot cooler. When I read the book when it first came out I was really exited about seeing the Dementors on screen and when I did I was well pleased...they are the coolest and scariest monsters in the series yet and I wanted more scenes from them (and in future movies they will come). Buckbeak the Hippogrif was also very well done (and a lot less annoying than Dobby), they did a good job of making him real and believable.All in all this is my favorite Harry Potter film, it went by the quickest out of the three and I think it will be more accepted by those not too interested in the books as a great fantasy film...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
561,Gemma_Philips,Be Prepared (Very Minor Spoiler),5,11 August 2008,"Anyway, I felt that from this movie onwards there was a lot missing. Richard Harris played Dumbledore as a very wise, fair and most importantly kind old man. Gambon plays him with an Ulster accent like that of Ian Paisley. It sounds abrupt, preaching and everything but friendly. The Dawn French lines made me cringe, and the Granger girl seemed to become the main protagonist. There seems a lot of cost cutting like, ""Don't bother going to the Alley to get your books because I've conveniently got them all for you"" and let's just cut out Platform 9 and 3/4 and jump straight to the train chugging along with everyone aboard. Many scenes are drawn out to a yawn inducing length which sacrifices quality for quantity.Overall it felt like this movie and the next has a different Director and Screenplay Writer. I checked this out and it says they're the same, but it doesn't look it. Perhaps the cutting room editor is different, I just don't know. If it isn't broke then don't fix it, but someone has tried. It definitely looks cheaper.The time travel scenes were blatant 'Back To The Future II' rip offs and they reminded me of accusations of old, primarily that J.K.Rowling had collected many ideas of other's and passed them off as her own. Many people do this to some extent, but not quite like Rowling does. She's like those Hip Hop musicians who rip off sections of popular songs by changing a few lyrics or beats and incorporating them into their next hit.The first two movies were great and when watched back to back they followed on seamlessly. Prisoner Of Azkaban and Goblet Of Fire look only vaguely related and this is glaringly so when watched straight after Chamber Of Secrets. I found it immensely disappointing.I found myself persevering with Prisoner just to understand the next movie. Towards the end it picked up a bit but that's scant consolation. I found myself doing the same with Goblet Of Fire, but only this time it didn't pick up. Yawn.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
562,juliebug04,Great entertainment,10,19 July 2004,"The movie didn't follow the book as closely this time around, but the film itself was great. I loved the casting and the special effects were wonderful. Those dementors were CREEPY! I wouldn't want to come up on one of them in a dark alley. Gary Oldman was brilliant and I really liked David Thewlis. I was more neutral on Michael Gambon, but Richard Harris left big shoes to fill. I will be curious to see how he tackles Goblet of Fire. The kids are really becoming quite gifted actors and are growing up so quickly. What a difference between the three movies. The cinematography was very unique in this one and there was much more of a feel to the castle. I loved the intro scenes with the Dursley's and the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing about Scabbers and Crookshanks...Very entertaining movie and worth the trip to the theater.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
563,wet_willie_89,fairly entertaining...,7,4 January 2005,"I can say i enjoyed this movie but i can't say it was a fabulous adaption of the book. I mean they took out so many important scenes that would be useful in the later movies, aside from that the acting was terrific Dan, Emma, Rupert, Robbie, tom and etc all played there roles perfectly. And Professor Mcgonnagal played by Maggie smith was once again brilliant, and Gary old man's performance as Sirius Black was my favorite. David Thewlis gave a terrific performance as Professor Lupin, and the visual effects were great and my favorite was Buckbeak he was so beautiful i wish i could just take him home. A downfall was the director Alfonso Cuaron now i'm not being mean i don't think he is a bad director but he was bad director at making a harry potter movie. And what was with tom the barkeeper he turned all goofy and weird, and even though tom felton did a great performance as Malfoy his character was sissy than ever...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a fairly good entertaining movie but it was missing stuff the other two potter movie's had.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
564,TinySparrow,Something Wicked This Way Came!,8,4 June 2004,"I used to think that Harry Potter' couldn't be taken seriously. I thought that only inexperienced children could read and love these books. I had no doubt about it until last summer I saw my own 10-year-old niece intently reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. I was amazed as she had never read a book on her own will. `Ok then' I said to myself, `I must have my own opinion'. So when everybody went to sleep I took the book from the table, went to my room and started reading.I came to myself at about 5.30 in the morning when the last words had been read. That's when I could put the book away, still too excited to fall asleep. I couldn't believe that I hadn't read it earlier.That's why when I got to know that the movie was coming soon' I made a decision not to miss it. And I didn't.When my friend and I entered the cinema this morning, we felt a bit embarrassed as we seemed to be the oldest persons there. But all those happy children were too busy with their own discussion about Harry and everything, that they didn't pay any attention to us. So we crept into the hall and the lights went out.Well, the main thing I have to say is `We shouldn't have watched all the teasers and trailers!' Almost every moment of the movie was familiar to us and we were not surprised at all (leave alone the fact that both of us had read the book!). The pace of the movie was a bit unequal  I mean the 1st half was kinda measured and the ending seemed to me very crumpled, as if the director suddenly realized he didn't have enough time to end the story in detail.Nevertheless I liked `The Prisoner...' because of its fantastic cast. I liked all the actors' performance! And the movie itself was beautiful and charming with funny and scary moments. Visual effects were fascinating! Whatever I say, the truth is I wasn't bored at all, I spent a very nice time, I laughed and was frightened, and I was feeling myself as a child when I left the cinema. Now I'm looking forward to watching `The Goblet of Fire'. Oh my God how long shall I wait for?!All in all, 8 out of 10... or maybe I'm too greedy?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
565,ville_koistinen,Better than predecessors but still not what I'd expected.,5,14 March 2005,"First of all I have to say that I love the books and I'm really fond of the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like the previous Harry Potter movies at all because the acting was just so bad. And it hasn't improved much.The thing I liked about this movie was Alfonso Cuaróns directing. The area of Hogwart was also more beautiful than it had been in the previous movies. Emma Thompson was quite good as Professor Sybil Trelawney and Rupert Grint was again funny as Ron Weasley.The thing I don't like about movies that are based on books is that they don't leave anything to your imagination. And again this movie ruined a little bit of my reading experience but not as strongly as the previous Harry Potter movies. I think that if you haven't read the books you really like these movies.I wish that they'd stop producing Harry Potter movies because even though I haven't liked them I still have to go and watch them in the hope that this one will be better.So the conclusion: If you're a Harry Potter book-freak, don't watch this. If you haven't read any of them, watch this because it is a beautiful movie and the story is great.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
566,tommyhawka,Unimaginative and Unoriginal.,2,5 December 2019,"I have recently decided to watch the Harry Potter films from start to finish on Netflix. I have never read the books so I am not comparing the stories in these films from the novels.First of all I was quite impressed by the visual effects throughout the movie, however the plot is really where it all went down hill.In these films a lot of the things that happen feel like plot convenience. Why did Harry Potter shoot snape with his wand spell? It wasn't used to highlight the change in Harry's character, it just feels like the writers wanted snape and Harry to hate each other throughout the movies for not much reason. If the plot made sense, and if snape was a genuine character he would like Harry and would want him on slytherin with his ability to speak to snakes and his immense power. Let's not even get started on how stupid and non believable the interactions are with Harry and Malfoy throughout the earlier films.The main reason that led me to write this review was the time travel sequence which tied together the plot at the end of the film. This would have to be the most unoriginal and bland plot device I have ever seen. In my opinion time travel makes no sense in the Harry Potter universe and it just creates so many plot holes and things to question. How could Hermione have received such power? This is potentially the strongest power in the Harry Potter universe and Hermione just goes ""oh yep I've been using it to get to my classes on time"". All of these was justified within just one scene. What were the writers actually thinking? If this is in the books then I really hope that in the books they go through Hermione receiving this power and using it to get to her classes.The entire sequence was just hard to watch. Even like the directing of the sequence was really hard to watch. There was no suspense throughout, they never almost got caught, when they were supposed to get caught everyone is looking at some strawberry field in the distance or something. I mean there are much more intense and original ways this sequence could have panned out. Maybe Hermione did see herself in the forest and that's what led her to go back in time? Maybe there was an actual purpose of going back in time in the first place? Proving that Sirius black was innocent would've been very easy and throughout the series it feels like Harry and his little team are by far more intelligent than anyone on screen even his enemies.Long story short I went on to watch goblet of fire until I got to the opening scene where these two guys waited for Harry and the gang in the forest instead of their house and one just randomly pops out of a tree. The whole story is unoriginal and unimaginative. Sorry potter fans. I'm not a fan.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
567,artcatcms,Disappointing! Just don't skip the books in lieu of the movie!!!,6,10 June 2004,"I was really disappointed with this outing, though I realize I may be prejudiced because this was my favorite book of the series. I knew that having a new director would give a different look, I just don't think it was necessarily a good thing. There were some major things left out that could be confusing to anyone not familiar with the books. For instance in regards to the marauders map...they never explain just who Prongs, Wormtail, Padfoot or Mooney are. There may be something wrong that I know this at my age without having to reference the book...but I love these stories and its disappointing to see them tweeked on the big screen. There is also Harry's patronis taking the shape of a stag...that is never explained either. Further they didn't explain a lot about what an animagious is. Like I said, I know the books so well...maybe that is why I didn't care as much about this rendition. See the movie......but please....read the books! They are so much fun!!!!!!

Did anyone else have a problem with this? The same question must be asked about the book. It would have made sense if everyone THOUGHT Sirius had betrayed the Potters, which they did, but then when we meet Sirius, he explains that it was Pettigrew who was to blame and that he never wanted to kill Harry, that it just a rumor.

He's a brilliant actor when it comes to being scared. But my favourite thing about this movie is the animation. The hippogrith that Hagrid owns looks real. The domentors look really freaky and all this clever animations look like it's actually there! But the reason that it lost a mark was because Albus Dumbledore sounds younger than the second and the first and I understand why. Also I thought Dumbledore's last actor was better than his new one.

574,germanman,A hacked job - a sequence of scenes that tell no story.,5,6 June 2004,"From the beginning, I felt as though I'd come in 5 minutes into the start of the film; as if I'd missed some beginning section, thought I was there from the previews on. This film never got to telling a subset of the story of described in book 3, but rather was a collection of scenes depicting parts of the book, but never evolved into a coherent plot-line that one could follow or feel. I'd read the book; all the books, in fact. That did not help and so I feel those movie goers who had not read, but mearly came for a good film were even more confused and disappointed.Clearly, there was too much material to cover in the 2hours 20-something minutes of the film (does that count the last 10 minutes which is all credits?). As to be expected, some of the story had to be left out for the sake of brevity. However, this, being my favorite of the books, resulted in my least favorite of the films. And its not even related to the new, leather-cap wearing Dumbledore, whom I could get to like, despite the drastic change in appearance that was not necessary. No, its either the direction, but surely the editing or production thats too blame. For one, the scenes didn't seem to flow into a store that brought the viewer in. Then, the look of Hogwarts was totally different than the previous films. Sorry, when you are part of a series, you MUST stick to those things that have been established in previous films. Hagrids house is not down a rocky slope from the school and the whole thing is not on a mountain side as depicted... at least not from the previous films. To that I say BOO! Bad job on all responsible. Thanks for ruining a promising and wonderful world. Get off your high 'my artistic vision' horse and do the damn series the way the fans and the previous films and the books have set it up. No one gives a 'wormtails'-arse what your artistic vision of the story is. Really, we don't.Where did all of these 'standing stones' come from? Nothing of the sort was ever mentioned in the books, neither was Lupin having a mustache. If there had been a mustache - Rowling WOULD have mentioned it. Which, by the way makes me wonder, what the hell was J.K. doing other than making sure the director and producers didn't bugger up the film?In stead of wasting time on a needlessly long bus sequence and pointless whomping willow vs bird encounters, they could have spent more time telling vital story elements. A few mentions of Hermione showing up to class in the middle of it all doesn't cut it for setting the stage to her actions. Snape making 'one' mention about the 'potions' Lupin should have been taking..., if thats it, you chould have left that out since the director/producer didn't bother to develop the whole Snape-Lupin-Potion situation at all. The film felt rushed and cramped. Knowing the story, I barely could follow the events. For those not readers of the book, I feel pity for what is surely total confusion.If there is extra footage on the floor, I pray they do put it into an extended version for DVD ala Lord of the Rings.Learn your lessons and don't fudge up the next film, ""Goblet of Fire"", which is to already be shot and I'm expecting in the editing process now.If this is the vision of the current director, I say, bring back Chris Columbus as soon as possible.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
575,spiderangelwing,Completely outclasses the previous two,9,2 July 2004,"I am stunned to see opinion so strongly divided on this film, with many deriding it as a great disappointment and as the worst of the three Potter films so far. Personally, I believe the film to be in a completely different league to its two predecessors, surpassing and outclassing them so astoundingly it's almost embarrassing for poor old Columbus.New director Alfonso Cuaron's marks are all over this movie. Where the first two films exhibited an unadorned, functional narrative lacking any film-making flourishes or cinematic flair, Prisoner of Azkaban is a joyous treasure-box of celluloid delight. Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets contented themselves with simply going through the novels' plot joylessly and mechanically - Azkaban, on the other hand, weaves a spellbinding visual tapestry of a magical world, relying on all the non-narrative techniques open to cinema to bring this world to life.Thus we have beautiful, rich cinematography (too many examples to mention, but the frequent use of wide-angle lenses to juxtapose foreground with background stands out, and just check out the shot of Harry riding Buckbeak as he glides over the lake's surface), a Hogwarts that has changed considerably (into something much more magical and majestic), and direction that frequently borders on the genius. From the hand-held camera in the early Dursleys scene, to the 1920s style fadeouts (which I thought were a nice touch), to the visual delight of the changing of the seasons, to the seemingly constant motif (right from the opening scene) of going through windows (and even mirrors), there are so many wonderful little touches in this film that, after two viewings, I can already see that it will be one to repay many repeat viewings.It's not a perfect film, however, and what's frustrating is that it's so very close to being a masterpiece. Its one great flaw is that it fails to properly explain the backstory linking Pettigrew, Lupin, Black, James Potter and Snape, as well as their link to the Marauders' Map. Just ten more minutes of running time expended on this and the film would have been a solid-gold classic. As it is, the title of flawed gem will have to suffice.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
576,sjdean-1,Better With Time,8,25 July 2007,"I was never a huge fan of this movie. Everything changed and we feared the loss of Chris Columbus at the helm. With the unheard of director at the time, I feared that we would lose the fantasy element that we had with Chris Columbus, especially when Alfonso Cuaron started talking about ""coming of age"" rather than pure unadulterated magic.I am however delighted to say its ""stood the test of time"" and I think will continue to do so. It is quite an accessible and should be remembered quite fondly.It's somewhat more professional than the first two films in the franchise and it's good to see the young cast fleshing out their roles a little more - they're not so stiff. Having just read Book Seven, the Deathly Hallows, it's quite intriguing to re-watch this movie and recognise the fore-shadowing.Despite another tired clichéd and familiar sound track from John Williams, and another linear, disjointed scene-by-scene adaption by Steve Kloves, this is a fine movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
577,sin42,gets better with every time i see it,9,3 January 2008,"first of all i'm not at all a potter fan, never was but to say this movie is bad, cause its not exactly like the third book is utter nonsense. i didn't read the 3 book but never the less i know what its about i know where and about whom... thats all i need to know.the story is solid OK maybe a little weak at the end but non the less good and interesting.what i did not like was the way the dementors where done... nut very convincing but gore... lifeless computer animations that is in complete contrast to any other element of the film.what i liked most of all is, this movie is one of the view of the fantasy-genre that really manges, to show you another world, that lives and breaths... u can see it everywhere, in all these beauty full and funny details all along the film... for example when potter rides around with a huge hippo grip that starts playing with its reflection on the surface of the black lake near the magic school while flying over it or when a waiter comes by balancing in one hand a pile of dishes, that is actually higher than the waiter himself...but also in the behavior of the characters. the minister of magic, that trys to avoid step in to a pile of invisible-horse-you-know-what or Ron, when he gets up at night talking about step dancing spiders that want him to join in...Alfonso shows a great feeling for light and shadow in his scenes and uses interesting and ingenious techniques to show u how strange this potter world really is... without leaving you alone.the acting is also great but that is naturally thinking of all the details put into the acting like when potter is playing with a kandleflame while thinking of a, so called... wonderful moment of his ... that is actually more painful to him.i like this movie i like it a lot and every time i watch it i like it a bit more.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The way Alfonso Cuarón handles the camera is just great! And even those wizards get something believable now, where in the first two movies they all looked like out of place Halloween characters.And the final battle scene, where Harry is fighting the Dementors, it's really like I visualized during reading the book!I can only blame them for making it to short :( The almost 2 1/2 hour were by in no time ...Can only give it a 10 out of 10.

579,magic_eight_ball737,This film is holding no one prisoner,9,18 March 2013,"Harry Potter was a fantastic and well thought up series. The first and second films were pretty mature for children's movies, and I still admired their stories. However, I can see why they didn't pay up plot-wise to Prisoner of Azkaban. First things first, I'm a little reluctant about series that are directed by a numerous amount of directors. It gets... messy. However, this one film is the exception. Alfonso knows what he was doing. 1) New variety of camera techniques. Although I didn't like the fade/circle transitions as much, I enjoyed a lot of the hand-held camera work. You don't see it a lot in filmmaking today. 2) The acting. It seems as though Emma Watson has completely changed as an actress in this film and on. Her acting in the first two films are what some would call dim-witted... ironically. The characters are more realistic and actually have feelings.3) Conflict. Yes, I know there is conflict in every film out there. What most people forget is that most of the conflict needs to be directed towards the main character. Harry almost gets killed by Voldemort in the first film. Harry almost gets eaten by a basilisk in the second film, sure. But it's not enough. Harry falls off his broomstick. He gets yelled at by a teacher who's close to him (which is quite new to the series, frankly). He almost gets his soul sucked out by dementors. A lot of writers are afraid of hurting their main characters. 4) It's emotionally grounded. It's rare to see movies that have this sort of phenomena. Hermione and Hagrid are in love with the hippogrif, despite how harsh of a creature it is. We see Harry's hatred (for the first time) for the person/people who aided in the deaths of his parents. He believes that his own father was the one who drew the dementors away when he almost got his soul sucked out - and it's the first thought he comes across once he awakens from a coma. 5) The motifs. It's also rare to see these in movies, as well! There is the very important and reappearing motif of time in this film, both visually and audibly. There is one entrance to the school that everyone seems to use - and, incidentally, the base of this entrance is a giant clock tower standing like a monolith over a nice atrium. During the entire time travel portion of the film, the faint sound of a stopwatch is heard... for the entire duration from time travel, to climax, to rescuing Sirius.6) The climax itself. Enough said. After Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are awaiting their previous fates to take place, Harry brings up the rescue between him and Sirius to Hermione. She claims that only a real powerful wizard could have conjured it. Harry believes it to be his father - and when it comes time for Harry's 'past self' to be rescued from the dementors, it's Harry who rescues himself. He was the powerful wizard after all.7) Almost everything had meaning. I'm tired of watching films that include things that don't have much meaning or use to the story. Why did we spend all those minutes watching Harry practice a patronus charm? Because he uses it during the climax to save himself. That's why. Why did we spend all those minutes watching the Hogwarts Express being infiltrated by dementors? Because they play a big role in the story.I am a strong believer in the difference between good films and enjoyable films. Good films follow the formula, and is static. Enjoyable films rely on opinion and the such. However, it's rare to come across both a good film and an enjoyable film... and I know I had just passed by one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
580,sadclownrep,"Finally, The Spirit of The Books on Screen",10,7 June 2004,"I love the Harry Potter books.  I've read them several times, search obsessively for information about the new books and, yes, went to see the first two movies.  They left me flat.  Yes, they hit the plot points of Rowlings' books, but (in spite of their special effects) they lacked, frankly, the magic.""Azkaban,"" on the other hand, abandons some of the major plot points of the book.  If you are somebody who wants to see the book on screen exactly as it was written, this movie will disappoint you.  Of course, let's not forget that there were plenty of plot points abandoned in the first two movies as well.Anyhow, if you, on the other hand, fell in love with the world of Rowlings' books, this movie is likely to be a delight for you.  There are tons of little details that don't scream out ""LOOK - MAGIC"" (like nearly every magic moment does in the Columbus films) and, as a result really seem magical. 
Some fine acting from all the cast members - this is the first time that, for my money, the kids really seemed like the characters instead of like children who were just lucky enough to look like the characters.  David Thewlis is an excellent addition to the cast as Professor Lupin.  The scenes with Radcliffe and Thewlis are among the finest in the film.At any rate, I give it a 10 out of 10.  It exceeded my expectations.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
581,kellychitwood,"Super Movie, But Only If You Haven't Read The Book",5,9 June 2004,"WITHOUT considering the book(s), POA is probably the best of the Potter movies so far. It looks and feels more real than either of the first two, thanks in large part to improved special effects and striking scenery changes. Somehow, the spirit of Potter's world is more believable than before. It kept me engaged, excited, and talking to the screen, which is pretty remarkable, considering that I'm 41.BUT YOU CAN'T CONSDER THIS MOVIE WITHOUT THE BOOK(S)! Throughout the film, vital plot and character information is sacrificed at the expense not only of this story, but of all Potter stories to come. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The most glaring omission is the failure to identify Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. All are major characters who will play important parts in the rest of the Potter saga. Why and how they came to make The Maurauders' Map touches on a key element of their personalities, as well as their relationships to Harry and among themselves. As it stands, viewers could easily believe Lupin when he tells Snape that the map is just a Zonko's product.The POA book also sheds some light on why Snape hates Harry, Sirius, and Lupin so much...we need to know this! It is critical to future character interactions, and it adds depth and motiviation to Snape himself.More illuminating points that are omitted: How did Sirius (A) stay sane in Azakaban; (B) escape from Azkaban; and (C) know where Wormtail was? We see the newspaper clipping of the Weasley family, complete with Scabbers, in Egypt. That clipping has ONE purpose...to answer the above questions. But after a fleeting glimpse, we never see or hear about it again, and the questions remain unanswered. Padfoot: The movie creation is far too menacing and utterly unlike the shaggy, boisterous Padfoot of the books. Next movie, Padfoot must survive on hand-outs as ""a lovable stray."" The creature we see in PoA would inspire even a dog-lover to get the gun, not the left-over roast beef! And again, considering who Padfoot is, his animagus form should not be monstrous.Harry's Patronus: Beautifully executed on-screen, but tell us why it is a stag! In that answer lies a wealth of character expansion and emotional attachment for Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, and the viewers! Something that should be wonderfully moving is just superficially pretty.All this leads to one huge question: WHERE WAS J.K. ROWLING WHEN THE SCREENWRITER AND DIRECTOR WERE BUTCHERING HER BOOK? Has she given up all creative control? If she doesn't step in before Goblet of Fire is released, lovers of Potter's wizarding world may riot at the box office, and the gloomiest predictions Professor Trelawney can dish out will be warranted!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
582,BIGHAIRY-1,The best so far.,8,8 June 2004,"Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is a curious movie. It is probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, being a bit more sinister & gothic in both the look & content. It has, on the whole, better performances from the cast than the other movies. It doesn't seem to drag like the first 2 did in places. And the special effects are dazzling. Yet, as I pondered the movie a couple of hours after I had seen it. I found myself thinking `Yes it was probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, but what was missing' Well I eventually realised what was missing after watching the HP & the Chamber of Secrets' with my kids later that evening. I shall come to the missing ingredient a little later. It's Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Wichcraft & Wizardry, & yet again he is caught up in mysterious goings on. The mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard's prison `Azkaban' & is making a B-line for Hogwarts & in particular, it seems, Harry himself. It transpires that Sirius Black was the wizard responsible for the Death of Harry's parents, at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. As a result, the guards of Azkaban, or Dementors (think floaty Ringwraiths), have been stationed at Hogwarts to try to stop him. They do seem more intent on trying to suck the soul out of our hero. (That's what a Dementor does to its victim. It sucks all of the goodness out them until they are nothing but a living shell of a human). Add to this a Werewolf, a Hippogriff (a half horse, half eagle that can fly) & a menacing black dog that seems to be stalking Harry, & you have movie choc full of mystery & marvel. Now to the positives & negatives. Alfonso Cuaron has managed to get the best out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). He seems to be more at ease in front of a camera, when delivering his dialogue & you get the feeling that he has actually been given the proper encouragement & coaching. He seems to be a far more confident actor than the wooden puppet of the previous films. The other child actors are also very good, with both Emma Watson & Rupert Grint (Hermione Grainger & Ron Weasley) showing that they could have big careers ahead of them. In fact, the cast as a whole are pretty damn good. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Dame Maggie Smith all slide comfortably back in to their usual rolls & are, as usual, excellent. The new members of the cast are also very good, with David Thewlis excellent as Professor Lupin and the magnificent Gary Oldman (chewing up & spitting out every scene he is in, with relish) as the sinister Sirius Black. The actor with the hardest job out of the whole cast was Sir Michael Gambon. He had the unenviable task of replacing the late Sir Richard Harris. Thankfully he slips in to Dumbledore's robes with the minimum of fuss, playing it more as a bumbling old hippy rather than the imperious & imposing Harris' Dumbledore.The only real disappointment in the cast is Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney. She over compensates for limited screen time, with over the top, hammy nonsense. The visual effects, as you might expect, are top notch. Cuaron seems to have taken a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book, letting the visual effects fit around the movie rather than the George Lucas style of let the visual effects be the movie. The pacing of the film is just about spot on as well. It's not too long & it manages to stick to the book fairly well (although the lack of explanation about the origins of the Marauders Map was fairly irritating).But. There were a few minus points as well as that missing thing I mentioned earlier. Again, as with the first two movies, Alan Rickman is woefully under-used as the bitter & twisted Prof. Snape & the same goes for the glorious Gary Oldman & his movie stealing performance. And the biggest thing to be missing was a standout action set-piece.In both previous movies, there have been major spectacular set pieces that have really stuck in my mind. In the first one (The Philosophers Stone) there was Harry's first Quidditch match & the Giant Chess match. In the second (The Chamber of Secrets) there was the flight to Hogwarts in the Weasley's Ford Anglia, another impressive Quidditch match, the escape from Aragog's lair (Aragog is a giant spider) & the battle with the giant Basilisk (Snake). Yet in Azkaban, there is nothing that stands out (apart from performances which some would say isn't a bad thing). Harry Potter films need a good set piece or two. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good action sequences. The journey by Knightbus, Quidditch in a thunderstorm, a Hippogriff flight sequence & a werewolf/dog fight. It's just that you get the feeling that you've seen similar before, so there is no real wow factor.On the whole this is a mightily impressive movie. Alfonso Cuaron delivered a movie as magical as the first two movies but with more depth & much better performances by the impressive cast.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

My sister and I are huge fans of the five novels, and the first two films (great adaptions!) But when we saw this film, we were greatly disappointed! They took out A LOT, and added A LOT. There was a shrunken head on the night bus. They took out the quidditch cup, they took out Crookshanks' involvement with Sirius Black. They did not explain the whole ""protection spell"" Dumbledore used on Harry and his parents. And what was with changing Hogwarts so much?! Dememtors flying?! Sirius NOT slashing Ron's drapes with a knife?! This film being shorter than BOTH of the previous films?! That new director RUINED my second favorite Harry Potter novel! They deleted AT LEAST a hundred and fifty pages of the book, and added TOO MUCH new (and stupid) material. There was some dumb hunchback, and Harry behaved too much like a hero.

The problem comes from the fact that you only get a skeletal sketch of the novel itself.Most people have criticized the film for not explaining fully the marauders map for instance, however, the problem goes deeper then this. The time it took for harry to produce a petronus was greater, giving Lupin and Harry time to converse (I don't remember walks on bridges or woods). But what I found most astonishing was (unless I've missed it) the lack of explanation as to why Snape loathed the Potters, Sirius and Lupin - this is really quite central to Snape/Harry relation, and if it was covered it was fleeting. All in all the novel had a good deal more depth and detail then was in the film. Perhaps if the director didn't waste time on unfunny shrunken heads he could have added more detail that was actually in the book.If you haven't read the novels or are quite content with the essence of the book then this should prove to be a very enjoyable film.

586,frogger612,8¾/10 [with explanation],9,28 November 2004,"[Caution: May contain spoilers]My rating: 8¾/10Why?Best installment of the series so far, in my opinion. The new director added more punch and character to the film, whereas the first two seemed a bit wooden. Some complain that the grounds of Hogwarts changed; I say it's about time. The new, more interesting terrain seems more realistic and beautiful, so that you can see why the students like it. The flat, treeless plains of the first two movies were unattractive and dull; I'd rather stay indoors.The acting improved greatly on this film. Emma Watson, who already proved herself competent in the first two, really shines in PoA [and is getting rather pretty as well: perfect timing with the Yule Ball coming up...]. Rupert Grint is good, as well, and Daniel Radcliffe, though he needs more improvement, is getting better as the series progresses. The new actors...well, they're good for the most part; I just don't agree with some of the choices. Emma Thompson is brilliant in the part of Trelawny, bringing that frenzied, bug-eyed woman to screen excellently. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis also played well, but I don't agree with casting them in the first place. Also, as it was a rather large burden, Michael Gambon did okay in the part of Dumbledore, though he didn't bring us the twinkle-eyed old wizard Richard Harris gave us.The movie was darker than the previous two, and rightly so. Now we have dementors, a supposed murderer [and the real one], more mysteries and secrets, all leading up to the dark climax of Goblet of Fire. The pace is quicker [though some more details might have been nice], but the movie flows a whole lot better than the first two.--",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It introduces us to Harry's father's two best friends and the man who betrayed them.In ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" Emma has improved quite a bit. Ron's character is (thankfully) no longer the stupid sidekick (GRRR to you, Chris Columbus! GRRR!) but still provides a lot of comic relief. Dan is pretty good as Harry, but can't cry!

589,Kostale,Things are starting to get better!,7,30 May 2020,"Unlike Harry Potter 2, this film showed a lot of improvements on the screen in terms of things that I characterized as bad in commenting on the previous sequel to Harry Potter. Compared to the previous sequel, this sequel shows better acting and an increased presence of uncertainty and drama which is good. The actors have matured and their acting skills have slowly begun to improve (although they have shown very good skills as beginners in their work in the first part of Harry Potter). In that sense, I would like to thank to the screenwriter for throwing out unnecessary dialogues and dramatic breaks, as well as the directors who removed children's facial expressions from actors and thus opened the way for the Harry Potter franchise to move from the children's world to the adult world. In my opinion, JKR took a short ,,break,, in writing story for filming this part of the movie, because it is obvious that the story is not as interesting as it was in the first two parts of the film. But that's ok. It is important that all of them react in time to the question of making the unreal become real, both by writing and screening. In this sequel to the film, the emphasis is on mysticism and the relationships between people, both for solving the mystery in this part and for evaluating the characters themselves, and I support that. What is missing in this part are those interesting activities, events and actions that complement the film itself, which in the case of the theme of this film is already accustomed to his audience because they are constantly hungry for magic, strange and new things and knowledge from the world of magic. I liked the inversion of mysticism regarding the original suspicion of Sirius Black, which later got its positive turn, as well as solving that mystery with a part of returning time. What I would work on a little more is the relationship between Harry Potter and his family with Draco Malfoy because it is still childish and pathetic and deserves a more serious and realistic look. The part with the Dementors deserved a longer and more meaningful epilogue as well, and the evaluation of Professor McGonagall's character should be done urgently, she seems to be becoming an old grandmother who doesn't know what she's talking about or where she is and her position is quite demanding.
I will see this sequel as a break, as I said, and an opportunity to turn Harry Potter into a more realistic magical world, if it can be called that at all, and catch the train to gain a big name in the world of cinema, both in the field of action and in the field of filming. We are waiting for the next sequel to see what has been done on this issue.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
590,cooncat,"""Cliff Notes"" version of PoA still pretty good!",7,6 June 2004,"How do you fit a 560+ page book into a 2 hr. 20 minute movie? Well, the answer is, you don't. Kloves and Cuaron hacked and slashed the original story down to a barely passable minimum, which will no doubt be somewhat confusing to those who've not read the book. However, the original Prisoner of Azkaban story by author J.K. Rowling is so brilliant that even Kloves and Cuaron couldn't deal it a death blow.Things I liked:They actually did use some of the dialog from the book, word for word. Some of the scenes were exactly as depicted in the book. Performances by most of the supporting adult cast were absolutely 1st rate, especially Thewlis' ""Lupin"", followed closely by Gary Oldman's ""Sirius Black"". Maggie Smith is *always* great as McGonnagal. The CGI ""Buckbeak"" was entirely believable and 1st rate. William's soundtrack (scoring) was, as usual, very, very good.Things I didn't like:Harry's ""Titanic"" moment while riding Buckbeak. Cuaron's infatuation with Watson/Hermione, giving her all of Rupert's/Ron's best lines ... and inventing scenes and lines, just to be able to use her even more. Cuaron's pushing the ""sexual awakening"" aspect of supposed 13 year olds with scenes/comments, which doesn't happen until the 4th book, GoF. Cuaron's ""Blair Witch Project"" cinematography, which made the movie look like it was shot in 8mm film for an independent film fest. Cuaron's ""fades and transitions"", which were distracting, and had an amateurish feel to them. Anyone with a home computer and decent DVD Authoring software could have done better, with a bit of practice. Skipping important scenes, which would've given necessary information about character background, to flesh out the story, making it more poignant.Unlike all the so-called liberal Hollywood types who think Cuaron is brilliant, and that this movie is somehow far superior to the 1st two HP movies, I think that they 1st two movies were brilliant, and that this one is decent enough, given the hacked, choppy feel of it, brought about by Cuaron.As I said, its still good enough, and well worth seeing. It could've been MUCH better, with a better director and better, more fulfilling script. I intend to see it again, just to pick up on nuances I may have missed the 1st time around .. and to experience ""the magic"" of viewing the film with a theater full of Potter Fans.Seven out of ten ... definitely a cut above the ordinary, and, IMHO, better than all 3 LoTRs movies combined (but that's just me).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

592,edmar_mota,Probably the best so far...,9,7 June 2004,"Perhaps I'm writing this review as a Mexican who is proud of the mexican director of the film, but aside some nationalistic feelings this is probably the best of the three Potter films so far. I've read the book before watching the film, just as I did with the other two Potter films and one way that tells me that is better is that I didn't get bored at the middle of the movie (because I knew all the things).This film set apart (witch some had disliked) from the previous two in ambient, in darkness and in a more mature atmosphere (it's clear in the acting of the main characters), but for one reason: it's the first chapter in the Potter series were all the previously child characters are now teenagers (13-14 years). That's way the director (and I hope the producers) want (and ultimately does) a new style that is welcomed, and make a precedence to the next films to follow as the characters and actors grow older. Some other reviewers complain that the movie is loosely based on the novel, that the other two had almost everything from the books, and this had not, but that's no all true. Sure some of the key plots that link Azkaban to Goblet are missing (like the Chan girl, Harry's love interest in the next chapters), but many of the things that other users complain of are present, like the absence of the explanation of who make the marauders' map (in the film Sirius explains that is HIS map), and some other things that are there but inside dialogues and situations. It's was an intelligent way of compress a big novel into a two hour movie. And of course it's Cuaron way of doing things: that the spectator had to stay focused on both dialogue and picture to get all of the script and the film, and to understand things and situations. It's good that some one makes a truly `teen' movie, for intelligent teens. I hope my teen nephews appreciate,enjoy and like this movie. One last commentary: my wife is still at the middle of the book and understands the entire plot, and of course had enjoyed the movie as much as I did. Cuaron get to make thinks a little different than the book to make me interested from start to finish. 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
593,Laudanum_Legend,Best film of the year so far! Best of the three!,9,2 June 2004,"I saw the film last night with great anticipation, and boy did it deliver! The whole look of the film looks so much better, the uniforms, the style, Hogwarts itself, Cuaron has done a great job too in creating a darker film. The film is rushed and yes there are bits from the book missing but I think Steve Kloves has done a great job in creating a screenplay perfect for the big screen. Remember this is a film and not a book! The problem with the first two was that they were too long especially Chamber of Secrets which, with the deleted scenes felt like  they were trying to film the entire book! This film though is perfect for timing, the Quidditch match is long enough as are the rest of the scenes. Everything rolled out quite nicely. I will see it again most notably for the scene where Ian Brown (ex Stone Roses singer) makes a cameo appearance! He is the first wizard you see in the Leaky Cauldron. Overall I give the film 9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
594,Opie-7,"Great, even better in IMAX",9,7 June 2004,"This movie was definitely an interesting watch, seeing it in an IMAX theatre increased the suspense particularly in the Quidditch match, but the larger image did make the CGI look noticeable, but not too bad.
As for the storyline and acting by Mr. Radcliffe, Mr. Grint, Ms. Watson, nicely done. I haven't read the book yet but since this movie, I just began reading the series. The change of directors in this movie as well as the theming were apparent in the film. Cuaron did successfully establish a darker, yet more suspenseful film; but I really didn't like that 'freeze-frame' that everyone else is complaining about.Overall, definately in my humble opinion, one of the best of the three. If it's playing at an IMAX theatre near you, definately see it, even if you have already seen it at conventional 35mm theatres.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
595,hokanu127,Interesting visuals that fail to make up for poor Storytelling.,7,5 June 2004,"First off the VISUAL STYLE of this film was very artistic and dark. It went in a new direction that tossed aside the established world of wonder that Chris Columbus set us up with in the first two films. In some ways this is good, in others distracting and uncomfortable. Visual effects aside THE STORY exposition presents many problems for this film. What we have come to see is the story of these teenagers and their conflicts, climaxes and resolutions. In this film their is little of that.While Cuaran says that he wants to emphasize the feels of conflict inside these teenagers, he manages to gloss over it. From the onset of the film we begin with quick forced plot points given as fast as possible with no time to breathe. Sometimes its a good idea to stop and let the audience feel what is happening inside these people. That said, there was not enough exposition to cover the story. Cuaran touches on things and lets them die without embellishing on them at all. Columbus never let that happen. In this film we simply find no follow through. The film needed to be longer.SPOILERS We start at the Dursleys and without any preamble we are introduced to Aunt Marge. We know nothing of the relationship between her and Harry and we know nothing about why he despises her. After he gets angry and blows her up, he flees into the night. Here we have no sense of why he is worried about what he has done. He wanders out and is taken by Knightbus to The Leaky Cauldron during this time he learns of Sirius Black. Good moments of time spent on Diagon Ally are tossed out, and after this it is off to Hogwarts. On the train we are introduced to the dementors and Professor Lupin, played by Thewlis who has a certain warmth to him that you attach to.At Hogwarts we see Dumbledore again, this time of course played by Michael Gambon. Gambon has a certain batty and stern but humorous sense about him, but very much lacks any of the wistfulness that Harris brought to the part. Throughout the next forty or so minutes. The Hogwarts year passes by completely. This is far to short too cover all that needs to be covered before Harry meets Sirius at the end. We are briefly introduced to Lupin's teaching methods and Harry's fear of the Dementors. The subject of Harry's parents and their connection to Lupin, Sirius and Pettigrew is barely touched. Harry's desire to go to Hogsmead is not well supported, as his permission slip requirements are not truly discussed in the beginning of the film. Harry plays Quidditch only once and falls off his broom which is destroyed. He gets the Marauder's Map from Fred and George. The map is well done but is hardly seen. He goes into town and McGonagall conveniently divulges the facts on Sirius and his relation to the Potters. This whole scene is forced and way too quick to really let it sink in. There are several scenes where Lupin and Harry are for some reason walking though the grounds and Harry expresses his need to learn the Patronus Charm. After one session however he has it down. He also sees Pettigrew on the map well ahead of the scene in the Shak and it makes the ending less interesting. Hagrid only has one class that we see, the Buckbeak scene. After this Buckbeak is sentenced. At no time do we really see Hagrid distraught like we have in the past. So you never truly care for the Hippogriff. Twelawny's class is only seen twice and each time not much is revealed. She never makes the predictions she should that set her up as a mystic and later a fraud. As we leave Buckbeak's supposed execution Sirius in dog form drags Ron and his rat off under the Williow. Here comes a quick anti-climactic scene where Sirius reveals himself and Lupin comes in to stop him, realizes who he is and embraces him. Of course at no point did they establish the friendship of Lupin and Black. Then Snape pops in for no apparent reason and tries to stop the lot of them. They stop snape reveal the rat and Harry decides spare him. Lupin is then transformed into a werewolf. Sirius shouts to ask if he has taken his potion. Of course we know nothing about any potion because this part between Snape and Lupin, which would also serve to explain why Snape was there, is completely left out. Pettigrew then gets away, Sirius chase Lupin off and Harry follows. There is a scene which is the dementors flocking down on Harry and Sirius, and then Harry thinks his father sends a Patronus charm to aid them. He awakes in the castle and Dumbledore indicates that Hermione must use a Timeturner to help them aid Buckbeak and Sirius, which they then do. At the end of the film Harry speaks briefly to Lupin, where instead of providing any explanation as to the map, or Pettigrew, he says he is proud of Harry and must leave the school. Then Harry goes down and receives his Firebolt. This is the same one that plays an important point in the book. However, Cuaran left out all of Christmas at Hogwarts and the Firebolt and its importance. Instead it is used to end the film with Harry flying into the air and a freeze frame of his smiling face fading to black. I hate to rant on a film, but this lacked any sense of a climax. In parts there was little to indicate true conflict or resolution and no explanation of key elements of the story. The directing loses its vision early on. It is funny yes, but a series of Ron's jokes and Hermione's right hooks don't make up for a serious breach of storytelling. My overall score is 4/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
596,billy_man78,The best book...the worst movie...,6,18 September 2005,"I am almost 27 years old. A lawyer. A pianist. A computer freak. But above all, a Harry Potter maniac. And I feel proud to admit that, because, for me, the HP universe is something extremely exceptional, powerful, full of substance and every true value we hold. A whole new complicated, parallel to ours, world with a lot to teach every kid or adult, capable of making each and every one of us think and think again. The character analysis is awesome and the plot childly enjoyable but brilliantly mature. So, I'm a HP fan. And, naturally, I've read all the books (10 times each) and I've watched all the movies (20 times each!!).I loved the first movie, I had some objections about but still I enjoyed much the second one. But the third book was destined to give the best motion picture. Because it has everything in it, all the very fine ingredients to provide a great total!! Because of the Olympic Games, the movie came out in Athens in September 2004 and after a lot of irritating waiting we rushed to the cinema the very first day, full of excitement and predisposed absolutely positively. The result: THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF MY LIFE.THE HARDEST ONE TOO... Is that movie an ""adult"" movie as they baptized it?Why? Because it has nothing to do with Potter?Because it was deprived of everything that matters in the Potter universe? Because ""magic"" is a ""childish"" thing and we have to eliminate it to make a mature movie?Or the kids wearing cloaks and uniforms of Hogwarts would humiliate Cuaron's creation?And I ask all of those who have read the sixth book, how in the name of God is this little ""sissy"" of Cuaron's Draco going to be the person he is supposed to be in the 6th movie??? The atmosphere is changed dramatically and not because of the Dementor's presence. The Hogwarts is changed substantially too, and not because of the different location. Of all the classical British super-actors, only few remain decent and even fewer do something more than that. From all the new characters only Trelawney makes a statement-but that's because she is Ema Thompson-and Thewlis' Lupin is also something relatively memorable, while Gary Oldman's Black is not acting but absolutely overreacting, making you think whether Black was in Azkaban or in St Mungus' Hospital!!And that's definitely not Odlman's fault.Further more, the unavoidable replacement of the late Harris' Dubbledore with the Gambon's one has seemed to have a deteriorating effect on the Headmaster!He simply is...less magical, less proud, less grave, less ""aristocratic"", less important and less.....clean.And that's not Gambon's fault either..... The only really decent element of the movie is the artistic creation of the beasts. Hippogriff is a piece of art and Dementors exactly as anybody would picture them reading Rowling's description.Some elements of the plot - things that could not be anyway altered - also remain thrilling or sentimental or terrorizing but the question is whether all these are enough to save the movie... When, in the beginning of the movie, the Knight bus is running on the streets of London and it is IT that gets out of the way of things and not THE THINGS getting out of ITS way (like in the book), we overpass it without difficulty.But, in the end, it's all about the same thing: GET THE MAGIC OUT OF THE WAY. Deminisize it. Reduce it. Eliminate it...Or even humiliate it (see shrieking heads, the most ridiculous idea in the history of ridiculous ideas...). Cuaron is no fan of HP. He knows it. We know it.I doubt whether he has ever read any other HP book except from the 3rd one//If we accept that he has really read that too!And he has the right too hate HP and magic in general.What he is not allowed to do is force us to witness the desecration of our beloved world!!!THAT HE CANNOT DO!! 6/10 only because it is theoretically based on the third HP book, a triumph of J.Rowling...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
597,im_a_pig2003,New director and a better potter film,6,1 June 2004,"I have to say I thought the first Harry potter film (Harry potter and the philosophers stone) was incredibly rushed and not thought through. It seemed as if the director was in such a rush to get the film on the big screen that he did not take his time to do it. The second (Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets) was better than the first but I still felt it was rushed.Now this film has been done a lot better. The graphics and acting have improved dramatically and the whole new dark feel of the film is what I expected Harry Potter should be like. Fans of the books and films will love this instalment to the movies and, to me, it is the best one so far.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
598,brdwaygirl,"Loved the book, loved the movie!",10,6 June 2004,"I have read a lot of comments written by fans of the books who disliked the movie because it was not faithful to the most minute detail. I, for one, must say that I am a stickler for detail as well as a big fan of the books. I LOVED ""THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN."" The magical tone of the movie covered up any minor discontinuities between the book and the movie. The acting was fabulous, especially the three young leads, who have matured brilliantly since ""CofS"". Also amazing was David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the series, and I was a little nervous as to how his character was going to be treated. But from the first scene on the train, my fears were blown away. The one disclaimer I must add is that if you have not read the book, you might get really confused as to what is going on, because many plot elements are left unexplained (this, however, is not a problem if you've read the book). 10 out of 10. A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS OF THE BOOK",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
599,uglygelly,Almost a Masterpiece,9,15 June 2004,"Right away, you can tell that a much more talented person directed this. I noticed the better performances from the kids, the camera-work, and the stylized way it ended. You just couldn't ask for a better director. We still get some of the good qualities that made the first two movies into entertaining adventures like the humor, special effects, the musical score, and some likable characters. My favorite character is still Snape but I went on to prefer Prof. Lupin instead, I felt sorry for him at the end. Another character that stood out for me was Buckbeat, he has to be one the most beautiful non-existent creatures to ever be made by CGI.Just when I thought the film was going to be over, there was still more left and it made everything more unpredictable. I was utterly mesmerized and impressed by the last scene with Harry and Hermoine. It made me think and it made me realize what a genius J.K. Rowling is. I really am missing out a lot by not reading these books. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is almost a masterpiece and so far, it's the best of the series and also the most unforgettable.9.5/10Rated PG(scary moments, creature violence, and mild language.)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
600,herumesueni,Less a Harry Potter movie than an homage to Alfonso Cuarón,1,30 August 2004,"This is the only HP movie to come out so far that I actually disliked. The biggest problem are the many unnecessary changes that Cuaron makes only becuase he wants to. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the Trivia section here at IMDB. There are two items listed as being ""In honor of Alfonos Cuaron's Mexican Heritage"" and not one but TWO director's cameos. More than anything that shows that Cuaron was more interested in himself than the work at hand.There are major changes not only from the book but from the previous films. Many of the changes alter the overall ""feel"" of the movie. The sense of wonder that is maintained and fostered by the first two movies and all the books is replaced by one of foreboding and dread. Overall, the film just falls flat because the director failed to understand the soul of the work.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
601,ryaneco,Fantastic,9,25 June 2004,"Harry Potter and The prisoner of Azkaban ----- 9/10
From a film viewers perspective this film was extremely entertaining. Definately the best of the 3. The characters have grown and seem quite comfortably playing their alter egos, fingers crossed they don't change actors. It was a pleasent change having director Alfonso Cauron take over the ropes from Chris Columbus who did a great job but didn't make the films his own, he was faithful to the books in all persepctives, which don't get me wrong is not a bad thing, but cutting certain scenes out and picking up the pace a little would've made the films far more enjoyable than what they were, they were still great films at that though. Cauron definately saw this film as a chance to show us his creativity and spin on the potter universe, he probably cut too many scenes out especially involving the scene where Harry is caught under the Whomping Willow with Sirius Black, i don't need to say more for those who have not seen the film, but this could've been done so the audience of non-book readers could've picked up the story alot easier. As noted before the film had opened, this third outing is much more darker than the first two. It darker than the darkest parts of 1 & 2 combined and some scene may scare younger children, but made for a far more enjoyable experience for those older fans. The camera work is very stylish indeed and I was glad to see more artistic angles were taken during the production. Finally the quiddicth scene was so well done, you could actually belive this was a real game, shows how much CGI has advanced since 2001 when the first film was released.Overall, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban was a well rounded, stylish, entertaining yet dark film. Extremly Recommended - 9/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
602,ricoda-1,The book was better...But it was Great!!,7,4 June 2004,"I really enjoyed watching this new installment of the Harry Potter series. I thought that the special effects were a brilliant part that helped bring Hogwarts, Buckbeak, and many other animations to life. Although I liked the book better, I do give credit to Alfonso Cuaron for giving the audience a good and enjoyable movie. He managed to use great special effects with a good story, although the book had a much better story, and I was more anxious to find out the ending of the book than watching the movie. And one part of the movie that I missed very much was Richard Harris who had a great performance in the previous installments. I think the new Dumbledore didn't have the voice and the look to make it seem that Dumbledore was one of the greatest wizards of the wizard world. Again all three young actors, Harry, Ron, and Hermione pull off another great performance together. Including the acting from Sirius, Snape, and Lupin who give outstanding performances that gives the movie a better feel. So I certainly await with great excitement the fourth installment of Harry Potter, which by the way is my favorite book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
603,beccaj_ilh,Better than the first two,10,8 August 2004,"Like almost half this planet I am a Harry Potter fan and yes I did queue up outside a cinema on the day of release to see this film (despite the fact I was on holiday in France and had to behave like a true fan and sit through the French dubbed version before I could see it in English, just so I could see it on the day it came out)(Spoilers for non book readers)I found it much more enjoyable than the first two as although it did not stick as closely to the book as previously, it did flow much better and did not give the impression of random scenes from the book being placed in chronological order. Unlike, what it seems, most fans I did not object to the casting or to the fact that they gave away some of Ron's lines as I tried to see it from a film makers point of view. Although I did not agree with the changes they had made to Hermione's character as I found they had made her to socially adapt which was unnecessary. I found the moments that hinted a blossoming romance between two certain characters were well used as it seems that not all fans are picking up the book hints (don't ask me how).The film was reasonably well acted and it seems that Daniel Radcliff's acting talents are improving (gradually). Michael Gambon was well recast as Dumbledore. Gary Oldman was also great, despite the fact that his looks do not correspond to how I pictured Sirius as you really felt him change the character from raving azkaban escapee to loving godfather.Yes this film is darker than the other two, but then again the third book is darker than the first two so don't be surprised by that. I enjoyed it.8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
604,mush_disaster,Somewhat entertaining at it's best but mostly disappointing,5,12 December 2012,"I will start by voicing my initial disappointment when I first saw the film in the movie theater in 2004. I was so disappointed I've avoided watching it again until recently. I had hoped I'd like it better the second time but sadly I did not.Had I not cared about the books I would have probably enjoyed the movie more than I actually did and here are my reasons: I did not understand the pressing need the director seemingly felt to twist every little scene in the book. From small unimportant details like Harry's ride on Buckbeak to the importance of Crookshanks being left out (and the Whooping Willow going from whipping it's branches madly to quietness without any explanation). Not one scene followed the book with precision.Scenes were made up specifically for the movie: The part when Hermione throws a stone at Harry's head while hidden outside of Hagrid's hut. Ron being fully awake when Harry and Hermione use the time-turner. Harry casting a spell under his sheets (Lumos Maxima) which contradicts the rule that underage wizards are forbidden to do magic outside of school - a detail that should have been explained in more detail as it becomes important in later books (although the scene was amusing as most scenes with Uncle Vernon are). Sirius' soul levitating out of his mouth during the Dementor scene.And what's with the talking heads hanging in the Knight Bus?! They are not funny, they do not bring anything to the film, they are NOT in the books! They do not even fit the scene!Harry receiving the Firebolt at Christmas was cut out and so was the fight that the happening originated. The crackling tension between Ron and Hermione over their pets and the subsequent fight ditto. The relationship between Lupin and Sirius was badly explained and his knowing about the Map of Marauders was not explained at all. The (very important) mention of who were really Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail and Prongs was not made even though it plays an important role when it comes to understanding who these men that Harry barely knows once where.I found Hogwarts' change of scenery disappointing as the grounds were not recognizable and seeing that this movie is a follow up of two previous ones, it was completely unnecessary. The fact that students mostly walk around in regular clothing was a bit disappointing as well.In conclusion, lots of important scenes were left out or replaced by happenings that were seemingly made up by the director himself, distancing the movie from the original story.Not all was bad about it however: the background music was lovely even though it lacked some magic; the first scenes were okay and the first appearance of a Dementor was as creepy as I imagined it to be. The scenes are breathtaking, Buckbeak was beautifully made as was the scene in which Harry flies on him (even though it was completely unnecessary for the plot and honestly a waste of movie space), the Boggart scene was amusing. I'm positive I would have enjoyed the movie hadn't I been so utterly miffed over it's deviation from the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
605,poison_visions,fun for all ages,7,13 August 2006,"After many years of avoiding the harry potter films my mum invited me to sit down with her and watch a few. after watching the first movie i wasn't particularly surprised or looking forward to the next films. i read the first 3 books when they were first out and was looking forward to this film remembering that i enjoyed the story. I think the choice of getting in the new director was a masterstroke, although the first two films were aimed towards the younger audience this one was less predictable and far more entertaining. Without initially realising it director Cuarón was involved with both Y tu mama tambien and Great expectations(or which i enjoy both), i was still keen to look up what he had done previously.i thought this movie was well worth watching and was entertaining for those of all ages, and i don't mean that in the same way as monsters inc. which people say its suitable for all but is only really suitable for kids and simple adults. Its got unpredictable twists and luckily the numerous deus ex machina's take on believable explanations due to a twist!in a fantasy world of werewolves, wizards and witchcraft the main characters take on more adult attributes and work together to protect Harry from the ghosts of his past.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
606,MotorbikeMaintainanceGuy,Poor special effects spoilt the movie,6,8 December 2005,"It seems that once again, I am one of the few to criticise Harry Potter films (3/10 for Goblet of Fire). What spoilt this film largely for me was the special effects. The Dementors were a huge disappointment - they looked like men with pieces of black cloth over their heads. As with the Goblet of Fire, not enough time was spent on small but important details. Harry does not meet Cho in this movie, which provokes an unlikely glance at a random Ravenclaw in the fourth movie as Harry's basis for falling in love. Where was the quidditch? Where was Diggory?Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are poor caricatures of deep characters. Black is not involved enough, he just hovers at the edge of the film at all times. Lupin does not look shabby with a neatly trimmed moustache and combed hair - he looks like a Muggle businessman. The scenery also changes inconsistently with a great whoppin' bridge appearing out of nowhere and gosh, Hagrid's hut has relocated.Another detail which I forgot is the Boggart scene with the class and Lupin. As Harry steps forward, the Boggart clearly takes the shape of a Dementor, yet later on, Lupin claims he thought it would turn into Voldemort.The only redeeming feature of this film was that the actors (with the exception of Black and Lupin who weren't provided with adequate script and just didn't look like the part respectively) did well.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
607,La_Pirata_Loca,The Hogwarts Trio start their third year with magical creatures and learn about past betrayals,10,14 August 2005,"The third chapter of Harry's life at Hogwarts begins. This film is better than the first two Harry Potter movies because it's so much funnier. One of the funny scenes was when Aunt Marge come over for dinner. She calls Harry's parents ""unemployed drunks"" and finally Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has had it. All of a sudden she starts blowing up like a balloon and floated out of the house. The funny thing was that two scenes later you see her floating over a house, yelling for someone to help her. Another was when Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) were bickering about Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, chasing Scabbers, Ron's pet rat. They will later be seen arguing about whether or not Scabbers is dead and if it was killed by Crookshanks. The Fat Lady singing was also funny. She can't sing and she was trying to break a glass cup that she was holding. She started to scream causing everyone to shut their eyes and cover their ears. She broke the class on the wall behind her and claimed that she did it by singing. I think that everyone's favorite part of the movie was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione caught Malfoy (Tom Felton)about to witness the execution of Buckbeak, a hippogriff that attacked after Malfoy insulted it. Hermione walked over to him and pointed her wand at him. Ron told Hermione that ""he's not worth it"". She looks at Malfoy, who it seems started crying, and lowers her wand. She turns and him laughing. All of a sudden she turns around really fast and punching in the face. Some parts of the movie were scary. The scene where the dementer enters the train to Hogwarts. It almost sucked the happiness out Harry. Luckily, Professor Lupin made it go away. Another was when the dementer attacked Harry at a Quidditch match. He fell off his broom and wake in the hospital where he learned that only they lost the game but his broom went into the Whomping Willow (it was destroyed in other words). Harry also, later in the film, learns Hermione's secret to getting to all her classes was a time-turner when they traveled back in time to free Buckbeak and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a falsely accused murderer. At the end of the movie Harry receives a Firebolt, the fastest broom in the world, by Sirius. I think this movie was the best also because more people watched it more than the first two films. Before my cousin saw it she thought Harry Potter was alright. After she saw it she bought all the books and we now talk about Harry Potter every time she calls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, tragedy, and magic all in a film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
608,Crane_94,"wonderful movie, horrible DVD",6,5 September 2008,"i remember when i watched this movie in the movie theater. i loved it. definitely one of the best ones of the harry potter franchise. then, in Christmas, my parents gave me the widescreen DVD version of this film. in that time, i didn't liked the widescreen format, now i love it. but, since back then i didn't liked the widescreen format, i sold the widescreen DVD version i got, and i bought the fullscreen version later. that was one of the biggest mistakes i've made in my life. i mean, when you watch the movie, the picture quality is horrible!another thing is that,like, in one shot, harry potter might be talking to Professor Lupin, and you see harry but you don't see Professor Lupin! that's retarded! it looks as if harry was talking to himself! and, there's drizzle in the whole movie! warner bros. might have forgotten to clean the picture quality of this movie. the picture quality for this movie is surely of the worst I've seen in my life. another thing is that, in one scene, harry potter and rons dad are talking in the leaky cauldron, in the left down side of the screen you see a code or something like that. i think those things come in every DVD in history. im not sure what they are for, but in this movie, they are so easy to catch! so, overall, don't buy this fullscreen version. its such a wonderful movie and it is a real shame to watch it in such a horrible picture quality. even if you don't like widescreen pictures, still buy the widescreen version for this movie. you will find out that some buy black bars and a small picture are nothing compared to drizzle an sloppy camera angles.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
609,Scott-12,Disappointing,4,28 August 2004,"Whoever hired this director should be smacked hard. That was about the worst choice they could have possibly made for Director. He needlessly changed so much. Why change the whole look of the school? It was wonderfully magical in the first two movies. In this one it looked totally different, and to no purpose. The costumes also were terrible. Dumbledore looked more like a homeless person than a headmaster of Hogwarts. I realize you were working with a different actor, but you could at least stay true to the character from the book. And what was the deal with the kids' costumes? They were always wearing street clothes when the books made it clear they only wore clothes like that when they were in the Muggle world. Effects were okay, although I agree with a lot of other people that the werewolf stunk. It looked like he somehow stopped transforming half way through. Finally, the look, the tone of the film was all wrong. In the first two movies the muggle world was all gray and flat, reflecting Harry's view of that world. Then the wizard world at Hogwarts was colorful and vibrant because that was where Harry really came alive. This movie, though, has the wizard world all flat and gray and dingy. Why? To what purpose? I know the kids are growing up and becoming more adult, but Hogwarts shouldn't change. We could get a perfectly good picture of the kids growing up without changing the school from a vibrant magical world to a dreary awful place. I was horribly disappointed in this movie. Whoever hired this director for this movie must have been drunk to think he could pull it off. One final thing: the imdb trivia mentions that the fountain at the school has eagles eating snakes because it is the symbol on the Mexican flag where the director comes from. What rubbish! It is perfectly fine and appropriate for him to put imagery like that into a movie about Mexico. But this is a British film about a British school in Great Britain, for pity's sake! Get over yourself already and don't put pointless extra stuff in that doesn't fit in the story. Sheesh!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
610,Janazz,"Finally, a cinematic Harry Potter!",9,14 July 2004,"No longer a disney magic kingdom Hogwarts, but a mystical place of the imagination.  Not a rote by the numbers read along with the story film, but a cinematic vision of the book.  Of course there are more differences but the spirit is truer.  It will get harder and harder to keep all the details of each book as the books get longer and longer.  This director took the bull by the horns, wrestled with it, and put his stamp on it.  I find myself so enthralled with his vision that yesterday I just had to visit Hogwarts again and took an extended lunch hour to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 4th time.  Went back to work humming Double Trouble.  I do think that the Mauraders Map and the relationship of Prongs, et al. especially with the shape of the Patronus could have been explicated in just a few more lines with Sirius and the final Lupin scene, and needed to be. But when I compare how rote the other films were, especially the 2nd, and I think of Buck Beak dragging his claw in the loche and the four seasons of the whomping willow, Harry's talks with Lupin, all the details that just melt into the affectionate yet dangerous landscape, well I just sigh with happiness that there is finally a HP movie that I like as much of the books.

I am a 2000s kid and there is no other the film that gets me to feel like a kid again but this one. Prisoner of Azkaban has everything you want from a cinema-going experience from a perfect cast to perfect cinematography to perfect direction.Even though this is the third film in the series, this is the first film in the franchise to become darker in tone. Alfonso Cuaron's masterful direction balances the light heartedness with the darker areas of the story perfectly. He captures the essence of Hogwarts in a much more elegant way compared to Chris Columbus who directed the first two films.""The ones that love us never really leaves us..."" says Sirius Black to Harry towards the end of this film. This scene alone stood out to myself as a child and makes me tear up every time I re-watch this film.If you are a huge Potter fan, you will realize that not everything in the books will make it into the movies but this is a faithful adaption like Peter Jackson's LOTR that captures the tone and heart of the story in a cinematically beautiful way. If you are not a Potter fan, you will not regret watching this film because this is a masterpiece from John Williams' music to superb acting from each of its actors to wonderful direction from its director.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
612,theevilartist1,Another Lousy Adaptation,2,30 December 2006,"Okay first off I am a Harry Potter fan but first and foremost I am a movie fan. This said I gave what I believe was a fair grade. Let's start off as why this movie got a 2.Now I could sit here and go on and on about how the movie isn't like the book but to be fair I will only go into this briefly. Like it's previous installments the movie has omitted some well known characters in the series Peeves still hasn't appeared in this movie nor has Cho, Harry's dream girl, so I was quite since Peeves adds the comedic effect and Harry's love for Cho adds a little more depth to his character. Then there's the typical character and plot change often seen in this particular series of films and the plot holes are numerous. Plus the character portrayal left much to be desired.Now on to the aspects of the film. Like all the previous installments this film once again features a cast of well known British actors which, while they are some of my favorites, are way too many. A few unknowns would be welcome on the scene. The scenery has changed to give it a darker setting despite this fact it didn't help the film too much. Daniel Radcliff, as our heroic boy wizard, didn't really do too much for me in terms of his portrayal. Yes the boy does look like Harry as I and quite a few others imagined him, at least that's as close as the physical interpretation is going get. The acting on his part is lacking as always. I don't know it could just be me but he only seems to have a few expressions and he never seems to display the right emotion. Ron was good though I don't agree that he should be reduced to a sniveling coward so much. The kid needs to have some guts. Hermione yeah I think she did well enough. The others did what was and has become expected of their portrayals not much to say there. I however did not like Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black.Look I know the guy has been in Azkaban for years but Sirius was a cool kind of guy who had not done what others thought he did. That's what was so special about Sirius even though the man spent years in a place where even the darkest wizards go insane not even the Dementors could get him because Sirius was without guilt. Instead in this movie what few times he's seen he's portrayed as borderline insane like he's just about to go over the edge. Not Mr. Oldman's best performance by a long shot. There was Thewlis' portrayal of Lupin. For the most part the man did a moderate portrayal of the werewolf/teacher. Then again his performance was one of the better ones of the film.There's that repetitive score that was good in the first film but by now is heard in every single scene. Then there's the monotonous CGI effects that appear so frequently in this film series. Sure Buckbeak was well done and was one of the higher points of the film. This said the CG werewolf was not ferocious or threatening but instead seemed sickly and underfed. The Dementors would have struck fear in me if I was four years old and every other computer generated character looked oddly deformed in someway.My list of dislikes could go further so time to rap it up. All around if this movie weren't based on a book series I might have liked it more. But since it is there isn't really much boosting it up. If you've read the books avoid this and all previous and future HP films. If you've seen the previous movies and liked them then I guess you'll be easier to please with this one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

614,python-c,The Worst Yet,1,2 August 2007,"This movie had me really excited, as the Prisoner of Azkaban was my favourite book. But in the end I was really, honestly disappointed.Another reviewer claimed that this was the best Harry Potter yet. I claim the exact opposite-- I think it's the worst. It was horribly shortened, and many scenes were altered to fit Hollywood standards. Practically everything was turned into a joke, even the things that really shouldn't have been.I also think that the appointment of this new Dumbledore was a dreadful mistake. While he certainly redeems himself a bit in the fifth movie, in this one, he was the opposite of what I imagined of his character (albeit, it was much worse in the fourth). He was hardly the gentle, soft-spoken, graceful wizard I had envisioned, or that was portrayed in the 1st and 2nd movies, which, in my opinion, were the best.The scene in the Shrieking Shack was summarized sloppily and altogether too quickly. Exemplified in this scene was the worst portrayal of Sirius Black we could have hoped for. Sure, we knew he was fervent, anxious to kill Pettigrew and get revenge, but we didn't think of him as insane. And the scene with Lupin turning into a werewolf--they added and awful bit with Sirius telling Lupin something like ""This is who you truly are, this heart, in here!"", which is hardly the kind of thing you'd be saying as your best friend transformed into a deadly monster.I eventually just turned the movie off. I couldn't watch it anymore. I was awfully disappointed after the stunning accuracy of the first two films. In those, the casting was spot-on, and the accuracy was impressive; here, the casting left a lot to be desired, as did the acting of those who were decent in both the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione seemed eerily preppy (""Does my hair really look like that from the back?""), Dumbledore I've already criticised, and Hagrid--quite the perfect match in all of the other movies--seemed to fall apart in this one. Even Malfoy, who was perfect before, was made into a stereotypical bully here, not the deeper character portrayed in the books.All in all, this was the worst Harry Potter to date, and I would only suggest it to hardcore HP fans or those who are entirely un-picky when it comes to accuracy.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
615,the_goldy_gopher,"My two word summary - ""It's Awful""",2,30 November 2004,"Each movie in the Harry Potter series (and of course the books they are based upon) is about the experience of Harry Potter and his two closest friends as they attend Hogwarts. His experience is based upon a wonderfully detailed back-story and interaction with dozens of students, staff, and faculty at the school. I think that Alfonso Cuarón missed the whole idea of the experience at Hogwarts when filming this movie. In the end with the way the movie is cut and the story presented the movie is just a bad horror film for teenagers; a number of people compared this movie to the Goonies, which is a lot better movie. I have read that there was a stated goal to produce a two hour long movie rather than three hour long movies of the first two. I have never understood the idea of shortening a good movie, as a fan I would have seen a better movie no matter what its length three or four times in a theater, rather than just once; there are a number of missing scenes in the movie that would go along way to improving this movie. While there is of course an argument on whether you would almost have to start over to improve this incredible awful movie. Alfonso Cuarón (and others involved in production) was in my opinion in love with the stupid special effects during the movie that did not advance the story line; especially with so much of the back-story missing. The transition between the seasons was interesting, but they took too long, and after watching the deleted scenes they could have been longer. The moving pictures in the frames became a distraction, was the giraffe really necessary? The Knight's Bus scene was way to long for the length of this movie, and the talking head was annoying, and the idea that Harry Potter could lie was entirely skipped. I was upset they changed Harry time at the Leaky cauldron, skipped the scene with McGonagell and Hermione, and I could go on and on. Almost all of the foreshadowing in the book was cut from the movie; however J.K. Rowling indicates that two scenes foreshadow later movies. All in all a dismal movie another movie like this could greatly affect the status of the franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
616,dwils22876,The Worst of the Harry Potter Films,3,13 June 2004,"Chris Columbus where are you?!  Unlike the first two Harry Potter films this film was made only for those who have read the book.  It is close to impossible to understand exactly what the heck is going on if you have not previously read the book.  There are so many important plot pieces left open that it's mind boggling! The movie does a POOR job at explaining them and a poor job telling it to the audience which is the main goal of any movie.How does Sirius Black, Professor Lupin and Peter Pettigrew fit in with Harry's parents?  The films says they were friends, but does not convey the true closeness of the group.  Nor does it explain why Snape hates Harry so much. How does Professor Lupin and Sirius Black know about the use of the map and who were Wormtail, Prongs, Padfoot, and Mooney?  If you read the book you'll know the answer but you'll never get it seeing this film.  Why does Harry see a deer when he summons his spell?  With the exception of the three main characters the rest of this talented cast is either under used or misused.  Michael Gambon does not hold a lighted wand to Richard Harris's Dumbledore and is a lot less believable as the senior wizard.  Over all this a great book that has been transfigured into a horrible movie. We can only hope that Mike Newell, the director of the next Harry Potter film (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), reclaims the magic that was lost on this film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Even though I still miss Richard Harris. The young actors, in this movie, acting abilities have improved immensely. The special effects were great. The story was great.

618,rastack-1,Editing cut out important detail,8,6 June 2004,"This excellent film was easy to follow since we had read the book with our kids. However, had I been the director (not much chance of that) I definitely would have explained the meaning, on the Maurauder's Map, of ""Mooney (Lupin), Wormtail (Petegrew), Padfoot (Black), and Prongs (Potter's dad, James). The context/depth of their friendship was absent as was the significance of Harry's Patronis - the stag. The degree of Petegrew's betrayal can't be fully appreciated without that background. Without the book, following the reltionships would have been confusing. Superb, even touching, scenes of Harry having several discussions with Proff.

619,KamakahiTotoro808,I don't believe in one line summaries...,8,12 June 2004,"So let me try to explain my feelings about this movie.(Spoilers ahead. You have been warned.)The Good: With regards to the tangible changes to the movie (the new geography of Hogwarts, the costumes, and the special effects) this movie receives excellent marks. I heartily agree with the assumption that since Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up, then so must their movies. The new clock tower to the campus is spooky, and will most certainly help in future films. The costumes are not as drastic as I had thought, and I must say that both the Dementors and Buckbeak the Hippogriff looked very good on screen, and are pretty much what I had envisioned from the books. While some have complained about the Dementors' ""soul-sucking"" effect, I found it a very good visual representation from the books. It was also nice to finally see the Marauder's Map on screen, and it was close to what I had envisioned from the books.The Bad: Sadly, it is with the deletions of material from the book to the movie that I must give failing marks. While the film focuses mainly on the issue of Harry's maturity into adolescence, I felt that at some points, perhaps TOO MUCH focus was on Harry. Also, some much needed exposition was necessary to answer various questions. For example: Black, Lupin, Pettigrew, Harry's parents (James and Lily) and Snape all knew each other because they were classmates at Hogwarts. The problem is that only those who had read the books beforehand would know that, and truly appreciate the scene in the Shrieking Shack, where Pettigrew is revealed. Another problem for changing something mid-way: Since these movies are supposed to complement each other, then the changes made here will have to be carried on in future films. And with regards to the argument about eliminating the back story of the Marauder's map, with the intent of revealing that information in future movies... Well, what if it isn't?A personal comment: I must say that the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies did a much better job of explaining character relationships for fans and non-fans of the books they were based on.Overall: Despite its inherent flaws, I must say that I found this movie entertaining. This film was made with fans of the books in mind, and it would be remiss of me not to stress that you should read the book beforehand to appreciate what you will see on screen.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It had a lot more humor, better filming, and yes, almost every single guy was A LOT hotter! Malfoy, Harry, Ron, the Weasley twins... Need I mention more? I think in some ways this movie was better but in other ways it wasn't. One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't as much music in the background and it didn't follow the books as much as the first two did. There were also a lot of scary scenes. The first two were okay for little kids but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one! I'm even debating whether to take my 9 year old sister or not!

621,Lucasio_Morthill,How to turn in a great book into a bad movie,5,1 August 2005,"Many people have done it before, ruin a great book by making a film about it, but this is by far one of the worst book movies ever. I love the Harry Potter books, every single one of them has a sort of magic that's very rare, a magic that both kids and adults like. The movies on the other hand, are a totally different story.The first movie was, well, OK, it wasn't bad, but it was no Lord of the Rings. The second one was a bit worse, but still, fun to watch, but the third, my god what were they thinking when making this movie?My thought is that they took the book, took some elements from it, the ending, the beginning, and some other small things that affected the story line and rewrote a completely new book from there on, because almost everything has been done differently. Now this could be a good thing, if the book wasn't the best Harry Potter book and virtually impossible to improve.So what has gone wrong you wonder, well, nearly everything. It starts at scene one, where harry blows up his aunt, the book didn't say she flew away and was never to be seen. And so it goes on, Harry doesn't spend weeks in London, now it's only a day, we don't see him, Hermione and Ron going shopping in Diagon Alley, and Harry finds out about Black in a totally different way.And the trend goes on, most things changing slightly, but some major events changing big time.One thing that probably annoyed me the most, was the ending, it sucked with a capital S. Harry get's his new broom and flies off. What, but didn't Black give that to him halfway his year, and didn't he won the quidditch season with it. Yes, but apparently not in this movie, in this movie there is no quidditch, except for the first match. In this movie, Harry is just scared of the dementors and that's the reason he's learning the Patronus charm. But why should he be, the dementors aren't allowed at school grounds by Dumbledore, so he has nothing to fear. I think they just wanted to squeeze the broom into the movie, and by doing so, ruining in ending.Now, if the story was all that went wrong, that would be one thing, but there are so many things, bad acting, bad lighting, bad casting (Emma Thompson never convinced me as Trelawney), David Thewlis wasn't bad, but good no. The only one who really convinced me was Gary Oldman. I really saw him as Sirius Black. Of the three main players, Rupert Grint was the best, Emma Watson wasn't bad either, Radcliffe, how in gods name he became Potter will always remain a mystery to me. But this was his worst acting performance by far.And so what do we have after 2 hours of film. Well, I really don't know, if you know the story line, the movie is entertaining, but nothing more than that, and if you don't know the story line, you never will, because everything is rushed into. It's a big book, and they fitted it in 2 hours, but that won't work. Nobody cares if it's a 3 hour movie, I didn't care with movies like LotR, and I wouldn't care with Harry Potter, even better, I'd love a 3 hour movie, but make it a Potter movie.What the makers tried was to make a film both enjoyable for the Potter fans who had read the book at least once, and to the lesser fans as well, who had only seen the movies. And this movie is a disappointment to both. The real fans will see a ruining of a brilliant book, and the movie fans will see a movie without a storyline. I'm really sorry I have to rate a Potter movie like this, even more because the third book is still my favorite one. But that's how it is, hopefully part 4 will be better, otherwise they might try to get Peter Jackson to direct the movie, because otherwise, I have little hope.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
622,The_katrankin,Cuaron takes a new approach,9,14 June 2004,"With Alfonso Cuaron on board as the new director for the third Harry Potter movie, the movies start to make a turn-around. While Columbus's movies were good, he adapted every single part of the book into the movie, which caused them to be good adaptions, but without any original material. Cuaron's new approach allows this movie to have an equal balance of original material and adaptation.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins with Harry having a bad moment with the horrible Aunt Marge; and by ""bad moment"", I mean inflating Aunt Marge until she floats away. Harry then runs away, getting to the Leaky Cauldron by the Knight Bus (a purple triple decker bus) and begins his third year at Hogwarts. But things don't get better there. Harry learns that Sirius Black, who was sent to Azkaban jail for the murder of 13 people and the betrayal of Harry's parents, has just escaped from jail and is out looking for him. This causes the Ministry of Magic to send out the guards of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts for Black. However, the guards of Azkaban are actually Dementors (soul-sucking hooded monsters), and they are just as dangerous to Harry as they are to Black.New teachers include a mediocre Divination teacher, Proffesor Sibyll Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and an all new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Proffesor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), who teaches Harry how to fend off Dementors. Even Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) becomes the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher, and introduces Harry to Buckbeak, a half-horse and half-eagle creature called a Hippogriff. Micheal Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Proffesor Albus Dumbledore, and while he acts a little less strict, he still captures the spirit that Harris had.Even though POA has a darker mood (the sky's always overcast and the ground is usually wet), it is definitely the best movie so far. It left out unnecessary scenes in the book and added more humor and extra parts. I would give it five stars out of five, but it does have its problems.Yes, POA left out unnecessary scenes, but it also left out important scenes. They also put a lot of things out of order, and a few of the scenes seem very rushed. I don't want to go into detail because I would spoil the movie if I did, but this may be a little annoying for people who have just read the book.Overall, though, Cuaron's adaptation is still very good, while not being TOO faithful to the book. I just have to say this: I can't wait till ""Goblet of Fire""!****1/2 out of ***** Rated PG for startling moments, creature peril, and mild swearing",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The characters were not fleshed out at all, none of the child actors can act (They should have been replaced for this movie...children that can kind of act when they're young do not always mature into great actors in their teens), and it seemed to me that if the viewer came in with no prior knowledge of the Harry Potter, they would be lost, and what's more, I doubt they would care.

625,papilion78,"True to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter",7,1 December 2004,"I think this third installment of the HP series is remarkable in that, with a consistent and contagious dark atmosphere, it brings out the psychological dimension of Harry's adventure, and illustrates that his struggle in his own psyche is as fierce as that on conventional battlegrounds.Cuaron¡¯s rather idiosyncratic vision as a director has instilled this movie with a memorable artistic identity, hereby making it something considerably deeper than an ordinary kid¡¯s adventure flick. Surely the action sequences are eye-catching, but what I've enjoyed more is the in this film is its suggestive cinematography, and the drama tension among the characters. Ron and Hermione's bickering is more naturalistic, and gives just the right amount of hint for an impending romance.I would hope that Tom Felton kept his hair glued, but, well, he is still the definitive Draco Malfoy. Daniel Radcliff has progressed a lot as an actor---in fact, I think he has a more difficult task since Harry is in many aspect a more interiorized character in the book, and I hope that Daniel may stand up to the challenge when Harry gradually comes to recognize the dangers lurking in his inner abyss in the fourth and fifth book. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape is simply divine. I am also very excited at the addition of two superb actors in the Potter series---David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius. I'm refraining from giving away too much here,but how breathtaking when extremely intense scenes involving Snape, Lupin, and Sirius are delivered by these impeccable performers!The visuals of this movie are stunning as usual. I particularly like the Wimping Willows seasonal change scenes, and Buckbeak's flight. I am also glad that Williams has made a new set of music for the movie, more haunting,dark,suspenseful,yet at the same times grotesquely humorous---exactly the right colors of the magical world that Rowling created. Of course, this movie also has serious flaws---yes, I'm talking about the failure to fully introduce the Marauders. I think it would only take five minutes more to integrate this necessary background story, without which non-readers are left very confused about the plot, and fans of the books are severely disappointed.There are also some glaringly tacky and out-of-character moments, such as Ron echoing Snape in calling Hermione an insufferable know-it-all. I hope in future movies Ron, Harry's best friend, can stop being a mere comic relief, and present a more in-depth character revealing his loyalty, kind heart,and,even more interestingly, momentary jealousy toward Harry. Despite the flaws, I still enjoyed the movie tremendously. It is true to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter.I only hope that the forth and fifth films would be even better---for, hey, Rowling's books deserve that.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

627,asiangirl93,Worst HP movie ever!,5,9 July 2005,"I was truly disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to it but the movie was a total mess. People might say Alfonso Cuaron 'got the real idea of Harry Potter' but the truth is, he didn't at all get the idea of Harry Potter. I must say Chris Columbus was much, much more better. He got the real vision of the world of Harry Potter.There were a lot of things that were messed up in the movie. In the Leaky Cauldron, you must have noticed that the bartender swished his hand and the chair went up and the fact that there was a wizard waving his finger around a spoon. Well, that's not supposed to happen since Wizards and witches in Harry Potter books can only perform magic using wands, the fingers and the hand are useless. Ron did not have a crush for Madame Rosmerta and the Three Broomsticks was not suppose to be closed. Lupin looks bit of than what I imagined him to look like. Hermione doesn't have bushy hair, which is just simply wrong cuz she's suppose to have bushy hair only on the fourth book, during the Yule Ball she made her hair looked sleek and shiny, not the third book. And by the way, Lupin in this movie sounded like he had a crush on Lily Potter. The script writer had said that that was an assumption but the way he is saying that he thinks Remus has a crush on Lily is wrong. They are creating a movie that shows the third book, not assumptions. The bad thing is people are going to assume that Remus does have a crush on lily. Well if it's correct, it's not a matter anymore but if it isn't, well, that's is going to be a problem for non-Harry Potter readers. Neville is thin, for goodness's sake! He's suppose to be plum and fat, not thin!

629,zero-hour-ii,A new style for a great series.,10,11 November 2005,"This third installment in the Harry Potter series sports a new style, much different from the previous two films' style. It turns the family-friendly franchise into a new, teenager-friendly offering, complete with teen angst, anger, and puppy love. The films are growing with their audience.The plot line of the film is fairly simple, but gets VERY complicated toward the end: Harry is entering his third year at Hogwarts, and he's going with the knowledge that there is a killer on the loose looking for him: Sirius Black. Mr. Weasley makes Harry swear that, no matter what, he won't go looking for Black. But, to quote Harry, why would he go looking for someone who wants to kill him? The mystery is solved in this excellently crafted fantasy film that combines good plot, artistic cinematography, and an excellent score from John Williams.The film hardly has any shortcomings. The actor who replaces Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, is in my opinion better as Dumbledore, but some people may not share my views. Also, the plot can get quite confusing towards the end, but it all makes sense by the end of the film if you've been paying attention. None of these faults are bad enough to affect the film much, though. It's an absolutely outstanding cinematic achievement, and it's worth a buy for sure. Go get it now! 10/10 from zero-hour-ii",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
630,Costashead,"Be a movie, or be a book. Not this half-assed thing.",6,11 June 2004,"Effects are amazing, it's a fun spectacle.That being said: Yes, it's a freaking huge book, and there's absolutely no way to get the whole thing into the movie. But the choices they made... Fans of the book will be disappointed by the crucial plot elements that get left out, and people who've never read the book will have no idea what the hell is going on. But if the critics are any indication, people who like auteur directors apaprently will not care that this movie has plot holes you could drive the Hogwarts Express through.For example, if you haven't read the book and you've seen this, you might be asking:How does Lupin recognize the map? Who are Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs? What the hell was that stag thing I saw for 2 seconds? What just happened?Obviously, I'm a dork fan of the book, but when I see a movie adaptation I don't expect the book. I expect a movie that can stand alone, have a coherent plot and fleshed-out characters. I'd rather they cut out even more plot elements from the book, which became meaningless in the jumble of events here anyway, and devoted more time to developing the few things that were left, like the characters and relationships. And that freeze frame -- just... don't.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
631,LordXenu,A solid continuation of the series,8,16 June 2004,"Once again, I sold my soul to Satan and took in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, adapted from the third novel of J. K. Rowling's blockbuster series of juvenile fantasy.Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Wizarding and Wizardry is about to begin. After Harry loses his temper during dinner and causes his abusive Aunt Marge to inflate and float into the night, he decides that leaving is preferable to apologizing, packs his things, and heads out. On the street, Harry is picked up by a wizard bus that takes him to London and the Leaky Cauldron. En route he learns that notorious murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban. To ""protect"" the students in case Black should come around, Hogwarts is now guarded by Dementors, the ghoulish and amoral guards of Azkaban. Dementors feed on human happiness, and unfortunately for Harry, they seem to take a liking to him. Thanks to Harry eavesdropping while under his invisibility cloak, we learn that Black is his godfather and his father's best friend, and that he betrayed Harry's parents to the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry resolves to have his revenge.After Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chris Columbus gave up the director's chair to Alfonso Cuaron. It shows. Stylistically this movie often differs dramatically from its predecessors. Visually the film is darker and more Gothic, as much of the action takes place outdoors, at night, or in the rain. We get to see more of the Hogwarts castle and the surrounding environs. Some of these establishing shots are stunning. Unfortunately some of the new visuals also offend established continuity, but not too badly.The acting is pretty solid. The three principal actors are maturing, and so are their characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry is taller and broader-shouldered. The rubber-faced Rupert Grint plays a more restrained Ron Weasley this time around. For some reason Emma Watson's Hermione Granger is played as more of a tomboy than a by-the-book student, but she's not terribly out of character.The redoubtable Robbie Coltrane returns as the slow-witted grounds keeper Hagrid, now promoted to teach Care of Magical Creatures. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore; while the physical resemblance is there, Harris' kindly-grandfather interpretation of Dumbledore is gone. Alan Rickman again masters the sinister Professor Snape. However, Dame Maggie Smith is terribly underused as Professor McGonagall, having all of two or three lines in the entire film. David Thewlis joins the cast as Professor Remus Lupin, the Defense Against Dark Arts Professor du jour. The almost unrecognizable Emma Thompson chews scenery beautifully as Professor Trelawney, the flaky fraud who teaches Divination. Gary Oldman, who excels at portraying characters who are on the border of insanity, is a natural for Sirius Black, though he too is hard to recognize under his heavy beard.The Prisoner of Azkaban's two predecessors were straight, mostly faithful, adaptations of the source material. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but this time minimalism carries the day, and much of the novel's superfluous material disappears. Gone, for the most part, are classes and the Quidditch season, apart from one match that is crucial to the plot. Hagrid holds one Care of Magical Creatures class to introduce Buckbeak the Hippogriff; we don't get to see the students learning about Flobberworms or Salamanders. This undoubtedly rubs the Potter purists the wrong way, but it does make for a tighter plot. On the other hand, some of the deleted scenes provide information that explain the scenes that are left, and so a little more padding would have been nice.Many of the novel's crucial clues are revealed through exposition or dialogue. Here they are often shown visually. We are shown that Professor Lupus' greatest fear is a full moon. (Why?) Harry acquires a magic map authored by Messrs. Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, but their true identities are not revealed, nor is the reason Lupus knows the spell to reveal the map's secrets. But the answers are right there in plain sight, if you are paying attention. It's nice to watch a movie that doesn't insult your intelligence by assuming you have to be told everything up front.Final note: Take the time to sit through the end credits. Not that there are any surprises or secrets revealed, but they are well crafted and have a touch of humour.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
632,yuppie-flu,iced flowers,9,14 June 2004,"I have never seen a movie of Cuarón before, but it was definitely a good choice to let him direct the third movie. What Columbus did was a boring and annoyingly long illustration of the books, not noticing that the passionate Harry Potter readers had grown older, so the audience expected more than a nice and sweet Disney-like entertainment. Cuarón changed the whole look of the set and gave the characters a chance to play. He also used a lot of nice shots full of metaphoric quality. There are a lot of detail shots with huge parts of the picture out of focus, e.g freezing flowers. One of the best and innovative things he did, was to give symbolic materiality to a camera, that doesn't exist with respect to digital image generation. There is a viewing view (Sobchack) that flies through windows, the gigantic clockwork, ... . It is the best Harry Potter picture so far and I hope Newell will follow this path.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
633,christoph-ostermann,"Thank you, Mr. Cuaron",10,5 June 2004,"This is the best of the three Potter-Movies. Cuaron leaves out unimportant details and completely concentrates on the story. The Dursley-Sequence is filmed like an Independent-Movie with the hand-camera, while the scene when Sirius appears the first time as a wolf seems to be part of a Suspense-Horror-Movie. There are no more special effects than necessary - I don't wanna know what George Lucas would have made of it. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson get better and better, but the greatest attraction of the movie is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin - already now my favorite for the Supporting-Role-Oscar. The Soundtrack is another Williams-Masterpiece, which contains a waltz, freejazz, a choir, medieval sounds and a typical Williams-Theme (Buckbeak's Flight). Cuaron even makes references to ""Titanic"" and ""The Hulk"". A brilliant movie, which you can see several times without getting bored.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

635,rachelbotros,A MUST watch,10,14 March 2021,This is one of my favourite Harry Potter films. I am a huge potter head and I can tell you that this movie made me that way. I loved the first two of course but this one was special. It really sets the stage for the next movies to come and turns the mood into the dark setting it needs to be. The actors are really developing who they are at this point as well. And of course Gary Oldman is in it so how do you not love it!!

A colossal amount of money wasted for this???? There is not even an attempt to explain the story to the viewers, its just thrown in their faces. I stil dont know what to think of the silly dementors, and the main story involving Potter's family's murder.
And the magic is just misssssinnnnnggg. it's so conscpicuous in its absence, it hurts. You just dont care for the characters, and what happens to them. All you see are snazzy special effects, which is no big deal. I mean even a spy kids movie has that!

I was a little wary, having read some mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Though I had just finished rereading the book and knew what was coming, I found myself startled more than a few times.  What great special effects!  The three actors portraying Harry, Ron, and Hermione have grown quite a bit as actors and have reached a certain level of maturity that is very evident in this film.  For those who haven't read the book, it may be hard to understand some things.  SPOILER:  For instance, someone who didn't read the book wouldn't know what Sirius Black was talking about when he asked Professor Lupin if he had taken his potion that day.  They wouldn't know that Professor Snape was the one who prepared the potion.  There are a lot of things like that left out of the movie, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.  I would have gladly spent a couple more hours in the theater if they had wanted to expand the movie to fill in those gaps because I didn't want it to be over so soon.  I'll just have to see it again! and again! and again!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
638,mmossa9999,"Alfonso Cauron, go to hell",1,13 May 2007,"Sorry to those who liked this film but i have to say that this film was disappointing. there were more bad things about this film than the good things. The good things about about this film were: 1. it was darker than the first two. they outlined the story in a dark way due to its background but that is not an enough of an excuse.2. i guess the actors were maturing and i will give them credit there and there was humour from them.3.the punch from Hermionethe negatives: 1.they took out a lot of important parts out as if they never existed. they took out key chapters like the owl post, the Qiudditch final, the owl post again. perhaps the only one i would edit is the Gryffindor vs raven claw otherwise it might drag on.2. the film itself was inaccurate. even with the chapters they kept in was not explained enough. they didn't talk much about the marauders map and the creators which is the key information for the 5th book and also they never explained why Sirius black is an animagus and that his dad was an animagus. they did not talk about how lupin was a werewolf, professor Trelawnys prediction was not explained enough. she was supposed to mention that not only will Voldemort return soon, that worm-tail will return and harry's shocking future. when it came to the important parts, it was either that it was skipped or rushed. in the book it explained the painting was teared and the fat lady was injured but in the film the fat lady was not injured and acted rather wimpish than shocked which also reminds me about Ron screaming that he saw a knife and no one believed him. this was not in the film. the hourglass was not explained enough either.3. this film wasn't really taken seriously. you would expect this whole film to be so dark you would be thrilled a lot more than the first two. the film seemed a bit like a young kids film and they portrayed malfoy rather annoying than a villain. 4. the werewolf looked liked a skinny greyhound. it said clearly in the book that it was large hairy and should have looked much more ferocious like the ones in van Helsing.5. what happened to the locations, Hagrids hut is elsewhere and the whomping willow is in the wrong place. if they are going to make a film based on a film it must be accurate.6. some of the important parts were mentioned at other point like the fire-bolt which was originally explained in the middle and in the film its at the end.7. the patronus charm was supposed to shape like a stag not a shield8. they may have matured but still could have improved and stop acting childish like Ron and Malfoy.my theory about this film being currently rated 7.7 is that first of all the book is known to be one of the worlds most famous novels ever. because of that a lot of people who haven't read the book would be curious about the film to know what makes it good. As a film, this can be quite good which explain why it is highly rated. but if you read the book and watch this, you will understand the disappointment. it has a darker mood but should have done much better.we all have our opinions, we are free to choose what we want but this I'm afraid is not what you would hope for if you are a fan. i myself thought that this would be the film of 2004 but it failed miserably.P.S Alfonso Cauron directed such a kiddish film called a little princess! what does that tell you!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

He has characters acting out of character and crammed the movie together without sufficient explanation or character development. Most of his ""cute"" bits were just plain stupid.I read that he got the director of the fourth movie to do the entire book in one movie. If this is true, then he not only ruined the third movie, but the entire rest of the series. Boiling in oil would be too kind in this case.Oh well, give it a decade and the remake will be out.

641,lostdreamer,Lacking substance and so much more (spoilers),3,13 June 2004,"I've refrained from reviewing this movie for awhile now, but I an finally going to put my two cents in. This may be rather long, but I have a lot to say. I watched this film the first time and absolutely despised it, along with the 3 other people watching it with me. I decided to have another go at it now that my expectations of the movie were blown to smithereens, never to be repaired. The second time, I enjoyed it a little more, but I realized that I was watching the film now as if it was any other film, that didn't have predecessors and could stand alone. This, in and of itself, disturbed me, since the HP movies are meant to flow together and seem like each other. This isn't just any other movie, this was the third part of a many movie installment. I'd have to say explaining the meaning of the story is very important and the elements that would truly have explained this story were cut. I didn't feel this movie was magical in the ""Harry Potter"" way. I felt like I was watching a bunch of teenagers run around and solve a mystery with a little bit of abacadabra thrown in. My main irritation at this film was the strange casting and lack of characters and continuity. Where were all of the characters that we had grown to love in the first two films (and the books)? Instead, we had to endure Cuaron throwing in all these new faces without explaining who they are (if they are the recasts of old characters? or just random people). Cuaron was pretty obvious in the fact that he was trying to broaden the nationalities of the characters. (sine the first two were all white people basically). However, he did this with no explanation and he pushed all the regular characters out of the movie entirely. I can't tell you how many people ask, ""who's that big black kid?""There were also some VERY important items that were left out of the movie or not explained well enough at all. The marauders map is the most important item. They never tell you who really made the map and who ""Padfoot, Mooney, Prongs, and Wormtail"" are. They also never explain why Professor Snape has the grudge against Harry. It would have taken an extra 10 minutes to explain these details, but instead we had to endure too much time on the bus with the talking head and the weirdly ""Titanic"" scene with the hippogriff.Where were the classes? I think that was the most fun aspect of the first two films. They were entertaining and made you feel part of the life of Hogwarts. The entire film was rushed and it didn't get me nearly as involved with the characters emotions and their lives as the first two films did. I remember after watching the film the first time I turned around to my friend and said ""I waited a year and half for this???""The whole meaning of the third book was ""Everything isn't as it appears."" It also delves into Harry's feelings of his parents and of his friends. This movie, as much as it was touted to supposedly show, did not truly emphasize Harry's feelings of his parents. I mean, he was supposed to be really upset about the Dementors showing him more of his parents deaths. This movie barely skimmed into that area, except to briefly mention it here and there.Cuaron was a great visual effects person. He knows how to visually stimulate and create a ""great"" film in that regards. However, his editing and his deletions were not so great. Watching the first two films made me want to be part of that world, be in the classes learning how to do spells, going to dinner in the great hall, hanging out trying to find the mysteries of Hogwarts. In this film, all of that was lacking. Everyone is going off about how horrible Columbus was for the films, but he is what made it great. There must have been some appeal for the films that kept people coming back for more, right? However, considering the fact that POA is in it's second weekend and it's not selling out anymore and not even coming close shows something about this movie. The first two sold out for many consecutive weekends and lasted quite some time. I fear that this film probably will last maybe until mid-July. I had barely heard of Harry Potter before the first film. After I watched that movie, I went out and bought the series. I became a die-hard fan of the series. I loved the first two films. Yes, they had glitches, but all movies have glitches. However, after viewing POA I don't feel the same way about the movies. After the second movie came out and went away, I eagerly anticipated the next film right from the get-go. After this movie has come out and is still out, I have no anticipation, in fact I'm left with dread about the upcoming movies. I thank god that Cuaron is not directing the next film. I just hope the next director doesn't sell out to Hollywood as this one did.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Again, good enough to see once, maybe even twice!If I do have one gripe, I would have liked it to be a bit longer, if for the simple reason that they could have given more time to the text material. Of course, the Goblet of fire (the next in the series) will probably have even more of the source material cut out of it for timing purposes.

644,ephoratus,Decent Harry Potter Movie,9,26 December 2010,"**SPOILER ALERT** First I would like to apologize for my bad English and possible misspelling. Anyway ... As so many people before me I have read all the books of the Harry Potter Franchise. This particular movie captures almost everything that is essential to the story. I must say that even though late Richard Harris was an outstanding actor (Gladiator, The Count of Monte Cristo ...) I still feel that Michael Gambon is better as Dumbledore. I certainly like the new outfit - Dubledore seems much more elegant. You can notice that Hogwarts is also changed and looks much less fairy tale-like. It is logical that it's practically impossible to capture all the book scenes in one movie. What bothers me most was the scene in the Shrieking shack. It's quite different from the one in the book and I just can't understand why. I think it would be much better if Lupin returned the wands to three young wizards after disarming them and after that Sirius and him would start to explain the real story. Those may be details but in my opinion important ones. Bottom line - this movie is great and certainly worth watching. One of the best Harry Potter movies. I give it 9 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
645,calebwilliams,So much better than Columbus,7,1 June 2004,"*Some (very limited) spoilers*I would seriously question the aesthetic judgment of anyone who didn't immediately see that Cuaron's Harry Potter 3 is in a different league altogether from Columbus's weak and humorless efforts to realize books one and two. It's not just that the overall look and feel of film three is so much more convincing; even in the small details, the superiority of Cuaron as a director is obvious. For example, where Columbus tries to gain a sense of the end of term at Hogwarts by inserting some ploddingly conventional ""Christmassy scenes"" (accompanied by some sickeningly jingly music from John Williams), Cuaron treats us to a much more subtle shot - Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies across a beautifully composed wide-angle shot, and as the camera follows her, the landscape behind her gradually passes from gloomy late autumnal green/grey mountains to wintry snow. The effect is altogether more mysterious. Furthermore, Cuaron's grasp of cinematic language is so much more complex and assured than the rather basic vision of Columbus. From the very beginning of the film, we have references to the passage of time, a crucial theme of book 3: the large pendulum of an enormous clock swings menacingly in a school corridor, we see Harry's face through the face of a clock way before the final time-turning episode, while models of planetary movements set the action in a more cosmic frame. Equally, the issue of identity so central to the plot of Azkaban, is foregrounded by Cuaron's use of reflection - what better way to signal the fact that Harry is beginning to grapple with the mystery of his past and the absence of his parents? Thus, the doublings of the final sequence, where Harry has to avoid his other self while he rescues his godfather, are foreshadowed by shots of Harry's face reflected in the darkened window of a train and in the rippling water of the lake. Cuaron also brings a much more vivid sense of humour to these movies than Columbus. The jokes in the first movies are often painfully laboured - one can't help feeling that Steve Kloves continues to miss the distinctive and colourful humour of Rowling's prose, in particularly her wonderful delineation of character. Cuaron is able to relieve this by inserting some visual humour - when Hagrid produces the hyppogriff, Harry finds himself ""volunteering"" only because the rest of the class have backed off in horror!That's not to say that the movie is perfect. Some of the CGI shots are wonderful (the hyppogriff looks amazing), but the werewolf is distinctly dodgy, and there aren't enough scary shots of the Dementors. I can't help feeling that Cuaron was hampered here by the need to get a PG certificate for a film which would perhaps ideally have been a 12A. Also, the script misses out incredibly important material - such as the connection between Harry's father and the marauder's map. This will only make the near-impossible task which faces Mike Newell more difficult - reducing book 4 to a two and a half hour movie is a gargantuan task in itself, without having to fill in gaps which book 3 should have covered!There are some tantalising clues here to the (yet unwritten) final books. A speech by Lupin on a bridge stresses the kindness of Harry's mother in precedence to the rule-breaking of his father. Will Harry's obsession with his Dad in the earlier books yield to a better understanding of his mother's history and sacrifice in the later novels? Such a twist would surely appeal to an author who began to write as a struggling single mother...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
646,melissaevans1972,Boring,5,4 September 2021,This movie could have been cut down to at least an half an hour.

647,The_Rogue_Phoenix,Disgracing a Noble Series,1,5 June 2004,"Harry Potter, the new rage of the century and turning new generations onto reading. Recently this beloved books have been transformed into motion pictures. Other than simple nitpicks the first films, depicting the first two novels in the series were tolerable. They are outlines of the plot and it is understandable why many things were cut and changed so as not to make a PG movie three hours long. Yesterday the new film reflecting the events of the third novel in the series was released and I must say that reviews from the Times to Newsweek are praising it, so it must be better than the satisfactory first two. This assumption is terribly wrong. The turning point of the series the Prisoner of Azkaban is, however unlikely, worse than its sister films. Somewhere at sometime they must've tossed the book out the window and started from scratch. Critical events to the plot were butchered and glazed over and some key points that are important in the future Harry Potter books are not even mentioned. The film went far too fast paced to give the viewer the same satisfaction given when reading the book itself. If you are planning on enjoying this film then I recommend not being a fan of the books or having read them at all. The only ones people who could sit down and watch this film without being purely disappointed are those who have never read the books and aren't planning on it soon. I must say this is absolutely the worst movie adaption and I plan on never seeing this movie ever again, for it has ruined one of the best books in the series.

Disappointments include, the werewolf and Dumbledore not being silly enough.

649,dawsonleery74,Very Good...finally,8,1 June 2004,"At least...something wicked this way comes! finally, a good movie from an Harry Potter books. I live in England at the moment and yesterday I had the possibility to see the pictures. Best things about it: THE DIRECTOR: finally someone that's not scared to change something from the book! Oh don't worry, not BIG changes but that movie isn't only a replicant of the book and this takes the possibility to see the director' s point of view. I don't hate the Columbus' movies but they're TOO stuck on the books! No personality was in the first two movies! THE ACTING: especially daniel Radcliffe, that was very believable, particularly in the anger scenes. Nothing to say about Emma and Rupert: they were good also in the others. Bravo to Gary Oldman and to Twhelis: their characters are well playe by both of them. THE EFFECTS: after the disappointing phoenix of the Chamber I was very frightened about Buckbeak but the special effects team doesn't disappoint me this time. They were also good in creating the Dementors, especially, in making some differences from the Ringwraiths of LOTR THE MUSIC: John Williams knows that something is changed in the story and in the characters so he was able to create some marvellous new theme. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY: the third book is the one where the story grow and it makes in a very dark way...and so the photography of the picture. A very little scene were illuminated by sun; it' s always grey or dark because the story becomes so! This has a reflection also in the location. Hogwarts wasn-'t never so scary! there are also some lacks; I prefer to see more Ron and hermione scenes, especially when the two were quarrel in the books: it's a clear signal of the changing of their feeling for the other one. I hope to explore a little bit more Hogsmeade but this isn't a great mistake. Maybe also the Lumos effect to end a scene is too abused by the director but also this one is a little lack. So enjoy the movie. I gave it an 8/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
650,AlericTX,"Pretty, but disappointing",5,4 June 2004,"The movie represents about 25% of the book. Much of it seems to presume that you have read the book. It is a sometimes choppy set of vignettes that barely cover the plot and provides the reader with some visual references for the book. The effects are gorgeous and I was pleasantly surprised by David Thewlis and Gary Oldman who brought Lupin and Black to life. I was also please by the Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, he brought a new strength the for the future.Gone, however, are the sense of community and most of the personal relationships of the book. There obviously wasn't time for them. This book and following books can not be properly contained in 2.5 hours.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
651,Glandros,Missing a little of the magic...,7,4 June 2004,"I went and saw ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" at midnight this morning. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while, having read the books. Unfortunately, the movie may be a bit of a disappointment to readers of the book. To anyone going to the movie without reading the books, it should still be great. But Cuaron left out a lot of smaller details that should have been involved, taking away a bit of the true charm of the stories... However, Cuaron did a great job at making the movie darker and grittier than the first two. At times, you forget that he's made changes because you're so caught up in the fantastic work on the movie. The acting is especially brilliant, since the kids have matured and we have some great new additions to the cast. Even though he doesn't have much screen time, Gary Oldman does a fantastic job as Sirius Black. Over all, the movie is very good, and I still suggest you see it. Though it may not have everything some readers hope for, it's still fantastic to see it on the screen.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
652,rsmkings,Watchable,8,25 November 2006,"I only watched the first two Harry Potter movies because I am in love with Emma Watson. I thought both movies were, otherwise, unwatchable. The Prisoner of Azkaban is different - it has a rational plot and believable adult story line. The star of this movie is Hermoine. She gets all the witty lines and all the good scenes. Emma Watson has improved greatly as an actress. It's truly hard to believe that she was only 12 when they first started filming it(13 in later scenes), she's incredibly mature for her age. Except for a preposterous grab of Harry's shirt in the tree swinging scene, a lack of fear in a werewolf scene, and a silly line regarding Hermoine's hair in a serious moment - the movie is quite believable within its magical boundaries. The time reversing sequences are exceptional with Hermoine taking charge. The intelligent plot twists are an unexpected welcome addition. It is a dark, beautiful, mysterious, and enjoyable film which even adults are welcome.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
653,the_mantra_man,"PoA has ""magic"" but ""not magical enough"" like the previous 2 ****Spoilers A-Plenty****",1,13 June 2004,"(6/10, out of which 4.5 goes to Buckbeak) How I looked forward to this movie cannot be summarized in a paragraph.. and then when I saw it...hmmm...this looked like a regular movie that had some magic but was in ""No way Magical enough"" as I quite liked the Chris Columbus presentation and his attention to detail in the previous two.. Don't get me wrong, Cuaron does a pretty good job but his style is more 'Artsy'.The first one was just cute.. and curiosity got the better of all of us in 'How is Harry Potter going to be depicted?' on screen.. CoS was more mature. Very occasionally it did seem that the movie's were long (if you have watched the DVD's enough) but they captured the essence of the books and there was a continuity to the scenes even for the non-Harry folk.I guess the length of the previous two movies must have made some kind of impact on the way PoA has been condensed. The pace of PoA was ""too fast"" compared to the previous two. From the initial scenes, Harry in his room to Aunt Marge to Harry leaving the Duddleys was < 10 minutes (or so it seemed). Magnolia Crescent and the 'black dog' was a trifle slow and then came the triple decker bus which was pretty brisk. The introduction of Sirius Black was not menacing enough by 'Stan' the conductor on the T.D. bus. Gary Oldman definitely deserved more (+5mins)*The entry into Leaky Cauldron and the inn-keeper 'Tom' (who looked like a character from 'Adams Family') swinging Harry off the street to meet 'Cornileus Fudge' (whose name is not even mentioned) was moderately funny. The re-union of Harry, Ron and Hermione lacks any friendship or bonding strength and 'Mr. Weaselys' warning to Harry isn't any more serious than watching 'Saturday Night Live'. I was particularly disappointed that 'AZKABAN' prison is just left to imagination (more like a passing comment) and the crime that Sirius committed, killing 13 with one curse & Pettigrew losing a pinky is NOT even shown in an abstract fashion (like Voldermot killing Harry's mother in HP1(+5mins)*The trip to Hogwarts with the train stranded and the Dementors/Lupins introduction was kinda neat (especially the fading of Harry - the soul screaming etc) but a gifted actor like David Thewlis could have had two more minutes at that point, especially when he explains what a dementor is (+2mins)* Cut, horseless carriages, cut, 'Choir group  very neat with Something Wicked This Way Comes', cut, 'Welcome Welcome' says DumbleDore, introduces Hagrid and Lupin. THE BEST PART - the Hippogriff and Hagrid's class, Harry's first flight on BUCKBEAK. The special effects team deserves an award for Buckbeak who IMHO was the SAVING GRACE or the HERO of the film, continued to impress me till the very end.Quidditch with the dementors swooping on Harry (very imaginatively handled) who falls and is going to be stopped by Dumbledore (very unimaginative after he starts falling as it fades dark and pop comes the next scene in the Hospital Wing). Divination room was much different than the book without the trap door etc although Emma Thompson was funny. Fat Lady was wasted. Sirius coming to kill Scabbers was cut. The FireBolt and its introduction without Hermione's suspicions looks 'hollow' in the end. Honeydukes (getting there was assumed) and Marauder's Map needed some more time (+5mins)*. Changing 'Three Broomsticks' to 'Hogs Head' was weird. Who is Sirius to Harry (as explained by Mcgonnagal) did not give enough detail (+5mins)*.Lupins class, Harry's scenes with Lupin, his encounter at night with 'Peter Pettigrew' in the courtyard and the last 40 mins with Lupin, Sirius, Snape and the dementors which is the CRUX of the movie was done very well although 'Who exactly is Peter Pettigrew' is not communicated clearly even in the climax. Hermione's Time Turner, which is confusing unless you have read the book could have used additional time (3mins)*All in all this movie would have made a 'magical' impact on me if we could have experienced those extra 30 minutes of detail to bring continuity in the film, but that was not to be. Maybe the DVD will be better.. I sure hope so.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
654,the_mantra_man,Azka-BAN this one!,1,11 July 2004,"(some spoilers) If this HP movie has to be reviewed in one word that would be 'PITIFUL'. I think I was very soft the first time around giving it a 6/10. How the heck this is acclaimed the best of the 3 is just undigestable.This style of movie making just does not fit the brilliance of a powerful story line, especially with the introduction of TWO of the best characters in the series SIRIUS BLACK and REMUS LUPIN. To top it off great actors like OLDMAN and THEWLIS (atleast he gets a better deal than Gary) are grossly underplayed. Although the movie is supposed to be all about Black (the prisoner of Azkaban) and the very thought of him sending a shiver down powerful wizards/witches, his screen presence and introduction is downright ridiculous. Almost ZERO impact. The brilliance or build-up of an unseen fear without seeing it till the very end, is totally missing. Then its an anti-climax in the end, bah, is this it? This is SIRIUS and now we know (or do we?) why he escaped from Azkaban where most feared wizards (gone bad) are kept?The concept of the foursome during school, the friendship between Harry's father James, Sirius, Lupin and Pettigrew is just not explored or even mentioned properly. Why did Pettigrew betray James and expose their location to the you-know-who Voldermot is not at all explained! One thing for sure this movie warrants a different type of BAN. Ban it from your hearts, don't waste your money and pray for the next one to be half as exciting as the story line. Its quite surprising when people say I'm looking forward to HP4 (Goblet of Fire).

I thought third time lucky would mean another chance at an objective analysis of this movie. No way. Such an ordinary feel for this magical series. I felt imprisoned to watch it with buckbeak providing much needed relief from time to time. One thing that HAS to be mentioned is the evolution of these kid actors. They have almost become adults but so much more could have been done with their talent.Chris Columbus - WHERE ARE YOU?? You left them at a time when they were just beginning to become more interesting. Darn, he would have cracked this story line and made this a $400+ domestic grosser in the US.Another given in this series that is cemented - Hermione will be Ron's gal (especially the scene where she leans on him instead of Harry). Unless JKR has conjured Luna Lovegood to lead Ron another way and Harry to be Hermoine's intellectual, platonic counterpart in HBP there is no chance for a young potter-granger romance.Six words for Harry Fans - This is just not good enough.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I don't know why everyone says harry looks too old for his age. HE'S NOT AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. Adam Lamberg from Lizzie McGuire was 16/17 and playing a 12/13 year old. It's a trend and true. Look at the people in their same grades in my school. A few have beards and mustaches growing! It's crazy. I loved had much darker it was. Very good! The new director would be wonderful for the fourth movie, but he's not going to direct it :frowns: Professor McGonnagol could have shown up more and some more humor could have been shown, but Ron had me laughing! SO did the shrunken heads. I want to ride the night bus! That rocked! I like how Harry is about the only hot guy there and Hermione is very pretty.

657,thepinkmenace,Good but not as good as the book.,9,17 June 2004,"This movie was great! But seeing how Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book it didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I would have been very confused if I hadn't read the book. And some things just p*** me off like how Harry didn't get the firebolt until the end, and how they didn't say who Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs were. But overall it was good. The scene where Lupin turns into a werewolf was great. I pictured him as more of a wolf though. And who else thinks that Ron and Hermione are going to start dating in the seventh or sixth book?

OK, J.K. Rowling wanted the reader grow with the book. But is it why the director was changed from the one who was a specialist in filming movies for children to the other who doesn't know a thing about movies for children! Oh, please. This is no longer a movie for the youngsters! All those beautiful landscapes, Hogwarts sooo big... I just don't understand. How can someone do something like this to this GREAT book?

659,gorbadoc25,"Best Harry Potter movie yet, but ...",6,2 April 2005,"I have read all the Harry Potter novels so far and I saw the first two movies before I watched 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which is definitely the best Harry Potter movie yet. The acting skills of the youngsters improve steadily, the CGI was nice but not breath-taking and there were some tense and exciting moments. Cuarón did a much better job than Columbus, that's for sure.So far the good news. The whole movie was totally messed up by the worst adaptation I've ever known. It was completely disorderly, unbalanced, indistinct and without any structure. The movie starts way to fast (you only have to blink after Aunt Marge's blowing up or Harry is suddenly in Hogwarts), the mid part is an incoherent pack of randomly taken fragments of the book (with leaving out lots of important stuff and mentioning vague, further unexplained elements: Snape taking over the lessons from Lupin, Trelawney making a creepy prediction) and the end isn't too long but also not very interesting. After Black is saved, Harry suddenly receives a new broom, he flies with it, and BAM! the movie is done ... The pacing was horrible. I also didn't like the 'restyling' of Hogwarts and its students. There weren't hardly any resemblances to the Hogwarts from the first two movies and the school from the third movie. Hagrid's hut is suddenly replaced, there are Stonehenge-like structures, the Wood has a totally different look ... not to mention the fact that the students almost never wear their costumes anymore, contrary to the first two movies.I rated HP1 4/10, HP2 5/10 and this one 6/10 (so maybe number 7 will get a 10/10?)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Compared to the other two movie, I will say rather critically that Harry Potter was a bit of shock to me as the location of the set was changed. In the two previous movie of Harry Potter, it was set to be very like what the book wrote and I like the effects. However, In Harry Potter 3, in order to like this movie, the book must be forgotten as the plot is switched about and love-at-first-sight can be seen between the Ron and Herimone. The game that is played in the wizard world- one of them was not shown and that is the game where supposely Harry caught the snitch and won the cup. That was not shown as well as the fact that the mouse and cat's attacks.

I was disappointed that it lacked the charm the first two films produced and fell short mainly due to the plot which just was not well executed. More magical moments, more action and more humor would have made this movie as spellbinding as the first two.Although Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely worth renting, it does not deserve the praise given to the first two films as it just doesn't quite pull all of them together. In short, you will not leave your seat with that ""magical glow"" when the credits roll on this one and you will perhaps leave a little empty.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
662,chimaru98,It's probably one of the best.,9,2 October 2013,"To start off with, when I say this review may contain spoilers, I'm not kidding. It's what makes the film great, I'm talking about it for a quarter of this short review. So be warned! I admit that the actors did well, but it's the spoilers that make this movie. Here we go!This introduces us to a new age of Harry Potter. Harry himself looks older, angrier and sadder (which can happen with age) along with Ron looking even more terrified than usual with his new look. Draco's stopped slicking back his hair, Hermione's getting older too, and Dumbledore's had a complete makeover (mainly because he's being played by Michael Gambon now.) So now we've got the new out of the way, let's see what's returned from the old films.There are still wizards, Hogwarts is still visually stunning, Hermione's still taking far too many classes and being far too clever, Ron's still got his pet rat and Harry's still trying to be killed. So far so good... but wait! What's this? Ron's pet rat is actually a man? Hermione's got a time travel device to get to classes? The murderer on the loose isn't actually a murderer, doesn't want to kill Harry and is his godfather? Played by Gary Oldman? This film certainly changes things up.It's not going crazy on the special effects like later films will, but still has that certain charm about it. It's just what makes a great film because the effects are subtle and not in-your-face. There's also some action involved - Malfoy finally gets punched after three years! It's great to see another one of the three finally making a difference (we're still waiting on Ron doing something other than being terrified of spiders, but hey, it's a start!)Finally, the way the time travel sequence is shown gives you a feeling of just what the Harry Potter films should be like - subtle, but impressive looking back on it. It's what pushes my rating of this film up to a 9. Oh, and Hagrid's here too. That's always a cause for celebration. So what are you waiting for? Buy it, rent it, do anything you can right now to just watch it?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
663,quidditchqueens,"A darker, grungier ""Potter""",9,30 March 2005,"Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the third film from popcorn culture and entered the realm of true cinema. One might, at first, be taken aback by the washed-out colors and lack of ""wizard clothing"" in favor of more modern ""muggle"" wear, but it somehow works, although I must admit to sorely missing the richness and jewel-like look of the previous two films. The sets and props are darker as well and even Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry takes on an almost dilapidated, sinister look for this scarier installment.The children are becoming accomplished and experienced actors in their own right and one can only hope that future directors aren't stupid enough to call for a new cast as the films progress. There is a great deal of talk about how Radcliff and friends are ""outgrowing"" their roles, but the truth of the matter is that they are maturing in proportion to their characters as the stories progress; unless there is another delay in filming or in the release of future books, there is no reason that these talented youngsters can't make it through to the very end.The only criticism for this film is that one really needs to read the book first, as the writers have left out a great deal of important information that could and should have been retained. We could have had a little less of the Knight Bus antics and special effects and more information about the originators of the Marauders Map, Harry's parents, Sirius Black and the symbology of Harry's patronus charm. Friends who were ignorant of the books that accompanied me to see this film felt completely lost, especially at the end.

664,OrlandoAT,The best Harry Potter movie,9,20 November 2014,"Cuaron puts the vision of a great director in the Harry Potter world, and the result is the most enjoyable film of the saga. The photography and design of the wizarding world is a big plus point of the film: simple but with great meaning and substance. However, the transition of the trio to his teenage version seen somewhat forced, botched. Especially in the dialogues and some situations that seem obvious for this purpose. Yet, some scenes featuring the boys have an interesting force. The acting is not the strong point of the film, as many want to believe, but the cadence and the visual art. Cuaron manages to, however, succeed and provide the most interesting film in the series (even for non-fans)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
665,Doogeylover,Wonderful. Best one yet.,9,8 July 2005,"I love this movie. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed with a few things, but you can't always match your vision with the vision of the director. All of the Harry Potter main characters, played by Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint, were much better this time around (I still like to laugh at their acting jobs in the first two movies, but they were kids). The replacement Dumbledore I actually liked BETTER than the first one because he seemed more quirky, more like the Dumbledore that I picture and that is represented in the books. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were fine, though I see them differently as well. Not that he is ugly, but Sirius Black is supposed to be very, VERY good-looking, and you could not see a trace of a good-looking man (that I pictured) in the withered Oldman.Also, the ending was rather stupid for me. I did not like the whole Harry-got-a-broom-and-is-whisked-away ending with Daniel Radcliffe's blurry face.Great movie. I cannot wait for the next one!

One of the reasons that it is my favourite book is because this is one of the most least explained films. Why the hell would they not explain why Sirius and Peter are able to be an Animagus???And also in NONE of the films do they ever explain that James Potter is also an animagus and transforms into a stag, hence the reason Harry's patronus is a stag. They also haven't shown they form of Harry's patronus at all in this film. There are loads of other reasons why I have this film a 6/10.

In this movie, Harry Potter finds out that a mass murderer, who escaped from Azkaban prison and also who is his father's best friend is his Godfather. He who is the godfather of Harry Potter is Sirius Black. Rumours have that Sirius Black told Lord Voldemort about the wanderings of James and Lily Potter (Harry Potter's parents) and their newborn son, and when Lord Voldemort got to know, he killed Harry's parents but Harry was protected. Watch the movie to know why?Sirius Black turned out to be a noble soul and didn't tell anything to Voldemort. Remus Lupin, again another best friend of James Potter, was the Defence Against the Dark Arts' teacher. He too plays a major role in this movie.Now if somebody has escaped from the Azkaban prison, must die.

668,uknortherner2000,The screenplay writer's one-page summary...,7,18 February 2006,"It has been said that the new director, Alfonso Cuaron asked the young stars to go away and write an essay on their characters. Emma Watson came back with a 16-page(!) essay on Hermione, Daniel Radcliffe, a 1-page summary on Harry and Rupert Grint didn't even bother handing his in. The point of mentioning this? Well, the film feels as though Cuaron had also asked the screenplay writer to do the same thing with the book and this film is his 1-page summary.Firstly, I need to point out that I have not yet finished reading Prisoner of Azkaban  I'm only half-way through it, but from what I have managed to read, around 80% of it has been omitted from the film. With that in mind, I will try not draw too many comparisons between the two, but will try to focus mainly on the film itself.The locations are atmospheric although changes to the layout of Hogwarts seem to confuse rather than enhance the viewing experience. Daniel, Emma and Rupert seem completely comfortable in their roles as Harry, Hermione and Ron, and once again are backed by an extremely talented cast comprising of regulars, Robbie Coltraine (Hagrid), Alan Rickman (Snape), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) and Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia), as well as newcomers to the series Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin) and one I probably should've easily recognised were it not for those thick glasses, Emma Thompson (Professor Trelawney). Contrary to what a few commentators have said, Michael Gambon made a fine Dumbledore given the circumstances.Sadly, despite the strong cast, the screenplay is somewhat weak. The film seems to jump back and forth to events with no consistency (Quidditch, for instance was a major event in the book this time around because it was to be Oliver Wood's last attempt to take the Gryffindor team to the top before he left Hogwarts for good, but it's just about squeezed in with little purpose in the film, except to show Harry coming face to face with the Dementors again); Lupin is asked if he's been taking his potion before turning into a werewolf (this would make no sense to viewers of the film as there were no other references to the potion), and the time-travel sequence at the end of the film feels more complicated and pointless than it needed to be. Characters that played an important role in the previous film (i.e. Ginny) are reduced to just brief appearances and often without saying anything at all, and entire events once again find themselves left on the cutting room floor. Also, there are moments that just seem to drag on, for no reason at all.Perhaps the most immediate thing any follower of the Harry Potter series will have noticed is how dark this film is. Harry, although more mature is a lot more confrontational and rebellious; the Dementors really can send a shiver down your spine at times; Buckbeak's execution, Trelawney's spirit possession and immediately near the start of the film, the presence of the dark and mysterious Grim who Harry sees immediately before the Knight Bus turns up adds to a film that tries to portray a sense of growing maturity and the realisation that the wider world really is full of danger. It's no Batman Begins, but the darkness the film portrays is a pretty welcome direction that drags the viewer from the safer and more pleasant worlds of the previous two films.It's the whole coming of age theme that Cuaron had probably pushed most though the growing maturity of the three main characters. Harry, as we already know is a lot more confrontational. Hermione, too exhibits moments where she can certainly defend herself from the likes of Draco Malfoy (with a painful reminder he won't forget in a hurry!), and Ron finally becomes less of a sidekick and more of an equal in the ""team"". There are moments where it seems that Ron and Hermione actually find themselves being attracted to each other, but Ron's awkward approach to these things tend to be comical and work to good effect.Having said that, some of the humour that we would expect to find in a Harry Potter film just isn't there. Without doubt, much of the dialogue has been re-written for the film, and some of the in-jokes lost along the way. Some of the jokes that remained had no meaning because the corresponding event or conversation had been omitted earlier on in the screenplay.It's difficult to say how future films will turn out. It would be a bold statement to say that Prisoner of Azkaban marks the point where the films and books go their separate ways because I have not finished reading Prisoner of Azkaban, nor have I seen Goblet of Fire, but certainly reading around IMDb, it would appear that this was becoming the case.Considering how much has been stripped out of the first half of the book (against the first 20 minutes of the film it seems), it would probably be a safe bet that fans of the books will continue to be disappointed with the big screen offerings, whilst newcomers to the Harry Potter films will continue to be mesmerised.Sadly, Prisoner of Azkaban has probably been the weakest Harry Potter film offering so far. Not because of the performances given by the cast, and not because of the special effects and atmospheric setting that are used to good effect, but simply because the screenplay omits too much.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
669,trillian28,Best by far,10,23 August 2004,"Here's how I feel about Harry Potter, so you know how I align with the fandom:-The books are enjoyable if not genius-- 4th is the best and 5th is the worst.-The first two movies were awfully disappointing. Near the bottom of big budget children's fantasy.-Alfonso Cuaron is a director about whom all I know is that Little Princess was gorgeous.Now you know what I was expecting coming into this. Coming out, I have to say that the viewing public is crazy not to love this movie, that it is not even in the same category as the first two, and that I am very sad that Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire (Mike Newell is). In this film, everyone stops looking like that were stuck on a postcard and starts showing some chops. Emma Watson shines and Daniel Radcliffe emotes and cries, finally, like a pro. The CG is no longer just passable; it is top flight. And in the camera work, the whimsy that makes the books endearing is finally captured.

670,jburton-3,Not a step forward for this franchise,7,20 June 2004,"I need to preface my comments by stating that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter novels, which means my opinion of the films are somewhat colored by my opinion of the books. While I enjoyed ""Sorcerer's Stone"" as both a book and a film, they were both, at heart, stories for children. I thought Chris Columbus did a good job of capturing the essential nature of the book, and I appreciated the effort. I gave ""Sorcerer's Stone"" an 8.""Chamber of Secrets"" is my least favorite book of the five, and so I was not surprised to find that I didn't like the second film as much as the first, either. I give credit to Columbus for, once again, staying true to the spirit, and mostly to the word, of the book, but he was working with inferior material. I gave ""Chamber of Secrets"" a 6.In the books, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" begins the maturing of the material. Author J.K. Rowling writes her novels in a more complex and adult style as the characters in them grow from children to young adults. As a result, I have found that I appreciate and enjoy the later books in the series more than the earlier ones. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first book to take that step toward more advanced storytelling, and it is my favorite of the first three books, but unfortunately that isn't true of the films.I found that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" does not live up to the book in a number of ways, but that comparison may not be fair, as many films cannot address all the material in a book's pages and thus fall short. On its own merits as a film, however, I still find that this film is flawed. First of all, it felt rushed. Cuts between scenes were often harsh. The movie takes significant leaps in time that don't feel that way due to quick edits. This and certain unexplained plot and character changes left me thinking that a lot of film was left on the editing room floor. For example, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) seems to bond awfully quickly with the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), and I kept thinking that we were missing some scenes that included just how their relationship developed.Another problem I have is that some of the child actors aren't very good actors. I thought this really showed with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Draco (Tom Felton). While their talents sufficed in the two previous films, in this one, they fell short. In don't know if this is due to the difference in directors or if the actors aren't up to the task, but their performances in ""Prisoner"" were a distraction - not good.Third, the choice of Michael Gambon to replace the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore was an unfortunate one. Mr. Gambon is a fine actor, and he brings a vigor to the role that Harris could not have provided, but he lacks the screen presence of a legend, and the magic of Hogwarts seems somewhat diminished.Lastly, characters that were well established in the first two films got short shrift this time around. Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) has little more than a cameo appearance. The wonderfully creepy Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) plays a much reduced role, and we never see a potions class that I can remember. Ron's siblings are barely seen. All of these characters are a big part of Harry's world, and that world seems much changed without them.Then we have areas where the shortages from the book detract from the film for those, like me, that really enjoyed the printed version. For example, the origin of the Marauder's Map and the identities of ""Messrs Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs"" go unexplained. Dedicating five to ten minutes of footage to this might have gone a long way towards explaining Harry's relationship with Lupin and also why he warms so quickly to Sirius Black (Gary Oldman).Another issue is that the films are coming out too slowly, and the kids are thus aging faster than their characters. Harry and company are supposed to be 13 in this film, but they look more like 15. This will only get worse if they continue to have more than a year between films.Does anyone else find that the film version of Draco Malfoy is a wimp? He comes off as much more of a villain in the book. Maybe this is due to the shortcomings of Felton as an actor, but I blame it on the script and the direction. And his cronies Crabbe (Jamie Waylett) and Goyle (Josh Herdman) aren't near as threatening a physical presence as they ought to be.Enough complaining. There are still lots of things that are right and good here. The world is still magical, and in this film, more fully realized. Other reviewers have talked about the darker look, but I find this appealing and fitting to the nature of the story. Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione) are fine young actors. (Watson is going to be a real beauty, too, and this is yet another departure from the book, as Hermione is supposed to be buck-toothed and frizzy-haired.) The wonderful adult supporting cast is still there, supplemented this time by Emma Thompson (as Sybil Trelawney) and Julie Christie (as Madame Rosmerta), along with Oldman and Thewlis. And the new version of the Whomping Willow is a fun bit of comic relief. Hogwarts is still a fun place to visit at the movie theaters.I give ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a 7.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
671,Tai23,Brilliant,8,7 June 2004,"Brilliant This film is magnificent. The best of the three by far. The use of imagination, set design, cinematography, lighting, all wonderful. This film has much more depth than the other three. Cuaron's direction sends the film into a world that is more believable and slightly sinister. Breathtaking sequence after sequence. These kid actors are growing up, and getting good. Emma Watson has matured and lost that annoying girlish whine. After you leave the theater you may wish that the world of Harry Potter would continue.

672,skodousek,Terrible Overall,1,27 June 2006,"I thought that this movie was a terrible waste of my time. There really wasn't a beginning and an ending, and I felt as if everything was rushed. The movie starts out with Harry sitting up in bed... DOING MAGIC! Underage wizards aren't allowed to do magic outside of school! Anyway, he does this about 5 times, then he lays back down and goes to sleep. With a blank screen, you hear his aunt shouting at him, but she doesn't sound anything like in the first and second movies. The next few shots are live-action, and very inaccurate to the book. Skipping to the ending... I honestly have to say that I am furious about the ending. Harry receives a broomstick in the mail, and flies with it. The movie ends when... he is flying on his broom in a pause-shot!? Honestly! The entire movie is BAD, and I really don't recommend it to anyone who has read the books. People who have just seen the movies... well that's just great because it doesn't make any sense. Okay, and just a warning, the dementors don't even have feelings in this movie (like they did in the book!!!).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
673,Tengsted,Butchered the Book,7,2 June 2004,"Oh dear, what a great disappointment.Azkaban had the makings of a great film, but the glossing over of far to many minor details, the changing of storyline, and the seemingly never ending ""Semi famous British Actor = Cameo Role"" put me off big style.My main bugbears are:The lack of explanation for Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs; The Lack of Sir Cadogan from the entire film; The ""attack"" on Ron, and Neville losing the passwords is missing; The Firebolt not arriving half way through, rather at the end; Ron and Hermione fall out over Scabbers and is glossed over.A major plus is the acting skills of Emma, Rupert and Dan. (Very well done).I realise that the film would be very much longer to include every detail, but it gives an insight to how the Goblet of Fire will appear, and if its less than 180 minutes, then it will be a poor adaptation.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

675,topmail123,best film ever,10,30 December 2006,This film is by far the best HP movie!The best character in it is Remus Lupin ( David Thewlis ) because he is the only good defence against the dark arts teacher. Him being a werewolf doesn't lower my opinion on him.This film is the most interesting and most like its book than any of the others.The only improvement in can think of is that they could make the ending better because in the book the firebolt comes on much earlier than in the film and they could have made it more exciting.When i first saw the film i thought it wasn't that good but when i see it now i think thats it is the best one.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
676,Zettsuyk,Alfonso Cuarón is just want Harry Potter needed!,10,29 May 2007,"Moments after leaving the theater, I was still a little confused to whether I liked the film or not. After a few day of letting it soak in, I realized Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban finally took the series to a whole new level of movie making. Alfonso takes a very huge leap away from the first two movies but the leap was greatly needed. Azkaban finally makes Harry Potter feel like a movie, rather than a book made into a movie. The environments and moods he creates are what really make this film stand out from 1 and 2. The dementors were especially creepy and were done perfectly. Azkaban shines in all of the areas it's predecessors were weak and Alfonso has improved on the already strong foundations left by Columbus. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban receives a 10/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
677,mihaly_bora,movie magic,8,28 February 2009,"If you are one of those HP fans who list every departure from the books, don't watch this this film, it will only infuriate you and ruin the whole experience. You want the unchanged story? Read the book, it's excellent.However if you only want to be entertained for two hours and see a good fairytale/fantasy picture, this is the film for you. The story is the best yet for Harry Potter it's twisting and turning, yet it is not unfollowable (even my grandma understood the story). The new director is simply brilliant, he didn't want to copy&paste the whole story into the silver screen, he just wanted a great movie so he took the scenes he needed and left out what he didn't.He even changed many things established in the first two films, but to the Potter universe's benefit: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry never looked and will never look more magical (at least in the 4th and 5th movies), it's as the castle is truly alive, not just a Gothic background.The special effects are great, better than film 2 and a lot better than film 1. John Williams's new score is excellent, it serves the new atmosphere really well, he rarely used the full orchestra. He didn't reach his 'Hook' or 'Home Alone' level, but this score is still very good.The teenage actors are okay, not brilliant but okay. Daniel Radcliffe couldn't properly channel Harry's emotions yet, but he is fairly decent (he will get better in later films).The adult actors are excellent, especially the newcomers. Gary Oldman joins the cast as the resident threat to Harry's life, he is maddened, he is tortured soul and you never know what he'll do next. His presence looms over the picture with much more strength than Voldermort's did in the first or second film.Michael Gambon's headmaster Dumbledore is very intelligent and somewhat crazy (like in the books) and more energetic than the late Richard Harris's, yet he is not the more aggressive Dumbledore we'll see in the 4th film.David Thewlis is also very good as professor Lupin, an old friend of Harry's deceased father, his scenes are warm and touching. Emma Thompson... she is magnificent, you'll see. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Hardy and Maggie Smith are all returning, Coltrane and Rickman are simply stellar.To sum it up: great story, brilliant new designs and atmosphere, excellent special effects, very good music and magnificent actors, BUT: if you are a hardcore fan and hate when the filmmakers change things from the book, do not watch this.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

679,SmartandDeadly,A disappointment and a 4-5,5,14 June 2004,"*possible spoiler, no detail though, spoiler ends at end, where it say s ""***end spoiler***""*Much like every sequel this one was by far inferior to its prequels. The movie started out with Harry using a wand in the middle of summer and continued by uncle Vernon telling him about five minutes later that he's not allowed to. Then the movie continues it's wonderful streak of mess-ups by making it clear that they're skipping out the first few chapters and condensing everything before the eventful dinner into less than two minutes. After that when Harry gets on the night bus it doesn't make objects jump out of the way, it just goes out of the way itself, through aids of time-warping magic. Shortly after harry has a Quidditch game in GOGGLES, where a few people are hit by thunder during which dementors come FLYING in. They mess up the order of all of the events, cutting out many completely and at times inserting ones that were never there. The scene with Lupin turning into a werewolf was completely ruined, along with the imitation of the werewolf. ***end spoiler*** This brings me to the few final and most crucial points, not only was Lupins werewolf self completely ruined, so was his human being. In the movie, he has completely brown hair, with no white streaks, an overly large nose, no wrinkles and a decent wardrobe. He furthermore doesn't seem to radiate energy and acts like what Sirius is supposed to in the fourth book. The rest of the actors aren't any better and all of their acting looks like a skit one would prepare in school. Even as sequels go, this one is at an all-time low, it's worse than the memorable T3 and Matrix: Revolutions. Much as it hurts me to say this as a Harry Potter fan, because of this movie I probably won't see the Goblet of Fire unless I hear some very good recommendations from some VERY reliable sources. For all of the reasons mentioned above I give this movie an undeserved 5/10 simply on the principle that it's part of the Harry Potter series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
680,kahfay,Excellent film but could I have more,8,7 June 2004,Wow!! Thanks Alfonzo!! He does great justice to all of the people we have come to love. Michael Gambon does a great job with staying true to Dumbledore. Only one thing you should be aware of..If you are an avid Harry Potter fan and know the books forwards and backwards like myself (my husband say I need a support group) know that some key things are missing. I would have liked to see the explanation of some of the plot twist. But overall it is an excellent film and I know that if everything in the book was in the movie then we would be sitting in the theater for about five hours. Overall this was a great film and definitely worth the time standing in line and worth the 20 bucks. I just wanted so much more.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
681,cbaddy,Harry Potter on speed,7,4 June 2004,"OK, granted, this was a long, complicated book, thus it was challenging to condense it into a 2 hour movie, but there was very limited character development. The whole movie just felt rushed, from the very first minute, and it made the entire movie a bit confusing. The dialogue was so fast that the acting seemed poor. Basically this was a 2 hour movie that needed to be closer to 3 hours. And if they felt that they could not make the movie much longer, they should have cut out superfluous scenes such as the singing with the giant toads, or the part where Harry is flying around on Buckbeak's back (which frankly, looked so cliché and ""titanic-esque"" that everyone in the theatre laughed). Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew are very important characters, especially in later books (and subsequently movies) but they were not fully developed. I don't think it was even clear that they, in addition to Harry's father, James, created the Marauders's Map. The Prisoner of Azkaban was shot in a very different way from the first two movies. You can definitely tell this was a different director. Instead of focusing on the individual, it was ""bigger."" You get to see more of the Hogwarts' grounds, which was great. And this movie was funnier than the previous two. I also really enjoyed seeing the relationship develop between Hermione and Ron! I did not care for the new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon. He did not have Richard Harris's warmth, which portrayed Dumbledore's light-hearted humor. Gambon's humor was sardonic, and just did not make Dumbledore as likable.The long and the short is, this is an entertaining movie, but without reading the book, you may find yourself a bit lost.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
682,HermioneJWeasley,A must see!,10,7 June 2004,"I had to comment after seeing this film. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*I really enjoyed it. The cinematography was beautiful, and I loved the musical score. I noticed that many of the shots involved nature, and I liked the shots of the Whomping Willow interspersed throughout the movie. The dementors on the train and towards the end of the movie were creepy, just like I imagined the dementors to be. I am a big fan of the books, and I felt that although some things had to be left out in the interest of time, the movie in general was faithful to the book. I loved Buckbeak - he was very realistic, and the whole scene involving the Care of Magical Creatures class was one of the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion. I also loved the scene where the class fights the boggarts in the wardrobe, and the "" magical animal noises"" scene.As usual, the actors did outstanding jobs I was very impressed with David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, who played Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, to perfection. I really enjoyed how Harry and Lupin's relationship developed. The movie clearly showed that Lupin, although he was an authority figure, developed a close friendship with Harry. He and Harry were shown to have a genuine connection.Rupert Grint was so funny as Ron, as usual - he is the perfect Ron, in my opinion, and Emma Watson's talents really shone in this movie. She was funny. I liked the way Ron and Hermione's growing romance was captured in the scene where Hermione ""accidentally"" brushes his hand during Care of Magical Creatures, and also, as they are watching Buckbeak, when she leans her head against his chest and holds him. Daniel Radcliffe also did an excellent job as Harry - he seems more angsty and emotional than in the previous two films. I noticed Sirius got to speak Dumbledore's usual words of wisdom just before he leaves on Buckbeak. His speech was very heartfelt. He captured Sirius' character perfectly. I would have liked to have seen more of Crookshanks chasing Scabbers and heard more of Hermione and Ron bickering, and also I wish more information on the Marauders was shared for those who haven't read the books but then again, I am sure it will be discussed further in future movies.All in all, I was very impressed!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
683,alwaysthere,Such mixed feelings about the movie...,6,6 June 2004,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this movie, I wasn't impressed with it. The trailer was disjointed, it had very odd editing, an odd pacing, it was very short, it showed one scene that I hated the first moment I saw it (Hermione marching down a hill, yelling at Malfoy in the oddest tone, and then punching him... there's just something about that scene that I hate).Now the trailer represents the movie in a way, but the movie was at least well-made as a film. The thing I really didn't like about the movie was that it was so freakin' short! A little over two hours is just tooooooooooo little time to tell the story. It should have been longer. WAAAYYYY longer. I would have liked to see a three+ hour movie. Return of the King length at the least! The big problem of the short running time was that so much got cut out. The pacing is odd, the ending is very abrupt, but the cut parts of the book are the biggest reason that the film should have been longer.They should have taken the time to: 1) set up the Firebolt when Harry is at the Leaky Cauldon/Diagon Alley. It would have taken like 10 seconds, and was pretty important when we get to the end of the movie. 2) show the Quidditch House Cup scene. IMO, this is what made book 3 so great. Without it, the movie doesn't have a perk. Would have been a GREAT scene! 3) Show the proper ending on the train, when Harry gets the letter from Sirius. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WASN'T IN THE MOVIE! 4) Show the proper beginning, when Harry gets all the ""Owl Post"". They never mention his birthday, they never mention how Ron's family got the money to go to Romania (or was it Egypt? I dunno). And by the way, how did Harry perform the ""Lumos"" spell under his sheet without the Ministry of Magic noticing it? He's not allowed to do magic outside of school (as we see later), and I'd like to know why he was allowed to perform that spell!5) show the Sir Cadogan scenes. I don't know if these scenes were filmed, and were just deleted, since we do see Sir Cadgogan moving around in the pictures in the scene with the Fat Lady disappearing, and I'd of liked to see him taking over the entrance portrait. Other than that, most of the deletions were justifiable, and acceptable.Now... Things they shouldn't have put in: 1) the freakin' shrunken head in the Knight Bus. Enough said.2) Hermione punching Malfoy. I already mentioned this scene. As great as it is to see her hitting Malfoy, I just seriously dislike this scene. Emma Watson doesn't deliver the ""you, foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"" line very well, and the horribly clichéd ""That felt good."" like afterwards is just so cringe-worthy. I easily could have done without this scene. I'd prefer her slapping Malfoy after he calls her a Mudblood down by the Shrieking Shack. It'd be simple, and more effective. Things that should be changed: 1) Dumbledore. Micheal Gambon is a fine actor, and of course, I never expected anyone would be able to fill Richard Harris' shoes, but... I DID expect better. Micheal Gambon just doesn't have the Dumbledore touch. He doesn't have the proper wise feel that Dumbledore should have.And what was with the bells tied around his beard??? God, I was just itching for those to be gone in at least one scene! Speaking of which, why'd they make his hair so short and cragly? And why is it so gray-looking??? Dumbledore's hair is clearly described in the book as long, straight, flowing SILVER hair!!! Richard Harris' Dumbledore had the absolute perfect hair! And they go and change that too!!! For crying out loud, THIS is the main reason why Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore just didn't look like Dumbledore. His look determines the feel you get from him, and they completely ruined it by changing his hair. I can't express how much I miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Of course, there's nothing anybody could do, but they COULD have re-cast better, and they COULD have kept the hair the same. 2) What was with Goyle being re-cast? Anybody know what this is about? I mean, if the original actor didn't want to do it again, fine, but why they bloody hell did they cast a skinny, small guy to play the part??? Goyle is supposed to be huge and brute-like. What the hell was that all about??? When I first saw him, I was like, ""Who is that??? Don't tell me that's supposed to be Goyle!"". Whoever the casting director was on this movie should be fired.3) what the BLOOODDDDYYYY HELLL was with Hagrid's Hut being re-located??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? It's not only inconsistant with the other movies, but it's wrong in regards to the book as well. Who's stupid decision was that? Same with the Womping Willow, for that matter. And what's with the ugliness??? Both Ron and Draco got way uglier between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. Ron looked great in CoS, and Draco looked cute and hot as hell. Then, in this movie, they both look different, they've changed for the worse. Why was Draco's hair changed? His hair was perfect in the first and second movie. Really showed his sly, slick evilness. Now, he looks like his mom cut it with a bowl on his head... what the hell???Daniel Radcliffe looks pretty hot in this movie tho! OK, now that I've gotten all the bad stuff out of the way (I'm pretty sure I got it all...), onto what I liked about the movie: I liked that the movie seemed to be taken more seriously. The dark feeling of the book was captured, and Harry's maturing was shown rather well. Daniel Radcliffe has obviously matured as an actor, and he doesn't say lines like he's reading them from prompt cards anymore. I liked the film-making aspects of the movie as well. The visual effects were very good (although I think they were a little bit better in Chamber of Secrets. Not quite as noticeable.), and I loved the shots where we go THROUGH the clock. Buckbeak was pretty well done (although he should have been a little bit bigger).I liked how they handled the scene with Aunt Marge. Harry reactions to her were pretty good, and the whole blowing up thing was done quite well. Even though it seemed rushed, it was pretty good. Towards the end, the movie just got so great all of a sudden. Right from the scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak out of Hagrid's Hut, up until the end when Harry and Hermione come back into the hospital wing, the movie was great. The Time Turner thing was done well, and the little things that suggested the Time Turner were great too (the rocks (or whatever those were) being thrown into the hut, Hermione seeing something, the Executioner axing something). All handled very well. And the scene in the Shrieking Shack was great. I saw the movie with someone who hadn't read the book, and when Lupin hugs Sirius, she was like, ""So predictable. The trusting ones are always evil."" She fell to the trap of thinking Lupin was bad too. It was hard for me to resist saying, ""No, Sirius is good!!"". To be honest, I've never had such mixed feelings about a movie. I don't know whether to hate the movie because it was so different from how it should have been, or to love it because it was so different. To be honest, I'm very, very, very, very, very glad that Alfonso Cuaron is not directing Goblet of Fire. I just don't like his style. I really do wish that Christopher Columbus had kept directing, because the first two movies were great as movies AND adaptations. PoA is great as a movie, but terrible as an adaptation. I just hope this Mike Newell guy sticks more to the Columbus side of things for Goblet of Fire... AND RE-CASTS DUMBLEDORE!!! ...and puts Hagrid's Hut back where it should be! .....and he better keep the ""Riddle House"" chapter in!.......and the Quidditch World Cup! ..........and make the movie more than 3 hours long. Goblet of Fire better be a long movie! Overall, I'd give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 6/10, because I did enjoy the entertainment side of things!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
684,Gamingboy,BRING BACK COLUMBUS (Spoilers),7,28 May 2004,"----SPOILERS ALERT-----I was lucky enough to catch a sneak peek of HP&TPOA. And I was disappointed. It didn't come close to doing the book justice. Things start off okay, but get progressively worse. The reason for this is the new director, Cuaron. Things are rushed. Very rushed. Lines from the book that explain things are never spoken. Some things are out of order, Harry receives his Thunderbolt in the end of the movie, not the middle as it should be, for example. Other sequences are off too. The characters from the other movies are underused, Dumbledore (now played by someone else) only appears in 5 or 6 scenes, tops. Mcgonagall barely appears at all. The only teachers we really see are Snape and Lupine (who is played pretty well by David Thewlis). The evil (or is he?) Sirius Black is played so-so by Gary Oldman, who is a bit too much of a madman for the part if you ask me. The big redeemer in this is the special effects. Yes, o yes, the special effects. From a lady becoming a balloon to a eagle/horse hybrid. The special effects are great. Sadly, the Quidditch scene is very short, had it gone on even 5 minutes longer, this movie would've probably gotten a 7.5 instead of a 7. Final Verdict: Go if you like the books or previous movies, but keep your expectations at a bit lower standard. I give it a 7.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
685,delgirl_ellen12,The magic still lives,9,31 May 2004,"*SPOILERS*The third installment of the Harry Potter series is (by my opinion, the best. It keeps close with the book but enough is improvised to keep the story at its best. Harry is at his third year at Hogwarts and Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban. Everyone knows that he is after Harry, or is he? Sirius finds Harry and tells him the truth of how Voldemort found his parents. The Prisoner of Azkaban is possibly the best Harry Potter book, in the movie the acting is great (although I don't think that Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) isn't quite as good as Richard Harris) and the special effects are amazing. The story starts off a little unrealistic (the Knight Bus is painted purple) but once the movie gets going it becomes a magical movie that captures your heart, also funnier than the other two (thanks to Ron's PG swearing) this is a movie that will surely tell you that magic lives on.I would give it 8/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
686,MadProphet,Third Time's The Charm...,10,3 June 2004,"SPOILERS""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" sees Harry and friends in mortal danger when they return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The atmosphere is tense, with a mass murderer called Sirius Black on the loose and several Dementors, the foul guards of wizard prison Azkaban, stationed around the school. Even worse, there is a traitor in their midst...Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) fills the shoes of regular HP director Chris Columbus excellently, bringing a much darker tone to the franchise, a tone which is necessary for this installment. Daniel Radcliffe is clearly moving with the times, and he has clearly matured since the last movie. His co-stars give a great performance as well. Rupert Grint retains his comic relief status, but it is a lot less whiney and scared, which seemed to be his only emotion in CoS. Emma Watson also gives a great performance, and there are definitely hints that her character will have a future relationship with either Harry or Ron.The adult cast are great too, if underused. Gary Oldman (Hannibal) only gets 15 minutes screentime as Sirius Black, and Timothy Spall (The Last Samurai) is almost criminally underused. They both serve great portrayals of their respective characters though. The regulars, Robbie Coltrane, (Van Helsing) Maggie Smith, (Hook) and Alan Rickman, (Galaxy Quest) are also underused, and are less noticeable in the movie. David Thewlis, (Timeline) is incredible as Professor Lupin, bringing the character to life. The scenes between him and Harry are the emotional core of the movie. Michael Gambon, (The Actors) is the new Dumbledore, and he plays him more like a hippy than Richard Harris did.The special effects are on top form again, producing werewolves, Quidditch in the rain, Hippogriffs, inflating aunts and Dementors. My only qualm about the effects was the rain in the Quidditch scene reminding me too much of the rain from The Matrix Revolutions...but that's just me. The plot is also great, with time travel, double decker buses and werewolves fitting comfortably into a semi-plausible story. There's less Voldemort and more themes of adolescent cravings for revenge in this one too. It's arguably the best of the lot, and will entertain the whole family, despite some scary scenes.

687,libroschica,Better than the rest,10,5 June 2004,"I went to the midnight showing of HP and I thought it was fantastic! The special effects left the other movies far behind. I thought Michael Gambone did a very good Dumbledore, though it was different. The pace of the movie seemed faster, and it was shorter, yet it still managed to capture the main points of the book. I had high expectations for this movie, b/c Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the books, and I'm happy to say that it met them. I wasn't sure if I could see Gary Oldman as Sirius, but he played it well. Oh, and if I hear one more person say this was a ""darker"" movie, I will scream! The book itself was darker than the others before it, and all of the books become increasingly darker as Harry grows up. By making the film have a darker tone, the filmmakers have tried to be true to the books and I feel they succeeded.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
688,jim26bass,Cuarón was just showing off...,1,23 July 2005,"Alfonso Cuarón claims that the film didn't need to be 3-4hrs long; well I have to admit he may be correct; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on?He said that a novel-to-screen adaptation is the Directors viewpoint on how to best tell the story. Well that's fine, but you still need to actually tell the story. Don't you? Not one person, who saw the film, without reading the books, understood what was going on half the time, and the few sub-plots he left in weren't explained in any way, shape or form that could be understood but an outside observer! So doesn't that contradict his whole Directors Viewpoint theory?Cuarón was just showing off his excellent film making skills (No I'm not being sarcastic!) and decided to say F*#K YOU to all the Big Name Hollywood Directors by making a Art-House style Blockbuster, which would have been great, if he had bothered to pay attention to the actual story, instead of just concentrating on all the stupid things he chose to shoot instead! Don't get me wrong they were amazing, but so much time consuming crap was put into the film, that could have been spent on, you know, Harry Potter instead of showing off to the world that he's an excellent director... WE KNOW YOU ARE MATE! YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIRED FOR THE JOB IF YOU WERN'T...He made some excellent & much needed changes to the films, and we all must be grateful for that, but by trying to make a more intelligent film, (Which he did) he robbed us of many wonderful aspect of the Harry Potter world! Things we were all looking forward to being brought to life on the big screen...And as if that wasn't bad enough, he convinced Mike Newell to make GOF (Which is the same size as books 1, 2 & 3, combined) into a 2 1/2 hour movie!?! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't let him near another Harry Potter film ever again!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
689,iawen_of_lorien,Great movie!,10,5 June 2004,"I enjoyed this movie much better than the first two Harry Potter movies. I will have to completely disagree with the people who said that if you have read and loved the books, this movie will disappoint you. I am huge fan of the books, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series.Anyone who goes to a movie based on a book KNOWS that it's going to be different. No one should have been surprised by that. Even the first two movies changed things. The problem with the first two movies was that they tried to do so much (yes, including Quidditch) that didn't have all that much to do with the actual plot of the book that the movie went too fast and felt too condensed. They tried to do too much for their alloted time. POA was much more focused, and yes they changed a few things around plot-wise that did catch me off-guard but it was done well. The visual effects are amazing in this movie, much better than in the first two. The three main actors are all much improved in this movie, kudos to them. I would have liked to see Maggie Smith in the movie more, but overall this movie is very very enjoyable. It does, however, require more of an open-mind than going in expecting it to be exactly the same as the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
690,gargygirl02,"""Loosely"" Based",5,4 June 2004,"I went to see the first show today at 10:00 with 3 friends and my sister. During the credits it says ""Based on the novel by J.K Rowling."" That is dead wrong. It should say ""Loosely based on the novel by J.K Rowling."" The movie left out about 80 of the most important pages from the book and replaced it with things like the Hogwarts chorus and prolonged Knight Bus and hippogriff scenes. The various parts of the plot don't line up and the casting was awful. David Thewlis looked nothing like J.K Rowling's descriptions of Lupin. The whole movie is completely messed up. When I rated this movie, on a scale of 1 to 10, I gave it a 5. One word sums it all up: dissatisfied. All my friends agree.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
691,adoyle444,Different from the first two...but in a good way.,9,13 September 2012,"People who have seen the third harry potter film will be surprised by the sudden change of tone and direction taken to create a dark and mysterious film unlike a happy family related movie. The first time i seen it i really didn't like it because of that but as the other harry potter films were released, they all sucked. So in retrospect this makes the third much better. I am not saying i like it because the others sucked but the more you watch it and compare, you will like it. As a 10 year old kid, i was hyped with harry potter, having read all the books, owning a lot of merchandise and knowing all bout the classic books. I was mad into it. I needed something to get into after the end of the lord of the rings (with one more star wars and more hp, things started looking great for me as a kid).Everybody knows the movie, its simple but adding in the different conflicts between characters, increases drama and tension in the movie, hence the different direction for harry potter. The music is still by john Williams who i really like the medieval themed music to create a spooky atmopshere. The characters all have changed as well but the big change has to be dumbledore played by Micheal gambon. The dumbledore in the first two films was played by the late Richard Harris who did a magnificent job in playing the beloved dumbledore. I know gambon In;t as good but he is still great and i hate it when people give him a lot of slick for him. He does give a great performance and I'm sure Richard is proud of him.The book is not as different from the movies, especially as the later films take not much from the books. The third book is the second best to read and the film is the 3rd best. A great movie that should be marked still as a classic and the first film i was introduced to the famous Gary oldman. What a performance as Sirius black! 9/10. Brilliant film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
692,ruxpin83068,Disappointing,7,13 March 2005,"This movie gets a 7 out of 10 solely because despite all its shortcomings, it is STILL Harry Potter. This movie is a drastic step down from the first two movies--mostly because of a new, inferior, director. The set has been greatly changed (did he think we wouldn't notice Hagrid's hut is in a completely different location?), the student's no longer have to wear their school uniforms--a sudden change in centuries of school policy--and the change in camera techniques are annoying. There are very few still shots in this movie. The camera is panning from up right or left and ""swooping"" down to the opposite corner while coming toward the subject on nearly every shot. It would be okay, I suppose, but it gets quite annoying after awhile.The magic and grandeur of the first two movies is sadly lacking from this incarnation. When shooting the magic stairwell, for example, where Columbus shot it from the ground-up, giving it a majestic, magical quality; this new director (whose name we do not speak) chooses, rather, to shoot downward at it--giving it a carnival-ride, ho-hum, feel.Finally, this book departs from the book far more widely than its two predecessors. The books have been thoroughly enjoyed and were well-written. Why would someone choose to depart from them? There were not just scenes from the book that were altered, but themes that were not at all addressed by the movie.The movie is certainly worth seeing, but if I did not love the Potter series so much, and if I were not hoping beyond hope that this current director does not continue with the fourth, my rating would be much less than 7.Please bring back Columbus.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
693,Snowflake93,Some parts are very disappointing,5,28 February 2005,"This film is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, following on from the Philosophers Stone (2001) and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) I went to the cinema on the day it came out, expecting the film to be better than the first two. How wrong I was. The story revolves around Harry's third year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, alongside his two best friends, Hermione and Ron. Harry's life becomes endangered after the mass-murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban; everyone says that he escaped to come and kill Harry.There are some fun and exciting scenes, such as the Knight Bus scene and the time - turning. But there are so, so many mistakes made, it is hard to count them all. Firstly, I believe that the new direction is not a very sensible idea, as the new director changed: A) The room that was the Great Hall B) Hagrid's Hut - It somehow doubled in size and the location was 100% different C) The fat lady - A completely different person, and the portrait hole was in a different location. D) The uniform was also differentThose are to name just a few - but a lot of things were so wrong. It is unfair on the viewers to suddenly make these dramatic changes. It doesn't matter if the director has changed or not, because they can still use the old set, as it was a lot better than the new one. This is quite a good film for the girls, however, as Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) has a major role in this production, and is nearly the very main lead. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) hasn't got such a large role in this, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is just a tiny fraction ahead of Emma Watson.Overall, I think this film is OK, but certainly not as good as the first two, and the third book. It is a pity, because the third book is my favourite, but the third film...isn't. But even if it isn't up to the high standards of the first two, I still recommend it, as a lot of people have totally different opinions on this production.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
694,blondie24,Good but different,8,28 July 2005,"This Harry Potter was really good. I enjoyed watching it and the plot was just as interesting as the first two. It followed the book and it was very well put together. But this movie was different from the first two movies. This one felt more...""dark."" I think this may be because of the plot, and how disturbing it is to Harry, so I think that is why it's different from the other two Harry Potter movies. The acting was a lot more dramatic in this movie. I think the events of the story engage this more dramatic acting. I was extremely impressed by all the actors and seen how they've improved from the previous films. All in all this movie was great. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
695,h2o_ns,A Complete Failure,1,27 January 2005,"This movie is terrible, no wait, it's garbage. There is so much BS put in this movie, and the real stuff is removed! Harry and Professor Lupin don't walk around talking about stuff! They speak once in Lupin's office, then they have anti-dementor lessons! There is no toad choir! Harry doesn't even tell Lupin what his happiest memory is! And it's not even his mom! And the worst part in the whole movie, flying dementors, I mean come on!? That was the most stupid thing ever. Dementors glide an inch above the ground.. They just don't fly! I am extremely disappointed in this fake Harry Potter movie. They could have done so much with the material, but instead they say, here's Harry Potter, this is his year, love it. And oh, how could I forget Professor Trelawny? The just missed what her character is about completely. Really disappointing. I gave this movie a 1, and it barely deserves that. The actors are alright, but the script and directing is terrible, just awful. I can understand that people like the movie if they haven't read the book, but seriously, do read the book. It's just so much better.Can't they just stick to what's in the book? Why add stuff? The books are loved for what they are.. Why ruin it? I'm just gonna stop, please don't see this movie, it's a pure waste of time. Read the book, enjoy a true piece of art.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I have like warner brothers previous works too. Mostly magical, special effects, never seen before(NSB) computer graphics and anime. Especially the hippogriff. We wished it could stay for long and could do more things. Nasty! Sets are quite attracting and absorbing. One thing lacking is spontaneity in Harry's character. He hears too much. Takes a lot of time. He must become emotional with age. Which is bad of'course but that's how this character sounds. Otherwise, it is rising. Rupert Grint is your finding. We like tidier movies and thin guys. Movie has a scary name but was action packed and scary too. Keep it up!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
697,krazykidz,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,9,14 January 2005,"The darkest film yet, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful film. As a big fan of all Harry Potter related things, I loved this film but, only because it was Harry Potter related. As almost all films, it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. I must say, that the director this time outdid himself, as the visual effects are no less than fantastic. The dementors, the scenery in general and the outside ambiance, especially Hagrid's hut are really fascinating. The village of Hogsemead is really cute and just as I expected it to be. What really disappointed me, probably disappointed most who are big fans of J.K Rowling's books. The film gave great importance to visual effects (if i might add fascinating ones, especially the computer animated hippogriff, Buckbeak) but almost ignored the whole story and its essence. Certain funny comments and situations were eliminated from the film, such as the Dementor/Malfoy situation in the Quidditch Game and Harry's crush on Cho Chang. The Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book was really emotional and although, true Harry Potter fans did find their eyes watering at the some point in the film, I must say that I almost tore the book's pages with my crying. The whole story of the Maurauder's map is almost deleted entirely and that, in my opinion is not good, as it is a very special part in the book. I really must say that the previous two films were more faithful to the story. But, who am I to comment on such things? After all, J.K Rowling did work entirely with the screen writer, so she, of all people, should know what is important and what's not relevant to future films. Still, I think that certain special moments mean the world to Harry Potter fans, who probably, have lost count of the number of times they had seen the film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
698,purplelua,Best Film of the Series So Far,10,23 December 2013,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the impressive Harry Potter series. This blows the first two films out of the water. I can't believe it was the least successful Potter movie! Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Harry Potter, finally getting used to being the talk of the planet. Rupert Grint again is wonderful as Ron Weasley. Emma Watson is great as clever Hermione Granger, who has mysteriously turned into a spunky character.The appearances of several other cast members are also a delight. Gary Oldman steals the show as escaped prisoner and Harry Potter's godfather Sirius Black. David Thewlis is good as troubled teacher Professor Lupin, who turns out to be a werewolf. Emma Thompson as loopy Divination teacher Professor Trelawney is also a delight.Even though this film is a bit long, it didn't bother me one bit. I enjoyed watching this film more than the first two. It does get darker, and spookier, but the twists and shocks just kept me watching.Overall, the best film in the series yet.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
699,aeroblaster1033,Takes Columbus' mundanity and turns it into magic,9,9 June 2007,"The first two Potter films were not bad movies. On the contrary, they were ""pretty good"". Of course, they were following Rowling's excellent stories as close as humanly possible within the span of a motion picture, so that does a lot to explain why they don't entirely suck.Unfortunately, a book is not a movie, and Columbus doesn't have half the imagination of a director like Alfonso Cuaron. How can you take a series like Harry Potter--whose essence is to be so magical as to spark the imagination of its readers--and apply such a mundane approach to its transformation into film? It followed the letter of the books so closely that it was boring. There was nothing magical that hadn't been made a point of in Rowling's work.And then along comes Cuaron. He changes the sets, swaps in a new Dumbledore to replace the sadly late Richard Harris, and proceeds to breathe life into the entire thing.Sure, the result is less true to the text of Rowling's story; but it's far more true to its spirit. And just as importantly, it actually feels magical. There's not a shot in the movie without something exciting and imaginative going on.And the child actors, stiff and unnatural under Columbus' direction, also come to life under Cuaron's careful guidance. They won't be winning any Oscars anytime soon, but at least they seem human and at least you can relate to them and feel their emotions.Of course, the final element that makes Azkaban a superior Potter film is that, in my personal opinion, the story is just plain better than that of the first two books. It's more personal, and the puzzle-like plotting actually comes together neatly and believably (as long as you ignore minor time travel paradoxes, which will always occur whenever you use time travel as a plot device).In any case, this is, to me, a beloved film, since it purely captures the spirit of the books that I love so much. Hats off to Cuaron, who did what Columbus did not, and actually created movie magic for a series that lives and breathes magic as its currency of wonderment.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
700,drumtom589,wow this sucked.,2,2 August 2005,"Okay, so I've read all the harry potters and i was a pretty big fan of 1 and 2. i finally got hold of harry potter 3. i wish i hadn't. this movie sucked ass. normally these movies follow the books? this one obviously enjoys a free-spirit(name of my bike) and decided to screw the book and go as off tangent as possible. and i also wanted to know whose bright idea was it to put harry in that pathetic yeah! pose at the end of the movie? was that supposed to be clever? i didn't find it clever at all. in fact, i thought it was pretty much retarded. This movie was up on my sh*t list along with Midnight Mass. those two movies are of equal quality, if anyone actually knows movies in here instead of just saying you like movie because it relates to a series of book everyone loves. quit succumbing to the pressure of society and think for yourself for once! yeah i kinda succumbed to the pressure and gave it a 2. it got a star because it was harry potter, if you could pick 0, it would've gotten a 1 from me.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
701,jetsguyty,A decent film but still lacking,6,6 August 2005,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is part of the highest caliber in literature. One that not only appeals to every age group; but shines with an excellent storyline full of plot twists and imagination. This book is part of the current most popular book series that has possibly ever existed. It is expected that the film interpretation of this book would be critically acclaimed with cleverness and great appeal to all audiences. Unfortunately this is not the case.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is directed by Alfonso Cuarón. After the first two movies were directed by Chris Columbus it seemed that films were not good enough for the plus- 10 million dollars that he was being paid. This turned out to be a dreadful mistake on Warner Brothers part. Alfonso Cuarón was definitely the bad choice to head the multi million dollar production that is ""The prisoner of Azkaban"". It is still questioned why Cuarón was hired for this job with his mere credentials being several low budget films, The Little Princess and the very disturbing Y Tu Mama Tabien. Cuarón brought his very unusual styles of directing to the mix. He adds very unusual cuts and makes a sub-par interpretation that would make writer J.K. Rowling ashamed. He doesn't bring the appropriate seriousness to the film as it often seems like a joke.The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) now 13 years old, starting his third year at Hogwarts. The wizarding world has been shaken up, due to the recent escape of Sirius Black from the wizarding prison of Azkaban. The significance of Black is that he was the person convicted of leading the dark Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents. It is believed that he is bent on finishing his task by killing Harry as well. Adding to Harry's troubles are phantom like creatures called Dementors. These heartless beings are sent to guard Hogwarts from Sirius Black. With all the stress of these terrifying beings and the person who gave away his parents location which lead to their death; Harry has become angry. No longer a helpless child Harry has grown up to become a darker and more powerful person.Harry reunites with his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) to continue the wonders of Hogwarts Wizarding School. Harry is helped by the new defense against the dark arts teach Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to learn to defend himself against Sirius Black and the treacherous Dementors. Harry doesn't ever seem to catch a break as his troubles only get worse.The movie overall is decent, the acting is surprisingly good for the young actors and the more experienced actors Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Gary Oldman all do terrific jobs of portraying their characters. However after the death of Richard Harris the role of Dumbledore was given to Micheal Gambon. Gambon however does in my opinion an inaccurate portrayal of the Headmaster failing to show the wisdom and care that Harris brought to the screen. Even so his appearances in the book are minimal as he does not affect the film in a big way. The CGI effects in this movie are excellent as the visual effects seem to get better and better. The realism in the broomstick flying and the creatures are phenomenal and the effects team deserves a pat on the back. Overall this movie is worth seeing for any Harry Potter fan, and should appeal for the average person to see it at least once. Unfortunately is seems like the opportunity to make a great film was squandered by Director Alfonso Cuarón and it is disappointing to watch and think ""what could have been a great movie""",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
702,goldmember25,Harry goes back for his third year at Hogwarts and learns that a murderer is at large and after Harry.,5,23 July 2005,"A real disappointment if you're a true fan of the books. If you don't read the books or didn't completely follow the previous movies, it'll be confusing. It was well-directed and really looked like the Hogwarts the books portray, but the acting is terrible and the plot-line is hard to follow. The movie has been built up to be a comedy and teen romance flick, where the plot line is thrown to the side, into the background, making it difficult to understand.First, the few good points: The directing was above average in this film and it's obvious that this is an improvement from the previous movies. Hogwarts is made out as it should be, following the books, again, unlike the last 2 Harry Potter movies. But this is really all that is good.The many, many bad points: The animation is absolutely terrible and completely fake. The movie has been so clouded up by unnecessary details that the main plot line is left in the dark, difficult to follow and, so the movie is made out to be, unimportant. If you're a fan of the books, this is a huge disappointment. As a matter of fact, if you've read the books, I strongly suggest you not go and see the movie. It will ruin your view of the Harry Potter novels and if watched enough, confuse you from what is important.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
703,allenquanobi,The first one in the series made for grown-ups and kids,9,19 November 2017,"I'll keep this review short since the movie came out more than a decade ago and it has been universally viewed. 5 movies came after this one in the series and 2 movies came before, yet Prisoner of Azkaban still remains my favorite (and many peoples') Harry Potter movie. This movie is the one of the few in the franchise that tells and completes a story. It deals with Harry uncovering a truth about his past involving his parents' murder, and explores how he adjusts to this truth. Here's what makes that sentence special: was there any mention of Voldemort in that summary? You'd be hard pressed to find any mention of him either in the movie, except in a couple sentences. This movie can be seen as separate from the rest of the Harry Potter movies because it holds up as its own, without having to build up the universe or service the Voldemort storyline at all. It's also the first movie to feature the dark undertones that the first two implied but never fully explored. He must deal with his darkest fears while also dealing with the danger of a murderer seeking to kill him. This is more personal, but this movie ironically deals with time travel better than any sci fi movie I've seen about it because it portrays it in a way that time is immutable, which makes the most sense.TL;DR: Dark and original, Prisoner of Azkaban stands as its own movie without having to build up a universe, while also entertaining in its own right.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
704,Shadowhardt,Book fans beware!,2,13 September 2006,"I can't stand this movie at all! Me and my best friend were complaining so loudly in the cinema that our other friends went and sat in the aisle. The PoA is my all-time favorite book and prolly always will be, I had been looking forward to this movie ever since 2001 when they started making them, and was so disappointed at the lack of faithfulness (or ANY faithfulness) to the books. Our friends were asking us countless questions not the way home because the movie didn't cover enough points and left allot of loose ends untied.Lupin not explaining the Marauders storyline was the ultimate downfall, which was what made the book the best of them all, I was so upset. Lupin looking like an overgrown Hairy Gollum when he was supposed to look like a normal wolf with only a few distinguishing features (tail, eyes etc) also, when they were explaining how Pettigrew was the traitor not Sirius, they didn't really explain the secret keeper charm properly and explained Pettigrew cutting off his finger and transforming into a rat in about a 30 second speech by Sirius. It is so obvious they crammed everything in. The stag at the end was never explained. They say they must cut the movies short or else they'd go on for to long, they had no trouble with Lord of the Rings! 3 hours long and they are considered classics! Oh yeah, the whole set was changed, the fat lady wasn't in a corridor but directly in front of the stairs, they put so much emphasis on that stupid clock and the music was really corny. Professor Trelawney was soooo stupid, she had frizzy hair! Trelawney was always described as sleek, mysterious with shawls and bangles but not, they had to simplify that. They changed the prophesy saying that ""Innocent blood will be spilt"" and no innocent blood was spilt! NONE!!!! About the only thing they did right were the dementors, the scary scenes were brilliant! I blame the director (Alfonso Cuarón) who did just this one film, all the others are fine but the best book is the worst movie and that makes me really mad! All in all, a movie that doesn't explain anything and is totally unfaithful to any form of the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
705,hmarasco,liked the first two better,4,13 March 2006,"I see that I am not the only one to feel that this movie was a let down compared to the first two. Even though the first two movies may have been more child like, the movies where close in context to the book. Like Nara from Japan, I agree that the move seemed rushed and confusing, even to those who have read the books. I went with many people who had never read the books and they where not excited but still commented it was good. I wish the producers/director would have not changed the setting as much and not have changed how the children where represented (the students wore ""muggle clothes"" instead of wizards clothes and other details that made it what makes the book so great). Overall the more I watched the movie the more I understood it but I have read the book and listened to it on audio tape. The darkness topic just goes with the theme, as evil gets stronger, the darker the books are going to get until evil is defeated. As the Potter gang gets older and so do the subjects. It will then be according to the parents of the children watching the movie to determine if the children are mature enough/ understand enough to be watching the movie. That is why parents should supervise their children when they watch movies. The books are by far 20xs better and I would recommend reading them to your kids before watching the movie so your kids won't be so surprised about the theme.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
706,DerekL,Best so far,8,1 June 2004,"A much better plot, and excellent acting by the three pupils - probably because they are now older and therefore more capable - makes this the best of the series so far.With the setting now firmly established (and surely everybody who sees this has already read the books), the beautifully realized and somewhat extended Hogwarts is now relegated to the background. The mechanics of the wizard world and the operation of the school are all observed, but not laboured, allowing the storytelling to flow more easily.Maybe it is the timing of the release, away from the traditional Christmas slot, but the replacement of Columbus as director makes the whole thing less sweet and, ultimately, more satisfying.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It was perhaps somewhat silly during the first 30 minutes, but the film grows darker and more interesting.*****Major spoiler*****I don't remember if this flaw is in the book also or just in the movie, but there is a great flaw when it comes to the time traveling. How can Harry Potter go back in time to save himself when he is already dead? He goes back in time AFTER the dementors has killed him. This makes no sense.

The kids are certainly older, but they still work well enough together, and in some ways their transformations give us something new and fresh to enjoy. The new (to the movies) characters are all fine too. The animation has certainly kept up with the times - Hogwarts is more alive than ever, and Buckbeak is a sight to behold.I only wish the music was stronger. I felt that the track during the most critical and important parts of the plot was ill chosen - it didn't convey the weight of the scenes.

If you have read the book, you'll wonder why they cut as much as they did. The movie could have sustained another 20-30 minutes without becoming excessively long, and the scenes which were cut would have made it a much more cohesive and enjoyable film.Specifics, without spoilers: Dumbledore has about five minutes of on-screen time No explanation is ever given as to who ""Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prong"" are/were. No explanation is given as to how the teacher knows the relevant incantation.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
710,bozobarr,What a wonderful film,10,7 December 2004,"In short -- it's beautiful. Further -- I feel great pain and sorrow to know that the remaining Harry Potter's will not be directed by the one who should've done them all: Alfonso Cuarón. I don't think I can ever watch another Harry Potter film (old or new) again. :-(I'm required to fill out 10 lines of review . . . If you haven't seen a Harry Potter film and you don't know if you want to: See this one. It truly reflects the best book by J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series by being the best Harry Potter film in the series.No words do justice to the beautiful cinematography, impeccable editing, and truly magical performances (it was the first time I didn't grimace every time the young actors spoke -- they truly have learned to become performers).Also, to note, this film didn't convince me why Hermione should like Ron more than Harry. A film or even a book that convinces me of that would be truly brilliant (but this one rocks nevertheless!)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
711,tfilm78,A good adaptation,10,6 November 2005,"I have read all the books so far, and enjoyed all the films so far. I didn't fault the first two films for their almost slavish loyalty to the books. This film, however, made more judicious cuts and a few more slight alterations, and I think it is to be commended for it. This is the first in the series that was truly and adaptation, rather than a transcription. As the books get longer, you can expect more changes as the series gets on, to get each story down to a manageable movie length.In this film, Cuaron keeps a very tight focus. Anything not related to Harry and his friends maturing and becoming young adults, or that doesn't contribute to the story of Sirius Black, is gone. The result is a much tighter story. The film doesn't follow the entire Quidditch season, or include the mystery of who sent Harry a replacement broom and why. In the book, that subplot serves to cast doubt in the audience's mind as to Sirius's guilt, since he obviously sent the broom, but it seems to have nothing wrong with it. That doesn't speed the story along towards its climax, so the gift is moved to the very end. The scene where Lupin confiscates the Marauder's Map was originally set after Harry returns from another forbidden trip to Hogsmeade. Here, he is trying to track down Peter Pettigrew, whom he saw on the map. Therefore, the scene ties much more directly into the main story. And if we weren't told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were, so what? It's not essential to the story. You don't need that to know how Lupin and Black knew how to use the map. I could easily argue that the book was lacking an explanation for how the Weasley twins knew how to use it.Despite not dealing directly with Voldemort, this film, and the book it is based on, mark an important turning point in the series. Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew become important characters later on. Harry begins to grow up. And his relationship with Dumbledore, I think, begins to change as well. As Harry gets older, he needs more mentors than just Dumbledore, and Harry and Dumbledore need to relate to each other as adults, not as a kindly old grandfather to a young child. I think it's appropriate, then, that this is the film where we get a new Dumbledore, and that Gambon brings a new take on the role.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
712,philfor,Good adaptation,6,17 June 2004,"Very faithful adaptation of the book but overall unsatisfying addition to the series. Radcliffe and Watson continue to grow into their roles but Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley has lost his charm. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are utterly wasted with almost no screen time to develop their characters.Michael Gambon is a poor substitute as Dumbledore. Perhaps, he could be replaced by a CGI Dumbledore.The characters of Lupin and Black were well done and certainly carried the film. My rating 6 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

714,supermarioking78,"Not so great,",4,8 July 2006,"Not the best Harry Potter. Here are a couple of reasons, well first, they took out way too many scenes, second, they arranged them in totally different orders and changed the whole story. I agree with some of these comments, because they should get a Director that actually READ the book. Not a Director who just gets the main plot and changes the whole book. The first Harry Potter was far more better than this one because that one at least GOES with the book. All the Harry Potter movies are always missing something very important. In this one, they took out the other Quiddich Match. That's where he ACTUALLY got his Firebolt and beat Ravenclaw. Oh, and they shouldn't change the scenery, that wasn't so smart because everything looks all different.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
715,tewkes_ape,"Alfonso makes a good effort, yet fails to stay faithful to the books.",5,15 July 2007,"If you have not previously read the books, do so before watching, else you shall be even more confused by a film that misses out so much background that it fails to develop the plot correctly.To Concentrate on the Direction of the film Alfonso has made a somewhat more believable effort than efforts of Columbus in HP1 & 2. For starters it appears that Alfonso has understood that it is unusual for students to wear their uniform outside of school, a clear sign that he understands what the films are about a little more.Be prepared however for some stupidly over-blown CGI that sacrifices time in the film that could have been used for better purposes. It is also to be noted that Daniel Radcliffe is placed with two extremely embarrassing scenes that would not have been out of place in ""titanic"".This brings us onto our Actors. The ""trio"" (Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)) who have undoubtedly progressed in Acting ability, while they have been good so far (and have had some awful directors to work with in HP 1 & 2) they show that they are certainly capable in PoA. Emma Watson delivering the best performance of the three in this film showing that she can use expression fully. With some stunning acting from other, older actors, but as other critics say their roles can hardly be called more than ""cameo"" appearances, which is disappointing as such time is wasted with, the aforementioned over-blown CGI.I scored this film as 5 (out of 10) simply due to the fact that it is half-baked, not even half as good as the book, and the adaptation leaves the audience with little satisfaction from it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I'll give the movie 7/10, it really caught my attention and watched in suspension. And for the ""I've read the books, and everything is missing in the movie""-critics! Bite me. This is a movie, not the book you read. If you want to read books, go to the library or bookstore, if you wan't to watch movies, go to the cinema. And don't mix-up the two concepts. I hope the next Potter movies will follow-up to this one, and keep the immature content to a minimum.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
717,x-angel-o,Not the best of the 4 movies,3,13 January 2007,"***may contain spoilers*** I must say that I was rather disappointed with this film. This is my favorite book out of the series, and I was expecting the movie to be as well. I might have been expecting too much, but I just didn't like the movie very much.I'll start off with what I liked. I thought the time turner was done very well. It was a hard thing to do to show people going back in time, and I thought Alfonso did I good job with that. I also thought he did a wonderful job with Buckbeak. He was done very well, and he looked very realistic as well.Now to what I didn't like. I will start by saying that I thought the movie was rushed. I think they didn't want the movie to be very long so they could add more to the time turner and revealing who Sirius and Wormtail really are. But it ruined the movie. I thought the acting wasn't done very well in this movie, and I don't blame the actors. The actors can only do as well as they can with the directions they are given by their director. Harry crying after he found out Sirius was his Godfather was laughable. It didn't sound realistic, and he didn't look at all sad. I didn't feel any amount of pathos for Harry. I actually laughed because of how fake his crying sounded.I found that the numerous scenes with Lupin were unnecessary. They could have showed the relationship between Lupin and Harry a better way than only walks. I also didn't really like the way Harry learned the patronus, but it didn't bother me too much. I didn't like how Harry fell off of his broom during the Quidditch match.Throughout the movie, I didn't get the magical feeling Hogwarts possessed during the 1st and 2nd and even the 4th film. It also didn't feel like the year was progressing. Showing the tree changing seasons was clever, but it didn't make the year feel like it was passing. Harry getting the broom at the end didn't seem very logical because they made it seem like it was the end of the year, and then they're still talking about the Quidditch cup being theirs. Another thing I didn't like was Oliver Wood and Gryffindor not winning the Cup being cut out. I know they can't add everything into a movie, but this was Oliver's big year.One thing that I honestly can't stand is that they didn't mention who the Marauders were. That is a crucial part for Harry since he finds out more about his father, and who his father is. We hear some much about Lily that we wonder about James. This was one of those key character pieces. They could have easily added onto the end a few more minutes about Harry finding out from Lupin that him, James, Sirius, and Wormtail had created the map.Overall, I didn't find this movie very satisfying. Alfonso seemed to focus more on humor than on the darkness and seriousness of the film. Alfonso did an OK job at staying on the main plot and theme, but he could have stayed more on track. I don't think they ever explain thoroughly the relationship Sirius, James, Lupin, and Wormtail had.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
718,FallingDay,A good movie but it does not capture the essence of the first two,10,14 February 2007,"I have to say this is the worst out of all of them in my opinion, but it is still a good movie. I think that this movie is the least exciting, and is the only one that doesn't have much involving Voldemort which i think is what made this a tad less interesting. I also didn't like the demetors but some how it seemed like they were taking the place of voldemort(besides Serious black). What i personally thought was the best part of this movie was when Hermionie punched Malfoy in the face, that was the best part of this movie to me. So to conclude my comment i have to say that it was kind of a let down to the other Harry potter movies but still a good movie",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Not copy, but adaptation. 1st of all. Harry's Hair. Hermione's Hair, The Leacky Cauldron, Knight Bus etc etc etc. I saw Harry Potter World on the Screen, each detail of it, like chairs in The Leacky Cauldon or a knight walkin' from picture to picture on the background. Yes, i didn't see Harry Potter's 3rd book on 100%. I didn't see a story about animages, and Gambon as Dumbledore not so ""dumbledored"", but i see life in his eyes(sorry about Harris, but i need to say that). If u red ""Albus Dumbledore's Big Game"" - huge Russian theory about Harry Potter books, u will see that Gambon is those ""gamer"". Also, i saw atmosphere of HP. Movie - is not a book. I think it's stupid to read a book on the screen. I can read it in my armchair with cup of tea. I want to see a World. I want to see all, what i can only imagine by reading. And i saw it only in Cuaron's film. And it's cool. Thank you Alfonso, for realism and perfect book ADAPTATION.P.S. Sorry for my English. I'm Russian :P",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The visual effects are much better in this film and Cuaron has managed to catch the spirit of the book, even though several scenes are missing. The whole cast is fantastic and I think that Radcliffe has matured soooo much. Best of all was Alan Rickman, who managed to steal every scene he was in, with his wonderfully creepy Professor Snape!! My only complain is that the film is slightly too short and I hope that the DVD will contain an extended version.   10/10 stars",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
721,scarletangel69,Something Wicked This Way Comes...,10,27 May 2004,"This is a wonderful movie. It's very gripping and the special effects are beyond brilliant. It's much darker than the first two, and we are introduced to three new characters, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Professor Trelawney. Oldman, Thewlis and Thomson deliver fantastic performances as the three newcomers... The Dementors are crossovers of Wraiths and dark ghosts, and they left much of the audience in awe. Even though the director left out quite a few of the parts from the book, this movie doesn't disappoint at all. It's fun, and it really captures the imagination of even those who aren't Harry Potter fans.

We were both really disappointed.I understand that for length reasons they would have to condense some things and leave out others, but...There were a number of things that were not done right.The special effects were really good. Most were very believable, especially Buckbeak.They completely left out the parts about Harry, Hermione, and Ron helping Hagrid with the case of Buckbeak.They completely left out Christmas. Instead Harry doesn't get the Firebolt until the very end of the film. They also left out the part at the beginning where Harry goes and sees the Firebolt in Diagon Alley. They left out the Quidditch final. Shall I continue?They also added some things that were not even in the book. They added Harry seeing Peter Pettigrew on the map and going to find him in the school.Overall this was so far off from the book it is crazy. If we did not read the book right before going to see the movie we probably would have enjoyed the movie more. Since we did it was a total distraction.In summary things were left out, things were added, and things were re-arranged.A very disappointing movie for any Harry Potter fan!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
723,Cootercat,Very disappointing,1,20 February 2005,"Disappointing movie. Wasn't faithful to the book, didn't stand on its own merits.Bad enough they had to change the plot to fit into a 2 hour movie. But why invent a scene with Lupin telling Harry how great Lily was? Where does sweetly sick belong in a Harry Potter film? And while I'm on the topic of Lupin, have you ever seen such a fake looking werewolf? Not the part of the movie where I would have expected to laugh.Hogwarts offers its students many educational experiences but a choir? Singing such an unoriginal song ""Something wicked this way comes""??? What was the point? Again, taking precious minutes of footage for something that had nothing to do with the book. I don't get it.On the positive side, the filming location was exquisite. But it didn't justify changing all the surroundings from the first two movies. Bad enough we had to do without Richard Harris as Dumbledore, why did they have to mess with the sets? With a new director coming on board for HP4, maybe things will improve. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
724,nzlegend,a mixed review,7,9 July 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a ""fan film"". By this I mean the makers have made the assumption the majority of viewers, the core audience - are fans of the Potter series. As a stand alone film would leave a viewer confused by a fast moving plot devoid of a lot of detail contained in the original book which the film quite closely follows. To fully appreciate the movie, prior knowledge through reading the book would be most beneficial, it would allow you to fill in the many blanks.Concepts, background, and explanations are skipped in the movie, which gives it a rushed, incomplete feeling, even for a Potter fan. Users have commented the movie is darker, this is somewhat true, it definitely has a different feel from the first two films, much of this can be attributed to the new director. He has changed the sets considerably, to the point where they barely resemble the first tmo films. The fine cast of adult stars is under utilized throughout the film. Maggie Smiths role could be considered a cameo for the limited screen time she got.Overall the rest of the film is acceptable. If I didn't previously know the plot I would rate this film lower than I did. Though this IS Harry Potter and he still has the midas touch.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
725,emeraldmist,A Horrible Disappointment!,3,5 June 2004,"This movie would be too dark for a child less than 8 years old but too childish for anyone over 12. The effects were horrible, the plot line disjointed, and the screenplay a far cry from the book. I a 24 year old, avid reader and huge fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies. Now I understand that it is a large book and it is impossible to literally translate a book to the screen but Chris Columbus did a great job with the first two films.I have never been so let down by a film in my life. If you haven't read to book recently I feel that you would be lost for the most part, so much is left out. However if you have read the book, you spend so much of the movie lamenting the wonderful material that was butchered for this production.Now the acting, rarely have I seen such ""over-acting"" in such a heralded movie. The reactions of the actors, young and old alike, brought to mind old cartoons with bulging eyes, melodramatic crying, and buffoonish grins. I spent most of the movie thinking how the acting and character portrayal was so much better in the two previous films. Please bring back Chris Columbus, and please consider that most of the fans of Harry Potter, immaterial of age, like the series because of it's well written, well thought out story lines, and please try to stay true to that. I would thoroughly enjoy an epic long film or even a two part film released separately or together, for the remaining four films if only they stay true to the wonderful spirit that J. K. Rowling so artfully and lovingly created in our hearts.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
726,thunderflare22,"Good, but not great",8,7 June 2004,"On its own, this movie was good. But for the large majority of people who have read the book, and/or seen the other two films, this was a letdown in my opinion. This does not mean it was a complete failure, or even anything close to it. I still enjoyed it very much. However, this film (unlike the other two) strayed from the book at several places (some of them major). I have read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it, and having the movie leave out or change so many parts was very disappointing. Also, I felt that the story was very rushed and fragmented. It jumped from scene to scene with little or no transition. It wasn't until the climactic ending portion that it actually elaborated on anything. Finally, I agree with the people who say the the new director has seriously cut back on the sense of magic and wonderment which was found in the first two. It's focused too much on the story (the much altered, and choppy one at that) to pay much attention to any ""frills"", which are much needed in a movie like this one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
727,gdozzi,"Maybe a little bit of lag towards the end, but very enjoyable.",8,13 June 2004,"I should start by saying that I really enjoyed the film. As many people are saying, it is a little bit more ""mature"" and even ""dark"" than the first two, a transition which I think worked out fairly well (though I still appreciate the first two for their own value). My biggest impression was that it really grabbed me at first (partially from having noticed the changes in style), but wasn't quite as exciting at the end. I was really looking forward to seeing Gary Oldman's performance, but was slightly disappointed to see that he wasn't in too much of the film. What part he did play, though, was quite good. I should also probably note that I say all of this having not read the book, so I don't really have any complaints as to what was left out, etc., and I'm inclined to think that it's probably better that way.

I didn't know if the movie would be better than the first two or not but Alfonso Cuaron did the movie just as good if better. I recommend going to see this move. As always Dan, Rupert, Emma, and Robbie play there parts well but I was surprised about how good David Thewlis played Lupin he was awesome and was meant for the role. Gary Oldman played Sirius well but he looked a little too old for the part but who cares anyway. Micheal Gambon was just as good as Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Emma Thompson was great as Prof. Trelwany. I recommend again to go see this movie.10 OUT OF 10-Hands Down",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
729,dragon_mistress9,A truly magical movie experience! *may contain spoilers*,10,22 October 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of both the Harry Potter movies, as well as the books written by acclaimed author J.K. Rowling. This movie was directed by Alfonso Cuaron, whereas the first two films were directed by Chris Columbus, and I find there is quite a bit of a difference--a very good one.Upon entering their third year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who is amazing in this film), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), the trio finds out that there is a wizard by the name of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban. He is legendary as he once killed thirteen muggles in a city street with a single curse.This movie proves to be the darkest of the three in both the atmosphere, but also the content. The group of kids behind me in the theatre were crying when the dementors came on screen! The dementors are, of course, the guards of Azkaban prison, and as such need to be terrifying and powerful. The cinematographers did a wonderful job at creating the dementors; they're just as I pictured them to be. They're quite similar to the ring wraiths in Lord of the Rings, only you get to see a bit more detail when the souls get sucked from the victims.Some of the new characters in the film are Professor Trelawney (brilliantly cast by a batty Emma Thompson), Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and of course, replacing the late and beloved Richard Harris is Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore. Gambon does a good job, giving Dumbledore a slightly more mysterious air about him, but he is still no Harris.Among the greatest achievements in this film have got to be the scenes where Harry flies Buckbeak the hippogriff, the scenes where the dementors swoop in on Harry in big groups, and the Knight Bus was truly entertaining, as well as its driver, Ernie Prang (Jimmy Gardner), a pimply-faced wizard by the name Stan Shunpike (Lee Ingleby), and the very amusing Shrunken Head, voiced by Lenny Henry.Over all, if you want to see action, good acting, amazing special effects, and a good, imaginative story all rolled up into one, go see this one-hundred-forty-one minute movie. It's sure to please!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
730,mep32,Excellent although flawed - contains spoilers,8,28 November 2005,"An excellent adaptation, with the necessary darker feel to it from the first two films. The cast keeps improving with each film, although Daniel Radcliffe still struggled with the emotional outbursts - ""He was their friend and he betrayed them"" a little cringe-making. Also, Draco was far too afraid too quickly of Hermione in the fight scene - good punch though. I don't think this was a fault in the actor, but rather a fault in the direction.Most of the film was a joy - I especially liked the change of location - Scotland has never been more beautiful. The look of the film was definitely an improvement on the earlier ones, enjoyable though they were. More excellent performances from the adults but sadly the teachers still didn't have enough to do. I would have preferred a little more of Snape that's for sure - Alan Rickman is always watchable. The main flaw shared by the first two films was too slow a pace and too many schmalzy scenes with the three leads grinning at each other and giving long looks to camera. This has all gone (thankfully). Also, the plot was a lot pacier and exciting. David Thewlis made an excellent Lupin although it might have been nice to see a little more of Snape's hatred for him and why - especially as there is some clue as to why he hates Harry so much. There were hints of ""just like your father"" but no explanation as to how awful James Potter and Sirius Black had been to Snape during their youth. Also, although I greatly enjoyed the look of the film, I was rather sad that the kids were not in their robes. It is often commented in the books that Wizards don't know how to dress in muggle clothing and tend to look odd, even when not in robes. The fact that they all dressed normally tended to make a nonsense of this.The PoA, even though very enjoyable, had SERIOUS plot holes (no explanation as to the identities of the authors of the Marauder's Map - ""Moony (Lupin), Wormtail (well we know that one now), Padfoot (Sirius Black) and Prongs (James Potter, Harry's Dad) or of why they had these nicknames (they were all animaguses (animagi?) apart from Lupin and had all trained to become one out of deep friendship so that Lupin would not be alone when he was in his werewolf stage) and these were descriptions of their animal identities - Prongs was a stag padfoot the black dog and wormtail the rat) and, consequently, no explanation as to why Harry's Patronus was a stag (like James Potter as Prongs) or why this was the main reason he thought his dad had summoned the patronus to save them). This was the worst plot hole imaginable in what was otherwise an excellent third film. These quibbles aside - a truly enjoyable film of what is still my favourite book. - Not as good as Goblet of Fire though!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
731,midnight_rose73,"A bit rough around the edges, but it's still better than the other two",10,20 September 2004,"'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' opens with the young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), under the covers of his bed, doing what most mischievous 13-year-old boys have done at some point or another in the dead of night (Reading! Sheesh!). We're amused to see that Harry's Uncle Vernon is too stupid to catch him (as the villain always is), and so the film begins!Harry, who always seems to get himself into trouble, doesn't disappoint us in this movie. He 'accidentally' blows up his Aunt Marge, and is now on the run from the Ministry of Magic, whom he is certain will expel him from Hogwarts. Harry decides to take the Knight Bus, a violently purple triple decker bus, to London to retrieve some coinage from his vault. Now, the Knight Bus was pretty cool... at first. However, it got old quickly, and the shrunken Jamaican head began to grind on my nerves within 30 seconds. The entire scene was dragged out much too long.While on the Bus, Harry is told all about Sirius Black, the dangerous murderer who escaped from Azkaban; a feat never before achieved. Harry quickly finds out from Daddy Weasley that Sirius is after him, but Harry isn't overly concerned. Why should he be? He's a teenager! It's an age- old tradition that we ignore the sensible advice of elders.Harry boards the train, but his pleasure soon turns into misery when the Dementors get on the train to check for Sirius Black. What are Dementors? Good question, and a difficult one to answer. They're faceless, they can fly, and they look scary. Enough said!This film in jammed- pack with action, excitement, and... love. Make way for the hormones, because Ron and Hermione have already begun to not- so- subtlety crush on one another. The full extent of their relationship in the books were arguments, which OF COURSE means they love each other (*rolls eyes*). In this film, however, they begin holding hands and hugging, and even their bickering is borderline- cute.The art direction in this film is fantastic. The exterior is completely different, yet more natural. You actually believe that the kids are at a bordering school in Scotland as you watch. It's rustic, yet colourful and alive. Cuaron pulled it off in a way that no other director could, ESPECIALLY Columbus. A particularly impression CGI was Buckbeak, a hippogriff. Buckbeak looked so real, I was tempted to believe that hippogriffs really DO exist, and somehow the crew managed to cage a wild one. The acting of all the children has greatly improved. Radcliffe, in particular, has taken strides. He had a few poorly done scenes, such as when he blew up Aunt Marge in the kitchen. Another one that comes to mind was the infamous 'crying scene,' which was the source of so much grief at many a message board. Word of Advice, Dan: If you can't cry, kindly as your make-up artist for some tear inducer! Honestly, kids were LAUGHING at him at the showing I went to! However, I can't just criticize. His body language and his entire approach to the character seemed much more natural in this movie, and so I applaud him!Two new actors joined the cast this year: Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis, as Harry's intelligent Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Both were extremely well- casted, ESPECIALLY Thewlis. In conclusion, this film was great. It is much better than the previous two, yet it still has its flaws. However, watch it for it's beautiful art direction and well- done CGI characters!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
732,kemberm,the best potter movie yet,9,23 June 2004,"OK, first off, those of you who have read the books and are complaining that the movie doesn't follow the book, you all need to settle down and back off. Who cares if the movie didn't follow the book. The movie isn't a direct copy of the book, that would take too long and would cost much, much more. Instead, the movie, like most adaptations of books, is merely based on the book. Who cares that there wasn't as much Quidditch or there weren't as many fights between Ron and Hermione. It's only a movie, strictly for entertainment purposes. They weren't competing for a special reward for following the book word for word. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN FILM!!! There are some things that are better expressed as actual objects instead of just words on a page. As for the movie, I thought that it was the best one of the trilogy. Cuarón is a much better director than Columbus. The third movie is full of more style than the previous two movies combined. Columbus relied more on the editing while Cuarón concentrates more on the Dogma95 aspect of cinematography (although it isn't true Dogma) Basically anyone who appreciates the true nature of film technique, not the Hollywood version chuck full of editing and special effects, will appreciate this movie more than the others. Anyone who wants to contact me and talk about the technical aspects of this film, feel free. For those who are going to complain about the story content of the movie shouldn't even bother.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
733,laura_p52,WOW!!!,10,4 June 2004,"I was very very surprised with the quality of this movie. Cuaron is just what the series needed, he is fantastic director,I don't mind the changes in the Griffindor entrance, or the location of W. Willow or Hagrid's Hut, or the fact that Harry got his Firebolt at the end of the term or other situations of the book that got the ax because of time limitations. I say that those arguments against the movie are miscellaneous, even when I adore the books and in fact have read them 5 times each. The scenery, the special effects are better, the camera angles, the movie is funnier, darker, and much more enjoyable to watch and it is not only because the story is better. Well yes the story is much better than the previous books but Cuaron had a lot do with the fact that The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 3. Also, I have to add the magnificent cast who were perfect in every way in their portrayals, Dan Radcliffe(Harry), Emma Watson(Hermione), Rupert Grint(Ron), Gary Oldman(the Prisoner), Maggie Smith(Prof. Minerva M.), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), David Thewlis(Lupin) and even Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) for which I had reservations(because I wanted another actor who portrayed another wizard ""Gandalf"") but he was also very good and exceeded my expectations just as the movie has. I give this movie a 10 and hope Cuaron does come back to direct the Order of the Phoenix or one of the other remaining stories and I also hope for no more changes in the actors PLEASE the series would never be the same if they change any of the actors who portray the main characters.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
734,maulik_ranolia,Its a good film but nothing compare to their predecessors,1,17 June 2004,"i think the idea of changing the director (chris columbus-:HP-1 & HP-2)has completely demented that sensitivity,emotionality and of course its incomparable MAGIC from its formal versions.Alfonso is indeed a very good director but(and there's always a BUT)he does'nt seems to be feet on columbus shoe.Many changes are followed in this film from that of the BOOK.A Very abrupt Ending(i think he <alfonso> wants to give harry his firebolt after having won quidditch cup and completing his 3rd yearP.S. -: No DUMBLEDORE at the end to give confusing ADVICE (Urgh...)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
735,kbrown7566,"Favorite Book, Loved The Movie",10,9 June 2004,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series (so far), so I must admit that I was anxious to see this movie. Though there were scenes that I would have liked to see from the book, I loved this movie. The imagery in terms of the dementors was excellent, they were scarier even then I thought they would be. The cast was great and the director handled the job superbly. For the first time, I did not find the movie dull or too slow. Scenes were rearranged and deleted from the book, but all in all it was a great adaptation.The purpose of the movie is to bring to life the characters in the novel and an individual's interpretation of what the key elements of novel are, not a visual regurgitation of every scene. Great job and I look forward to seeing it again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
736,Drychtnath,"A Treat For Fans, Mediocre For Others",6,1 January 2005,"I'm not particularly a fan of Harry Potter, although I understand the over-hype and fever thats hit the young impressionable youths of the world. The movies are always just a little over-rated due to the expectancy of them. Yet regardless of this they remain entertaining with a good contrast of British cast with only a few exceptions (Oldman). I acknowledge Gary Oldman as a good actor for his diversity of roles (Murder In The 1st - 5th Element) and he plays his role very well in this. Daniel Radcliffe is a bit weak in the lead and although it is a role that carries pressure with it hand in hand he does his best. Radcliffe for his age is not a bad actor but not a very good one, the same could be said for his counterparts (Grint and Watson). Although this cannot be overcome the fact the cast is mainly youngsters takes a chip of the overall acting quality as none of them are outstanding, and few satisfactory. The movie is made primarily for youngsters, the dark contrast of Cuaron's directing clashes with this leaving a mixed mood of film. This is not always a bad thing but for something that should be consistent its a disadvantage. Grint adds some comic relief whilst Watson looks good for the young men watching. The Potter films are average in an ever growing fantasy genre but will be forgotten soon after the hype which is catapulting it to such success that the second movie is the third highest grossing. Then again Titanic wasn't the greatest piece of film art, when putting any Harry Potter film next to any Lord of The Rings film it puts into context the sheer mediocrity of the Potter films, only catapulted to such extreme success due to the volatile and fickle interests of a young and naive audience. Overall, entertaining if your into fantasy, average if your not. 6.7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
737,ruhnas,Best Harry POtter Film,8,9 June 2004,"Possible Spoilers hereinI saw the movie for the first time the day after it came out and I'll probably see it again multiple times. The movie itself is not an epic but it didn't need to be. It wasn't as good as Return of the King (or any of LOTR for that matter) but it was far and away better that the first two movies. It left out a couple of things that HP Geeks like myself found important (like Lupin explaining who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were, and introducing Cho Chang as a character) but the filmmakers obviously didn't want to drag the movie out longer than it needed to be especially with having to push the release date back due to the passing of Richard Harris. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban accomplishes what it needed to in order to appeal to the geeks, the casual readers and the non-readers all at the same time. It's not Best Picture material but a Harry Potter movie shouldn't be. It should just be a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy and thats what this is. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
738,i-r-habets,Excellent!,9,3 June 2004,"Wow! This one's really good, by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies. Criticising a film based on a book is always difficult. After all, there are two ways to look at it: you can compare it with the book, or you can look at it forgetting about the book and rate is as a film as such (which, of course, is almost impossible if you have read the book). This one turns out very good either way. Whereas in The Chamber of Secrets it looked like possibly all the wrong choices had been made concerning what to include and - most of all - what to exclude from the film, here this very difficult task is done perfectly. The film would become a couple of hours longer if the director should choose to include everything (we're not even talking about the next two parts...), so you have to make choices. And yes, this means that a lot about the classes, the yearly competition, the frictions between our main characters, Hagrid's creatures, the trips to Hogsmeade etc is left out, the director concentrates on the plot. And this he does in an excellent way. Although it is a rather complicated story, it is brought to you as clear as, well, anything. Even the time travel part, which is done perfectly. OK, one remark: the whole story about Potter sr and his friends could or should have gotten a little more attention and explication. There are a couple of points where the film deviates from the book, but always in a supportive and OK manner. Two more compliments. Harry Potter in the books starts to become a more and more annoying teenager, not to say an insufferable jerk (is it adult's eyes reading a children's book?); here there's nothing of that, he remains sympathetic all the way. Although I must say that this gets worse especially in the next books, and certainly in the Phoenix-one. Secondly, and more important. I hate - and I mean HATE - digital effects. That has got nothing - and I repeat myself: NOTHING - to do with making a film. Just a cheap trick, and that was a bad (and commercial) band in the seventies already... Of course it's unavoidable here, and I must say that it is done in a brilliant way. The effects really are perfect. Well, you can see it is fake (how could you not?), but it's not disturbing, even nice to see. So even as you look at it as just a film and forget about the book it's a pleasure to watch. Can't imagine that little children have any fun when watching it, though. But that is not my problem...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
739,patelmd7272,Wow,6,30 January 2012,"Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as ""Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs."" I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think ""Wow, how young they all are, how naive."" The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path.All in all, I loved the new direction and the movie itself. I can't wait 'till the next one comes out.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
740,tylerny73,Best of three.,8,23 November 2004,This is definitely the best Harry Potter movie to date. I am actually quite surprised that this film got by the MPAA with only a PG rating (It really feels like it should have been PG-13.) And that's a good thing. Cuaron's direction is much darker than Columbus' previous two and the three main leads seem more comfortable in there roles than ever before. The performances are much stronger and the subject matter is much more developed than what we've come to expect from this franchise. Cuaron's transitions between scenes and the note on which he ends the film (Does anyone remember freeze-frames?) really add to the visual style and in my opinion give the film a much more ominous impact. Not to mention that there is barely a frame in this film with any sunlight (Think Tim Burton's Batman.) The end result is a very engrossing and entertaining mainstream film that will be enjoyed by even the most sophisticated moviegoer but may actually scare the little ones a bit!,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
741,FightClub4995,Much better style than the others.,7,5 June 2004,"I just saw Harry Potter 3. Wow, a lot of changes, in a good way. First off, Daniel Radcliffe's acting is still as crappy as usual, but not as bad as Malfoy. The thing that amazed me the most was the very different style of cinematography, which is dark, grainy, and much better than Columbus's boring Directing. You can definitely see the change. Well, unfortunately this movie started off a little slow. I felt like there was a lot of missing material and was a bit to short (142 min), considering how big the book is. There was not as much action or comedy in this installment which left it a bit bland. Bottom line is: Slower than the other HPs, better Directing, still crap acting (Daniel Radcliffe). This may be worth seeing if your family takes you, otherwise not. Much better quality than the other HPs. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
742,sleepwithyourpeepersopen,Feel thoroughly pleased.,10,2 June 2004,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI saw the movie last night at a 10pm showing. I had read reviews and was expecting anything from a gamut of so terrible I would storm out and so wonderful I'd melt. I think I feel more of the latter. OK, so I could drone on that the movie didn't follow the exact guidelines of the books, but I think that Cuarón captured the heart of the book perfectly.As a fan of the books it is amazing to see your thoughts become real, I was especially pleased to not only see Hermione thump Malfoy, but also that his head hit the stone behind him!The most touching part on the movie were the scenes with Harry and Sirius, both Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman play their parts spectacularly. I had tears in my eyes when Harry said that he would like to live with Sirius in the country so he could see the sky. It was made even more touching by knowing what happens in OotP.While the scenes at the Dursleys were short they were what they have been in the past two films, the performances are pleasant, though not a very integral part of the film. Bravo to Pam Ferris for getting just right the horridness of Aunt Marge.It is quite amazing to see how the Hogwarts students have grown since Chamber of Secrets, I was particularly stuck by Radcliffe's aging in the quidditch scene (and is it me, or does he resemble slightly Elijah Wood?!) It is good to see the actors grow with their characters, I honestly can't imagine them being replaced as no one else would ""fit"".Michael Gambon gives a good performance as Dumbledore given the few scenes he is actually in.Alan Rickman has managed to make Snape even eviler, despite spending a minute dressed in drag! He captured the spitefulness of Snape in this movie, which grows - if possible - even more.David Thewlis did an extraordinary job of playing Lupin, I could easily believe the part was written just for him. One thing I noticed was when he was packing up to leave the way he talked about ""people like him"" reminded me of the bigotry surrounding gay people, it seemed to me that was what they were aiming for so the the moral of the part of the story line was don't judge people on what they are but on *who* they are.For some light comic relief Lenny Henry - as the shrunken head in the Knight Bus - and Dawn French - as the new Fat Lady - were hilarious. And Emma Thompson as Trelawney had me laughing non-stop. I found also that Rupert Grint did an excellent job at Ron's mostly unintentional humour.Timothy Spall was OK as Pettigrew, I feel they could have let his scene extend a little, but he worked well with the time he had.I did enjoy the whole time-travel part, it wasn't confusing but did actually make sense, what with the stone-throwing and Hermiones ""I thought I just saw...never mind.""I saw the movie with my brother and mum, my brother like me has read the books and felt the movie justified them, my mum has not read the books, but was able to follow the story line and intricacies of the plot to the letter, I didn't even tell her about the bits the movie left out of the story (which I had done with the first two books) because I really do feel that this movie really did get the book and turn it into the ideal movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
743,lady-eleanor,I've seen it more than once - so should you! 10/10,10,23 June 2004,"Anyone who disses this movie is clearly a bitter lord of the rings fan or too proud to want to like it. The actors have grown into their roles so much more, and even though Rupert Grint's character Ron hasn't grown much, Rupert definitely has grown as an actor and is clearly the most natural of the three leads. And as much as i HATE Emma Watson, even she is really good in this film, making you forget about the ham she was in the first two. The biggest improvement however is in Daniel Radcliffe, who has improved incredibly and even drew tears in his emotional scenes from may in the audience. Tom Felton is also particularly good as Draco, and I think he is the most professional out of all of the child actors. Hey, even Fred and George are funny now, (though still not doing justice to the twins in the book). Although a little from the book has been cut, I have heard that it will be revealed through the other movies, and it just makes it more exciting for shrewd audience members to work things out for themselves. The story is a lot easier to follow than the Philosophers Stone, it is more fluent and carries the audience through the story nicely.As for those complaining that the famous adult actors do not appear a lot, I would like to remind them that this film is about the children and not the celebrities, and that the story has not been lost by reducing their screen-time - the kids have improved so much they hardly need the support of the adults. I would also like to mention that David Thewlis has one of the biggest parts in the movie and was absolutely perfect as Professor Lupin, I completely warmed to him even though he didn't look exactly as I imagined, and the relationship between him and Harry is very believable and wonderful to watch developing.Anyone who told you this film was darker was right - the atmosphere of the whole film is gloomier and scarier, and the dementors are horrifying and too realistic, and even as an adult i find one particular part hard to watch.This film is a LOT funnier than the other two, despite also being darker. Rupert Grint is a comical genius, inspiring laughter in every scene and gets the audience in stitches at the simplest of lines. Even Daniel and Emma get their fair share of laughs too, which is something we haven't seen before.Alfonso Cuaron could not have done a better job of repairing Columbus' botched-job in directing this movie. No longer are the children wearing foul, early 90s clothes, but they are dressed more casually which gives the film a more natural film. The CGI is so much better, and half the time I thought that the Hippogriff was real, it was so authentic. Little touches such as showing the season changes were humorous and visually awesome.I honestly can't find a reason why people other than the aforementioned would not enjoy this movie, I can see it will become a classic, and if the movies continue to improve at this rate we are going to have some incredible films on our hands.This definitely deserves some awards this year, 10/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
744,fred-deklein,Such a shame,5,10 August 2004,"Hi there, sorry to throw a spanner in the reviews of the people that did like it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with it. The good things were the special effects, but even then, I was more impressed with the effects in ""The chamber of secrets"". I thought the movie was too grey/dark in it's setup, and it did not even scratch the surface of the book. Now I know this is normally the case, but I think the first 2 movies were a bit more following the lines of the books.Overall I thought it was a waste of time, and I really have to think hard about seeing the next one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
745,psilive4jesus,Probably the best yet! (SPOILERS),10,8 June 2004,"I was amazed at this movie! I am so pleased about the latest movie installment in the Harry Potter Series! Alfonso is the new director and puts a different spin on the whole thing and shows a lot more emotion than Chris ever would have! Rupert Grint is Hilarious! (I don't want to tap dance for the spiders!!!) and I think the film really needed some comic relief considering that it is quite a dark storyline. Emma is great. She really softens down in this and starts to act a bit more girly (is that what my hair really looks like from the back???)which is good because this is the book where they all start to grow up. I think Emma definitely did Hermione justice! Well Done!Daniel Radcliife was amazing! A lot of people said that he was really overeactive about the whole situation and that crying, yelling and screaming was too much. I for one can understand why he would be that mad. He isn't acting selfish or like a spoiled or conceited brat. He is just reacting to everything around him. I mean learning that his dad's best friend had betrayed his parents to death, anyone would be that angry?Some things that I was disappointed with. There was very little Quidittch which was surprising. Alfonso really musn't have paid attention to the previous movies because Hagrids hut and the gryffindor common room had magically moved locations! Also, the Fat Lady and Tom (The Leaky Cauldron innkeeper)were played by different people. But, it was still a brilliant movie! I give it a 9.3/10 because of Alfonso's slip ups! but, it is still better than the other two!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
746,jason-586,The third movie is even less like the book than the second...,4,6 June 2004,"Did Rowling have to write another ""Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban"" for the film? It certainly has some likeness to the book, I'll say that much. In fact, there was some scenes after the werewolf that were what I had imagined it to be from the book, though that's nearly the end of the film. The rest of it, however was comprised of a rewritten story or highlights from parts of the book not shown in the movie. What did they film then? I guess you could say they showed enough highlights in the story that when piecemealed together, made it a movie. But there are some things in the movie that they touched only lightly on that never had any explanation in the film. Who is Messrs Moony Wormtail Padfoot & Prongs? Well okay, I guess if you watch the movie, you just think it's another Rowling name for a group of mischievous wizards. You'd never consider that Moony is Lupin the werewolf, Wormtail is Pettigrew the rat, Padfoot is Black the dog and Prongs is Potter the Pronghorn. Nor would you consider at that point, they were old school chums. What was the big deal about the Firebolt? Well if you just watched the movie, you'd think it was just an equivalent replacement to Harry's splintered nimbus 2000. You'd never hear about it at the beginning of the story and how it might be enchanted with charms or curses when he gets it before the second gryffindor quidditch match and has to ride an old worn-out broom. In fact, you would never know that he got to ride it on the third quidditch match and take home the quidditch cup at the end. At least in the chamber of secrets, the only major cut they made was Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party. But it seemed such a shame that they use such a wonderful actor to play Sir Nicholas only to take away his moment in the story. I am certain that people who have not read the book will find the movie quite interesting, yet somewhat puzzling. For the readers of this story, you may have also found it disappointing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
747,Swordgator,What a Joke.,3,9 June 2004,"After waiting an extra week to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban so I didn't have to see it with screaming children I came out of the cinema feeling deeply disappointed. *spoilers onwards*The film seems to throw the book into the bin and follow up by throwing a burning stick in there after it. The opening sequence was pathetic, Harry is practising magic at the beginning of the film, anyone who has read the books knows that underage wizards are not allowed to do this. The film even wants to point this out to us, as five minutes later we are told that Harry is not allowed to magic outside of school by his uncle... but wait? What had he just been doing?we are then suddenly greeted by Aunt Marge, this could of been a lot more subtle with this, instead they dived in two footed (soccer/football reference) and threw dialoge about that made no sense, in the book Harry and his Uncle get into a little spat before Aunt Marge arrives, and Harry is very cocky knowing he has the upper hand in the argument to get his permission slip to go into hogsmeade signed, however he suddenly brings this slip out, hands it to his Uncle and asks him to sign it, and he is told if he is good his uncle with sign it. This would never happen. and then as his uncle walks away Harry makes a remark that in the book is in struggle to get the permission slip signed.Skipping on a bit, Harry is meant to be in Magnolia cresent, where Sirius first appears, in the book Harry feels he is being watched, spins round and sees nothing, same thing happens and he sees the outline of a great big black dog. In the film, the wind picks up, the swings start to move, the lights go out, and he sees the dog, who starts Barking at him, this dog is meant to be Sirius, and why would Sirius bark at his God-son? again it makes no sense. Harry doesn't signal for the knight bus but it came anyway.With the knight bus I felt they added the shrunken head just to give Lenny Henry a part. There was no need for it, Ernnie the driver speaks for himself in the book, why not in the film. The bus in my view looked great. But didn't act how it was portrayed in the book, in the book things jumped out of its path, in this it stopped things.Only one thing annoyed me on the train is where Lupin didn't say any incarnation to produce the patronus.We get to school and apart from the song which added nothing to the film, but the feast was generally well done, the Fat Lady portrait had moved, and if the screen play writer or director even bothered to look at the book, or even the two previous films, it was located at the top of a staircase (not very well hidden is it?)we have quite a good time here until the first Quidditch match, where they play Hufflepuff with the most stupid looking goggles in the world. Hermione is meant to put a spell on Harry's glasses to repel water, which comes up in Order of the Pheonix. Then we completely forget about Quidditch from here, we don't even find out who won! (if you're still wondering but haven't read the book, it was Hufflepuff)The Maurders map was well done although, the whole seeing Peter Pedittgrew on the map by Harry kinda ruins the surprise that he is still alive and kind takes momentum away from the ending.The complete absence of Hagrids trial was a joke, the Buckbeak/Malfoy incident is a big sub-plot in the book and the film manages to sum it all up (badly) in one scene in which Hagrid is skipping stones across the lake.Christmas doesn't happen this year at Hogwarts, where Ron and Hermione's feud really starts to kick off, Harry doesn't receive the firebolt and the enquire isn't made as to whether Sirius black sent it.Guess what... No end of year exams at Hogwarts this year, The end of year exams is when the Prophecy was meant to be made, but no, this is made when Hermione storms out, and Harry not liking his divination teacher at all finds it in the goodness of his heart to return the crystal ball which has fallen down numerous flights of stairs and off of a table without smashing to the teacher where she gives Harry her prophecy.The end, harry receives a Firebolt? From who exactly? Sirius? Surely then it would be checked out, as only Dumbledore, Lupin, Ron, Hermione and Harry know Sirius is innocent it kinda ruins it again, and the train ride home, Where Harry receives a letter from Sirius with a signed Permission slip so he can go into hogsmeade next year, and Ron who gets the owl that brought the letter, is left out. Which means the next film (Goblet of Fire) will have to cover this and point out that Sirius gave Ron the Owl and Harry permission to go to Hogsmeade, so we Goblet of Fire start on the train back home from Hogwarts?Overall the film was a huge let down, and I suggest you don't read the book before watching it, and don't let the special effects fool you, it's a very mediocre film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
748,jafitzpatrick,Good but not great,7,10 June 2004,"I mildly enjoyed it, but all this fuss about it being better than the first two is not true.If you have not seen the movie or read the book, I recommend seeing the movie first and then letting the book fill in the gaps for you.The movie's breakneck pace is too fast - you never have time to properly understand or savor anything. It's always ""on to the next thing, quick!"". Most of the characters besides Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lupin are cameos, including Dumbledore, McGonnagall and Snape. There is no depth.Questions answered in the book are not answered here. Why does Lupin know about the Marauder's Map? Who created the map? Why is the Patronus a stag?How does Harry trust Sirius after, oh about thirty seconds, without an adequate explanation? What potion does Lupin take and why? What is Snape's connection to Lupin? Why and how are there so many Animagi? Who is that crazy knight cavorting around the paintings? The list goes on and on. The film is good but the book is a far richer experience.There were other items I found irritating. Harry can't use magic at home, but the movie opens with him practicing a spell. X! The Whomping Willow is smaller now, in a different location and is a breeze to sneak past. XX! Crabbe and Goyle are both in the film, but Malfoy ends up most of the time hanging around with Crabbe and some other kid??

749,serodores,OK,6,10 June 2004,"Even more so than the previous movies, tons of content from the book was completely ripped out for the movie. In addition, more content was added that was not in the book, which the other movies didn't even really do, and this movie had it in bucket loads. Some of the twists were interesting, but at the expense of some of the important scenes in the book, they were unjustified. Although, it may be possible there are many additional scenes on the DVD or something, many of my friends seem to think this was possibly the worst of their movies so far. Personally, I also felt the movie to be a bit shorter than it could have been (length wise) and due to the increasing age bracket they wish to target, I don't see any reason with making it a bit longer than it was.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Generally I have not been disappointed. Obviously when you do an adaptation of a very successful series of books, you are bound to have missed a few things out, and rely on the viewer to bridge some gaps, but I felt that in Prisoner of Azkaban, the story could have put a few things in that were in the book. For example, in the film, it didn't really mention that Hermione and Ron were going to be in London but in the book it did. But this is only a minor point and I thought the film kept to the book pretty much faithfully. The acting is so much better this time round from the children and of course Snape is the best still, although Trelawny was a close second! Poor old Dumbledore was never going to be the same, but he still had that little charm about him. Overall, I gave this film 8 out of 10 as it was entertaining as a film on its own, and gave a good account of the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I love the fact that it is darker than the other ones and the characters are more mature (haven't read the book.. i guess in the book it is like that). The only think I didn't like was some of the effects that seemed so fake considering the mega budget for a HP film. They really have to improve on it, specially on the animals. And there were some shots, specially in the ones when Hermione is held by the tree that look so horrible and in the room you could hear a big laugh for the horrible shot.Gary Oldman looks great on it, the best of actors in the movie. For sure this series of movies will not last forever but this one so far is the best of Harry Potter.

Harry Potter is the biggest cash cow in the history of entertainment in any medium, and Warner Bros. has a good grip.It has only been a few years that the big studios have discovered that ""value added"" DVDs are the best thing for bottom lines since popcorn. This revelation has led to 3 (three!) separate releases of the Rings Trilogy (so far) -- each with successively more ""value"" treats: footage, making-of's, documentaries, voice-track commentaries, stills, etc.The first 2 HP movies have so far only been sold as the theatrical release DVD. But we have seen the ad photos of the ""value added"" versions. They'll be here soon. And we've seen a new edited version of SS/PS on NBC once (but not in their re-broadcast.) This means it is worth more $ as a DVD than NBC could afford. It also means that by movie 3 (and probably 2) they shot at least 1 and probably 3 hours of narrative footage to be re-edited into a PLATINUM or TITANIUM edition sometime in 2006. It means that the story holes in the theatrical release will be filled in to be enjoyed in the comfort of our own homes. It means the unexplained character shifts will be revealed as more deliberate and thoughtful acting choices. It means we might see Paul Whitehouse after all.. And it means Goblet of Fire will be shot as a 5-6 hour movie, released as a 2:20 movie with plot gaps and missing characters. It means we will all buy the theatrical release on DVD; then we will buy the Extended Version DVD; then we will buy the I-VII set on 23 DVDs in an album with ruminations and interviews with long dead or retired Brit actors. It means that the movies we stand in line to see in the theaters will never be the whole movies, or the ""real"" movies -- and certainly not the best Hollywood can do. Warners will save that for the Diamond Anniversary Collection in 2050.Did I enjoy PoA? The look was artful. The jack-in-a-box motif was arty and the stuff flying-monkey-nightmares are made of. The little bird was distracting. The kids are learning to act. The spectacle is spectacular and finally treats HP as something other than the mangey illegitimate cousin of the Lord of the Rings.And the actual story has been clipped so tight that many of the reasons we love Rowling's stories have ended up in the ash can -- or more likely, in carefully noted files waiting to be re-edited into the movie for another release on DVD. I don't mind Hollywood making money. I like it. It means more movies. More spectacle! More stories! Business really is a good thing. But in Hollywood, passion for profit is only as good as its passion for story-telling.I also don't mind a movie short enough that we can all sit through it without too many bathroom breaks. Nobody wants to miss an important scene.... but we wouldn't have traded a minute of the 3-hours-is-not-enough Battle for HelmsDeep. And I don't look forward to to trading bathroom-comfort for the whole Goblet of Fire Tri-Wizard Tournament, the Christmas Ball, or the Quidditch World Cup. Yet, somehow, we know that is what we can expect. Warners will spend more money on the next HP film than has ever been spent on a motion picture -- but when we go to the theater for its release, we will only see about half of what what intended to be the final film. The rest will require a second purchase -- and a third and fourth.If this were McDonalds, we would be buying the bun first, then going back and paying 3 times as much for the meat -- three times that for the cheese and pickles -- and then we'd need to drive through and pay double again to get katsup and onions. Or we could wait until tomorrow and buy it all again -- frozen -- and pay them again to slap it in the microwave. It sounds like a really good idea if all they're interested in is milking the cash cow for all they can get. But if they're out to make an honest dollar, to satisfy customers, to offer value for $, or to offer people something they can enjoy with a smile, then maybe they should reconsider. A great movie -- will get repeat customers. A great DVD of the full version of the movie with value-added treats will sell beyond expectation.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
753,mark-crocker,"Love the book, disappointed in the film",7,9 December 2004,"The book, like all the others, is a great read, but this film version is a disappointment, compared to the first two. The pace of the film is too slow, in that we do feel empathy with the characters as much because of the frequent use of the cut rather than the fade (as with the first 2 films). I understand that this book was longer, so to produce a film that told a credible story , some parts had to be left out, but really...Also the obvious change in some of the settings- Hagrid's cottage was now down a steep hill, out of sight of Hogwarts, rather than a slow decline from the school is not how I pictured it from the book. As a total experience, I did not enjoy this film anywhere near as much as the first two, even given the fact that it dealt with a darker period in Harry's life. The Dementors, though, were a suitably scary sight.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
754,simmonsrj,"Maturing cast, new director.",8,25 June 2004,"The latest of Rowling's offerings to make the screen has all of the humor and interaction of the last two, but not as much of the magic (pardon the pun) of the previous editions. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron didn't pull off the same adolescent light-heartedness that Chris Columbus was able to portray in his two takes, adding a rather gloomy look to the film.The story line was parsed a bit too much and made the character relationships in the film hard to grasp, unless you: A)Read the book B)hold a degree in sociology or C)you were just there for the popcorn. And can someone please tell me why Harry hasn't fried Malfoy? The romantic tension b/w Hermione and Ron is overplayed and the interaction of Harry and Sirius Black jumps to far too many conclusions without any reason why. Harry goes from shock and fear about having an alleged psychotic killer-wizard out to finish the apparent job he did on his parents, to being reservedly giddy about moving in with him. The acting on almost all counts was stellar. The young troup is coming of age and have those problems to deal with, but Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch, as is Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson.I did enjoy the film and recommend it to both the avid Potter-ite as well as someone who simply wants to do the escapism thing for a few hours.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
755,cameo-1,movie,6,17 July 2004,"A much more mature movie compared to the other ones before it. This one lacks all the special effects of the two before it, however it was really good and I found that the lack 'whiz bang' effects were a welcome change. The storyline was much easier to follow because of it and the characters were more mature with just a hint of romance - and about time. A much more individual performance was given by each actor bringing each one into their own. Harry is finally more confident and his co-stars are less like groupies to him. Nice to see more than one character get the on screen attention. I love the twist of time storyline and the surprise about the prisoner. Who would have guessed! This movie is really worth seeing as the actors have really settled into the whole amazing life a Hogwarts giving them more time to personally find their own strengths. I can't wait to see the next one (but one year is too long) so I can again see the next development stage of these characters and their talent for tricks and mischief.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
756,siriusandjames,Great if you haven't read the book - virtually unrecognizable if you have.,1,20 August 2004,"Onward and upward! Lets hope the next one is better: Dumbledore is whiter, the Quiddich World Cup hasn't been cancelled, Hagrid's hut hasn't slid down the mountain side, Sirius has become an aristocrat and Ron gets a few lines (amongst other things).And why are the special effects so patchy? Dobby and Buckbeak are superb but Remus's werewolf is - well - words fail me! Sirius's dog wasn't brilliant either.On the plus side, something few people mention - John William's music. Without Hedwig's Theme all the Harry Potter films would be infinitely poorer (it peels merrily from my mobile phone!). His music brings a 'shivery' magical quality to every scene. Two particular scenes which leap to mind are the very first scene in the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone and also the giant Chess scene in the same film. Thank you, sir.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
757,siriusandjames,"Feels more like ""Three Go to Hogwarts"" - no magic.",1,15 August 2004,"This film has no sparkle to it. The book which contains Oliver Wood's finest hour has hardly a mention of Quiddich when transferred to screen.The horrifying scene when Ron is attacked in his bed by a maddened Sirius seeking Scabbers/Pettigrew has been dispatched without a backward glance. The knife-slashed curtains have been abandoned as unimportant. Pettigrew never appeared on the Marauder's Map.Hagrid's hut across the lawns at the edge of the Dark Forest somehow manages to cling precariously to the side of a cliff. This will cause MAJOR problems when filming books four and five where important events happen at speed between the castle doors and Hagrid's hut.It must really have taken some doing to make Julie Christie look like a secretary - they couldn't have made Madame Rosemerta look less like a pub landlady if they'd tried. What happened to the 'sparkly high-heels'?! And - for heaven's sake - couldn't some middle ground have been found so that the children could have had a butterbeer in the pub instead of lurking in the doorway?! How are they going to set up the DA (Dumbledore's Army) in 'The Order of the Phoenix' in the 'Hog's Head'? That can't be tampered with - it's a vital part of the plot.And a word about casting - and for this I'm on a planet of my own! Gary Oldman is a wonderful, accomplished actor who puts his heart and soul into everything he does. But Sirius he isn't. Sirius was the last of a long line of aristocrats. He was outrageously goodlooking with easy, graceful manners and abundant self-confidence. Azkaban made him a nervous wreck but it didn't turn the Scarlet Pimpernel into Gary Oldman. It also worries me a bit how they're going to change the nerd in the Mirror of Erised into the Snitch-twirling, show-off James Potter who 'roolz the skool'!I agree that there was a need for a different approach from that Chris Columbus employed - Harry does need to grow up. But he needs to grow up 'magically'. There doesn't seem to be a lot of difference in approach between Uncle Vernon and some of the wizards in PoA the Movie. Lastly, special effects. Why ARE they so patchy in the HP movies? Buckbeak was stupendous - absolutely fantastic. Lupin's werewolf was abominable - it looked like something out of a cheap cartoon. The Dementors are, I think, a matter of opinion. They depend largely on what you saw in your head when you read the book. Personally, I would have found them far more threatening if they had been more like the 'Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come' in the old black and white version of 'Scrooge' (Alister Simm). Check it out if you're under 105 - it's gruesome!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
758,zdaniel89,Absolute garbage,1,10 February 2006,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I felt this movie to be an absolute waste of my time and money. There was no closure, no regular plot movement, just random pieces of information from the book. Harry looked schizophrenic after they didn't include the explanation as to how Pettigrew was actually responsible for Harry's parents' deaths, instead of Black. Also, they cut the Quidditch matches from that year, except for the one between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff when the dementors arrived. Also, one other thing: the book clearly describes Patronuses as being able to move, so why weren't the ones in the movie? Honestly, the best parts of this horrible film were when the birds would fly too close to the whomping willow and turned into a shower of feathers.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
759,bocelli_fan,Read the books.,2,17 March 2005,"If you want the Harry Potter action, read the books. Out of all the movies so far, the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the worst. It's not just that they had to pack so much into a few short hours, but that they completely ruined everything J. K. Rowling wrote. Rowling wrote in perfect detail how everything and everybody looked and acted, but the director ignored it all. In my mind, everything from the werewolf's appearance to the fact that the students never wore their uniforms was simply wrong. Also, if you've never read the books (like my sister), the Peter Pettigrew scene looks like a practical joke. You have no idea what's happening. A few other disappointing parts were the Patronus charms and the dementors.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
760,piklyscmik,who will enjoy this film,8,26 December 2004,harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is a excellent film although it doesn't all ways keep to the book. It also proves that girls can be just as good a boys when it comes to fighting. All members of the family will enjoy the third film of the collection.This is the best one of the harry potter films that have been released due to how the characters mature as the film does. And because more new characters have been brought into the new world of harry potter so over all i give this film 8 out of 10. i would recommend this film to anyone because it has been put together with such skill and perception that it is a masterpiece that every one should have the chance to see such a spectacular film and get pulled into the magical world of harry potter,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
761,MrZ_ultimateGH,well it beats the other ones,7,9 January 2005,"The First Potter film hit theaters November 2001, it was a huge hit so the sequel was sure to come. Now what was wrong with the first one? Well to my opinion it was too boring to be for only kids, the children's acting was only mediocre(well you can forgive it, maybe...), and the believable paradox of a fairytale failed. Well it wasn't that bad, but with the exception of Dobby the house elf(though Gollum beats him 1000 - 0) the second film was even worse. It was better in terms of technical achievement since more time was used to that, but there was all the time a too linear story telling adapted like word to word from the excellent book. That doesn't work right. Well that movie still deserved it's 6/10 because of the wonderful appearances of such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs.Well the third movie is not THAT much better, but it's richer. The linear type of telling the story is forgotten and it feels fresher and more entertaining right then. Acting of the children is FAR better and the story of course gets more interesting. Gary Oldman is always great and this time it's not an exception, though his role is small. Now the characters still do not really develop since the story itself takes too much time. The film could have been half an hour longer though and it should've been. Everything is told quite quickly and it doesn't really get boring but it gets annoying. In some points only. All and all this is a bit better than the first two and I liked it, but i still wouldn't spend 25 euros(yeah euros you dumb asses :D) to buy it. To each their own, no?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
762,BlueRuins16,Definitely The best yet,10,8 April 2005,"This without a doubt is the best movie yet. That is major because of the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, who really knows how to put magic into a movie. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the first two movies, but something was missing and so was a flowing story. Cuaron improves on many things, from better sets too the movie rushing past you that you have to pay attention or you will get lost. While, he does all these good things, their are some things which hard-core fans of the books will dislike. Firstly, the movie isn't as faithful as the first two. While I think the first 2 were too faithful and they suffered because of it, many fans think a faithful movie is all that matters. Secondly, Cuaron has moved some things in the movie around to fit better with the story. This may bother some people who hate dis-continuity. Regardless of those things, Poa is a far better movie all-around, and I would love Cuaron to direct another hp movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
763,some_libertine,Great adaptation belongs to Thewlis and Cuaron,9,13 February 2005,"Critics of this film should just stop complaining and watch it for what it really is, a great, if very probably difficult adaptation to produce. The book I think most people will undoubtedly agree is one of the best in the series, containing all that is going to be hard isn't it. I agree that the changes that were made were unnecessary, moving Hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, but don't critics get it, the changes actually I think bring the film closer to the book than the first two. David Thewlis as Lupin just stole the film, he made it feel as if he was always on screen he had such presence. Gary Oldman was just great as Sirius Black, if only they had more screen time. Alfonso Cuaron, I just can't praise enough his influence on the film, it feels less like a bad children's film franchise now, and more like the magical world it was meant to be. Visually his influence is most notable, but I think the difference in all the actors shows as well. The harry potter world has grown up, just like it did in the book, and it got a lot better.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
764,messnera,Disagree with review,9,26 August 2005,"I could not disagree more with the review done by ladypythia. I am a humongous Harry Potter fan and was not disappointed. Granted some plot points were left out of the movie. However this is the fault of the studio who insisted on cutting and cutting, and the fault of the people who chose a person who was not interested in the Harry Potter world to direct. Cuaron did a good job, but had never even read the books before being asked to direct. He could have made the movie more all inclusive and from what I heard he did shoot more footage, but it all got cut. All in all I think what you get here is the best harry potter movie of the three in spite of all this. The mood that was created was better than the others and it sets the tone for the fourth movie which should be longer and more inclusive. Also, the issues that were left out are for the die hard harry potter fans, but for those who just want to see the movie and keep up they wont sit through a 3 and a half hour movie. So it had to be left with what it was to ensure that it would appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
765,dixielandsh,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/Falls Short,6,8 August 2005,"I am sure that Harry Potter fans will turn out in true form to see this movie. The reputation of J.K. Rowling's story and Steve Kloves' (screen writer) adaptations of previous books have been exceptionally well done.In The Sorcerer's Stone a new and fascinating world of fantasy was opened up and Chris Columbus did an impeccable job of making you believe in the existence of that fantasy world.In The Chamber of Secrets you expected action and you GOT action. For some of us even more than we wanted. Ewwwwww, Spiders! Chris Columbus once again did not disappoint his audiences.With two extremely well done movies as predecessors, the third film promised to be just as exciting and well done. You could feel the excitement and see the anticipation on every face of the audience as they entered the theater. We left disappointed. Gone was the excited buzz of chatter after the first two movies; people left this one in stunned silence.The story-line itself left much to be desired, jumping all over the place and veering completely away from the book in several instances. Unfortunately, the veering left excitement behind and bordered on mundane.So, what saved this movie from actually becoming mundane? 1. Excellent graphics exceeding those of the first two movies. The ""blowing"" up of Aunt Marge, the transformation of Peter Petigrew, and the knight bus adventure are some of the scenes that will certainly impress the viewer.2. The characters make-up and costuming, fabulous.3. The set, exactly as you would picture Hogwarts to be from the books. In Azkaban the setting should be darker and it does not disappoint us.4. The actors were right on with one exception. Michael Gambon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore fell short. He simply was unable to portray the quiet strength people have come to expect from Dumbledore.Alfonso Cuaron's direction did not make the cut with me. He had it all; characters, setting and plot....he just didn't make it work.Steve Kloves, stop attempting to ""improve"" upon J.K. Rowling and continue to follow her lead.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
766,gambits_cheri,Damn art films,3,10 March 2005,"I hate the new direction. Harry Potter is supposed to be MOSTLY for kids. But now movie 3 has become an artsy-fartsy German indie film. I hate that; there were too many shadows and the black-out was way over-used. I mean, there ARE other screen transitions.Kudos to Michael Gambin for trying to fill Richard Harris' shoes though; even in sickness, that's a hard act to follow.Plus Alan Rickman wasn't in it nearly enough. His thirty seconds at the head table, then the cross-dressing incident, and then in the cabin...not enough sexiness for me. I'd really rather watch the first two, where you can see his brilliant acting and his...snarky sexiness.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
767,supperstarhahn,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban? I think not,1,28 April 2005,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen. It leaves gaping plot holes, is nothing like the book and the only even almost good scene is the time travel in the end.I am a avid reader of the books, and am disappointed in the movie having so little to do with the book. The people in this movie have never read the books, or hated them to do this to the best in the series. If you have read the books, you would know the Mauruders Map and it's makers are pivotal to Harry's discovery of his father's life, and also of his trusting trusting Sirus. Sirius uses these things to get Harry to understand his past and Sirus' innocence. The movies have nothing to do with this, and tell a story of three teens trying to deal with a wizarding high school with enough angst to sicken even the darkest teen. Also, are you sure that's Hogwarts? It looks way different to me.The only good things in this movie were the special effects. As usual of the Harry Potter movies, the effects were real and yet impossible, such as the hippogriff, Buckbeak.PLEASE, WB, GET SOMEBODY WHO HAS READ THE BOOKS TO WRITE THE SCREENPLAY NEXT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I have been reading the comments on this site, and a startling number are positive. Who the hell are you kidding? Seriously, have you ever been to see the movie? If you have and liked it, you musn't have read the book, so tell me why Harry trusts Sirus and who created the maruder's map, both of which are piviotal to the series at large.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
768,theenglishman101,"I paid to see a movie, not a piece of art!",6,21 November 2006,"Alfonso Cuaron has made a common mistake among directors these days: just because a movie pretty doesn't mean it's good.Yes, I admit, Azkaban's visuals - and how Cuaron uses them - are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The Dementors are unfaithful to the book, but still genuinely scary, and Buckbeak looks incredible. In fact, I would have rated this movie lower had it not been for these spectacular effects.Cuaron seems to have a very claustrophobic sense of directing, keeping everybody intense and focused on one shot and not allowing anyone to breathe while a line is being spoken. This results in some extremely tight and stiff acting from some incredible acting. In fact, only the three new adults - Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis - seem free from Cuaron's grip.The script is okay; at least it doesn't try to cram everything in like in Chamber of Secrets. However, this time it does the opposite: it focuses too much screen time on visuals and not enough on important elements like plot, acting and storyline.In conclusion, this movie could have been so much better. I don't recommend seeing this movie if you have already read the book, because you will be gravely disappointed. For the rest of you, it's an okay way to kill two-and-a-half hours.

Personally, I had high expectations of this film as Harry Potter and the POA is one of the best books out of the six. I was disappointed and felt like the movie was rushed. Main events were missed out such as Sirius Black coming into Hogwarts, Quidditch matches and Hermione's worries over the firebolt, which was meant to be introduced in the middle of the plot. Events were not explain thoroughly enough and I think many viewers who have not read the book may have started to get confused. Also an important factor in the movie was the bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sometimes while watching the film, I felt like they were not best friends but merely classmates. Arguments appear between Ron and Hermione, which is perfectly normal, but there is just no love between the trio. Praises go to Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis for playing their roles excellently! The movie is not terrible, as the special effects are good and the acting is OK, but I just didn't feel the special magic of the movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Love it and definitely recommend it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
775,lound,"Hugely enjoyable, overall - some important flaws, alas.",9,5 June 2004,"**Spoilers ahead**First, Alfonso Cuaron's personal directorial stamp is clear for all to see, and his aesthetic sensibilities shine through in this film  for example, the sweeping vistas of the Scottish landscape place Hogwarts in its stunning, breathtaking, natural context. Eye-candy for sure, and something I missed in the earlier films.Second, I thought Sr. Cuaron's re-placement of Hagrid's hut and the whomping willow was entirely appropriate, as was his inclusion of Callanish-like standing stones, which bring a sense of the ancient Celtic presence in the Hogwarts world more palpable. The earlier films were far too cardboard, claustrophobic and (for a movie) too stage-bound in this respect.On acting, Daniel, Rupert and Emma have clearly matured and developed. A lot of the wooden-ness has been shed, whilst Daniel hasn't yet acquired the skills to emote convincingly, except in his angry scenes, which were passable. I was happy to see Rupert lose much of his limited repertoire of facial expressions and to rely instead on his natural comic abilities. Equally glad to see Emma turn in a persuasive, sensitive performance.As for the adults, predictably excellent, if brief, contributions from the regulars. Sir Michael Gambon to my surprise didn't quite capture Harris' feel for the contradictory character of Prof. Dumbledore  whimsical and yet authoritative, wise and yet apparently innocent, careworn and yet fresh and childlike. Maybe his undoubted range as an actor was circumscribed by the screenwriting? Emma Thompson's Prof. Trelawney was perfect - at once hilarious and winning, facial tics, big glasses and all. Wonderful indeed  Emma certainly bones up on her characters!David Thewlis' Prof. Lupin was absolutely spot-on. His portrayal of the tragedy, the humanity, of this man was touchingly-captured by David in his understated, gentle way. A performance one can savour and learn from.Gary Oldman as Sirius was, as one would expect, highly successful. An inspired, if all too brief performance, alas!Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew depicted that appalling character with aplomb. His rodent-like demeanour as Peter, rather than his animagus alter-ego Scabbers was especially effective.Regarding CGI, Buckbeak the hippogriff was a massively successful and endearing CGI creation  utterly convincing. I was very moved during the scene where Harry and Buckbeak bow to one another, and by the thrilling section where Harry rides with the hippogriff over the Scottish countryside, and the loch. Unfortunately, the moment was somewhat spoiled by the gratuitous inclusion of the clichéd Titanicesque scene where Harry opens his arms in the wind. I mean, please - what was Cuaron even THINKING?Finally, the most signal and unaccountably AWFUL let-down in this otherwise highly enjoyable adaptation was the Patronus scene, where Harry conjures the silver stag  his Patronus. This is undoubtedly THE high point in the entire book, of good against evil - yet against all expectation, the combined forces of the film-makers succeed in DESTROYING this scene completely. A brief glimpse of the silver stag (stationary at that) followed by a completely meaningless CGI wash of white after Harry and Hermione had travelled back in time to undo the damage. I couldn't believe it! How absolutely unforgivable! Again, one wonders how this pathetic visualization of Rowling's extremely potent and touching moment could have been trashed thus?The Patronus scene notwithstanding (UGH and grrrr) I give Azkaban 8 stars.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
776,draven1013,This is the film the first two should have been,9,7 June 2004,"Cuaron's adaptation may stray from the source material far more than Chris Columbus' previous films did, but he's managed to capture the spirit of Rowling's world far more successfully. Several scenes in this film had more heart that the previous movies combined. A fantastic, warm, scary and pleasing fantasy. The kids shine as Harry, Ron and Hermione, while Gambon's Dumbledore has a liveliness befitting the character that was absent in the late Harris' portrayal. Gary Oldman is in the film for far too brief a time, but his presence looms large, and he's certainly arresting -- no pun intended -- when he is on screen. Buckbeak is a far more effective use of CGI than any of the previous creatures, as well. Is it wrong to want a hippogriff of your own?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
777,reynolds-9,Efficient screen adaptation---a change in director makes all the difference!,9,17 July 2004,"Very happy to see this film and eager to see it again, unlike the 2nd in the series!A change in director makes all the difference! Careful editing and the improved sets also helped greatly. Most notably the Whomping Willow is now outside the castle walls and given vastly improved rendering!The screenwriter appears to have hit his stride with this the 3rd in the series: seamlessly altering details of time and place for brevity without losing important exchanges between the characters and information for the uninitiated audience. He'll need it even more for The Goblet of Fire; so, I write this in eager anticipation of that product!Standout Excellent Scene: the confrontation in the Shrieking Shack. Oldman is brilliant as Sirius Black, as is Thewlis as Lupin. A solid film. I was a little disappointed about the delay of arrival of Harry's broomstick until the end of the movie, when it was to have arrived at Christmas however; but, that really doesn't figure largely in the advancement of the plot (until the next movie) and so it is totally forgivable along with all other such story alterations.Similarly I would have liked to see the Divination classroom more in keeping with Rowling's original description of having to be accessed from a trapdoor; but, that's just nitpicking. The actress playing Treylawny is a dead ringer for the part---excellent casting all around!I will definitely buy this film for my collection, and seek to see it again before it leaves the theaters.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The principal cast are now so comfortable with their roles, that they may never be able to work again and it is fun watching them age on screen. Definitely darker and really may not be suitable for young children. This will make more money at the box office than the previous two and I have not seen a line (mob) for a preview that even came close to this. Michael Gambon slides into the Dumbledore role with ease and Oldman is his usual awesome self.

He and Alfonso Cuaron are a perfect match for this one.Kloves has given us a much deeper look into Harry's personality than in any of the previous films. His working J.K. Rowling has paid off and it fits perfectly with Alfonso's style.He is more artistic and visionary than any of the other director's that the Potter's have had.

Saying that, I'd like to express how much of a fan I am of this movie. I must confess that I was a little disappointed that the explanation of Harry's patronus and how it relates to the Marauder's Map was left out, but everything else about this movie made up for it. The music, special effects, acting, scenery, and surprisingly dark and stylish cinematography are all high points of this film. The book is something else, but this movie stands out on its own. I was so astonished and excited on how different this film was from the others, and I think that a change in director was very necessary, and it worked out fantastic. I am an avid fan of both books and movies and their adaptations, and I am able to view a film separate from it's book.

And its sad that Richard Harris has died but they did get a good dumbldore. I'm truly looking forward to my Harry Potter Movie Marathon. Thats gonna be fun!

Crookshanks was supposed to be super fat!!!! i was looking forward to seeing a fat orange cat as sad as that sounds.it should be 4 stars, i gave it five cuz Tom Felton was super hot!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
784,Jestre,A Review,1,5 June 2004,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan that has been looking forward to this movie ever since the credits finished rolling for Chamber of Secrets. To say that I am disappointed in this film is a huge understatement. I shall start with the characters. The two most fascinating and powerful characters in the books and first two movies outside of the three kids are Snape and Dumbledore, Snape is reduced to a seldom used butt of a joke and Dumbledore has completely lost his magnificent presence and aura and is closer to a doddering old man. One of the most effective parts of the first two movies is the magical settings and costumes, these are completely missing from this movie. Hogwarts looks shabby and stark, Hagrids Hut more closely resembles a redneck trailer home. The students spend most of their time in street clothes, the entire 'feel' of the movie is more like a cheap imitation of 'Lord of the Rings' than the wonderful settings from the first two movies. However the most disappointing part of the movie is its plot/storyline... While the first two movies brought the books to life in a vivid and spectacular fashion with a faithful presentation Prisoner of Azkaban is a choppy, mutilated version of the book, completely lacking the engrossing nature of the book. Many important elements of the book were completely overlooked or 'changed'. The most important omission to me was the lack of any explanation of the significance of 'Padfoot, Mooney, Prongs and Wormtail and their relationships. Also the book introduced Cedric Diggory as the Hufflepuff seeker that beat Harry and brought about a level of animosity toward him by the Griffyndors... Cuaron seemed to approach POA with an intent to make it a combination of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Men in Black' it was a complete failure...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
785,sprock21,"Great acting, lousy story",6,5 June 2004,"I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
786,angelicatty,The beginning of the end,10,13 June 2004,"There isn't much else to say than that this movie was awesome. Cuaron's vision and dark tones was the perfect setting for what is the beginning of Harry's dark, downward spiral to the end of the series. I loved the 1st two movies that Chris Columbus directed because they set the scenario and established the characters for the viewers to understand and fall in love with. HPPoA is a dark book and therefore needed to be a dark movie. The actors have grown into their characters and all of the new characters had only nominal face time; with the exception of Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black . These two characters, Black especially become as important to the series as Harry, Hermione and Ron. I look forward to seeing the next installment,Goblet of Fire.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
787,fab4-1,Much of story missing,6,19 June 2004,"The first two installments were so in-line with the book, but Azkaban left out so many critical and interesting points that the story suffers for it. This movies run time was too short and while the bird flying into the Whomping Willow was cute, there were too many redundant scenes and if these were cut, there would have been more time for the important dialogue in the Shreiking Shack. The school choir was another example of this, interesting, but not in the book. Also it was disappointing that this movie did not begin with Harry's birthday and end as the first two ended. But, the dementors were absolutely fantastic, as was the Maruaders map!! Stay until the end credits are over for a small bonus; besides that the Map is worth watching the complete credits.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
788,aimeesnow@yahoo.com,MAJOR plot points left out,4,4 August 2007,"Listen, I understand that to make a movie from a book you have to leave things out. However, I believe that if a movie is going to made from a book, it should stand on its own. Meaning that you should be able to follow the movie if you haven't read the book. I have read the book, but I saw the movie with people who had not. And we got out of the movie and they were thoroughly confused. And I don't blame them, because the movie failed to explain (1) how Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, (2) how he knew that Pettigrew was Ron's pet and therefore at Hogwarts, and (3) who the 4 Marauders were so it was confusing that Lupin understood what the map was and how it worked. This is just sloppy film making. Add a few lines here and there and it's explained. I can live without the Quiddich and the subplots from the book, but when I have to spend 15 minutes explaining things to people after the movie, the movie is a failure.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
789,gothgarg,Just did not click,2,25 November 2005,"Meant to update this a long while back. But the movie itself got me so de-motivated, that I didn't even bother to rank it. Some moments in the movie were good - but only thanks to CGI wizardry - nothing original at all in the movie or even the story! Total crap. If I did not care to give regards to the millions of HP-fans, I'd even rank it the lowest 1. The original HP movie was the best in the series, but only because it was new (-sort of) in its genre. All sequels just lack the depth. They only rely on visual tricks to awe the audience. All shine, no ground. This is a plain kids movie - kids who need little to get awed at. I can get equals thrills and probably indulge in more intelligence more whilst watching even Thirteen Ghosts.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

If you have read the books you must separate movie from book. Hey, I'm a Lord of the Rings fanatic and am completely able to LET GO of the many areas of lost content that leave most of the story unexplained and just ENJOY THE MOVIE. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 4 - the first two were just too childish and sort of lame to enjoy if you are over 14, and the 4th was inexplicably odd - I have no idea why the characters whined so much and had inner fighting for no apparent reason and it was too dark and depressing, leaving nothing at the end to really care about - ie. why would i want to watch these characters again? Azkaban is a great time - much improved acting, great characters, engaging story - this is the HP that made me actually care about the characters, especially Harry, and the more I watch it the more moving and interesting it gets. Class act movie great for 10 - 99 year olds.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
791,wim72,"Finally, a real film",9,16 June 2004,"Having been deeply disappointed by the first 2 films, which missed the mark utterly despite the great cast and attention to small details, i went in to Azkaban thinking that it couldn't get much worse.. And i was right! Azkaban is a good film, made for all ages, not just 6 year olds, with well-timed (rather than ridiculous unnecessary over-the-top) action scenes countered by plenty of moody and intelligent dialogue. Cuaron manages to build the tension throughout the film, as do the books, and this time Cloves/Cuaron made a good job of condensing a long story into an exciting movie.See it!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
792,josie421,A big disappointment!,3,12 June 2004,"After the colourful, warm and enchanting films that were ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"", I had expected that ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- quite possibly the best of the Harry Potter books -- would be a quite splendid affair. Not so. Clearly, Alfonso Cuaran has failed. Dialouge is good, picture nice, but too little time is given to the brilliant actors, the movie is too short and rushed and does not live up to its potential. Very disappointing. I suggest you read the book instead. However, I must say I'm quite impressed with the line-up: Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis in the same film! I wish they had been given more dialogue and screen-time. They are all excellent.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
793,Lord_of_the_Manor,"Amazing, trimmed a touch too much.",10,10 June 2004,"Spoilers Below (especially if you haven't read the books)I finished watching this movie about half an hour ago and I'm still in awe. Cuaron did such an amazing job of adapting Azkaban, easily interweaving teen angst with the dramatic Rowling plot which captivated me besides the screaming brats in the cinema with me. As the end drew nearer I couldn't believe how beautiful the film was the light from the Patronus charm blinding me as much as the Dementors.Having made my overall comment, I will now go to specifics.The Dementors, you cannot go past commenting on what was the most hyped feature of the film the teasers with the hand on the door drove me and others mad. They were superbly done, well done to the POA Special effects Crew. They were scary, dark disgusting creatures and after the scene by the lake at the end I will never look at a flock of birds' overhead the same way. The Quidditch scene was amazing and scary and phwoar. It was a far cry from the lush green fields and obvious CGI of the 2 previous Quidditch scenes in the series.Gary Oldman was a magnificent Sirius Black, although in the shrieking shack he seemed quite insane at first but came around. Bravo for being the perfect Sirius, to me at least. Peter Pettigrew was not as I would have imagined, I always saw him as a grown up Neville Longbottom type person (their similarities always made me feel that Neville's future is not so bright) but the actor did the sucking up and desperate attempts at mercy to perfection, I must say. While still on characters, Michael Gambon (who I had only ever seen in Ali G) did such a good job of being Dumbledore I nearly forgot Richard Harris (RIP Albus) wasn't playing him anymore. It was amazing.Having listed all of the things I thought were Excellent about the film, I feel it pertinent to say what could have been better. I understand that anything longer would have seemed grandiose but he cut so much!!! Little things like the origin of the Stallion (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) which were very important were missing. There were other things, but not worth mentioning as the film was amazing and captivating.One last comment. There has been a lot of speculation over the three of them playing the roles throughout the series, due to their age. Has everyone forgotten that the three of them are actually the same age as the characters within a year and that they look the age? If they want to keep going, I think they should because lets face it Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter and no other kid could step into the role because Danny is forever in our minds as what Harry looks like. 9 stars out of 10, a ripper of a film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
794,favresb31,New Director = bad story telling,6,5 June 2004,"I've never been one of those people. You know the ""Oh that movie didn't do the book justice"" people. Yes, THOSE people. However, in watching Prisoner of Azkaban, they leave out so many important points in not only the book, but in the big picture of the story which is Harry Potter. First of all, let's get this out of the way, PoA, the book, is not a very good story. Yes, it does advance the plot, but let's face it, there's not Voldomort and the only point is to introduce new characters, in particular, Sirius Black. So granted, the movie doesn't have a lot to work with (compared to the other stories), but it could have at least done a better job in capturing the story telling aspect.Instead of using foreshadowing, continuity, and other aspects of story telling, they focused more on the cinematography. I could just picture a director's commentary ""yeah, this part of the plot was important, but we had to take it out, because it was such a BEAUTIFUL special effect."" And just to prove I'm not ranting incoherently, here are a few examples of this: Harry was never spotted at Hogsmeade, very little quidditch mentioned, nothing about winning the quidditch cup, nothing about the house cup (only 5 points were deducted the whole movie), Ron never spotted Sirius in the dorm, no mention of Snape delivering the potion to Lupin as his reason for finding them at the shack, no mention of who Padfot, Prongs, Wormtail, and Mooney were (or better yet, that they wrote the bloody map!!!), and perhaps worst of all, Wormtail transfigured into a fully clothed human, but when transfiguring back into the animagus, his clothes were left behind.Though much of this was probably because the general muggle viewing public is incapable of following too complex of a plot, they wanted to simplify the plot. I respect that, and I came to expect as much. However, as I stated earlier, the case turned out that they wanted to show off their special effects and ""movie making"" ability, even if they had to sacrifice some of the plot. An example would be with the Wormtail transfiguration. I'm probably with the 99.9999999% of the movie public, and we don't want to see a naked Wormtail appear as a human, so it is perfectly acceptable to have him appear fully clothed. However, when he turned back into a rat, his clothes fell tot he ground, and the rat scurried away out of the pile of clothing. Now of course, the director thought it would be such a ""cool shot"" to have the rat run away as the clothes fell, thus sacrificing continuity, for a good camera shot. I find that highly unacceptable.The bottom line is this. If you are a film student, or someone who is into good camera shots, special effects, and scenery in movies, than Potter 3 will send you home very happy. But if you're like me, and enjoy good stories, consistent plots that challenge the viewers to think what will happen next, and reward those who remember little things to make the story deeper and very interesting, then you will leave this movie feeling unfulfilled.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I have no idea what I would think of the movies if I didn't love the books.I look at the movies as a supplement to the books. I know some people can go into the theatre and love it after never having read the books, but for most, it falls flat without the background the book provides.For the loyalists who constantly say that the movie lacks what the book has, I say, you can't put it all in. If you use your imagination to enjoy the books, why can't you do the same for the movie?I thought this was the best one so far. The movie does a great job in bringing out the main points and feeling of the book. All the characters are enjoyable, even the ones you don't like.

796,clooneys_girl,What did they do to my film????,5,27 May 2005,"It all sounded so promising... A darker film, no more Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron - a man whose films are stunningly beautiful, unfortunately Steve Kloves was still writing the script but hey we can't have everything can we...So where did it all go wrong? I understand the concept of artistic license - believe me I do... and I understand that certain aspects of the book have to be left out, altered but there are some things that are sacred! One of my biggest gripes is with the Mexican Werewolf... I'm sorry a hairless werewolf in Britain? Just... just no! I'm sorry - it would be mocked by all the other werewolves.... plus it would freeze! And when would Lupin have been in Mexico? Which leads me to another gripe... Lupin. Now don't get me wrong, I love David Thewlis, he's a great actor... He's just not Lupin... The weedy 'stache, the abrupt way in which he addresses Neville, the way he cowers, some of the things he says. It's just not right.Also, the bluebirds and the Whomping Willow. It's Scotland - they don't have bluebirds. Bluebirds are not native to the UK.One thing that interested me the most was the use of magic at the very beginning of the film... Lumos Maxima... what's wrong with good old Lumos? Why do the spells all of a sudden have sound effects? And who isn't allowed to do magic outside of school? What fact is reiterated some time later by good old uncle Vernon? - 'You're not allowed to do magic outside of school.' Come on people! Another thing that frustrates me... but this is speaking purely as a film student... is the sudden trend in using wipes. Why? It looks so amateur.And what is the need for all the repetition? 'How is it you know everything?' 'How is it she knows everything?' We are not stupid. We don't need things such as those to be reinforced time after time. We have read the books. We know what is going on.My biggest problem with this film comes at the very end. Sirius's last words are not to Harry, they're to Hermione. Why? This would never happen. A beautiful moment spoiled by the line 'You really are the brightest witch of your age.' It truly infuriates me. The original line of 'You really are your Father's son' is far better suited and means so much more.This really has turned into a major rant about the film. The thing that probably annoys me the most is the fact that despite all this I still have to admit that it is truly beautiful and that it is far superior to the first two films.With a British Director, finally, at the helm of the next film and the fact that there will be no more Steve Kloves bodes well for the next films. If only we can get Warner Bros. to budge on the time restrictions....",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
797,wiccalee,"Disapparate Me, Please!",4,5 July 2004,"Being an avid fan of all of the Harry Potter line of books I was positively salivating in the queue to see the latest installment of the movie. And quite honestly I was a bit disappointed. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry James Potter), Emma Watson(Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint(Ronald Weasley) all gave their wonderful performances but there were moments in the movie that I did not care for. My main problem was the extra footage that did not belong or add to the storyline i.e. The Frog Chorus, the shrunken head on the Knight Bus. These items were fluff and was not part of the original storyline. I believe that these two parts should have been omitted and their monies used to make Lupin a more realistic werewolf. I am sure that Alfonso Cuarón is a wonderful director but he did not capture the vision as did Chris Colombus had in the previous Potter movies.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
798,dizzyupthegirl,"Good, but not great",6,31 May 2004,"I went along to this film expecting it to be pretty good. Not because I liked the other films because I only found them OK, nothing special, but because I heard good reviews, the trailers were impressive and because I wanted to see how the new director handled it.This film is a huge improvement on the previous two. The director, Cuarón does a good job. The film has a more stylized look than Harry Potter one and two but it still leaves much to be desired. The CGI was patchy in some areas, and astonishing in others. The Dementors are done well and I managed to watch the whole film without them once reminding me of the black riders from Lord Of The Rings. Which is quite an achievement in itself.The kids have all grown up loads and it suits them better. I didn't think much of the acting in the first film but the trio are on top form in this installment and looking generally cooler whilst doing it! All three are convincing and if certain aspects let down the film, it's not them.I think the problem with converting the Harry Potter films to the big screen is a matter of pacing. The books are so plot orientated that fitting it all in is naturally impossible. This film, like the previous two felt in some areas like a selection of the important bits in the book put into a number of short, individual scenes. However, this is coming from someone who's read the books and is sickening biased towards them so I couldn't speak for those who haven't.Overall I'd say this film was good, but not great. Cuarón is not afraid to change the story, which may annoy some and entertain others. He obviously has a good flair for action and the early sequences with the Knight Bus are fast paced and breath taking. This film is worth seeing and if you liked the first two you'll probably love this. But for the more cynical viewers among us, especially those who have read the books, it might feel like something is missing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The story of the film is quite different from the book, but I think the changes are good. They suit the film. My favourite parts of the movie are the sense that Harry and Hermione go back into the past and the conversation between Sirius and Harry, very touching. The music by John Williams is excellent and I really hope that he can get an Oscar nomination. However, if the movie can explain more clearly about the relation between Lupin, Sirius and James,and why Harry's Patronum is Prongs, it will be better.

I really and truly hope that they will keep these actors it wouldn't feel the same if we replace these in which they have put a lot of effort to make the stories first class.The most really impressive, in my view, is that of Daniel Radcliff.

It does deviate from the books in many ways, but I felt the director captured that feeling you get when reading the book.You can see the anger in Potter, and the delicate relationships that are evolving with Ron, Herm, and Harry. This is something that even the books struggle with, yet are well done in this movie. Also the seeing the guys just fooling around in there dorm with the candy really gave you a great impression of tower life.All in All this move is a 10, and it captures the feelings allot more. You get a real sense of what Harry is going to have to endure in the next movies, and puts a good real world feel on everything, which makes the books more believable thus creating a much better movie.

Prisoner of Azkaban is a great book, my favorite, but this movie was so far from the book that I hated it. They took out everything that was important and added filler that did not need to be there. Also they had alignment with book problems. Such as, when Harry got his firebolt. Though the acting and all that stuff were excellent. In fact anyone who has not read the books will love the movie, but As I see it it was horrible. By far the worst Harry Potter movie yet. I am pleased to say though that there is another new director for movie four and I am confident that he will do a better job than Alfonso Cuaron.

The Hippogrith was a beautiful creature. Hermione rocks. Ron and Harry are so cute. I liked Draco's new sense of fear was so cool. I like him in that role. I cant wait for Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire. I now have to go and dust of the book and read it before the movie comes out.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
804,reignsong-1,"Dark, and Bloody Brilliant!",9,5 June 2004,"No, I haven't read the books; I am more of a Thomas Pynchon reader, but I actually adore these films while I detest mainstream cinema. The direction in this film is much more thoughtful than the previous two. The camera angles are highly effective at setting the mood and intensity of the scenes, and the cinematography is more organic creating a ambient magical realism. The acting is brilliant, to state the obvious and expected, and there is a bit more humor and emotion in this version.While I hear this is a less faithful adaptation, it is the best of the three as far as the film making and storyline goes. Pure Cinematic escapism. It certainly has a little more of an indie aesthetic to it rather than that glitsed and polished Hollywood style of the previous two. A very soulful presentation. Perhaps a little intense for the little munchkins, but nothing too terrible. Buy them an ice cream afterwards, and they'll forget all about the spooks. God bless Gary Oldman! After seeing this, rent a copy of the Goonies. I think the director had this film, among others i.e. The Frighteners, Lord of the Rings, maybe Fellini (not for the kiddies), in mind.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
805,martinerouweler,very different,8,2 June 2004,"They are very different when you compare the first two movies and this third one. I just saw it and must say that I will have to see it at least once more to appreciate it fully. But non the less it is a good movie with a very different scenery this time. Although I think a few comments are in place. Like the new Dumbledore, now of course a replacement is always hard to find and I do hope that for the coming movies they won't have to replace anyone else. Michael Gambon does try very well even though he doesn't have the charisma Richard Harris had. But Tom the landlord? He is supposed to be a gentle man like we saw in part one, not a hunchback, dark type.On the one hand it is a shame that they didn't look at the previous movies more but on the other hand Harry is growing up and becoming more angrier.Even though my comments are not that positive I still think it is a brilliant movie and I can't wait for the next one. But first.....part six, I want to read it, when is it coming?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
806,jpoulter11,Abstract and dark themes abound; still the most mature HP entry,10,19 January 2011,"Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.First-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.This is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.If you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
807,halibut5,Not horrible,1,24 June 2004,"Wow. Before i saw this movie i said, ""after the first 2 movies and a better book to base this one off of, How could they go Wrong??"" Famous last words.First, the good. They really captured a few things perfectly if not better than expected. The Book of Monsters and Buckbeak were Awesome!! In Fact, the book of Monsters was even better than what i imagined. Buckbeak, looked REAL!! Nice combination of animatronix and CGI. Pretty impressive there. Besides this, you would be hard pressed to find much more positive about this flick.Direction and costume choices were just that, choices. They totally disregard all mage robes, pointed hats etc. I guess after spending all the money developing Dementors, they decided to cut cost by letting the kids wear jeans and t-shirts. it looked odd. The Direction wasn't all bad but it was far from good. (spoiler)The touching sceen between Black and Harry was about as touching as watching someone fry in the electric chair. And harry even blows it off. ""he invited me to move in <wierd expression and shrug>"" this is probably the most important part of the books, their relation ship. but i guess who needs story. I think he took a page from the MEn in Black Director. ""i don't care what you are doing in the sceen, as long as you are constantly saying your lines"" everything was rushed and confusing. OH, and those stupid segways between scenes (whomping tree shaking off snow or eating birds. the kids singing Bubble Bubble Toil and trouble) if you are planning on dropping 75% of the story, why not drop these segways (which had to be 20 minutes of the film)and instead of 75% dropped you might pull off just 50%.NEXT! they left out MAJOR HUGE plot points. <spoilers> 1) who is Padfoot, Prongs, wormtail 2) what was the relation ship with Harry's dad, sirus, lupin and wormtail 3) what the hell was with the glowing stag running across the pond, who btw didn't show up again when they replayed the sceen when they went back in time 4) where the map came from 5) ron's replacement pet 6)never even came close to explaining why and how sirus was framed or even WHAT really happened 7) sirus' innocents......never cleared. the only thing was Lupin saying ""Oh, he's a good guy"" and no mention of that again.These are the major plot points dropped not to mention dozens of small things/characters that play a major part latter. (when did Dementors start flying?)A) i am happy that this director didn't have time to do the 4th one ""I will still be destroying the 3rd film much less have time to ruin another"" B) I'm worried if they settled for this for the 3rd what the hell will they look at for the 4th. (Longest of the three books makes the shortest movie.) which is even longer than the 3rd. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who Hasn't read the book....you will be totally lost.How can you let this happen. J.R. can not be happy except she got the huge pay day i guess.On the beer scale, this is a 7 beer movie. you might get lucky and pass out half way through it. This movie is rated PP....Pretty Poor",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
808,spam1-5,This was NOT an enjoyable movie.,6,13 June 2004,"I'm not sure what movie others were viewing but the Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban I saw was a badly disjointed cinematic effort which left my date totally confused. Those who have not read the books or at least seen the previous two movies had no chance to follow the storyline, if indeed there was a storyline. The seemingly endless movie was more of a series of out-of-context skits strung together for over two hours. The misery ended for me and I sincerely hope other Harry Potter fans avoid this one as a true stinker. Defects included a failure to fully introduce two central characters, Herminone and Ron; failed to introduce other key characters like the Weasley twins and Mr. & Mrs. Weasly and why these characters are important to Harry. Professor McGonagal, a key figure in ALL of the Potter novels, is almost left out of the movie and the animosity and its back story between Malfoy and Harry is never explained. The new broom from Sirius was given midway through in the book and included a delightful side story but it was a toss away scene at the end of the movie. The director didn't even bother to explain the cloak of invincibility that was used in large parts of the movie, what it was and who it first belonged to and how Harry came into possession of it. The endless failure of the director to clue in newcomers to the Potter saga makes me wonder if he ever read the book himself.If you must see this movie, Please, read the books first.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The movie was stuffed with details which I assume were faithful interpretations of the book (which I haven't read) but I felt the characters lacked depth and after 45 minutes I didn't really care what happened to them. Special effects were good and I think that the direction was better than the first two movies but overall it just didn't work. I have seen both the previous movies and found them more entertaining - so I am not an anti-Potter person.

811,taj500,The best harry potter film yet...by far,9,3 June 2004,"I saw the movie yesterday and I loved it! The camera work was amazing using extreme angles, and shots which last up to a minute. The 'moving' camera really did create a great effect. The acting is so much better this film too. A lot of people have felt that the darker feel has meant that the film doesn't seem as magical now but I disagree, its such an improvement from films 1 and 2. They were OK films and people loved them because it was harry potter but PoA is in a different league. One criticism though - it really did need another 2mins of dialogue to explain the plot better - why sirius seemed so bad - i can't remember hearing how he blew up a road which these days people can relate to and would help us understand why everyone thinks hes such a dangerous man. also we were never told that james lupin peter sirius were the makers of the map which was surprising, and lastly it wasn't clear enough that peter was the one that blew the street up. so people who haven't read the books #might# be a bit confused. Another 2 mins of dialogue would have turned this into an excellent film but hopefully we'll get those scenes on the DVD!Visually the film looked so impressive, from the hand-held camera shots at the beginning to the long swooping aerial shots near the castle. The scenes with the time turner are amazing too. The director, the acting, the very impressive landscapes, the excellent buckbeak scene, and the camera work made this into a very, very good film...and dawn french was great!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
812,MambaJack,Best of the Series So Far,9,14 June 2004,"It's always tough watching a film when you've read the book, but this entry in the Potter series is by far the best so far. Perhaps it was the fact that the books themselves have improved with each new offering. In any case, the visuals, pacing and story are all tighter and focused than previous films.The casting changes, most notably Dumbledore, don't detract from the film. The young actors, who have grown quite a bit, are showing more edge and that's an improvement. It might be the change in directors that made the biggest difference. Cuaron brings an interesting attitude to the film. Unlike Columbus, he seems willing to be a bit earthier in his vision.Definitely worth it for fans of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
813,starbucksluvr,"A Good Movie, but not True to Harry Potter",10,5 June 2004,"I preface my comments by stating that I had exceedingly high expectations for this film. Harry Potter is one of my many obsessions, and after watching the trailer, I was sure that this film would be by far the best of the three. I was, however, disappointed. The cinematography was beautiful, and most of the acting was much improved (aside from Radcliffe's pitiful crying scene and Hermione's pathetic dependency acts), but the movie was so poorly thrown together. The first twenty minutes were hilarious. I was rolling in my seat laughing as Aunt Marge blew up, busting buttons (which consequently hit Dudley in the face), and the Knight Bus was equally amusing. Sadly, however, once you get any farther, disappointments ensue. The set is entirely different. This isn't necessarily always a bad thing. The set was much extended, but certain aspects of the it were noticeably different. The whomping willow decreased to about half of its size and also changed locations.The chronological order of the events in the movie were also rearranged, as well as leaving out many important aspects of the novel. Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I personally really liked how the movies followed so closely to the books. Peeves is still missing from the story, many important conversation in general (particularly between Harry and Lupin) are taken out, Harry finds out all of the information about Sirius and how he is his godfather in a completely different fashion, Harry receives the firebolt (without any explanation as to how he got it) at the very end of the movie, and most annoyingly and obviously, everything about the bond between James, Peter, Sirius, and Remus is left out. It did not explain at all who Prongs and Padfoot and the like were at all. So much was left unexplained, and as a whole it was very very rushed and choppy.Many beg to differ with my opinion and perhaps I need to see it again, but I thought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie alone as a movie, but regarding the true feeling of Harry Potter left much to be desired.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
814,CoolGarret101,THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR BY FAR!!!!!!!,10,5 June 2004,"One thing that goes without saying, this was much better than the first two. The adaptation from the book to the movie was done very well, and the three main actors (especially Daniel Radcliffe) did much better. Some other great movies I've seen this year are ""Passion of the Christ"", ""Troy"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Super Size Me"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Kill Bill 2"", ""Shrek 2"", but this movie beats all of them, this is the best movie of the year by far! I thought everything about this movie was excellent, and the part that I enjoyed most was that when Hermione didn't have class, she'd be walkin' around with the coolest clothes ever, like light jeans with a belt, and a pink buttoned downed shirt with a cool pattern on it, not to mention her hair looked pretty good. Also an excellent popcorn movie. And take my advice, don't see ""Shrek 2"", see ""Harry Potter 3."" It will be more appropriate for your kids, and much, much better too.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
815,weblore_01,It FEELS like the book,10,10 June 2004,"A guy walked straight up to me at the end of the movie and asked what I thought, and I answered right away that it had the exact 'feeling' of the book. It totally felt like 'Prisoner of Azkaban'! Yes, loads (lol) were missing, but I felt none of it during the film... unlike the jarring missing parts of 'Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone', which I still adore none-the-less. There's a part in this book called 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' that I remember my dad reading to me. Something along the lines of that it's hard to write a 100 word paper on an entire building, but one could write a 1,000 word essay on one of it's bricks. I think Cuaron applied this simple, yet very effective lesson to 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. He's done away with trying to cram as much in as possible and fleshed out what otherwise would have withered into faded memory. Just look at what he's done to Daniel Radcliffe. Before, his character was almost forgettable and the fangirls glommed onto Tom Felton and Sean Biggerstaff. Now that Cuaron was able to focus in on Harry and get a stronger performance out of Dan you see thread after thread of girls on the messageboards going completely ga ga over him. It's not just because puberty is unfairly kind to him; he was pleasing to look at even back in 'David Copperfield'. It's because Harry is now a character you can FEEL for. There's something sexy about a tortured character, no matter what their age, and in 'Prisoner of Azkaban' Harry's tortured soul has been amplified threefold.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
816,l4taylor,My own review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,8,31 May 2004,"So was the latest Harry Potter Installment worth the wait?I would say YES. The film itself is made very well, special effects up to standard and best of all, the scenery was excellent.Surely Alfonso Cuaron has done us proud? Well, Yes and No really. Read on....Standing at 142 minutes, you fail to realize that time has gone so quick. As the credits for the movie rolled, I thought, ""my god, is that it?"". I could have easily sat there for much longer, perhaps the length of a Lord of the Rings movie.The downfall with this movie is that is strays through the book too quickly. At one point, I thought I must have fallen asleep because we got from one section of the book (in the film) to another, within a blink of an eye. So much has been cut from the book and I think this is its downfall. Obviously, for those people who do not read the books, they would not see anything wrong, but for the book fans, some may be disappointed. Major plots in the book are cut into 1-2 minute scenes and some important facts have been missed out. A lot of characters from the book were not used either and those that were, so little time on the screen- ie, Mcgonagall. She was only in a few scenes, as was Dumbledore himself (Michael Gambon--Well done!!) and Snape--compared to the book was hardly present in the movieI give this movie 8 out of 10. For the normal viewers, you will Love this movie, for the fans-- very very good but it felt like a rush to get to the end and there was a lot of plot holes and parts of the book that should have been there",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
817,arsenalfan,Cuaron creates masterpiece,10,5 June 2004,"Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch.Michael Gambon does a fine job replacing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson hams it up as the spaced-out Divination teacher, Professor Trelawny.Gary Oldman is good as escaped-prisoner Sirius Black. He doesn't have much to do, but what he does works well. I look forward to seeing more of him as the series continues.Of all the adult actors, my highest praise must go to David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Thewlis was assigned the task of bringing to life one of the best-loved characters of the Rowling books, and has done so magnificently.This review wouldn't be complete without mention of the overall tone of the film. This of course is due to the amazing direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Everything about this film is in stark contrast to the first two offerings by Chris Columbus. By no means does this belittle Columbus' two Potter films. I enjoyed them very much. However, I must say that this third chapter was the most satisfying of the three. I believe it's because, as strange as this may sound, everything felt more ""real."" There wasn't this sense of wonderment that was ever-present during the first two films. In ""Azkaban,"" everything in the wizarding world is just matter-of-fact, and that in itself is magical.Also of note is the fine special effects in the film. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked absolutely amazing - like a real animal. Those horrifying guards of Azkaban, the Dementors, were just the right touch of scary. It's tough to keep them from looking like the Black Riders from Lord Of The Rings, but their mouths are all their own and are truly frightening!In all, an absolutely fantastic film, and one that I am sure to see several times over.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

819,lanieintexas428,What Happened to this movie!!!!!!,3,4 June 2004,"Let's keep this short and sweet.I'm a die hard Harry Potter fan and this movie was suppose to be darker. Instead we get light and fluffy. I expected this movie to be different just not this disappointing. Yeah of course the special effects were awesome and there was some humor also. Now I'm not saying the other two movies weren't a little disappointing, because the truth be told they were, but not as much as this film. I can under stand some of the changes, but lets talk about some others. Hagrids cabin, When did an earth quake happen to slide Hagrids cabin down the hill? What happen to Snape? When did he stop being sinister?Why is the Whomping Willow in a totally different spot? Why is McGonagall in this movie only once? Why is Dumbledore a bumbling old man and this one instead the powerful wizard that he is supposed to be?This is only five things that disgusted me about this movie. Luckily they have a different director for the Goblet of Fire. Hey this is just my two cents,but save your ten bucks and barrow it from the library or someone you know when it comes out on VHS or DVD.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It was the opening day and I was sooooo excited, Not only do I get to see the now mature and hot Emma Watson again on film, I get to see one of the 5 books that made me read and get some knowledge into my brain put on the screen. I had trouble thinking that the director of a raunchy sex film would make a good adaptation of Mrs.Rowling's perfect story. he turned out to be a great choice! the movie is superb in every way. The only put down for me was that Harry got his Firebolt at the end. The werewolf was cool, too! Dementors are actually scary, and the monster book of monsters was kind of freaky! I give this film a perfect 100%",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
821,Sunshine00000002,Best adaptation of the spirit of Harry Potter,9,30 July 2004,"This movie was most clearly better adapted from the previous Harry Potter films not because of being true to the book, but the spirit. What struck me the most of what was wrong with the first two were that they were *too* close on following JK Rowling's Harry Potter, and left the wow factor at that, save for the pause-to-awe of the awesome magic that really made the films too childish and stupifying. This film weaves the magic throughout the experience and causing wizardry to be more normal and casual, helping to add to the darker, more adult act. I was especially pleased by Gary Oldman's Sirius Black, in fact most out of the new characters added to Harry Potter. The actors for Peter Pettigrew and Prof. Trelawney was passable, and the acting for Prof. Lupin was a good choice. This was definitely the best of the three so far, but unfortunately I will be happy to see the director skip HP 4, because of this history that he would go over many of the very significant plots of the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The direction is much better and improved, i'm glad to see this guy was chosen cause i think the film is better with a darker tone. Harry potter still is a not the greatest actor if u ask me, i didn't like him that much, never have. Hermoine did better, and Ron is just as good as he has been. I thought the special effects were really good, the dementors were crazy, that was cool. (SPOILERS) Gary Oldman i guess did o.k. cause he was only in the movie for like literally 10-15mins, and it goes by fast making it seem like 5mins. I definitely enjoyed this movie, but it could have been better in ways, like the very last shot of the film wasn't very good it hough, and the ending was kinda rushed. Besides that, lupin was great, and the movie goes by really fast, enjoy it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
823,MyEmpireIsCrumbling,Harry Potter and the New Lease of Life,7,23 July 2004,"Harry Potter is one of those phenomenons that you either get or you don't. Having a little sister who has read all of the books and is properly immersed in Potter-lore I can understand to a certain extent why kids are so enamoured by the boy wizard. I myself have read all the books over the last few years, which I enjoyed even if they were relatively unremarkable.Being a keen film goer I have seen all the Potter films on the big screen and also on DVD. Whilst I could happily sit through the first two films they never particularly grabbed my attention, they seemed more focused on getting over as much of the information from the books than being cinematic entities in their own right. Admittedly the Chamber of Secrets marginally improved upon this but still lacked a voice of it's own. Chris Columbus shouldn't be overly criticised for his Potter offerings, it was a wise choice on his behalf to stay faithful to the books as much as he did or face the consequences of disappointing a sizeable proportion of the worlds child population. As a result of Columbus' offerings Cuaron has a much easier starting position. It is readily established that the cinematic Potter can stand on its own feet, and this allows The Prisoner of Azkaban to spread its wings a little more than its predecessors.It has become clichéd to say the film is darker than the previous outings (see the Lost World: Jurassic Park or Back to the Future II) but in this case it's true, not just in tone but in the look of the film. Hardly a frame goes by where the mise-en-scene is not shrouded in shadow or the action pounded by rain. In terms of the story (many claim Azkaban to be the better of the Potter books) there is an improvement on the first two films, with a significant change to structure, which was already becoming tiresome (welcome to Hogwarts, something strange is going on, quick Harry face Voldemort). Credit here must go to Cloves who was again on screenplay duties, who now seems comfortable enough with the material to be able to steer away from the source more effectively this time around. The result is a much better paced script that is structured more like a film than episodes 1 and 2 which were if anything guilty of being too worthy to the book, which does not make for a good film (Does anyone remember Sphere?).The truncated script is served well by Curaons swift atmospheric direction.Even though Hogwarts had magic in the earlier films Curaons vision of the school is something else altogether more mysterious and often sinister, which suits the storyline and the theme of self discovery, the passage of time and the realisation of the adult world. Curaon and his director of photography Michael Seresin use the camera wonderfully to further evoke these themes. The camera passes through the workings of the Hogwarts tower onto the faces of the main trio on numerous occasions each time effectively reinforcing the narrative not detracting from it. The cinematography allows the audience to become more involved with the events rather than just a voyeur.Despite the shorter running time and general better pacing the principle characters are given more room to grow, we get a much better feeling for the way relationships are developing between the principle trio, especially Ron and Hermione. Unfortunately due to the more streamlined script some of the more interesting elements are left out including any real input by Snape (the always enjoyable Rickman) who is Potters Trump card a character of genuine interest and divided loyalties. Although by sideline some elements of the book it does give the main actors opportunity to shine, the three main kids whilst not outstanding are now much more comfortable with their roles, I genuinely hope for the sake of the films they are not replaced. In terms of the adults both Thewlis and Oldman come out with their reputations as serious actors untarnished, Blacks (Oldman) first encounter with Harry is a genuine standout moment. Also of note is Gabon as Dumbledore who while he does not exert the same ominous presence as Richard Harris provides a much more enjoyable headmaster and a far more likable character.This is however not to say the film is without fault, the Dursleys prologue has now become tiresome (I've heard a rumour they are to be dropped from Potter 4). The first half of the film whilst enjoyable stays too close to the format of the previous films, the major changes only come in the third act. Most disappointing for me however were the dementors, whilst they were an impressive design and had some genuinely creepy moments I thought their potential was somewhat wasted considering the importance of their presence. Although I have sung praise for the shortened script elements which will become of importance in later films have unfortunately been glossed over which may create problems later on but all in all Potter 3 is a highly entertaining family film7 out of 10Oh and before I finish. Those who remember the geography of Hogwarts from the first two film may also be a little confused by the sudden tectonic activity that seems to have afflicted the Hogsmead area. I personally prefer the setting in the stunning Glencoe but some may be perturbed by the lack of continuity, children can however be persuaded it's magic.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I have yet to read any of the books but I have seen all of the movies and so far this one is my absolute favorite. This movie is so terrific and so different than the other two films. I love that the film was geared towards more darker, scarier and adult themes. I also loved the fact that Harry Potter is growing up and he is showing a more emotional side to himself. I am glad that we get to see his anger, his sadness, and his strength. I like the way he stood up against the Dursleys, I loved how the students were relaxed and wearing street clothes, I liked the guys hanging out just acting like teenage guys. The special effects were amazing, I loved the blossoming romance between Hermoine and Ron even though they pretend to hate each other. Daniel Radcliffe is turning into a seasoned actor, Emma Watson has grown into a beautiful, strong, and smart character in the film, and Rupert Grint is just a red haired cutie pie with great acting and comedy timing. All in all I thought the movie was great. I love all of the changes and all of the characters and if this is the growth of Harry Potter then they are definitely going in the right direction. This is the best film so far and I predict that its just going to get better and better.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
825,DIVACANSANG1,"Sometimes, Change is Good",10,6 June 2004,"I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
826,MezzadrilPhoenix,Not the greatest,8,6 June 2004,"for me , the film concentrated on being scary ... it was over all a waste of money for everyone who worked on this film... to think the director / script writer didn't go in depth with the characters enough was just plain stupid... it had the potential to be a great film , after all it was my favorite book... it was also way to short ... and very very choppy... i did like the depiction of the dementors and i do like how the character of Sirius and Remus came out ... just next movie i hope they try to be more about the feelings of the book , than trying to scare people... i did enjoy seeing Harry's aunt blow up...and the fact that all the characters have slightly evolved... well thats all i guess , i would have liked it a lot more if it were in depth just even a bit.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
827,mizz_m_2002,The magic Within!,10,3 June 2004,"(Spoilers)Where do I start with this movie? Well, I suppose I should start by telling you that I am a huge fan of the books, especially this one and so I may be slightly biased. From start to finish I found my self on the edge of the seat, taking in every inch of the screen not wanting to miss a second. The movie flowed smoothly with everything in a perfect order. We would have great scenes with the actors in and then panoramic views of the area surrounding Hogwarts, especially the crucial Womping Willow.The movie starts with our hero practicing magic back at the Dursleys and from then on we are on a roller coaster ride of emotions. From the high points, especially Ron's (Grint) comments to the more sentimental and slightly 'mad' moments of the thought to be evil, Black (Oldman). Thelwis made a wonderful job of portraying the mysterious Lupin as did Oldman with Sirius, both exactly as I personally imagined. The Dementors were a rather creepy moment, helping to introduce the more darker and serious side to the stories.Yes, Alfonso has made an absolutely wonderful job with this movie, sticking to most of the plot. There were a few things which were missed out which to a non-reader may be come confusing but if thought are obvious. He introduced many wonderful extras into the films whilst sticking to the basics. Lupin's 'jazzy' music had a wonderful down to Earth feel bringing this character to life and his and Harry's one on ones allowed to gain a back story to everyone. An extremely enjoyable movie for all the family, with some wonderful additions to the cast, from Emma Thomspson to Dawn French. Acting has improved greatly as has the atmosphere and effects are superb.A must see for fans and non-fans alike.10/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
828,coffeeandcelluloid,Amazing piece of art,10,2 June 2004,"The film was absolutely amazing. Alfonso has worked his own magic to truly bring Harry Potter to life. The direction and cinematography were not at all hindered by Hollywood pressure, and this is by far one of the best major studio films I've seen. It is truly a brilliant piece of art.If you are looking for great adaptation then I must say this is not it. But what was changed was all for the better. There was no mention or scenes of the Quidditch cup or final match, but you have the first too movies if you want Quidditch. For the scenery, parts of Hogwarts were different but with Alfonso's direction it was made to be absolutely brilliant.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
829,sammy999,Confusing.,10,6 November 2012,Now how does the time travel in this film work?!!!! It doesn't make sense what so ever when the time travel is introduced and even before it is. when harry is in Hagrids hut before Buckbeak is executed he clearly gets hit on the head with a pumpkin stone and another stone smashes a jar in the hut and when harry turns around no-body is there. But when Harry and Hermione go back into the past it is Hermione that throws the stone at harry to warn him the executioner is coming this leads to a very confusing story line of how originally hit harry with the stone because this would mean they had already went back in the past which would have meant again they had went back in the past before that and also when Ron is in the hospital wing and harry and Hermione come back after saving Serius black and Buckbeak we see an other Hermione and harry leaving to go back in time which would mean it would happen all over again which is very confusing.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
830,calliej3,worth the 8 bucks but not really,6,8 June 2004,"hello first off i want anyone reading this to understand that i have read the books all the way. OK, i found this movie to be more or a disappointment than some people say it was. but i would recommend this movie to any one who doesn't mind violence. or action. seeing how there is a good bit or that in the movie. if your looking for a movie you can see time after time, this is not the movie for you. a person could most likely see this movie about two (2) times before it lost all or most of the fun, surprise, and everything else. i recommend you to read the book before or after the movie. and i m sorry about any spelling mistakes",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
831,SchizophrenicRingwraith,Best Potter Movie yet,9,29 July 2005,"With an entirely different director, followed by a different style, the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people questioning whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its predecessors. As for me, it not only was entertaining, but seemed better and more adult than its predecessors.When comparing such a movie to its original novel, it's hard to say how along the lines this particular movie followed. With several crucial missing parts, it left faithful Potter fans to throw their popcorn cartons to the screen, and babbling about Cuaron's terrible job on the movie. I, having read the series, do agree that the film could have done well and made more sense with what had been cut. However, most forget to think of this movie as a movie alone--with no thought of the novel from which it was derived. Instead of comparing it to its novel twin, comparing it with its predecessors would be more accurate.As the series progresses, the stories, therefore the movies, get better, as well as the acting abilities. As the stories continue to get darker, the characters continue to mature. Radcliffe's performance, unfortunately, was a bit of a disappointment. Having improved since ""Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone"", his performance was still less than expected for the third installment and for the character he plays. He is Harry Potter, after all.Watson continues to improve, and she does not disappoint in her performance as Hermione Granger. She has grown to be one of the finest and most respectable teenage actresses for this generation. Grint has a natural talent for being Ron Weasley. It was almost as if he were born to play the part. He IS Ron. His performance was one of the most entertaining in the entire film. Comic relief is an important part in films which consist mainly of darker matters, which is what Ron brings to the film.The style in which this movie was set--more casual and laid back--was really appealing. It was refreshing to see that Hogwarts students aren't always in uniform, and everything is really comforting. This was by far the best way I have seen a Harry Potter film. Cuaron should have directed all three films. His style of directing was really riveting.Thus, I give Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban a 9/10 rating. Fantabulous.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
832,redroja,liked chamber of secrets better,6,3 June 2004,"well well well - what can i say - it is a great movie - well done - visually it is a treat. it starts with the usual drama of how harry is being treated badly and his dose of sweet revenge - perhaps a bit overdone and it is beginning to look dated. the bus to the leaky cauldron is terrific. superb editing and a nice tension mixed with some comic elements - not kiddish at all. the main reason this movie falls below the second one is because the plot is not well developed by the director. i don't feel the angst for the escaped prisoner and i keep asking myself what has he done - of course, of course, he has been involved in the murder of his parents you dumbo - that qualifies for him to be hated so much, to be imprisoned for 12 years......wish the director had some visualisation of the murder of Harry's parents or about Azkaban and its horrific nature etc. or simply about Siruis himself...the movie almost starts with the character in it and goes no further to create that tension to dislike him....i did'nt develop strong feelings for Sirius black and there the plot feel a few notches compared to the previous movie the chamber of secrets i felt here the story line is a bit weak. the chamber of secrets had a great ending with the fight sequence with voldermot et al. the ending here - the tim e travel etc is lever but not so engaging and feels a bit affected...the dementors have been conceived very well...the cold, dark, menace they are comes across superbly. hermione's character is well developed while Rons's roles is too shallow. Harry of course is the hero and has done a great job. some predictable elements like poor malfoy getting bashed up etc...and i wonder whether it was at all necessary to have the divination teacher ( emma thompson)...felt very flaky and purposeless.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
833,redroja,the scar - right or left temple,6,3 June 2004,"In the scene after Prof Lupin demonstrates the way to get over the worst fears - i noticed harry's scar was on his left temple...did I make a mistake or was it wrong..did anyone else notice?a small point but i suddenly felt that there was an error and...i asked my wife who was in the movie but she could'nt say for sure...the dementors looked meana nd cold, hermione has shaped up well, cuaron deserves credit for allowing the character to mature wisely. siruis black doesn't evoke any emotion in me at all..he is as cold as the dementors. i loved the werewolf scenes.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
834,element_echo,Fan-bloody-tastic,8,26 May 2004,"Us at the Odeon all saw the run-through of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban this morning- and boy does it rock. I mean, the acting is still a little dodgy and the new Dumbledore is a little sketchy but maaaaannnnnn....I mean Harry. Wow. He's angry, he's bitter, he has an attitude and best of all- he is no longer being shadowed by Ron. And speaking of Ron- him and Hermione have this great sexual tension (yes, I know they're 13. So, it's more puppy-love tension) But it's there and just lacing the plot with little 'will they wont they' feelings.Onto the plot-- they don't skimp on the important bits. Some parts I can tell people who haven't read the books would be a little bemused but apart from that Alfonso Cuarón really pulls it off. He takes his time to show just how everyone is feeling- reflecting on images of the scenery which must make the old director quiver. Also- he has just shown the world that Harry Potter is not kids stuff any longer. By the third book we can see just how they are growing up and Cuarón reflects on this successfully. So if little kids are watching this- be prepared to scare themselves when the Dementors come along. They will make you shiver. All in all the film is so much better than the first two- bringing out the best in the young actors and not missing what Rowling was going for when she wrote it. Fan-bloody-tastic.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
835,acrnkn,Not quite all there,6,14 June 2004,"I am going to start by saying how much I have loved the Harry Potter books; their growing complexity and J.K. Rowling's ability to have the characters mature is amazing. Unfortunately, the movie adaptations are falling away from quality of the original written work. The Prisoner of Azkaban is visually stunning and the casting is superb, but the filmmaker is assuming that the audience will have read the books before having seen the movie. This is probably a fair assumption, but it was in the omission of minor details that bothered me the most about this film. A few extra lines of exposition would have made all the difference in the world to the quality of the film and its continuity. For example, it was never explained why Sirius Black chose this particular time to escape from Azkaban, it was assumed that the audience would know. Also, how did Professor Lupin know how to use the Marauder's Map, only those who had read the book would know. Otherwise these two instances leave gaping continuity holes in the film. These would not have been difficult holes to patch and it would have been worthwhile for audience members new to the film. On the other hand, the time turner is dealt with quite well and the emotional impact of Harry creating the Patronus is heartfelt without being overwrought. I hope this is not an indication of what is to come for The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix, books that are even more complex and detailed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
836,eldanielfire,Very good.,9,31 May 2004,"I really liked this film.Like the previous 2 it is not a patch on the books, however its a very well acted and directed and is the perfect visual representation of the book story.As I reread the book I see the parts from the film, much like the first 2.It's funny, smart and darker. A few of the questions raised from the book however are not raised here and the focus is far more on Harry at the expense of some of the supporting casts characters being 'fleshed out'. However the complaint here is that there is so much good stuff you want more.The only flaw is that the editing feels rushed do the film moves at such a pace you can rarely digest everything thats happening, so it'll probably be more enjoyable on DVD :-). However, surly after 'Lord of the rings' Warner could do a 'extended version' for the first 3 films, especially this one. It would make Potter purists happier if more scene's are put back in and it would make them another wave of mega cash for whats is relatively a small investment in a editor.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
837,Celticmuse05,Not too bad,10,7 June 2004,"Maybe I am just a Potter purist, but part of me thinks the movie could have been a little better. Granted, it stuck to the main points of the book, but it moved a little fast for my taste and I was sad to see that they did not show the quidditch house cup scene. There were a few times where the movie strayed from the book, like the whole scene with Harry looking for Pettigrew in the corridor, but nothing really too major. I did enjoy the new music and look that this new director added to the films, and i thought that the acting was much better. I was also pleased with Thewlis' Portrayal of Lupin and Oldmans portrayal of Sirius. But I just think they took too much out. Granted the movie was already 2 1/2 hours long and they stuck to the main points, but there were some parts that I was looking forward to seeing and didn't. But, then again, I am a Potter purist. I give it a 9 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
838,SquashCoach,"I have to admit, as an AVID READER, this movie was not that great...",6,4 June 2004,"Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, there were some cool scenes, but the director altered it SO MUCH, not only from the book, but from the other freaking films. I mean, the landscape of Hogwarts looks like the result of a devastating mudslide based on how much it has changed. It really is noticeable. There are also so many minor alterations from the book that seemed out of place. For example, what the heck was with the talking head on the Knight Bus? That was just dumb. Also, the pace of the entire time they were at school seemed like it went all too quickly and it was rushed. The pace was really off and they never really had an ending to the SCHOOL, just an ending of Harry's adventure/quest. But, there were some good things about the movie, like the Bogart scene for example. Also, Gary Oldman did an excellent job in the small role he had. BUT FINALLY, and most importantly, the feud between Malfoy and Potter has just gone too goddamn far. I mean it is so cheesy, and so corny to a point of feeling uncomfortable watching it. Every time they meet it is like a showdown. They throw out some insults, Malfoy's friends chuckling at his ""clever"" remarks, and Harry's friends stick up for him. In the book it doesn't nearly seem that ridiculous, possibly (and probably) because it is written, not acted out. But I do cut the scene some slack, for two reasons. The first reason is the director is working with inexperienced kid actors. The second reason is that I myself can't imagine them doing it any better ON SCREEN (perhaps they could tone it down and make it more discreet, that is about it). Now, all in all, it was about a 6.5 out of 10. I liked the movie, but from a movie-making point of view, it wasn't that great. The reason, after all of this criticism and negative remarks about the film, that I gave it a high score (in terms of ratings) was that these flaws didn't bother me that much, but they were evident. Now, I can see why someone who is bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would despise the movie, and I can see why someone who isn't bothered by these flaws and inconsistencies would adore this movie. This was a fun review to write.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
839,pyrogal1016,What I Thought,10,1 June 2004,"I honestly thought that this was the most brilliant of the three movies. All three of the kids have grown so much as young actors and actresses. The performance given by Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), and the chemistry between him and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) were completely brilliant. The only lacking part of this movie was the quidditch scene. Brilliant and beautiful as it was, it was cut way too short (around five minutes, mostly of Harry dodging dementors), and this is a problem as this is many young children's favourite part of the Harry Potter movies. Both Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)have transitioned gracefully into teenagers, both very good looking, while Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley)has kept with his character's lanky, less smooth looks. Congratulations, Alfonso Cuaron, 10 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
840,bumfluff_j,"WOW! I think it contains SPOILERS, not sure though!",10,2 June 2004,"This has got to be the best Harry Potter movie yet, it is way better than the first two. I love it sooo much that I am going to see it again for my friends birthday! I saw it 9:45 31st May 2004, I was one of the first people in Wales to see it, or so I have been told! It is very funny in various parts of the movie (nearly all of those funny moments were provided by Rupert Grint-Ron Weasley!) The animals in the movie are soooooo cute (even Crookshanks)! Aunt Marge being blown up was one of the highlights of the movie! My personal favourite part of the movie was the boggart scenes, snape in a dress = HILARIOUS! Honestly I think Rupert Grint was the best in that movie and overall although the position of Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow was changed from the first two movies it was an excellent movie!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
841,carpe_retractum,David Thewlis and Gary Oldman stole the movie.,10,12 July 2004,"Okay, so I go along to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to enjoy seeing my favourite book of the HP series put on the big screen. The film is excellent, of course, but there is one major problem with it, well, actually two: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. These two excellent actors stole the whole film. No sooner than Remus J Lupin teaches his class to tackle the Boggart, I was aching to see more of his antics ( as we obviously do in the book ). But when Sirius and Remus take the stage together - my God what chemistry. It could have gone on forever and would have if the scene hadn't been reduced so much ( which I'm angry about by the way >:  ). And of course throw Alan Rickman into the mix and it actually becomes heaven. Roll on Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. I want the talented Gary and David back on screen! :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
842,marijeisback,Brilliant,10,5 June 2004,"It was the greatest film ever! It's exciting and a bit scary... The pace is great, you fly through the story, so there is enough time to show the important bits. There are many things directly taken from the book, and if you are a huge fan like me that's nice. And Sirius Black, I think they couldn't have casted a more brilliant man than Oldman. He's wonderfully crazy and weird. Not so great is that when you haven't read the books you'd probably not understand everything. There's no explanation of Potter, Black and Pettigrew becoming Animangi for Lupin....And you wouldn't recognize james potter....but ahh what the hell, It's an amazing movie....you should all go see it!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

This is one of the plus points of the film, which in my opinion is some way off the other 2. As a huge fan of the ""Harry Potter"" series and having read all the books i feel this film left out a bit to much of the fun material associated with Harry Potter. Instead the film had a very rigid storyline and without the fun most of us love in these films lost my attention very soon. Of course this opinion is as a HP lover and is compared to the other 2 films. In all it is a Very very good film but not one that reminds me very much of the Harry Potter saga.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
844,jessca27,Book is better...Spoiler...,6,4 June 2004,"The third book was definitely more exciting than the first two. However the movie did not do it justice. The actors did a superb job with their characters and the movie was well made, but important and exciting parts of the book were left out. Here's the spoiler: Harry never got presents from his friends, there was no visit for Harry to Diagon Alley, no second Quidditch game for the Cup, the chapter on the Firebolt was left out only to be thrown in at the very end, the movie didn't explain why Lupin and Black were Animagus, they also left out the part where Black tries to attack Ron in the Gryffindor tower, Ron doesn't get his new owl nor does Harry get permission to visit Hogsmeade, and Crookshanks was hardly included and you kind of needed him to be. Hopefully they will and try and include that in the beginning of the next movie And there are more. I understand that the book was long and they couldn't include it all but I think fans of the book will be disappointed. Another thing that has me worried is that if they cut out all of that from this book cause it was so long, what will the leave out of the next two which are longer than this one, especially The Order of the Phoenix? I'm sure there's more they left out that I forgot. Like I said, the movie was made well and the actors did a great job, but I just felt a little cheated. Glad as I was to see it, I think I prefer the book more. So that's my thinking on the movie. I understand that nothing can be perfect but some things just shouldn't be messed with.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
845,DjDeb,Very Disappointed :-(,5,4 June 2004,"I was very disappointed with this film. I felt like I was being rushed though the whole movie, and too many crucial parts were left out. The total movie time was approx 2 hours and 12 minutes! I didn't like this new director's interpretation of the book. Everything was changed. I didn't feel any magic (no pun intended), and it seemed as if the movie was filmed in black & white. The golden glow was gone. The teachers only had a cameo, and I didn't feel Dumbledore's presence...not to mention that his beautiful white-silver beard and hair was turned into a muddy grey. Quidditch seemed to be non-existent, and the pitch was stripped of the flowing school banners. I hope the Dementors get Cuaron so he will not mess up any more HP movies. How could Ms. Rowling let him destroy her book?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
846,leannaestes,win lose situation,6,5 June 2004,"There are as many great things about this movie as there are sad disappointments.Harry is 13 now and starting his third year at hogwarts. he is reunited with his friends and finds that he is yet again in trouble. The dangerous prisoner, Sirius Black, had become the first in history to escape from Azkaban Prison, and he is going to Hogwarts to seek his revenge.This movie is darker than the last two and I think that the mood and atmosphere of this movie reflects the intention of the director. It is time to see that Harry Potter is not just for kids anymore. The evolution of the kids as well as the CGI development is really maturing and coming to fulfill the climax of the movie that will lead to the center of the entire plot. As we all are aware, there is no way to fit a 700+ page book fully and detailed into a 2 1/2 hour movie... but some changes of the director really offended the faithful readers of the series.Overall, a great film that, though a bit choppy, made everyone want to believe in the magic in ourselves.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
847,the-reviewer,"My first Harry Potter movie. All I can say is, hype is overrated.",7,6 June 2004,"I've heard both sides. The Harry Potter movies are brilliant!...and the Harry Potter movies aren't all that fantastic. I've heard the same about the books. What I remembered quickly after seeing this film, is either way, don't believe the hype.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was an interesting experience. Having never read one of the books or seen the previous movies, I was tempted to try a little of both before seeing this movie, but decided to give in. I was happy with my choice. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson made a great team and carried the movie well from beginning to end. (I'm not sure why IMDb lists them - Grint and Watson - so far down the list of cast - to me they were the prominent figures). I was impressed with their abilities in the film and would be interested to see them outside of the Harry Potter genre. The special effects in the movie were decent, though the werewolf effects were a little weak. I enjoyed the flying scenes and the comic relief on the bus as well as from Rupert's Ron Weasley. The ending was a surprise and I thought tied up the story nicely.My only disappointments in the movie were three. First, I would have liked to see more from Maggie Smith in this movie. Perhaps it is because her character in the book has a small role, but such a wonderful actress as Ms. Smith is one I always enjoy. Second, and this is more of a personal annoyance rather than disappointment - Alan Rickman's character ""Sererus Snape"" was pretty distracting. I didn't care for that character much. Last, and this is entirely unrelated to the movie's production - I think I would have enjoyed it better without so many young children in the theater. >From smells of diapers, to cries and jumping around and sudden outbursts - it became a little distracting. But, what can I expect from a children's cult movie? All in all this was a fun movie to see and it has turned me on the possibility of seeing the others. I still enjoyed Lord of the Rings better :), but every movie has its place, and there's certainly no doubt of that after you have seen this wonderful flick!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
848,rosefw1987,Best Ever!!! WARNING-MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS,10,6 June 2004,"First off, I have read all the Potter books at least four times. I can practically remember every detail in every book. I went into the movie theatre prepared to be disappointed but being a harry potter fan, i couldn't help myself. I saw this movie and loved it. The atmosphere is great and so much better than the ball of fluff the first two movies were. Unlike some people I found the humor to be just right. Yes, i know a lot was cut out and the storyline was basically butchered, but for once I wasn't thinking about that when I was watching it. It was so much more adult than the first two and the movie showed that brilliantly.The acting was much better in my opinion. Hermione(Emma Watson) wasn't so annoying and talked naturally. Ron (Rupert Gint) was better too. He actually had a display of emotions instead of the normal panicky look he constantly had. Harry(Daniel Radcliff) is about the same as he was before, if only slightly better. The adult actors were great as usual. Snape deserved much more screen time and Michael Gambon can never compete with Rex harrison, but he wasn't a complete failure. Finally, Malfoy, I thought, was a bit whimpy in this one. He looks a lot better (HOTTER!!) but he wasn't as vicious. The set was much better. Hagrids' hut is in a different place, which i'm not sure how they will manage that in the future movies, since some scenes have to rely on the fact that the hut is near the castle. The castle was a lot darker. It isn't the cheery place you would imagine. They showed the characters more outdoors than in the castle, which is fine since the outdoor scenes are just gorgeous. The scene with the whomping willow was great fun, and had me laughing more than usual. The characters weren't in their school uniforms but in normal clothes. I found this to be great since it shows them as normal children. And finally, the scene where Hermione punches Malfoy, is worth every dollar I paid.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
849,angela32285,Expectations met...,10,6 June 2004,"Out of every Harry Potter movie I have seen, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best thus far. It fulfilled and exceeded my expectations in each area-it was funny, serious, scary and mature enough to keep me intrigued. It is wonderful to see these young actors taking on roles that in some areas of the world are hard to make believable. With their talents, enthusiasm, apparent dedication to the film and a great script, they have made the Harry Potter series what it has become: something for everyone.I have read the books and I must say it is a true pleasure being able to put characters' names to faces-It makes the reading experience so much better. I give it a 10 out of 10!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
850,Reidfan,Best of the three made so far,9,7 June 2004,"While I would have liked to see better explanation of the Marauders, I really think this one is a superior movie to the first two. The kids are all getting better, and the CGI this time was wonderful. Buckbeak was breathtaking. The patronus was so well done, and the imagery was just beautiful.Whoever's responsible for casting is to be commended. Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson absolutely wonderful in their roles, but David Thewlis just blew me away, he was ..I'm at a loss for words... stunning, perfect and amazing don't cover it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
851,terpsfan89,Disappointment,6,7 June 2004,"I was disappointed at this movie. As the book is my favorite so far, I expected much more. The casting wasn't great at all, and they missed too many important things, including the explanation of the map. I thought Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, compared to the annoyance that it was in the first and second movies. The set of Hogwarts, to me, was much better than before. The scenes with Aunt Marge were so much better than I'd expected, and the humor of it was fantastic. I think the change in directors really improved the movie, but the screenplay shouldn't have been like it was. They should not have deleted so much stuff from the book. I thought that some parts should have been changed, but the special effects were better than Columbus' special effects. Overall, it could have been better if Rupert Grint hadn't been so whiny, and the screenplay had been different.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
852,sharislaya,Something Fresh!,9,11 June 2004,"To tell you the truth i wasn't expecting much from the film, i had always enjoyed the books so much more then i ever did the movies as i never felt they truly explored what it meant to be apart of the magical world that is Harry Potter. This film almost did it, and thats how close a film will ever get to it, because nothing will ever be able to compare to the books. The dark themes were right alongside the simplicity and beauty. It was much more streamlined which helped but at the same time there were the poignant scenes between harry and Lupin. I wish more of a relationship could have developed between Harry and Sirius as that was never really explored but other then that, it kept me captivated.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
853,saurabh_dashora2000,Book reader: beware of this movie,1,14 June 2004,"SPOILERS!!! I have seen the film and am already rueing to change my decision to do so now. The reviews have already disappointed me. I'm a huge fan of HP books and films but if Cuaron has changed Hogwarts, removed the robes, altered the school grounds, Hagrid's hut and Whomping Willow, what's the use to this movie?What is go great about Harry Potter is its different. If there are no fascinations about the wizarding world and nothing different, what's the big deal? I like jeans but HP should always wear robes.I have heard all stuff that its darker and so better but I feel that it has been overly darkened. Hogwarts is a place to study and the safest place in the world. If its so dark and dangerous, what's the use of studying in there? Why would parents send their children to such a haunted place.Another half hour to the movie would have been a good deed. There are hardly any explanations. What about Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs? What about Snape's hatred to Harry? The werewolf was a scum and Buckbeak lacked the essence of Dobby.The first two films were slow but they were classical in their approach. They allowed the viewers to gulp in the tale. This one was a rush-over. Why did the Dementors looked like balloons? Why did Cuaron changed them so much? Was he afraid of the Wraiths of LOTR?Well, readers have already accepted them as they were and there is no need to be so different. Dumbledore should immediately be changed. Sign up Ian Meckellen. He is even better than Richard Harris. Sirius should not have been shown so terrible.I think it was great injustice to JK Rowling. I have sympathy towards her for I know what a writer feels when he sees his story being obliterated by poor direction. I too am a writer. I feel that she should step in and write the script for Goblet and in fact, bring Columbus back who managed to realize the essence of Harry Potter. She should help in the direction as well. If Goblet suffers from the same discrepancies, Harry Potter would be over.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
854,llmcdermott,"Disappointing and unsatisfactory, still better than most of what is out there.",6,14 June 2004,"This could be construed as having minor spoilers. I found the latest of the Harry Potter films to be very unsatisfying. While the acting was good, the story line was very episodic with no flow that told a coherent story. Too many things were left out such as the winning of the Quidditch cup and the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map. Nothing was said about Sirius giving Harry permission to visit Hogsmeade. Not enough was made of Percy making Head Boy. Other unnecessary scenes were added, The chorus singing near the beginning of the movie was cute, but not pertinent to the story or even derived from the book. The Knight bus scene was too long and some characters changed. I don't remember a hunchback at the Leaky Cauldron. The film quality looked very bad. I guess the director was trying to make a statement but it looked more like something that had been videotaped. The colors were muddy and many scenes almost appeared subtly out-of-focus.Hogwarts looked like it had fallen on bad times and they had been evicted to shabbier quarters. The books talk of a sloping lawn, not an extremely steep hillside, I thought the landscape changes were largely unnecessary and not well done. The addition of the giant clock was totally out of character with the non-mechanical world of the wizarding community in the Harry Potter books. Having the giant pendulum swinging dangerously through the hall bordered on stupidity. Clearly the director was trying to put his 'mark' on the films. He succeeded in making the film much less entertaining and less true to the author's world. The movie suffered from an attention to detail and had a very shallow feeling. There were confusing and unnecessary changes in plot and how characters acted. The shrunken heads and spinal column candlesticks should be sent back to Knockturn Alley where they belong and the director should be sent packing. If he had been responsible for the first two films I doubt they would have been nearly the success that they were.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
855,blackirishjunkie,Not Nearly Up to Par,2,3 January 2005,"I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series, and have read all the books several times, up until the sixth, (July 16, 2005) and this movie was for the most part, trash. It left out highly important plot keys like who Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs are, how important it was that Harry's Patronus takes the shape of a Stag. The back story it lacks is highly important to the books, and if they talk about time constraint, then what about that scene where Harry rides Buckbeak the hippogriff for five minutes? The CGI is amazing but I think it would have been a lot better had they kept the back story in. The worst part of this movie is the Shrunken head, who is just down right annoying. He wasn't even in the books but added him for some reason, unknown to us all. So if you want to know what happens to Harry in his third year at Hogwarts, skip the movie, and go buy the book. It costs just as much and is much more worth it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
856,iwritesf,"Visually stunning, but edited poorly",8,19 June 2004,"This movie is visually as stunning as anything I've seen in a long time. I'm excited to see it several more times, and I'm looking forward to Curon's handling of the next movie and more.However, I think Azkaban has been edited poorly. There are several dropped threads and essential information that is simply dropped. If you are not a fan of the books and have not read them, you will be, unfortunately, very confused during Azkkaban. If you've read the books, you can follow the plot, but you will similarly miss several important aspects.Dropped threads include: no explanation of who the makers of the Marauder's Map are, (so no explanation of why Harry's Patronus charm looks like a deer); Ron and Hermione's fights due to their pets is very minimal, although it is an essential aspect of the books. Lastly, Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie, which seems a nice reward - but the book used this more as a plot device to push the relationships between the main three characters.The changes aren't all bad, and Curon has certainly tried to make his own movie, instead of just following the books by chapter and verse. However, I'm hoping Curon has followed Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings format - I hope he has another half-hour on his cutting-room floor that he can release on DVD as an ""extended"" edition. This movie sorely needs it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
857,KatieScarlette,Keep an open mind...,8,20 June 2004,"A few things are different in the movie then in the book.For starters we all know that the actor to originate Prof. Dumbledore passed away shortly after the release of ""Chamber of Secrets"", thus a different actor with a different perspective on how to play Prof. Dumbledore is used.Secondly, that the book(500+ pages)is much longer than the movie(2hrs. 19min.)is. Thus making it virtually impossible to include everything.Thirdly, each one of our imaginations as to whom looks like what and how the book is perceived differs. Not only by age, but by gender as well.Lastly, by viewing the movie with preconceptions from the book, you are not allowing yourself to fully acknowledge the art it took into making the third series, let alone missing ""important"" key information. Such as when Harry reads the map (part truth and part bogus), you can clearly hear whose names are read on it.Thus, saying all that I have, I refuse to give you my positive and negative points about the movie, merely to say that I have seen it two times now and intend to buy it on DVD when it comes out.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
858,tudorpassa,What has gone wrong?,5,21 June 2004,"I recently saw a behind the scenes on t.v and heard director Alfonso Cuaron say that when he knew he was to direct he went and read the book through, I'd just like to know what book he was reading because it certainly wasn't the one I'd read several times over. If you haven't read the books then enjoy the film, if you have read the book then go to the cinema with the idea of watching an original version of what you haven't read. All the settings and characters we have enjoyed meeting in the first 2 films are totally turfed out for a darker more depressing feel, gone is Hagrid's cabin across the lawns it now can be found halfway down a mountain, Gone is the fatherly Dumbledore instead he's more like a music hall comedy magician. J.K. Rowling if you have any sympathy for your legions of book fans,oust this director from film 4 before you lose your audience. Of course I will have to buy the films on DVD otherwise you have an incomplete set, which is a very shrewd move on Warners behalf.Go see this at your peril.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The books are yes, better than the movies, but can be brought to life through the films. With that said, I must say that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best film adaption of the current trilogy. The actors were amazing; the set, as much as it changed, was fulfilling; the story was faithful despite minor alterations; and lastly, the wizard world was greatly explored. I gave it a 10/10 for it lived up to all expectations quite dutifully.I highly recommend Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to anyone with imagination.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
860,zaarmysterygirl,Very disappointing,5,26 June 2004,"This movie was made for those who haven't read the books. If it were a stand alone movie instead of one in the middle of a series it might not be so bad. Unfortunately for Harry Potter fans it is one from the middle of the series. When the series is done and you sit down to watch them one after the other this one will be a jarring note. Hogwarts has been changed inside and out. Even poor professor Flitwick doesn't look like himself.Even as a stand alone movie it has problems. The first half of the movie flies by and the poor actors have to react to situations in ways that make no sense. For example, Harry & Hermione both fly off the handle with little provocation. There is absolutely no build up to give you any idea why they are reacting the way they do. Even new characters do things that make no sense - Lupin taking Harry for a walk in the Forbidden Forest (off limits to students) after he scolds Harry for walking around the inside of the school at night. Go see the movie just because you're a fan but expect to be disappointed. Here's to hoping the next director is more concerned with the total picture (the series) than his piece of it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
861,mggoulden,A large improvement,9,3 September 2004,"Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds its predecessors in almost all respects, which isn't to say that Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were bad, just that this is better. The acting from all concerned is top notch (especially Thewlis as Professor Lupin) - the young actors have come on leaps and bounds from their previous efforts - and the special effects are so much more realistic (who can say Buckbeak is awful?). What impressed me most though, is the way the whole idea of magic is portrayed: whereas Chris Columbus presented it as some wondrous, awe-inspiring thing that has to be marveled at at all opportunities, Alfonso Cuaron let's the camera just glide by, as if seeing a spoon stirring itself or pouring a cuppa from a teapot suspended in midair are completely normal, everyday things!Chris Columbus was burdened with laying the ground rules of the Potter universe (at least on screen!), and it was obviously a big burden, resulting in lots of exposition, slow pacing now and then, and long running times for the first two excellent movies. But Cuaron has clearly been given more freedom to maneuver and he expresses himself wonderfully, supplying one of the best visual films I have seen in a long time. The Dementors in particular are a treat. Not only are they actually frightening (unlike the Basilisk or Spiders in CoS) - physically AND figuratively - but reading the novel, I just imagined them as indistinguishable from the Nazgul, or the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, or the Grim Reaper, and I was pleasantly surprised to see them flow and weave like they were moving through water. I would never have come up with that!! Yes, some of the characters are barely given any screen time - Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall for example - and I do imagine that the one or two people who watch the movie with no prior knowledge of Harry Potter will be left floundering at times, but at the end of the day Prisoner of Azkaban is a continuation of a series and if the price for enjoying a simply brilliant film that zips by at a joyously fast pace is having to know beforehand who Harry Potter actually is etc, and being slightly disappointed that some good sections of the novel are cut, then I for one am glad to pay it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

863,chalitodk,Pure magic and a lot more mischief.,10,5 May 2005,"When I first found out that a Mexican was directing the third installment in the phenomenal ""potter"" series was kind of a shock,a good one that is.Alfonso Cuaron directing the beautiful ""a little princess"" and the sexy ""y tu mama tambien"" has crafted a fantasy story worth remembering.The film,which is way much darker and it isn't directed to the kiddy audience,is mostly about betrayal of an old generation and revenge.Sirius Black,the escaped prisoner of Azkaban is heading to Harry to finally achieve what his master couldn't do:to finally get rid of the boy who lived.Also in this film many secrets are discovered (wont give them away!) and surprises that will be used in the upcoming films. The first two installments,directed by Chris Columbus didn't bring the spirit of wizards and witchcraft.For example since the movie is a about witches and dark lords ,it should be with more of a dark feeling in cinematography,music,and set decoration and thats something Columbus failed and Cuaron achieved.The performances here are way much better from regular child actors.Emma Watson delivers the role of the nerdy yet rebellion Hermione,Rupert Grint as the clumsy but loyal Ron,and Harry as the wizard who his mysterious past keeps unfolding at each movie.Even though the films are'nt as faithful in pages as the last two,it still manages to get the storyline right.And for the crazy fans who sended death threats to Cuaron,at the end credits you can see in bold letters:""BASED on the book by JK Rowling"".So they aren't saying it IS the movie,they are saying it is BASED.In conclusion,as crazy you might think I am,this was the best film of 2004.It has great performances,directed with inmense flair,art directed with a Gothic feel,beautiful music,spectacular special effects and most importantly of all it has the spirit of JK Rowling spectacular series in to a big budget movie.Amazing and truly captivating.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The ending scene was terribly messed up. Believe me, I have read the book over 6 times, I should know. The quidditch game is in the wrong time period; and since when do the students wear zip-up hoodies and rainbow belts? That is wrong.

It's as if the director decided he'd film every 20th page in the book, so great were the flying leaps over whole sections of plot. Not a lick-and-a-promise, but rather ignoring the in-between material entirely, as if it didn't matter to the story. Several VERY important scenes from the book that were vital to understanding the plot - such as the explanation of how Sirius, James and Peter had become animagi while still at Hogwarts - were apparently not deemed necessary for the movie.

Well, i liked it. Although it didn't perfectly follow the book (what movie does?) it was good. Here were some things i Didn't like though:The werewolf: He was bald. BALD. Need i say more? Sirius: OK, i loved the actor and all (he was good in the Scarlet Letter) but i think that he didn't do his best. Jim Cavesial (s/p?) would have been better.Dumbledore: I think everyone agrees with me that this Dumbledore sucked. The first one (i don't know the actors names) was better. I got the feeling that he knew EVERYTHING going on. HE was graceful, wise, and refined. This one was dressed as a hobo, had a PONY TAIL IN HIS BEARD and acted clumsily. The first one sort of glided. The second stomped. His hair was short, wavy, and gray. Overall, i hated him. If i were to say the one think i hated in this movie, it was him. Anyone would have been better.Alfanzo: Hated the director. Cristopher Columbus was way better. IT kept shifting to much and left little explanation. My mother, who has never read the books (but seen all the movies) kept asking me what was going on.Hermione: OK, first of all i LOVE emma watson. I just didn't care for her ooc (out of character) comment about her hair""Does my hair really look like that from the back?""Hermione Granger as J.K wrote her would have never , EVER said anything like that.

868,wilson49,Cauron should have read the book.,1,11 December 2004,"This is by far the best book in the series, and I really think that Cauron was a very bad choice to direct it. He ruined it. He said he wanted to make the movie dark and sinister, just like the book. But I can't help but notice that the later half of the movie is so 'dark' it is hard to even see it. I guess what Cauron failed to understand was that to make the movie dark like the book did not require him to veil the camera lens. He failed to understand that the book was dark because of the story and situations itself. Compare Cauron's movie with the earlier two ones directed by Chris Columbus, and it comes out looking even worse. Chris also took liberties with the plot and the look in the movies but it was a pleasure to watch them.I don't say that Cauron is a bad director, but he was a bad choice for this movie. Some of the scenes, in this movie too were brilliantly contrived. The water on the window freezing, the dementors, the bird flying out of the castle and knocking itself on the Willow, Harry's flight on Buckbeak, and best of all, Dumbledore lighting the candle with a wave of his arm, were the scenes that really call attention to the creativity of the director. But Cauron lost out on the parts that were really important to the story line. Throughout the movie, there is not one instance where Sirius Black is established as dark, villainous, psychopathic, brute; except until the very end; while what was required was Sirirus Black as an ever present fearful shadow. Cauron attempted this, using posters in every scene in the movie. Boggart in the wardrobe sequence was not tenth as enjoyable as in the book. But worst of all was the characterization of Remus Lupin. One of my favourite part in the book is Lupin telling off Harry for going to the village. What makes Lupin's words most effective is that he doesn't raise his voice or let his disappointment show on his face. Lupin, as a good teacher has a way with students and knows that at Harry's age accusations will give back arguments, but will not make Harry realize his mistake. Lupin merely tells Harry that risking his life to go to the village was a bad way of repaying his parents, who gave their lives to save his. Cauron's juvenile attempt at this turned the scene into one in which Thewlis yells at Harry and sends him to his dorm. These are but a few inconsistencies in the movie, which I couldn't help but notice. Cauron's movie got lost in the animatronics and computer imagery, and lost out it's best part- it's story.However Cauron was lucky to get some of the best artists in the industry. Sir Michael Gambon brought new life to Dumbledore. Emma Thompson was marvelous as Trelawny. Though he only got one real scene to perform in, Gary Oldman brought Sirius Black's character to life. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were great as always. Daniel, Rupert and Emma were good too. But best of all was John Williams. His background score really saved Cauron's movie. This was the best score out of all the three movies; the previous two were actually quite similar to each other. I expect John Williams to get an Oscar for this one.My rating: 2/10 (basically for the background score only)This movie can hope for an Oscar nomination for its background score only. I personally would want John Williams to win.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
869,Telepathic1911,Worst of all the movies,4,18 December 2004,"I thought that out of all three of the Harry Potter films, this was the worst, not because of the story or the acting, but because it was simply the worst adaptation of the book.The other films were extremely close the the other books. The first film left out a few details, and second a few more, but this one left out key components to the story.I for one, did not really like the books. That is I did not like the first two. The 3rd book was my favorite, and I really enjoyed it. I was for the first time, looking forward to the film.I believe that the director did a awful job, and for people who did not see the film (the people I saw the film with), it left them wondering...

It would be great if we could all have friends like those 3. The effects in it are great. The scenery is awesome too. The bird type creature cracks me up.

871,moongear,Charming and Extraordinary,9,7 January 2005,"As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.As one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.Overall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.Now, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
872,outfielder24,I have never cringed more in my life than in the hours I spent watching this.,1,11 May 2005,"It's difficult for me to comment on this movie in an unbiased fashion, since I am an avid fan of the books. However, I am not the kind of person who automatically thinks that any change of the story from the book is a bad thing.This is an enjoyable enough film for people who have never read the book, even if they will probably not understand some of the plot. This movie completely ignored some of the key sub-plots that I was really looking forward to seeing. Ron's character is still portrayed as a wimpy, cowardly moron just like in the previous movie. They add many stupid annoying lines and objects that are obviously supposed to be funny but just made me cringe. The storyline has been so re-arranged and edited that it barely feels like a Harry Potter movie. Hogwarts is suddenly in a different location, as is Hagrid's hut, the interior of the castle is different, etc. I'll admit I did like the changes to the grounds but not to the interior of the castle or the location of Hagrid's hut. Many of the characters are portrayed differently than they are in the book (not only Ron).The ending feels rushed and incomplete. If you have never read the book, you will most likely be lost.

874,johnrconnolly,Good Movie....,8,10 March 2005,"Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up, in this film. In fact i thought this was the best out of the three films. For a stat, the narrative of the film, and the plot change near the end. Completely twisting at the end was a good way in the book, and works even better on film.Being from the UK, the use of British actors (Mark Williams - Mr Weasly, Lenny Henry - Shrunken Head, Dawn French - Fat Lady, Tomothy Spall - Peter Pettergrew) made this a fun movie to watch. Not only that, but the whole way it was shot.. Marvaolus.Some of the film however didn't make for good movie sequences. Like harry invisible cloack. In the first films, everything that was held outside the cloack, you could see harry's hand. However in this one, Objects just floated.However the casting for this was awesome, the shots were amazing, and well the film was just right.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
875,kevinharper26033,"As a movie, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban' falls somewhat short of the novel.",6,18 March 2005,"I went to the Theater in the hopes of another great adaptation of J.K. Rowlings fantastic series and came away somewhat disappointed. There was so much that had been left out of the movie. Gryffindor winning the quidditch cup, Ron and Harry having a huge fight with Hermione over the Firebolt and refusing to even speak with her, The significance of Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. The movie left you wondering how Professor Lupin knew that the map was even a map, or how he knew to work it. Harry attacks Snape in the shrieking shack and the school year just continues on for him? Snape does nothing about it? On another note I felt that the acting jobs of the three main characters was done fairly well. Emma Watson seems to be leading the pack in acting abilities and I wish that screenwriters would allow Rupert's character to develop more fully. In the books Ron is a colorful and fun character and is a great contrast to both Harry and Hermione. As for the newly added cast, David Thewlis did a terrible job as Professor Lupin, but I suspect that has more to do with a poor choice of Director, rather than Thewlis' acting abilities. I do actually like the additional scenes of the school, the showing of the grounds, etc. It gives Hogwarts more the feel of a real place. I have since watched the movie a couple of times on DVD at home and have become more comfortable with it, but no matter what I do I can't get past Lupin's rushed lines in his various discussions with Harry. Sorry but it really lowered my opinion of the movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
876,KLS8800,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,3,19 March 2005,"As an adult HP fan, I was disappointed in POA. I believe the director did not read the books or watch the films or if he did, didn't understand them.Snape in SS and COS was scary. In POA, he just looks like a very ugly, silly cross dresser. In the other films, you see him be unnerved by Harry. (Watch SS and COS's scenes with these two.) McGongagall who had come across as strict, but with an understanding of kids now is depicted as cross, uncaring and almost mean.Another thing I did not like is how the kids wore their street clothes at Hogwarts. It made Hogwarts less magical. Before, the distinction between Muggle and Wizard worlds was made with their clothing. It just felt wrong, like seeing your teacher show up to class in their nightclothes.Hermione, once intelligent, is now portrayed as cross, moody, and unable to be understood. Ron is now the dumb sidekick. What a waste of talent.Some of the few good things seen are Harry's self doubts, pain, and humanity. At one point in the film, his emotions are so raw, his actions and words just hit you, as if you are feeling the emotions with him.Harry's pain, his rage, and so many emotions all at once coming to the surface to be voiced as they had not been before. Seeing Harry discover the past that is his, known to all but him, finding who he is now and searching for his place in the world, especially the Wizarding world, you feel for him and want to help him. That is Daniel Radcliffe's brilliance, not anyone else's. His interpretation of this side of Harry was done to perfection.Harry's conferences with Lupin, expressing his fears, and confiding in him. I was also impressed with Lupin not treating him as a silly child, but someone closer to being a man and giving Harry honest answers, even if Lupin had no answers or the answers were not what Harry wanted to hear.The bones in the story are strong, but this director goofed more than he didn't. Had this movie been done by someone who understood the movies, it'd have turned out so much better.I think Steve Kloves, JK Rowling and other PTB (powers that be) need to BEG Chris Columbus to take the director's chair again. He GOT the movies. He understood how to do the difficult task of putting Harry Potter on film, capturing the magic, wowing audiences, and still being very true to the books.I in no way blame the actors. They all did their best to give the stellar performances but with lousy direction, even the best actor cannot shine.These actors have only one chance per movie to get it right. I can only hope that Goblet of Fire and if the sixth film is made, that more care, time, and talent comes from the director of those films. However, if the PTB get it right and get Columbus back in the director's chair and give him free reign, I know the true magic of Harry Potter will return.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
877,tycoonexcel,Harry Potter,10,5 August 2005,"I think that this movie shows A lot of potential and I really enjoyed watching it. I mean the fact that someone can do magic is a little unrealistic but it fun! And it makes want to believe. Actually it MAKES you believe. The graphics were also amazing and the casting, it couldn't have been better! It also followed the basics of the book and also had character building, in which I mean you could tell that the actors really felt their characters. For anyone who hasn't watched the movie I suggest you watch and the first 2 movies as well, you should also read the books, they are amazing!

878,leelooNS,From a sorcerer's student to his master... followed by a try to describe what magic is....,9,11 May 2005,"Well, it's difficult to find any words for the film Alfonso Cuarón made of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. I had so many many expectations to this adaptation from  for me the best of JK Rowlings novels  that book so i feared it would become as boring as his predecessors are.But....Cuarón made it! Absolutely real magic from beginning to end. This film breathes the spirit of it's model, although shortened and changes in many ways, but I don't care...Cuarón eliminates all of the sticky American sugar icing from Harry's film-life. Shown already in the very first scene with the Dursleys. Nothing is multi-coloured anymore, instead we see a typical depressing English suburb-family, not better or worse than any other suburb-family.Even to Hogwarts some locations-updates are made. Somehow it looks like in the predecessors but it's surely different, within the hilly Scottish landscape, with staggering new settings (this bridge from the castle to Hagrid Hut  really great). The Kids are changed to modern typical teens, like you will find in every school in Great Britain. A lax funny atmosphere at the beginning, the boys hangin' around together, happy to be back at school, that all seems like a really normal school day.Radcliffe will never be one of the greatest actors of the lifetime, but here he made some good tries to mediate Harry's feelings....even Emma Watson & Rupert Grint did a good job, hopefully they will do the remaining films together....Completed by old and new adults: Snape (Rickman) nasty good as ever with a lot more scenes as in HP 2, Coltrane lives Hagrid but Maggie Smith leaves it only to a few Cameos... Michal Gambon as Dumbledore fills in the vacancy leaving by Richard Harris terrific, the Schoolmaster is no longer only a wise great wizard, he's also lax and funny . David Thewlis as Remus Lupin is great. Though i was a little bit disappointed with the casting-news, because my Lupin looks very very different in my mind, i must say: Great - Thewlis evolves his figure fantastically, those scenes between him and Harry are the strongest of the whole film.Well and Oldman......NOBODY could have been better to play Sirius Black. This unbelievable ambivalently figure comes to life with Oldman.....i can't find words for this. Only one thing disturbed me....his appearance is too short. Really too short. But he has definitely the greatest scene in the film with Harry......let me nearly burst out in tears....*sniff*...(well because i know how the story will go one....)There are so many beautiful scenes in the film: The lesson with the Boggart, the Quidditch-Match through the rain and the attack of the dementors, Harry's Patronus, the time-travel, the flight with Buckbeak.....and so on....Well, all of this is Harry Potter like i have it in mind from the very beginning. Cuarón knows like no other before him how to bring Harry up to film-life. A magician of pictures, lights, & scenes  a sorcerer bringing Harry Potter up to LIFE!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
879,greekdude_2,It stunk!!!,1,27 May 2005,"I HATED this Harry Potter. It was murder on the books and they changed everything. They changed the location of Hagrid's hut. They let the kids run around in street clothes. They changed the music. This one just sucked in general. I mean some of the graphics were okay, but it didn't just meet up to the first two. Maybe it was because of the new director of the movie. The creatures were real cool. They changed some of the characters and there wasn't much of the old excitement as there was in the older movies. Another example of changing location was the hotel where Harry stayed at in the first 2 was run by a different tom and it was as befuddled. Another thing was that it was next to a train track. In the first movie. It wasn't anywhere near a train track. So ill say it again, this one stinks!!! I'm a big fan of Harry Potter. I own every movie except this one, because its so bad, thats how bad it is.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
880,illyria-4,Expect(o) to be let down by future installments,10,18 December 2005,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the only installment of the Harry Potter series to stray from the formula ""Voldemort is trying to kill Harry"". That's one of the reasons I liked this movie so much. It lacks the sense of impending peril present in ""Sorceror's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" and the lack of oppressive atmosphere allows for the most complete (as of movie 4) character exploration of the entire series.I think Alfonso Cuarón is the perfect director for this type of material: this movie is so well-handled it makes Chris Columbus' and Mike Newell's efforts look like amateur productions. It is really a shame that he didn't sign on for the fourth movie.This movie also contains some of the finest performances from child actors I have ever seen. I must have watched this movie thirty times by now, and not only because it's picturesque, with wonderfully shot scenes and seamlessly integrated effects; not only because of the enchanting music chosen, which adds tremendously to the sense of immersion in the movie. No, I watch this movie over and over because of the master performances put in by Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe. They're very likable people, and they're charming in every scene, whether they're trying to dodge unfair punishment from Snape or saving themselves from Dementors. They're so charming, you actually feel like you're there with them.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
881,gtalbot,Best film of the series,10,13 June 2016,"Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite book of the series and is also my favourite film of the series.There is a good mixture of comedy and drama in this film. The scene with an inflated Aunt Marge floating across Privet Drive is hilarious. the scene where Harry realizes Sirius Black is his godfather is very moving. It gives Harry something close to a loving relative, which he never had with the Dursleys.When Sirius Black has to go back in to hiding it adds to the feeling of sadness. Harry Came so close to having a loving home but it was taken away.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint improved greatly as actors in this film. They seem much more confident in their roles than they did in Chamber of Secrets.Of all the films in the HP series this is the one I could watch the most.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I had many problems with this installment. Me being a Potter fan myself i had an idea about what this film would look like. I am sad to say that many portions of the film were not only done wrong but out of time sequence, there was also a lot of things missing from this film that could have been done if other minor parts were left out.Though i did enjoy the special effects and the characters, i felt that there wasn't enough time in each scene to digest what was really happening in the story. I think you would really only understand what was going on if you had actually read any of the books. I think many people would agree that even the look of this film was different then the previous films. Its understandable that because directors were changed things would be different, but certain things i believed went to far.I gave this film the ranking that i did because like i said before i am a potter fan and i still stand behind the books and the films no matter how bad or good they are.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
883,pascal-ledahal,"The Best ""Harry Potter"" among the first ones",6,11 August 2005,"Harry Potter was not specifically designed for the cinema, that is why adapting a Harry Potter book for the big screen was, in itself, a challenge. The first two of the movies were quite faithful to the book, but took the time to show some details of the world of HP, for example life at school or others things that were not indispensable to understand the story completely. With the change of the director (Cuaron replaces Colombus) comes a change in the way the story is set up for the screen. Cuaron didn't think it was necessary to keep the previous details, in order to focus exclusively on the story. It might be a bit embarrassing for the people who are not familiar with the atmosphere of Harry Potter, but for the other it is really efficient: The story turns to be more intensive and breath-taking. Nothing to say about the actors, they are mainly the same than in the previous movies. A last word concerning the music: when will Williams retire??? He could have composed a much more interesting music, given what he'd written in the past!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
884,Diamondgirl291,A really good movie,7,23 July 2005,"At first, I didn't care for it. Too many things taken out and the plot was almost ruined.But then after the third time seeing it, I realized it wasn't too bad at all. Alfonso really did a fantastic job. And after watching interviews, I found out that JK Rowling was happy with what turned out. If my favorite author is happy, I'm happy. She even liked the things Alfonso and the screenwriter added in that she didn't write in the books. I myself loved the whole shrunken head concept.I absolutely love all the special effects. Buckbeak, the Hippogriff, looked so realistic. Those Dementors gave me goosebumps. I cried when Sirius Black (played by the awesome Gary Oldman) almost got his soul sucked out at the lake. The moving paintings and photos are also a real treat in the movie.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Tom Felton are some of the best teen actors I've ever seen. Daniel deals with all that pressure really well, being the star. Rupert Grint, hot like Daniel except in my opinion, hotter, gives comic relief throughout the movie that made me and my friends laughed at over and over again. Emma has really matured a lot and does a great job but I think they are showing more Emma and less Hermione which, plainly, isn't good. Tom Felton, another British heart throb, plays Draco Malfoy, a snobby, rich, mean Slytherin student who thinks too highly of himself. Tom plays the role very well, but we all know he has a heart of gold outside of acting, right?We also meet some new actors in the third movie. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. He will never be as great as Richard, but I suppose he did an acceptable job. Garry Oldman, who plays the framed Sirius Black, does a good job. Timothy Spall, the sniveling Peter Pettigrew, who turns out to be Ron's rat and also he framed Sirius, does a good job but I think they made him look too ugly. I didn't expect him be handsome, but I didn't expect him to look disgusting either.I really loved this movie, being a huge Harry Potter fan and all. But I think even people who don't like the books would love this movie too, because it's deeper than wands and brooms.

It doesn't help that Alfonso Cuaron never read the book! The one and only part that I liked was the Patronus charm, which earned 4 stars. The other one was for Alfonso Cuaron's Effort and the fabulous soundtrack by John Williams. I hope that the Goblet of Fire will be better. The Maruder's Map was cool. I do recommend the video game. I think this movie is worth seeing, even though I was disappointed. The bonus disc on the DVD has lots of cool activities. I hope Mike Newell will use Chris Columbus' style.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
886,rahafs92,Harry Potter 3 was the best movie from series,10,12 August 2005,"This was the best movie from the Harry Potter series. In fact it was also the best book. In the beginning, the part where they show you that Harry is reading in the Dursleys' home was kind of a lame part. What was the point of it? When Aunt Marge showed up it was an upsetting, yet funny part. It was upsetting because it would make you feel sorry for Harry because his parents are dead and no someone just makes fun of them because they are mean. Funny because Aunt Marge gets blown up.When he runs away and sees the dog it was a little freaky, especially if you haven't read the book. The movie had many funny scene and scary. The heads we're pretty funny. ""Why the long faces,"" one of them said when the night bus went in between two buses. I would say the dementors were the scariest thing in the movie. The appeared in places you didn't want them. Even though this movie was a great movie, if I could change things in them, I probably would have changed a lot. The director Alfanso Curon was excellent, but he changed a lot in the movie. He didn't make the actors make wear the clothe that they are supposed to. Instead he made them wear normal clothe. The part where Harry receives the firebolt after he falls down and his Nimbus 2000 goes into the womping willow wasn't even added. In the book Hermione wasn't talking to Harry and Ron for a long time because of this, but they didn't put it in. The actors did a great job too. They have improved a lot since the first and second movie. (what did I expect) There were scenes though when you would think, oh they would have done better. Over all this movie was amazing.

This movie is so terrible it made me cry,1,27 August 2005,"I am a devout fan of the Harry Potter series, however, when I saw the Prisoner of Azkaban, needless to say, I was utterly disappointed.I was offended with the way the director decided to portray the Dementor's Kiss. Dementors do NOT suck out the happy thoughts, and so causing the soul to come out of the mouth. This movie was a disgrace to the Harry Potter movies and I hope the director burns in Hell.Secondly, what the hell happened to the Quidditch Final?! Gryffindor winning that match is a major plot point and cannot be cut then filled with some stupid choir singing a rip-off of Shakespeare.Although not a main character, it was indeed a shame to lose Sir Cadogan. I appreciate that certain characters and scenes need to be cut from the final edit, but to totally disregard the main plot and replace it was some cheap imitation is unforgivable.Also, I was disgusted the way the director 'Americanised' this movie by making the students run around in non-uniform. Perhaps it would be a better idea to get someone who knows the British culture and ask him/her to direct instead.This movie is a total disgrace and should be remade by someone a lot better than Alfonso Cuarón.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

They weren't that close in the first two b. Who the heck are you kidding?? The similarities with the book I could count on one hand.Okay let's see what I would change...1. Who the heck needs that much angst in a movie based on the third book?? Try the fifth book and you'll still be way over it. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT MUCH ANGST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! 2. Why the heck did we need that lame shrunken head. That was just stupid. Is there anyone who can say that they really liked the shrunken head?? It's like JarJar Binks from Episode 1: supposed to be funny, but just annoying.3. We need to know about Harry's past. That's one of the main plots throughout the books, and that much is kinda important in the fifth book to learn this stuff 4. When Disney's Jungle Book was made, the writer was expressly told not to read the book, just make the movie based off of ""a boy raised by wolves who must return to a village."" Did they do this with this movie too?? 5. The reason Crabbe isn't there is that he had to take exams. Couldn't they tape it another day?? How hard is that??

Harry's ride on Buckbeak was amazing except for the Titanic-esquire part. (Cheesiest part since the freeze-frame ending to Philosopher's stone!) I really liked how they animated the map. Only thing I find missing is an explanation of the Marauders and why they had the nicknames they had. Everyone I know who hasn't read the book was confused by that and the stag at the end makes no sense unless you know who ""Prongs"" is! They should have Alfonzo Cuoron back to do more!

But even the are not too bad. But the way, the movie depicts the meandering and moving set af the Shrieking Shack, the horrifying dementors and some other creatures is just incredible! ** spoilers end Where the first two movies apologized their lengths with ""sticking to the books"", the script here is fast-paced, clever and atmospheric.

893,Summer4,"Good movie, but too much is skipped",10,13 November 2005,"The third Harry Potter movie is a good movie. Compared to the first and second one it is different and I think that the first two movies were better. But with a new director is it normal that everything is different, and that doesn't mind a lot. There also a lot of things better, like the clothes. The Trio wears actually nice clothes and that is way better.A lot is skipped though, like Cho Chang. She appears in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but in the book, she is there in POA. Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup for the first time, since Harry joined the team. I think that's very important. And at the so-called finale, in the Shrieking Shrack, Sirius and Remus are supposed to tell Harry a lot of important stuff about his parents and their past, but they don't. At the end Harry was supposed to get a note from Sirius that he was allowed to go to Hogsmeade in the future and then Ron gets his owl because it was Sirius' fault that he has rat was gone. The movie is 141 minutes, that 20 minutes shorter than Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, while the third book has more pages! The things that happen were not the same with the book either. With Christmas Harry gets a broom from Sirius, in the movie he gets it at the end. Ron and Hermione are not allowed to go into the Three Broomsticks, but in the book they're hearing too that Sirius is Harry's godfather. And so there more things that are wrong or missing.The new cast is casted well, like David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew. The animations are very good, like buck beak, Hagrid's monster book for his classes, the dementors etc. I really loved the scene when Harry flies on Buckbeak. They filmed that so well.Of course, the third book is hard to film, because there happen a lot of things and the scenes that Harry and Hermione are going back in time are very good too, but little thins are missing, that did happen in the first movies.

894,shyamali108,The Film maker's aspect of the wondorous world of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban,10,18 January 2006,"The mise-én-scene of Harry Potter Happiness can be found, in the darkest of times, if one simply remembers to turn on the light. Welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter! Our feature presentation is Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is a thirteen year old boy, shaping his future while learning more and more about his dark and heroic past. ""A true kid's classic is just as magical for adults. "" Says Peter Rainer of the New York Magazine. But just how was it created so that adults sit spell bounded in their seats. Enchanted.... Charmed.... Bewitched.... If it weren't for the excellent use of mise-én-scene, it probably wouldn't be the same. No, my fellow Harry Potter fan, mise-én-scene is not a spell, nor is it the name of a character or actor. It is the thaumaturgy of the director and the Director of Photography; it is the sum and substance of the directors' wits that draws you attention to the screen. Mise-én-scene was originally a French theatrical term that meant ""placing on stage"". It is the use of many different elements in movies, kind of like painting a picture on the closed space of the canvas and placing objects appropriately where they belong. Some elements of mise-én-scene amongst the hundred of others used on the set of Harry Potter are composition and design, territorial space, and the superb use of proxemic use of proxemic patterns.Composition and design refer to the systematic placement of people, places, lights, camera, and objects. The human eye attempts to harmonize the elements of a composition into a unified whole. The director takes advantage of this fact by strategically lighting different parts of an image, guiding our eyes to the dominant, which attracts our eyes with its compelling contrast. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), embark upon a journey neither one wished to take, leading to their finding out more and more about Harry's ""criminal, murderous"" Godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). In one of the final scenes, the audience's eyes are carefully guided from Harry's face of shock, to Hermione's face of absolute fear, to Ron's face of mingled pain and surprise and finally to the cause of their reactions --- Sirius Black, who wears a maniacal glow and a wicked smile on his unsightly face. He really does look like a murderer! How close should the camera get to the subject? Or how close should we get to the subject, since our eyes identify with the camera lens. Space is one of the principle methods of communication in all films. The way people are arranged in space tell a lot about their emotional, social, and physical relationships. Harry has yet to find out who his Godfather really is; he thinks or rather the whole world knows his Godfather to be a murderer. The first time Harry meets, or more exactly encounters his Godfather, they keep quite a distance. Harry stands at on end of the room while Sirius stands at the other end of the room. The spacing suggests a distant or scared relationship between the two main characters. Harry is positioned, standing in a quarter turn, with a high degree of intimacy but less emotional involvement. Sirius is shown with his back towards the camera, conveying a sense of mystery and concealment.Harry stands ten feet away from Sirius at their first meeting; both look hateful and full of vengeance. Neither knows why the other hates him, but the rest of the movie makes us understand Harry's anger. Sirius remains a complete mystery until the end, where he and Harry find out and clarify the truth about their odiums. As the movie ends, Sirius and Harry stand beside each other, exchanging words of comfort and relief. Harry has just rescued ""an innocent man from a terrible fate"", and their two-minute talk ends the tension between them. Harry now regards Sirius as a mix between a father and a brother and comes to love him like no one else. The proxemic patterns or relations of organisms within a given space, give us a commentary on what each character feels, without them having to tell us anything. Harry and Sirius start from being bitter enemies in a public space, to uncovering their true relationship as Godfather and Godson in a personal space.Mise-én-scene . Harry Potter. Director Alfonso Cuarón enchants us, bewitches us, charms us by the use of mise-én-scene . We see Harry's point of view and then Sirius's. When they become Godfather and Godson again, we feel happy and elated for both of them. We witness and feel the human trials and triumphs that they go through. We watch Harry turn into a true hero despite the ""Double, double, toil and trouble."" Get ready for a bumpy ride!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
895,sharonlowen,"Brilliant film, but fairly badly adapted",9,22 December 2006,"I absolutely LOVE this film, but as a Harry Potter book fan I was slightly disappointed in how it had been adapted from the book.I saw the film before reading the book, and thought that this film was great, although there were parts that confused me, like there was no explanation why Harry's patronus was a stag, and not much explanation about the Marauders and the marauders map. Whilst this film was great cinematically, it was not very well adapted from the book. I thought this was disappointing as the film was the shortest out of all the movies released up until at least the 4th film. I think reorganising the events in the book was not very good.The film also had a bit too much 'cheese' for my liking. I did not like the end bit of Harry on the Firebolt and parts of the Whomping Willow scene.All in all, the film was really great entertainment, I was disappointed with the way it was adapted, but Alfonso Cuarón was an excellent director and this film deserves a high rating.***** Stars",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
896,kylesduck,The film is nothing to the book,3,23 January 2006,"The film is made up by special effects and nothing else, it has hardly any story to it and poor acting, Alfonso even calls hogwarts hoerts in the interviews and has clearly never read the book as he wanted to put Buckbeak in a graveyard when clearly in the book is not correct, J K rowling must know that the film should be made with a limit to the special effects and not to waste time flying around castles and sucking Harrys face off with weird dementors that freeze things when they're just suppose to make it feel cold and drain the happiness out of you, Hogwarts castle also seems to have gained a clock tower which it shouldn't, overall i think this film is an insult to the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
897,ybeenormal2004,Something Wicked This Way Comes,8,27 March 2006,"Harry Potter (Danielle Radcliffe), Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) have returned to their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And yet again, Harry's life seems to be in great danger from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a prisoner who has most recently escaped from Azkaban in order to kill Harry for He-who-must-not-be-named. It also seems that the school has become under the protection of hundreds of Dementors from Azkaban. Soon Harry realizes that things may not go as they planned for him or his friends either.Director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job in portraying this movie from J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" Also along with the actors who has portrayed these characters to the best of their abilities. Although, it may not portray the book in the exact order of events, but it does indeed give the story fluidity and meaning like Harry Potter has never seen before.The movie does not go along with the book that it is based on, and skips on a lot of major details which is explained in the book. Yet the film does give the book meaning as it deserves. The director could have done a better job on the special effects shown in the movie, especially with the werewolf. The graphics on the werewolf aren't as up to as it should be. Other than that, it was an excellent movie nonetheless.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
898,cngraves,What a letdown!,5,5 July 2004,"After the first two movies, I expected something similar although the tale was maturing with its characters. What I received was an incredible letdown. I realize that a different director meant a different movie, but I at least wanted a clear and understandable movie. The take jumped from scene to scene, often without connecting information. If I hadn't already read the book, I would never have known why characters were acting the way they were. Also, did anyone notice the altitude change of Hagrid's house? It wasn't that low on the mountain before, was it? I gave this movie a 5, and I'm fervently hoping for a better try next time.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
899,hayllorni,"Good, but too much changed/left out",6,12 June 2004,"Overall, I didn't mind the movie. I mean, once again, the visual effects, acting etc. were very good. But the most disappointing part was the fact that they changed the set. For example, the books say the Whomping Willow is a tree by itself in the middle of the grounds, and it was in the 1st and 2nd movies, whereas here it was in the middle of the forbidden forest (and even that wasn't scary, eg. where they met Buckbeak). And since when did dementors fly?? Also, i can't believe that the director left out Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, that is such an amazingly happy and brilliant part of the movie. The acting was once again excellent, however there certainly wasn't nearly enough teaching/classes. And what's with the Patronus being a sheet of white light? I mean, I know we saw Prongs near the end, before Harry goes back in time, but when Harry was actually producing the Patronus, there was no Stag. And speaking of things being left out, or put in in this case... where on earth did the Director get the idea for a choir, and seriously, wasn't Harry's flight on Buckbeak just a bit long. If he'd cut the choir and made the flight a bit shorter, perhaps there would have been more time for the more interesting parts of the movie.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with The Prisoner of Azkaban. I was expecting the same set as the first, didn't happen (much to most ppl's disgust) and there was way too much information left out. I know they have a time limit, but still... I sincerely hope that for The Goblet of Fire, either 2 movies are made, or they find some way to squeeze all the info into one 2.5hr movie (i'd go the 2 movies myself)!!!Anyways, that's just my view... I did like the movie, but there was too much non-continuance from the first 2, and not enough fun.At a last thought, in the previews, i completely loved the hand of the dementor on the train... but i really didn't think that they were scary, if even a little too close the the Ringwraiths..

900,matthew_finney,"A fun film if you have not read the book, a let down if you have",6,31 May 2004,"Taking this film on its own, not as the third film in the series or as an adaptation of a book this would be excellent. It has a good story, though as mentioned later it is full of holes, great acting and some good set pieces. But as an adaptation and a third film it is very disappointing.Let me explain why. Firstly I know it is a magical place Hogwarts, but who decided they could completely rebuild the place and move everything around. In the first two films Hagrids hut was just out side the main gate, now it seems to be over a bridge through a church yard and down a very steep hill. Also the Whomping Willow now seems to be in the middle of nowhere rather than in the main courtyard where it was in the last film. Now I know they made Hogwarts bigger in the last film but they did not start moving buildings around.Secondly as many people have noted very important sections of the book are missed out and the story is left with a lot of holes if you have never read the books. I saw the first film and then read the books using the film as a way into the series, this one would make you think the books were not worth reading as the plot is so full of holes.Thirdly why do we have to have so many shots of things floating and flying. Every cut scene has at least one flying object in it, be a feather, a leaf, a bat or a dementor. This started to make me laugh as I tried to guess what would come up next.Fourthly, Dumbledore. I know this is the first time we have been without Richard Harris, but that is who I now imagine as Dumbledore whenever I read the books, it will take some time to get used to the new meaner sounding Dumbledore, but hopefully this will happen.Finally, it is just over much to quickly. You never get time to settle down with the characters. It is always rush rush to the next bit on and on. Hogwarts is a place that no one really minds how long they stay and take in because everyone wants to be there. I know we don't want a 4 hour movie, but a little more time spent in the company of friends would be appreciated.I am not saying it is a terrible film it is just flawed in a number of ways that make the experience less enjoyable than previous outings. Lets hope the next one brings us back to the Harry Potter we love to see on the big screen.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
901,mibmit,The fun keeps rolling on,8,31 May 2004,"Repeat: The film is not the same as the book.But then there is a lot to cover in 2 and a bit hours, however this is actually shorter than the previous outings.Massive cheer for Hermione giving Malfoy a good whacking!Dementors are pretty cool, about as nasty as they could be in a film for under 15sHagrid's den and the whomping willow seem to be different from the previous films, but Grint, Radcliffe and Watson are great developing in the roles.Roll on next film, like the books are addictive and you just want more.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
902,charlieg-4,Missed two important parts,7,8 June 2004,"This was the first of the Harry Potter books that I read after seeing the first two movies. My son read the book, so I picked it up to make sure he read it, and was really good. The two parts that were missing I though were important and easy to do so I don't understand why they were left out! The first, is no explanation of how they know Sirius Black set up the Potters. The second was the Marauders Map, how did Prof. Lupin know how to use it. That shows just how close the four friends really were and why everyone thought that Black was so evil their nicknames on the map were not even mentioned. Hopefully, that will be on the DVD. Otherwise it was very good.The effects are very good, the creature looked very believable. If I didn't read the book I may have enjoyed it more.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
903,Chunky-10,"Great in places but a jerky, 2D adaption.",6,3 June 2004,"I have really been looking forward to this film for a long time since I thought the first two films were excellent and this was a MUCH better book/story. The previous films had worked very well even though they left quite large parts of the books out, there was a continuity and a flow that was true to the spirit of the books. Unfortunately this can not be said of this film, and for this I am grateful that the Director is not making the next film in the series.So what is good about the movie ? Well the special effects are great and there are some really good moments when the main characters really do get you involved. However the cuts have been so savage that the character development of the supporting roles has been trashed and the extra scenes added actually made the film worse.Do you know the film Scrooged with Bill Murray and how he butchered Dickens ? Well when I left the theatre, that was how I felt that this movie had turned out. A lot of the characters had their development removed and were nothing more than cardboard cut outs, Hermione is now turning into a typical Hollywood lady (holding hands through chase scenes etc.) and what happened to Mrs Weasleys development into a Mother figure with an edge. No linkages into the next book such as Quidditch World Cup, Sirius Black's letter, threatening the Dursley's to take Potter back (would you after he'd blown your sister up ?) just took the shine off the whole book.I really hope they get back to basics and follow the book more faithfully for the next film. If they do that then we are in for a real treat, if not then they will lose many millions of pounds/dollars/euros in lost sales and will probably damage the reputation of the remaining films.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
904,jhm.traveller,"All aboard, a blockbuster directed by a true director",10,2 June 2004,"You expect to be disappointed by a much awaited and hyped new release, but 10 minutes in and I knew this was a great film. Radcliffe really can act, depending on the situation he appears like a young boy, someone bearing a heavy burden, an angry teenager...It's fairly creepy, I would be wary of taking young children, particularly if they haven't read the book. The film is liberated from the confines of the school, very little happening in the classroom. Cuaron certainly wields his own magic on the film even doing well incorporating the effects (something he is not known for) smoothly. The Knight Bus sequence is fun and thrilling, and there is a lot to laugh at without breaking the mystery. This is my favourite Potter book, but the film did not let me down. The plot concentrates on the more important characters, most of the other pupils are just background. I would quite happily have sat in the cinema all day. Mike Newell, you have a hard act to follow.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
905,johncolumba,One of the worst...,3,16 August 2021,"This film is painful to watch. The tone is way off base. There's something contrived in its whacky feel, shifting away from the grounded feel of the first two films, something Columbus got right, capturing the 'spirit' of the books, a feel which was natural to the characters.The film ought to be judged as a Harry Potter film, and as a film in itself, it is out of place, and this is to say nothing of how poorly the plot and content of the book is treated. It's as though Cuaron is imposing his personality and ideas on the film, instead of really trying to serve the franchise and maintain a sense of continuity with the previous two films and book.I dislike the artificial wackiness he injects into his direction, and in the screen play. It's a shame, because the young actors are getting better, but their characters, along with all the others (just look at the Minister of Magic in the beginning scene!) are forced to dance to a try-hard funny tune, piped by Cuaron, and it results in a painful display.This was the beginning of the general decline of the films - films I enjoy watching on one level, merely because it's Harry Potter on screen, but a little extra length, humility and faithfulness in dealing with the source material, would have resulted in a far better film series.I dislike the feel of this film more than the Goblet of Fire, but somehow Newell managed to be even less apt in translating the book to screen than Cuaron, and that is quite a feat!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Anyways...Harry, Ron, and Hermoine should not have any problems ever. Here's why: 1.They all have magic powers. They can just cast a spell on whoever they hate. 2.They have an invisibility cloak. If I had one of those, I wouldn't waste my time with whatever they waste their time with. I'd steal, spy, and sneak however I need to in order to get rid of my problems. 3.They have a 'time machine'. How the hell do you complain about anything when you can just go back in time and fix it? 4.They have magic brooms, and... 5.They have access to a flying horse/bird creature. Either one of those two can be used for easy transportation to anywhere they want to go. 6.They have a map that shows they all the things going on on the ENTIRE campus! These all give these 3 an incredibly unfair advantage against any enemies or problems they have. I would also like to mention that an enormous portion of the movie was spent on displaying that criminal as such a bad guy and a ridiculously small portion of the movie in the climax. Then, when they finally got around to the climax, the movie just ended. Because of all this, I give this movie two big fat thumbs down.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It's very spooky and has dark characters(even good ones). The Guardians of Azkaban(wraiths) are probably the most interesting characters in the film.

910,volklaero,overall displeased..but it grew on me,7,7 June 2006,"i was one of those readers who fell into the magic of hogwarts and loved the childish scenes portrayed in the first two movies. The quiddich scenes, the jovial music and overall juvenile feeling made those first two movies special. Now, with the third movie and a different director, you can expect a very different story. Apparently harry isn't a kid anymore because we aren't allowed to enjoy the movies like we enjoyed the books. not only is there a totally different feel, but the actions in the movie are jittery and some scenes are almost scary. The third movie completely changed the way hogwarts looks and how the grounds look. The new castle has this feeling of darkness, not the overwhelming happiness that harry originally felt by coming to hogwarts. I have seen the movie a few times since the first viewing, and i will admit it has grown on me. The new style is definitely an art, and should be respected. It is just sad to me that the magic of hogwarts will never appear the same..",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

However, this one left out too many important details from the book. I sat in the theater, bored and rolling my eyes. They focused too much on things that weren't important to the book and didn't stick to the story enough. Some key elements of the story aren't included in the movie, which was aggravating. I am aware that some things needed to be cut for time purposes, but there were things in the movie that weren't in the book. They could easily have left those things out and gotten the story right.

The most annoying thing was that they changed the location of the filming; Hogwarts, Hagrid's house, and the Whomping Willow were all located in different places from the previous movies and thus looked very different. The credits say it was filmed partly in Scotland, which probably accounts for the change. While the essence of the plot was intact, the pacing was slow. The best part of the movie was the Marauder's Map, which was shown throughout the final credits. While the acting was good and it was well cast, none of the new characters matched Kenneth Branagh's performance in the last film.

The amount of shrunken heads, however, confused me, especially the ones that stopped Hermione and Ron from entering the Three Broomsticks.

923,KevinRiggs,Cuaron skipped the backstory and apparently assumed everyone has read the book,3,4 June 2004,"For anyone who hasn't yet read the book, you'll do yourself no true service by seeing the movie. Harry's interaction with Dumbledore (the school's headmaster) is overwhelming absent. The parts of the story that are filled in by 3rd party dialog or interaction between Harry and other characters is woefully excised and any character development of Hermione dealing with time, her pet cat or her budding relationship with Ron is completely left out. Cuaron's version seems to be directed at hardcore Potter fans who might not mind the How's of the storyline and simply want the MAJOR plot points to fit between the books and the movie adaptation. Columbus' first two versions were true not only to the basic premise that there exists a miniature magician named Harry Potter and that he's cemented into some life and death struggle with the arch villain, Voldemort; those first two films were true to the nuances of the story. They followed the character development and told the backstory so that if you hadn't read the book (as several adults around me hadn't) you could still see the movie and not miss a beat in discussing Harry's life with your eight-year-old nephew or niece. With this installment you would be left to believe that Dementors are ghostly spirits who migrate with pack mentality and that Harry himself could lift off the whole lot of them from Azkaban just by mastering the Patronus curse (the book leans more towards a few Dementors circling him and some other people rather than 30 Dementors). I'm interested to see based on Cuaron's development (or lack thereof) of the Dementors how a future director will handle Dumbledore's assertion regarding who the Dementors will side with in the coming battle when Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to try and hide that Voldemort has returned to human form in book 5 (Order of the Phoenix). Perhaps they are just Biblical demons and Voldemort is the devil incarnate. I like this story because it provides a whole new universe; a new context for fantasy and myths. Cuaron totally dropped the ball on explaining the Dementors and making them less demonic and more of a new type of creature like the books seem to imply they are.The movie further leaves out any back story regarding the difficulty of becoming an AniMagus (as Harry's father, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew did) so that never is Peter or Sirius Black's mystical ability to change into animal form even commented on other than when Ron says something to the effect of ""It's a trap! He's the dog. He's an AniMagus, Harry!"" No mention of why Sirius, James and even Peter decided to work so diligently at this magic trick that requires registry with the Ministry of Magic. Cuaron totally missed the opportunity to present a wonderful and engaging story by throwing in his unseasoned transitions such as Hedwig's flight from Autumn out over the lake and into Winter. Neat transition and I liked seeing Harry behind the clock hands but in my opinion Rowling tells a great story and Cuaron should stop screwing with it just to show that he is a ""visionary."" I saw ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and I liked it. Not something I'd take my nephew to see but it was a decent story with a nice message that it didn't have to smack the viewer in the head with. You got the point at the end. Harry Potter's storyline ain't Cuaron's venue. He's edgy and it works when there is no preconceived ideas or framework into which it needs to fit. Here, in this movie, it blew big chunks of flubberwurms.I liked the acting but the movie got in the way IMO.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

But then again, you can't condense a movie to the point where it looses its entire essence just to keep it within 2 hrs 20 mins.A 3 hour movie would've done justice to the storyline as well as each character.In my opinion the movie lacked substance. Terribly disappointed.P. S. Trivia says the Director never watched the earlier two movies or read any of the Harry Potter novels, which explains a great deal.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

929,localsandtourist,Excellent Movie!,9,22 March 2007,"This was a really good movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I have watched it about 5 times now. The story lines are engaging.I would say that the acting is phenonmenon. I am glad that Harry Potter is growing up so now that he can fight evil like a man. The 2 other characters are very entertaining. Omini and the red head boy. I am so glad they picked these three kids to be in the movie. I heard that there was a major attack on the Asian girl playing Harry potter's new girlfriend. I don't understand what the jealousy is about, if you really take a good perspective, harry potter, the real boyis still single, he is now the richest young man in the UK and yes, you have a chance to marry him, but you might have to fly out there to meet him first!http://localsandtourist.blogspot.com/",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
930,tigs9348,Huge improvement,9,1 June 2004,"I'm not a fan of Harry Potter. I read the first book and it was fairly enjoyable but by the time I got halfway through the second I had experienced too many feelings of deja vu to want to continue. I saw the first two movies with the kids and was distinctly underwhelmed by the experience. Again, the first much hyped film struggled to be average and the second film felt like a rehash of the first. Before going to see this one my hopes were raised by the reviews, but I was still skeptical. I'm glad to say the reviews were correct, this has to be three or four times better than the first two Potter outings. Yes, I was confused in places, such as when Sirius Black turned from lethal enemy to friend, but on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Better acting, better script, better plot, better cinematography, great special effects and so on. One or two minutes of Quiddich was more than enough for me! What's more, the film actually ended when it felt like it should end, no endless scenes in the Great Hall. Hurrah!! I'm giving this a 9, the others I gave 5 and 3 so I don't give my high scores lightly...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
931,danserwish,Tremendous,10,9 June 2007,"Absolutely outstanding special effects. Daniel Radcliffe bounce back into acting his third Harry Potter movie; Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban. Things get challenging for Harry in this movie, he finds out that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come for him. As Harry is in Hogwarts School with his fellow friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermonie (Emma Watson)he faces new classes such as approaching Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and learning about shape shifting Boggarts and how to transform them in to something hilarious. Then Harry's worries of Sirus Black are getting deeper, when he founds out that he is lurking around the Hogwarts grounds to find Harry.Also soul-sucking deadly dementours are also lurking outside the castle walls...Harry has a lot of mysteries to face in his third year of Hogwarts...Especially Peter Petingrove...Daniel Racliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the cast all deserve an Oscar for all their hard work and achievements. Also, I understand the crew spended millions of money to make this magical movie for us, so they should all deserve an Oscar for that as well. I would recommend this movie to people ages 7+ despite the lack of fantasy. So grab your popcorn and snuggle up in the sofa and watch it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
932,rosebudchick,Don't waste your time,1,22 June 2004,"Fans of the book (and I am an obsessed fan, I admit it) will be horrifically disappointed. The movie was not worth the money it took to make it. Actually, it wasn't even worth the overpriced movie ticket. A blistering failure from beginning to end. (Spoilers lie ahead) OK, a confession first: no one could ever possibly play Professor Lupin to my satisfaction. It's just simply not possible; I'm too emotionally invested in the character to accept any actor's interpretation, especially one who had never read the books. I knew before going into the theatre that I would hate the way they butchered my favorite character. But David Thewlis actually fell below my expectations. Not one thing about him was right, from that awful cheesy mustache to the watery blue eyes, to the cane he sauntered away withyes, I said a cane. Lupin would NEVER carry a cane. But just when I thought that they had ruined Lupin's physical appearance beyond all possibility, the actor had to open his mouth. Again, everything was wrong: the voice was wrong, the charm was gone, the sweet and patient honesty was nowhere to be found. They made this proud and unflinching noble character into a simpering pile of self-pity and fear. He couldn't even say Voldemort's name, nor make mention of his 'condition' by name. And please tell me why he spends his free time chatting with students in the Forbidden Forest? Meanwhile, I had hoped his appearance would improve after the transformation, but again I was sorely misguided. Considering the exorbitant amount of money they spent on those awful lake scenes and redressing (or should I say destroying) the set, they might have bothered to get an animal trainer. Instead, they created a CGI nightmare with no aesthetic relation to a wolf. But if I spend all my time discussing the way they ruined Lupin, I'll never get on to the rest of the horror. Everyone's favorite falsely accused murderer? Horrifying. Sirius would never have a menorah tattooed to his chest. And he certainly wouldn't spend his time lecturing Harry on the meaning of life when he had the chance to finally be free. After all, Harry would just tell him to stop kidding himself; Sirius has never exactly been the ideal role model. Oh, and why exactly would Padfoot *growl* at Harry? Then there's the cheesy Grim dog, which showed up everywhere without any actual meaning behind it. Or the Quidditch match that should never have been. I was angry about them cutting Quidditch; now I'm angry that they left it in. Michael Gambon was a horrible replacement. With all his acting experience, you'd think the director would bother telling him that Dumbledore has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and that he would never say anything straight. Nor would Hermione, the empowered and scholarly (albeit bossy) role model, obsess over her hair, or wear anything preppy, trendy, and teenybopper-esque. But if I get started about Hermione, I'll *never* finish. The plot holes in this disaster were so large that several Mack trucks could be driven through them. Why the director decided that mentioning the authors of the Marauder's Map was a minor detail, I shan't understand. But leaving out the fact that James was an Animagus was just criminal. I won't even get into the ignored Quidditch win. The omission of the Firebolt, until the very end of the movie, and without Pig or the Hogsmeade form, was just stupid. Basically nothing was explained. Beyond that, every one of my favorite scenes was dramatically ruined. The boggart scene was abysmal; the Shrieking Shack was apparently cutting into those wonderful scenes with Buckbeak flying over the lake, so it was rushed and stupid. Oh, and they somehow left the Invisibility cloak out of the entire scene. But once Harry and Hermione went back with the Time Turner, I got fighting mad. It was overt, cheesy, melodramatic, inaccurate, and just plain stupid. Not one character behaved appropriately. Ever, in the length of the film. Well, maybe I should mention the one or two redeeming qualities that kept me from actually asking for my money back. Emma Thompson was surprisingly good, with her airy mysticism and dragonfly-like glasses. Daniel Radcliffe was just hot. And yes, I'm saying this and feeling like a pedophile. The Aunt Marge scene was pretty funny, and the Knight Bus was within the bounds of artistic license. Other than that, I give this film an enthusiastic two thumbs way, way down.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
933,MorganFreemanRocks,did they even read the book?!?,2,25 June 2007,"I went to see Harry Potter and the Prizener of Azkaban In theaters and I saw it on DVD and each time I could not believe how badly It was written. I don't even think they read the book and If you didn't read the book then turn off your computer go to Barnes and Noble and buy all six Harry potter books. Now this movie would not be entirely bad if they just left stuff out but they actually changed the book! And it wasn't just a little thing here and there they changed major things. I'm not going to say what they where all I can say is that you should get the book, read it, and then watch the movie again to see how much worse the are then the books. The S.E. were pretty good even though every time any one cast a spell it looked like wind shot out and that was that. The acting wasn't very good and the best actor by far was Allen Rickman who is a perfect Snape. All in all I hated this movie",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
934,dearjule,"All fluff and no substance, so don't expect too much.",1,5 June 2004,"My overwhelming reaction to the movie was, ""Is the movie over yet???""How much you'll like the movie will all depend on what you're looking for. If you're the kind of person who likes lots of cute special effects, then you'll love the movie. If you're the type who wishes the novel had been followed more closely (like me), you're going to hate it.I honestly think Cuaron worked too hard on the visual effects of the move, which were breathtaking, and not enough on the plot and scene continuation and the actors. There were many times when a scene was simply too intense and seemed to highlight all of their worst acting skills. I think Cuaron expected way too much out of the young actors and did not accordingly adjust for their shortcomings. The result: lame scenes where the lines fall completely flat and the actors seem like they're reading their lines, or even worse: overacting.In my opinion, The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best novel in the series, and the movie should have been more faithful to the book. I understand that it's difficult to adapt a book to the screen and that many things have to be deleted, but they did much more than simply trim the story short. They changed the dialogue and added things that never happened in the book. Also, there's a tribute to Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien, which I found completely inappropriate for a movie like this. Cuaron says the movie's theme is the fact that the children are growing up, but I don't think that it was even conveyed all that well. If a person hadn't read the book, I don't think they would have really understood what was going on at all. The continuation from scene to scene is too disconnected to really showcase any theme or story properly. All I can say is, bring the old director back!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
935,jedilisa77,By far the best Harry Potter film yet.,8,5 June 2004,"Cuaron is the best thing that happened to the Harry Potter series. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker then the other two Potter installments, which is important for the subject matter of the film. ""Stone"" and ""Secrets"" were too cheesy concentrating too much on little details within the stories. Although ""Azkaban"" differs in many way from the book, it is easier to watch because the plot flows better. The scenes end the begin in a much smoother fashion, probably an addition of Cuaron. The only criticism I have is the ending, there has yet to be a Harry Potter film where the ending leaves me completely satisfied. I can only hope that the next ""Potter"" film is as good as this one was.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
936,jtf1986,The Best Harry Potter Movie so far,9,5 June 2009,"This is the best of the Harry Potter movies. The critically acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron brings his own unique vision to J.K. Rowling's wonderful story. He adds nice touches like the showing the Whomping Willow snagging passing birds. This movie can stand apart from the books and other movies as a good movie in its own right. It has poignant moments between Harry and his friends and with Professor Lupin, scary moments, and of course lots of adventure. The only complaint that I have that the movie does not explain why Harry thought the Patronus that saved him was from his dad. The book explains that his dad's Patronus is in the form of a stag.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
937,warlord148,"Enjoyable, but many unnecessary changes",6,4 June 2004,"(Disclaimer: Minor, non-plot-centered spoilers)I saw the midnight showing of this film, and though I feel Cuarón was successful in capturing the ""darker"" feel of this story, I think he simply changed too much of what Chris Columbus had set up. Most notably, I saw no reason to change the sets. I was expecting to return to the same old Hogwarts, but instead found Hagrid's house down a rocky hill as opposed to across a green meadow. The familiar courtyards and hallways from the first two films were gone as well, and were replaced with entirely new ones. I agree that using the same sets for seven (if they make them all) different films would get repetitive, but I feel that it would be possible to show a different angle, perhaps showing new areas of the castle that had not previously been shown, while still retaining what existed from earlier films.My girlfriend (who has read all of the books while I have not) pointed out many elements of the story that were just plain left out. Unless I am mistaken, this was the shortest of the first three films, despite being adapted from the longest of the first three books. Does this mean ""Goblet of Fire"" will be pared down to ninety minutes, and we'll leave the theaters in 2005 wondering what just hit us? After the immense success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, I feel that audiences have the attention span to sit through three-hour movies. Heck, kids can read these 800-page monstrosities that J. K. Rowling writes, so throw them a bone, Cuarón!One more minor comment: I know Michael Gambon probably wanted to create his own interpretation of Dumbledore, but I still think that he, like the director, could have followed more of what was previously set up. His accent and speech patterns reminded me more of Ian McKellen's Gandalf than Richard Harris' Dumbledore. And they at least could have given him a white beard instead of a gray one!I hope the next director finds a way to maintain a dark feel, but do so without creating a whole new set. I know that the plots necessitate changes, but there's just something comforting about coming back to the same old Hogwarts every year or so.Final rating: 6/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
938,tb9891,Keeping the kids entertained and telling a good story does not combine well,8,31 May 2004,"The Harry Potter books are loved for their wealth of detail and twisting story lines. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in my opinion where JKR changes gear after the first two and gives us a great book. I fully accept that transferring to film is a tricky balance to achieve, however in my view there was more than enough to pull out of the book to make for a great movie - and they failed. I suspect that parts of the film had to be made less scary or cut in order to get a PG certificate, however I would dearly love for the darker tale to be told. What on earth is the graveyard scene in the Goblet of Fire going to be like if this is the precedent? It seems the series is heading towards a backlash from the older readers over dumbing down for the younger kids. I say leave the twists and have the kids use their brains - and I think and hope that JKR is with me on that one. I'm quite happy to answer any of the questions the young ones might have.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
939,mbae,"Darker, but better",10,12 June 2004,"The third movie is darker than the past two, but it is better. Director Alfonso Cuarón shows his talents in this film, but I can't say that I honestly mean that he is the most suited director for a movie like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. My feel is that some of the books elements come out wrong, even though this is the best Harry Potter so far. Of course some of this can probably be blamed on scriptwriter Steve Kloves. Some parts of the film seems a bit long, but that's a bit like the book actually.The cast performs good, and I can't say the lack of humor makes the movie worse, I would rather say that it actually cranks it up a notch instead. I read another comment commenting that the Americans don't understand the spoken word in this film and rather wants it dubbed(!). That's in my opinion the worst thing you can do to a movie. Even though Americans seem to like it, along with several European countries (they should all learn to read subtitles). I'm from Norway and we all learn English as a second tongue, how often do we run around shouting to get films dubbed? (just a little statement)Back to the movie: The movie stands well on it's own feet, but if you have read the book the experience is a bit different (sadly, you also miss elements from the books, but when each book grows in size, things got to be cut from the script so the movie doesn't double in length from the previous one.Alfonso is claimed to be a more ""emotional director"", and that's something that shows through the movie, and actually seems to go home with the audience.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
940,chrisc_doa,Better than the other 2 and the book.,9,31 May 2004,"Having heard some good things about this third installment, and having enjoyed the first two films i was quite looking forward to seeing Harry Potter 3. The first obvious thing about this film is how much it has changed due to having a different director. Even though the book is darker the film is completely different. For a start, i don't think their is a brightly lit shot in almost the entire film!The acting is improved, as is the script, and all the children just look right. That's mainly because they have all aged, and are wearing normal clothes, so the film feels less Disney than previously. IT may be a departure from the book, but since JK hasn't mentioned the kids growing in 5 years, it seems more realistic. The new characters are OK, thewlis is impressive (which is a shock given previous work), oldman has little to do but is okay, and Emma thompson is plain weird. The most important parts of the book remain intact, but quite a lot has been ditched to keep the running time down. Unlike the last two films, this one retains a good pace throughout, while keeping the sense of wonder i enjoyed from 1 and 2. It's really a great film - good acting from a mostly young cast, great visuals (no dodgy CG this time), good story. My only bad point would be that i don't think it's a film for kids at all. Teenagers yes, younger kids no. 9/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
941,ionic_girl15,Sorely Disappointed,1,19 January 2011,"Was a disgrace to my Favorite book of the entire series. I was sorely disappointed with the complete absence of Quidditch (and I don't count the one scene where he gets attacked by dementors, they win the cup in the book), the constant unnecessary changes (talking heads hmm?), changes in the entire set, which was wonderful beforehand, The explanation of who Sirius is to Harry is severely lacking as well.This movie was such a disappointment for me. I read PoA enough that the binding of the book was finished and I was extremely excited for this movie. It was a sure let down and I did not watch Harry Potter movies for a long time afterward.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
942,pchip1,A total disappointment,1,3 June 2004,"My daughter and I have been waiting with anticipation for the third of the harry potters to be released, but sadly were both extremely disappointed with the results. This third film should have been excellent as the book was the best of all 5. How can it have been made into an absolute mockery of the novel? My partner never reading the books, was left wondering what was happening and couldn't follow the plot fully without myself filling him in. I sincerely hope that the fact that there is yet another director working on the 4th film, will improve the viewing,plot and relation to the novel.Hopefully the screen writers will heed the comments of people regarding this movie, but i hate to say that i know they won't. If they see the box office results regarding the showing of this film, then i'm afraid they will not be interested in reviews of any adverse nature.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
943,north1,A refreshing new take on the series.,10,2 June 2004,"The third installment to the Harry Potter series just got better. With a new director on the helm (among other things) the movie and its cast has grown out of its shell and into maturity.The movie is now no longer slow and is no longer trying to impress its audience. It is now more direct and less dragging, with much better and impressive shots from falling leaves to flying umbrellas to silly little blue jays. Almost every detail is rich with color and brilliance, nothing too distracting or too droned out. Each shot has a point and it is sure to make something of it. The film then proceeds to take hold of you for the next two hours and you won't even notice the time fly by.Most of the actors have also improved their presence. With the new director it was refreshing to see the cast do a splendid performance - a performance which definitely surpassed the previous film. Alas, we can't help but feel the absence of several actors in this film but the additions of new ones was thoroughly exciting.Their more relaxed outfits were also a pleasant scene than the previous films which often shows the cast in their ever so black school clothes. Here, the sexuality and maturity of the actors are accented by their clothes and by the complexity of their costumes. Growing out of its shell, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one very delightful journey. A refreshing new take on the series and a brilliant follow up on which Alfonso Cuarón did a magnificent job and surely deserves another take on the helm in the up coming chapters.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
944,Nerbie,Great atmosphere but too little back story.,7,4 June 2004,"The main problem with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the fact that it glossed over too many important things in the book. Also Lupin and Harry's relationship developed far too quickly and they NEVER mentioned who Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. To me the movie felt like a poor summarization or book report of a great book. That being said the acting was good, the characterization was pretty good and the mood of the film was much more ominous. And seeing Hermione punch Malfoy was a real treat. If you're not a fan of the books the movie seems great. If you are you'll probably leave the theater thinking about what the movie could have been had it been longer or left in someone else's hands.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
945,bernardgpulham,Best Director for Best Installment,8,31 May 2004,"Of the first five Harry Potter novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite. It was as if J.K. Rowling had spent the first two stories on a steep professional learning curve, gradually improving her prose while she was finding her feet stylistically. Only in the third book was she so able to focus on the story, weaving an ingenious plot which builds to an immensely satisfying conclusion. I was pleased to learn that a new director had been found to tackle the Prisoner of Azkaban, and the results are, in the main, wonderful. The music and visuals are great, with Hogwarts looking better than in the first two films. There is often so much background detail in each shot, that you will have little chance of taking it all in until the film reaches DVD. The Dementors are scary (though the full horror of their soul-leeching kiss is not really dwelt upon) and the animagus / werewolf effects are effective too. Each of the three lead players has enough to do to develop their character a little more. The assurance of Emma Watson's level-headed Hermione is such that having her, and only her, squealing in every scary scene is a bit difficult to understand. The time traveling plot mechanism is well handled, and unlikely to confuse even younger viewers. This makes it odd that the film makes no effort to state clearly who the characters Wormtail, Moony, Padfoot, and (most importantly) Prongs are discovered to be. The obvious clues are all there, and readers already knew, but at what moment did Harry, Ron and Hermione share this realisation? Overall, this film is well worth going to see.

It's not my mother language)So far, I've seen PoA three times and I wouldn't mind seeing it a thousand times. Wow. My favourite book in the series, and the movie certainly lived up to my expectations. The child actors have grown in their roles. I do hope the main three actors will play the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione in all the seven movies. The grown-up actors are also wonderful. I particularly like Michael Gambon, who's Dumbledore is funny, sharp, strong and convincing. His Dumbledore is more like the Dumbledore I imagined when reading the books. As for the director: nothing against Columbus, but Cuarón adds speed, humor and depth to the movie, which is faster and more grown-up than the other two. I also like the new decor and the fact that Hogwarts and the magical world become less of a fairy tale and more realistic. Good job, I'm looking forward already to the next movie, but wouldn't be surprised if PoA would stay my favourite of the series.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
947,hammettdavies,Maybe the best Harry Potter film yet.,9,28 April 2009,"For a while I still had not come around to the idea that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was as good as some critics have said. I think I was even left a little cold by this third entry in the series when I first saw it. I still really liked the film, considering it with ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" as the one of the strongest in the franchise so far. I never quite agreed that Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films, which I loved were as weak as some critics believe but last night I found myself really coming around to the idea that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" may be the best entry in the franchise; and even if it isn't it still a terrific movie. The director of this film is Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron, director of ""Y tu mama tambien,"" which I have yet to see, and also the excellent ""Children of Men."" Even though I loved the first two Columbus films I think Cuaron is probably the best director to direct a film in the franchise. He has a keener visual sense than Columbus, meaning that Cuaron is able to make a CGI sequence like the train sequence when the Dementors first appear into a sequence that owes just as much to the way it is shot and lit as it is to the CGI artistry present. He even makes CGI-less scenes and shots very interesting. The whole movie is visually alive in a way that the first two, as great as they were, were not.As always, the actors are very good. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are the perfect actors to portray Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger. They capture the qualities in the characters that make them lovable. The adult actors like Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane are also perfectly cast as Hagrid and Professor Snape. Michael Gambon replaces Richard Harris as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and does a wonderful job despite limited screen time.There are also new characters in this film, and new actors as well: Remus Lupin as played by David Thewlis. Lupin is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy; and also a friend of Harry's deceased parents, Lily and James. This movie, is very much about delving into the past, as many of the Harry Potter stories are, and this story is very poignant since it is about the past of Harry Potter's parents, which involves the fact that Sirius Black, a wizard who has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban, is possibly then man who betrayed Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort.This movie is about Harry's continuing growth as a wizard, which includes learning how to defend himself from Dementors. The movie is in short, simply wonderful. I am sad that Alfonso Cuaron will not be back as director for any of the upcoming films but am glad that he got to direct a film in this wonderful franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Not only the unavoidable replacement of the late Richard Harris with Michael Gambon, but the alterations in architecture, landscaping and costuming. It just seemed more like a retelling than a continuation of the first two movies, with the familiar Hogwarts we had got to know from the first two movies replaced with a new vision. More darkness, not as much wonder.On the positive side, the animation of Buckbeak was top-notch, and seeing Emma Thompson as the very weird Professor Trelawney was a hoot. Also the two lads playing the Weasley twins seem to be getting better actors, and their characters have lost their teenage gawkiness to be replaced with teenage cool.Personally, I hope Chris Columbus comes back and puts things back to the way they were in the first two movies he helmed personally.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Hoped this one would have some (chaste) ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" teenage exuberance, but it's not much different than the other movies. This one is better--and probably scarier--but not much better. It's slow-paced until near the end, and, if you haven't the read the book, somewhat incomprehensible. Most fun is spotting familiar English actors--Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Dawn French, Timothy Spall. Daughter complained that important elements of the book were omitted. Tried to explain that as Rowling's books keep getting longer and movies needed to stay more or less the same length, something had to go. She remains unpersuaded.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
951,rlapplet,"short and sweet, don't read this if you haven't seen the film and don't want it spoiled.",6,3 June 2004,"I was sad that there was so little of the classic Hogwarts theme. The last two films had me almost in tears at parts, this one didn't at all. There was no battles between houses in fact the house names didn't even get mentioned once! Alfonso Cuarón has done some good stuff in the past, but I can't say that I am happy with his choices in Prisoner of Azkaban. There were a few really well done scenes, I like the werewolf animation, but overall I am rather disappointed in this film. I am worried about Goblet because if this is as much as we can get in Prisoner then how in the world will they be able to fit in even half of Goblet. Why not make it into two films, one of the quiddich world cup and the other of the triwizard tourny.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
952,ephriam2,A New Angle - Possible Spoilers,7,31 May 2004,"Having never read the books i went into this film with no idea what to expect as i knew nothing that was going to happen. I was more than pleased with what i saw, the new director is a step up from Chris Columbus who did a very good job with the last two. The acting was of a good standard...i enjoyed Gary Oldman as Black, having never read the books i thought the character was very good and well played. Michael Gambon did a great job taking over for the now deceased Richard Harris. The special effects were of a high standard and while impressive never over powered the film and took more of a back seat to the characters and story. I liked this one also because of the darker tone and the whole style of the film made it very enjoyable.Overall i would give it 9 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

954,Tr-A,"Nice conversion, although really missed some parts of the story.",8,30 June 2004,"The books growing thicker it's more and more difficult to fit in all the essential stuff in 2 and a half hour (max). I would've liked to see more about how Sirius escaped and about James Potters's friends back in the school days. Some scenes were added/changed but nothing crucial.Computer graphics fit in well, Hippogriff was well done, and so did the dementors.Acting was OK, Gary Oldman is superb but.. in such a small role. 'New' Dumbledore was a bit different, a little bit more lively than the old one. The young ones are almost too old looking.. Don't know if they'll be in the next movie/movies. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
955,mb20rocker,Best movie...but lacking,10,4 June 2004,"***Caution: Spoilers if you haven't seen it yet***This was easily the best of the three HP movies so far but it was also the best book of the first three so this was to be expected. The only thing that bothered me is that too much was left out about the origin of the Marauder's Map and how Lupin, Sirius and Peter all grew up with Harry's parents. They never divulged that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were James and his friends and even why they were animagi and why the Whomping Willow was on Hogwarts grounds. Also, Cuaron seemed to care more about making breath taking shots and memorable moments than telling the story Rowling had written. Overall I think that this was harder for him in comparison to the other movies for Columbus in that SS and COS do not have near as much going on in them. In any case, I give the movie a 10 as movies go but I think you would have to have read the book to fully enjoy the story that is behind it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
956,ltd2girl28,A great movie (spoilers),10,7 June 2004,"I thought the movie was great. It was so much funnier than the other two. The places they shot the scenes in were beautiful, and the acting was brilliant. In the scene where harry tells hermione about sirius black betraying his parents made me cry almost. Also, the outfits made them look so much better. It made sense, because it proved that they are normal teenagers. teenagers wouldn't walk around in there robes in there free time. The ending was my favorite part. When they went back in time it was great. Also, i really liked the whole stone thing. It wasn't in the book, but it was a great add in. The only thing i didn't like was that I think they could have added a little more to the end. Overall, a great movie, see it, it's worth every penny.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
957,MovieMaster3444,Terrifyingly great,10,8 June 2004,"Well, I have waited forever to see this movie come out to theaters since the Fall of 2002. After I saw the movie I was pretty disappointed by how much stuff was mixed around and how much stuff was cut out. But the fluid kept pumping and the story kept rolling.In my opinion, the movie had a way different feel than the other two. The three are now teenagers which are way different that youths or pre-teens. They've got a bigger attitude, like when Harry snaps on his Aunt Marge. They lightened up on each other and were nicer, but they protected each other with greater force and tension. I just want to say for all you Harry Potter lover's that this is the best one yet.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
958,acmech,Interesting Movies,8,6 June 2005,"First let me start-out by saying that I have not read any of the books, so what I say here is only from the movie perspective. I have found all three of these movies very entertaining although I feel this last one was more of a breakaway from the first two. I suppose this is why I like it better. Nothing against the first two though. I guess I just like that Harry is starting to realize his destiny lies on a different path than most others.Anyways, I liked the intro of Lupin and Black. I particularly like the scene where Sirius tells Harry about his feelings from the first time he passed through the doors of Hogwarts. Can you imagine Black, Lupin, Potter, Riddle, Malfoy and Snape all wandering the halls of Hogwarts as children?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Stood in line this morning. I will stand in line again tonight.I have never left disappointed.I loved the first two movies. I agreed with the casting and of the script.Now looking at the third movie, they are nothing.This movie (as does the third book) takes us into an whole different realm. The story darkens as we pass the ""introduction"" phase of things and really get into what is the core story that will carry us through the remaining years at Hogwarts.I loved this movie.I bow to Cuaron. I bow to Michael Gambon. I bow to Gary Oldman.And last, I bow to the Trio, who made this movie what it is.Thanks guys!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
960,tankster12,Terrible Directing leads to an extremely disappointing film,3,4 June 2004,"Well I just saw HP3 and I must say that I am very disappointed. So many plot elements were left out (quidditch cup; moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs remain unexplained) that I had to sit down with a friend who had never read the books for half an hour afterwards to explain pretty much the entire story. Also, I do not get the same feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world as when Chris Columbus directed. I mean, the kids were wearing common street clothes most of the movie, which was ridiculous. Hardly any actual ""wizarding"" took place, and the climax scene where Harry produces the patronus was terribly done. During the first two movies I felt like I was taken into the wizarding world, whereas in PoA I felt like I was watching some kids running around trying to solve a mystery while some neat special effects happened. I am extremely disappointed and I'm just glad that the next movie will feature a new director.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
961,hermoine786,A definite improvement,10,13 June 2004,"Compared to the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has improved drastically. Although many avid Harry Potter fans (one being myself) are a bit disappointed with the many changes, I think that those specific changes can be overlooked with how well this movie has been directed, written, and acted.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown so wonderfully... and in only a year. If they can do that in a year... let's see what they can do in many years. Daniel Radcliffe was very tight and nonemotional in his two previous movies... yes he was very good... but again, not very emotional. In the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, Radcliffe has really shown definite improvement. It's as if you can really relate to the character now. When he speaks in the movie, it isn't as if he is reading off the script... but actually adlibbing everything... which is very good. Emma Watson has definitely grown into a beautiful young woman. Even at a ripe age of 13/14... 16 year old boys (ahem my brother) are practically in love with her, and girls just love the way she presents herself. She is probably one of the only great young acting girls to come around (especially when you compare her to Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan who cannot act worth their life). Rupert Grint presents comic relief... and wow is he hilarious (Especially his dream scene). I love how oblivious he is to everything. And how laid back he is in interviews.This movie is finally almost doing justice to the books",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
962,nikid7,An interesting ride,9,9 June 2004,"After a few days of thinking about PoA, after reading other comments and the message boards about what others thought...I have a much happier spin on the movie version of this wonderful story. I read an interview with Cuaron, I believe it was in Rolling Stone, and I was so super-excited about seeing the movie (which was wonderful)!In all honesty, I was a little disappointed because I'm one of those totally envision-as-you-read kind of girls and I was a little perturbed that it felt so much of the storyline was missing, but I did think it was a beautifully done picture and there were a lot of uplifting moments in the darkness of it all. All in all, I thought it was quite fantastic and I'd like to see it a second time.I cannot wait to see the next four (and for the last two books) and for the Cuaron fans out there, he's rumored to be coming back for the fifth or sixth movies.PS Kudos to those actors, they're growing beautifully as people and as artists (thanks Columbus!). Richard Harris, we miss you!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
963,phil-452,If you love the books...,3,23 June 2004,"I have read the Harry Potter books many times and consider myself an avid fan. The first two films were good; they at least followed the spirit of the books. This film has very little to do with the book, the characters, location and story have been completely ignored. I feel, we the fans, have been totally betrayed. I left the cinema one hour ago and still feel angry. If you like the books and the first two films DO NOT go to see this film. Hope and pray that for the next one they go back to the old formula and get a director who cares about the books. Send a list of all the things that are wrong with this film to: Warner Bros.

In this movie my especially favorite parts were when Hermione punches Draco in the face after a rude comment. As well as some other hilarious parts, this movie was very very enjoyable. I especially love the plots crazy time turning moments where you really have to pay attention. I've never read the books but after seeing this wondrous movie I am on my way to the nearest bookstore to find them all!

965,goncalonevescruz,Time and Perception,9,10 November 2012,"It's amazing and beautiful. The Time subject is the main concern on the movie and that is pleasant. Big plans of the clocks working, the way they have to change their path going back, shown in a decent way. The difference between reality and perception, how harry gets to do things believing in something that it's not the truth, but it's what makes him deal with his problems. Of course it's not perfect, i think the Shapeless monster scene, where harry tries make his spell it's not really credible in some parts. And the one where Hermione grabs him while bouncing on the tree. Nhaaac, not really the best way to show it. But still these scenes are smashed by the beautiful concept of the castle and the greatness it inspires. Buckbeak it's amazing too. Never blinked to think it was CGI or how it was made, but still i was finding the story much lovely to worry about that.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
966,fatpie42,Even people who thought they hated Harry Potter will love it!,9,1 June 2004,"Put it this way....I HATE the harry potter books. I find them boringly written and despise the way they insult the reading ability of Children everywhere. Unlike Pullman who writes complex and descriptive books, Dahl whose imagery constantly surprises and thrills and Lewis whose Narnia books contain beautiful imagery, Rowling's books uses only very simplistic expressions.What Rowling's books do have though, it seems, is great stories. However, as always with novels, you can fit a lot more plot into a book than you can into a movie. The previous movies have kept very much to the plot of the book and as a result they have ended up leaving an awful lot of the story out. In this movie the director is not afraid to shift things about a bit in order to make the story work better as a movie.The director is a very important reason for the quality of this movie. Unlike previous directors the only place this director could be called an 'unknown' is in Hollywood. This director is critically acclaimed for his film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (""And your mother too""). In the Harry Potter movie he has taken some of his cues from the imaginative directing style of Terry Gilliam. As such he has added wonderful personal touches such as the shrunken voodoo heads (look out for them - they're great).This is the best Harry Potter movie yet, and by that I mean it is the FIRST good Harry Potter movie so far. Let's hope the next movie can provide more of the same because this movie was awesome!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It is the perfect translation from book to film...I am ever so grateful for the director switch...Altough i adore the cast... They are all so sweet and perfect for this type of film...-Harry Potter fan.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
968,ladypythia,The good and the bad...,7,6 June 2004,"Like most Harry Potter fans, I found this movie disappointing. I felt that Director Alfonso Cuaron choose style over substance, which is never a good thing in a movie.Some critics say that the previous movies were too stiff in how they stuck close to the book. THAT IS THE POINT!! If I want to see a Harry Potter movie, I want to see the book, the plot, brought to life. I don't want to see the plot changed.However, I must admit, I loved the darker, more Gothic look of the film. The books are taking a turn for the darker and this movie sets that tone.But there was so many plot holes, so much left out. It was hard for this HP fan to ignore. This book, while the smallest of the 5 out there is crucial. This is my main complaint with the movie.It introduces Lupin, Black, and Pettigrew, all of which are important to Harry, as they fill in the gaps of his past. In this book, you discover why Snape hates Harry, Lupin, Black, and James Potter. This is important later. The relationship between Snape and Harry is important to the Order of the Phoenix. Who is Wormtail, Prongs, Moony, and Padfoot? What is and who created The Marauders map. And why is Black an Animagus? The above are all questions that the movie leaves unanswered (but are in the book). I would have sat through another hour to hear the explanations and see the full story. Instead, plot points replaced by unnecessary (but yet funny) cut scenes. Not a good thing.Buckbeak looked great; the CGI was very well done. The time warp effect was also cool. I was disappointed in how Lupin looked as a Werewolf, I thought they were more hairy.The best part of this movie - the acting. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are growing into their roles and as actors. Although Radcliffe could have actually shed some tears during the Hogsmade visit. Tom Felton was great as Draco, who tries to be brash, but is really a coward under it all. He played it excellently.The adults were also fantastic. Maggie Smith was the stern, yet almost motherly Minerva McGonagall. We needed to see more of her; she only had about 2 lines. Robbie Coltrane comes back as Hagrid and he plays the part perfectly. Emma Thompson plays a wonderfully flaky Sybil Trelawney. Michael Gambon had a tough role to fill by following Richard Harris. Gambon brings his own slant to Albus Dumbledore, which in this movie was a bit off-kelter, but I think as we get used to him in this role, it will seem more natural.Alan Rickman.... He is the most underrated actor in this movie. The critics seem to ignore his astounding acting in these films. He is absolutely fantastic in his role as the sharp, harsh, angry, but troubled Severus Snape. Any lesser actor would have made Snape flat, but Rickman gives him life and dimension. Also, he has some of the greatest lines in this movie. ""Revenge is very sweet..."" Gary Oldman was good as Sirius Black, but we didn't seen enough of him. His confrontation with Rickman was emotion filled and was one of the best parts of the movie. I wish it had gone on longer. Timothy Spall plays a disgusting and revolting Peter Pettigrew. He looked the part and played it well. Remus Lupin was played by David Thewlis. I was not sure what to think at first; I was hoping Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Buffy) was going to get the part. But Thewlis was excellent, he made Lupin a character you liked and cared about, a feeling you didn't get from the book. But Thewlis makes you feel that for the character. He got a fair amount of screen time, but I wanted more. Fantastic acting. I can't wait to see him come back in the next few films. All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie. The plot holes really damage the film. The acting and the feel of the movie are great, but still don't quite make up the difference.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
969,daychooch1b,Not up to par,5,26 June 2004,"I have seen all the movies and read all of the books at this point. I have no problem with the movie being dark, but I feel that they did the book a huge injustice. Not only did they leave out some crucial scenes, but there was no continuity and the movie was choppy. I did enjoy the FX and the dementors were very good. The movie itself was , in my opinion, too short. Also, I believe the characters have done an excellent job as they are growing up. David Thewlis did an exceptional performance as Prof. Lupin, but I did have a problem with a bald-headed werewolf. The best I can give this movie in all honesty is a ""C"" and that was because of Thewlis. I hope they can do a better job with GOF.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
970,c_nichols,Visual Feast,10,24 May 2004,"This film is without a doubt the best of the three ... It is so visually rich with detail ... Interesting angles, lots of exterior shots, special effects were seamless ... The acting of the three majors is improved, raw and natural ... While staying true to the essence of the book, what is delivered here is a pleasing, fast-paced, extremely witty, visual feast ...Warning: Some plotlines don't make it into the movie or in some cases the sequence of things are not the same or are streamlined for the sake of time  While this is always a bit painful for the faithful Potter-fan to swallow, even the sections I knew ahead of time were missing I didn't find it to be blatant  you get swept away in the movie and it's hardly noticeable  Important though to separate yourself from the details of the book so as not to be disappointed  There ARE things missing but the main stuff from the book is all there  All considering, they were pretty faithful  There are some added scenes or things in scenes that only served to enhance Bottom Line: Can't imagine anyone coming away disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
971,PhantomPyrate,Do not expect a replica of the book,10,8 June 2004,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since the books came out in the USA in 1999. To me, the books will always be a wonderful escape from reality. Prisoner of Azkaban just happens to be my favorite of the series. I have never been disappointed with Cuaron's work. I feel he has immense talent as a director. This film was superbly done. However, in order to appreciate this, you have to look at it just as that: a film. The acting for these films just keeps getting better, and Gary Oldman was PERFECT as Sirius Black. It had a very nice flow, and the score is the best so far of all three.If you are expecting it to be just like the book, prepare for disappointment. Very much has been changed, left out, etc, and I made the mistake of seeing the film with the book sitting in my lap.If you have not yet seen this film, my advice to you is this: Go with an open mind. This is a beautiful piece of film history, and should be appreciated for all that it is. I give it a perfect 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
972,fairygirl122,Huge Disappointment,3,4 June 2004,"This movie me had me leaving the theater feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. The deviation from the book was such that there were gaping plot holes and the chronology was utterly destroyed. Many scenes that were added were unnecessary and took up time that could have been dedicated to more plot specific events. The scenes between Harry and Lupin which are critical to the story were very awkward and often were rambling without providing significant dialogue. While it is true that it is difficult for a movie to die hard fans of its original book, this was a complete distortion. Characters and events that are crucial to the outcome of both the third book as well as the story of the fourth were omitted or changed beyond recognition. Essentially the story became secondary to the imagery, which was lacking in itself. The scenery was a fierce deviation from the first two films, giving the impression that they were not even at Hogwarts. The attempts to make the film poignant came across as trite giving the movie a hackneyed quality. The characters were flat making it hard for the audience to empathize with them. I was glad I read the book because there was so much lost I would not have been able to follow the story, yet upset that I read the book because this movie fell so far from my expectations. All in all I would recommend waiting for video or even not seeing the film at all.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
973,laprath-3,Terrible Adaptation,2,18 November 2011,"As a big fan of the books, I found this movie to be quite awful. I understand that the director has to cut parts of the book to make this into a condensed film, and I've made my peace with that. However, this movie seemed rushed and too many important details were left out. Not only that, scenes were added that weren't in the book which didn't add to the movie in any way. I tried to watch this as an unbiased observer, pretending I had never read the book, and that made it worse. If I were a neutral observer, I would say that the characters are not developed enough, and the story was too rushed and sparse of details to give any real clarity as to what was going on. I just got done watching the first two movies, and while the cut scenes annoyed me, I ultimately decided that it was okay. I do not feel this way about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I can't believe anybody who hasn't read the books enjoyed this. As much as I cherish the books, I don't feel like this story is easily translated into film, and I think it shows.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
974,lisliming34,Third and Best Film of All in the Harry Potter Series,10,7 December 2011,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Cuaron, 2004), the third film in the Harry Potter series still remains my favorite of all. Not only is this movie about good conquering evil, it is also a coming of age movie for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson). This movie continually shows how Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown and matured into their roles. The film also shows how the friendships and the bonds among the three have strengthened and grown as well. Hermione, in particular has grown into a strong adversary for Harry, not only her knowledge but her skills with magic and her wand have also improved. Above all, she deeply cares for Harry and is as pure and good as he is. Ron continues to offer some comedic relief as he grows and we love watching him. The main plot of the film is that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who was imprisoned for his part in Harry's parent's deaths has escaped Azkaban prison and is coming for Harry. The role of Sirius Black seemed to be made perfectly for Gary Oldman. He portrays Sirius with such tenacity that you find yourself fearing him and at the same time falling for him because you see goodness in him. Ultimately we are cheering for him when we find he was not to blame for Harry's parent's deaths and that he loved them dearly as well as Harry and that he is Harry's Godfather. Harry continues to fight the Dark Lord and his followers throughout the film. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) continues his role as the nasty and unfathomable character we have grown to despise because of his harsh treatment of Harry and the underlying notion that he is fighting on the side of the Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes) and betraying Dumbledore (Michael Sambon). The story behind this movie continues to be gripping from beginning to end. It opens with Harry struggling with his family and the struggles only increasing, to Harry struggling with the fear and reality that Sirius is coming for him and ending with Harry struggling over the threat of Voldermort coming after him. I believe what makes this film so intriguing to the fans of Harry Potter is how true it has remained to the novels. J.K. Rowling has done a magnificent job of bringing these characters and the magic to life in her novels and the reward of seeing them as we imagined while reading on screen is phenomenal. The film continues to open up new avenues for our imaginations to expand with the twists and turns. The continual use of images moving in paintings, stair cases moving and ghosts floating around Hogwarts gives the audience the overall illusion that magic truly does exist. Even though we do not see as much of the Dementors, the special lighting used allows the viewer to feel their looming, dark presence overshadowing the school. The special effects used when Harry is using the invisibility cloak and seeing his foot prints on the map help the audience to have a sense of moving along with him quietly and softly. Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing such a fantastic series of books. The Harry Potter novels and films are truly something I will cherish for years to come. I fell in love with the characters in the books and only hoped that the movies would portray them as I had imagined. In reality, the films were much more than I could have asked for. It was a great experience watching the characters grow, endure and triumph over tragedy and evil.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
975,peppergirl3,scenery,9,2 December 2004,"i love the harry potter series. i absolutely do, but i have some criticisms of this movie in particular. There were so many things that were changed, unfortunately, for the worse. not that I'm not gonna buy th DVD or anything, its just, when i saw it in theaters....# 1? the scenery. it was the same in the first 2 movies, so it would have been so much better in this one if it had stayed the same. i know that replacing dumbledore had to happen, poor richard harris, but the new one coulda at least tried to sound a little raspier like the old one so that people who didn't know harris had died would find it harder to tell this was a new cast member. and the prophecy... i know they have to cut things out of th story and all, but there is supposed to bee like a month or 2 difference from the day hermione leaves divination til the prophecy. certain things just shouldn't be changed, and certain things must be made with real timing. oh, and peter pedigrew!!! he was fat!!! peter pedigrew is supposed to be a thin and frail, tiny man. yeah, the guy looked like a rat, but he definitely wasn't thin!!!!!and the whole movie just seemed so much darker.... the others had a realistic coloring, this one was just like it was always dark, when thats not the case...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
976,deathbylambcat,Just keeps getting better...,10,7 June 2004,"Although I've posted bits of this in a thread, I thought I'd like to leave a comment. Wonderful film, much better, in my opinion than the first two, no offense whatsoever meant towards Christopher Columbus. He filled the more whimsical, juvenile feels of the books when Harry, Hermione and Ron were younger, and now they're aging, Cuaron was more than good for this more mature installment of the series.I feel the critics have been right to hail this film, simply because they are viewing it from the proper perspective - they look at it and judge it as a film - not a retelling of a book. That is the way it should be. I am not saying that loving the book's content and feel is wrong - I am one of the millions of fans of the books - I am only saying that the film should stand completely separate from the book, and be judged as such. In this way, it succeeded painlessly.Bear in mind both Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz were adaptations of beloved children's books, and though in many ways both had stark differences from their novel counterparts, they remain to this day as film classics.Anyhow, on the film itself, many huge improvements from the Columbus films:The film had a much better flow. I just watched the first two films recently, and I noticed more than ever how extremely choppy all the scene transitions were. In the third film, the flow is much more liquid, and when Hermione, Harry and Ron are talking - albeit this DOES have some part credited to better acting skills with age - the direction and sequence of the movie's direction allows interaction between characters to seem more... natural. As if they really are at school, going about daily life, however disrupted by adventure and mishap though it may be. I found that to be very redeeming, right off the mark.Digital effects were noticeably better as well, although that's a technical improvement. The characters are aging in the series. Cuaron did a magnificent job of channeling this new age of the wizards in both the writing (albeit they still kept some humor, just the right amount, I think) and the flow.The plots get progressively darker as the series moves on. Many, MANY things were changed, yes, but you have to look at it from a movie scriptor's point of view - if there have to be minor changes in the plot, which involve characters being in different places than the book tells, you have to go back in the script and re-write to make sure that they logically get there. In the end, with all the cutting they had to do, due to time restraints, that involves a lot of stepping back and tweaking, and I feel that was also handled very well. Yes, it is a bit odd that suddenly dementors can fly, but that again harkens back to the need to have characters in place for plot advancement.Scenery and set changes, I felt, were for the better. Some large parts have been left out, but the whole still remains intact and spared from too much confusion, though there is potential for some if you aren't listening carefully.Chronological order (according to the novel) be damned - many people are seeing this film without having ever read the books, and that is how it should be viewed. Even if you have read them, I think if you try and empty your mind of prejudices and expectations in light of the books, and just view it as a film achievement, you will hardly be disappointed - you will be delighted.I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and can't wait to see it again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
977,tbeuschlein,A movie worth seeing again,8,7 June 2004,"This is a movie worth seeing again. I read the book more than 3 times. So I went with the eye of how the book was adapted to a screenplay. The basic storyline was there. But the way it was presented really branched off from the book. Which I found very interesting, but also exciting. I think any true Harry Potter fan would have sat thru a 3 hour Movie, so the movie director could have showed some of the details that were left out like how he really received the Firebolt or how Snape was really involved in the end book. Daniel, Emma and Rupert were superb in this movie. Emma Thompson role as Professor Trelawney was exactly has I pictured from reading the book. Gary Oldman portrayal of Sirius Black was I think worthy of a Oscar nomination. I can't wait to see what how The Goblet of Fire turns out.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
978,johnmuirhead,Boring waste of time and film stock,1,7 June 2004,"I fell asleep, literally, several times - at a noon hour showing. Very little that kept me even mildly interested. This 3rd offering is by far and away the worst. It's no Shrek 2. There were few scenes at the School. And very limited use of the School's teachers. There were a few scary scenes, perhaps too horrific for the younger ones (under 6?). The cinematography was pretty good. Both my daughter and I found this film's storyline and plot confusing and non-sensical. Okay, the Special Effects were pretty good, but that does not make a movie great. And this film is a long, long way from great. Boring bigtime. Bring your jammies and be prepared to sleep. Yawn!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
979,r_lehmann,Big Disappointment,5,4 June 2004,"I am a HUGE fan of both the Harry Potter books and the films. Prisoner is still my favourite book yet, and consequently I was very much looking forward to the third movie. However, I was thoroughly disappointed. Although I agree that Alfonso Cuarón introduced a much needed darker side of the story of Harry Potter, I found the movie to be lacking in several important aspects introduced in the books. For example the explanation of the Maurders Map, I feel that it was important to explain the connection between the map, James Potter and Harry, which in turn would explain the patronus that Harry produces (in addition the seen with the patronus by the lake could and should have been better). Also, the very short explanation of what occurred between Sirius and Peter should have been longer, it eliminated the character building of Peter, Lupin and Sirius, and did not give the watcher the chance to understand why Harry forgave Sirius so quickly. Also, many of the events were out of order or completely missing, of course the firebolt, the letter of permission for Harry to go to Hogsmede the next year, and the introduction of ""Pig"" Ron's new pet. While the story line of the Prisoner of Azkaban was, in my opinion, completely destroyed, I feel the worst part of the entire movie was the portrayal of Albus Dumbledore by Michael Gambon. Although Michael Gambon is a very good actor, Dumbledore is NOT the role for him. His portrayal of Albus Dumbledore, I felt, was that of a cold, bumbling, fearful wizard, instead of the caring, all knowing wizard we have all thought Dumbledore to be, example: at the end Dumbledore is patting Ron's hurt leg with a kind of harsh manner ... NOT the Dumbledore we know. Basically, Dumbledore is a father figure to the Hogwart's students, especially to Harry, who is not surprised by events; he is in short a charismatic character who lost his charisma through Michael Gambon.However, on a good note, I was thoroughly impressed by the portrayal of Sirius Black by Gary Oldman. When I first herd he was playing Black I was disappointed, Gary Oldman was NOT how I pictured Black, but he surprised me and did a fantastic job at brining Black to life.In short I am still a fan of Harry Potter, and I was glad to see a more dark portrayal of Harry's world, but I can not account the Prisoner of Azkaban among my favourite movies. I remain a very disappointed Harry Potter fan.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
980,fabriziosturlese,"Good, but hoping for better",7,7 June 2004,"This is a good movie...but I really was hoping for it to be AMAZING...I think that Cuaron takes a bit too much liberties, especially in the way he has changed Hogwarts, and he cuts some parts that would have slowed the pace down a bit but that are really important...(Harry's patronus shape...who wrote the map...how Sirius knew that Pettigrew was at Hogwarts...Ron & Hermione that don't talk to each other for a while...). Anyway, has I say the movie is good, sometimes extremely good other times less; the kids are growing well in their roles, the choice for Dumbledor is adequate (even if he will always be Richard Harris in my mind), and the new professors also are well choose (especially Lupin)...so let's wait for the fourth one!!!!!!W HP!!!!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

In a world in which Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta play high school seniors (Grease), some people find a 14 year old playing a 13 year old too hard to swallow? Hogwash!Whew, that's off my chest - My one problem with the movie is that it is so short, we could have done with 2 more hours. Otherwise, fine job by all, superb acting, sets, mood, scripting, etc. Stay for the ending credits, they're fun to watch, nice touch, even if you don't know a gaffer from a best boy.

I swear , if I hadn't read the books I would have probably left the cinema clueless of what I have just saw , just like my friends which I went with who liked the first two films but hadn't read the books... Why Sirius is innocent or who the hell is Peter? was the major questions rising in many heads and will have to be answered by Mike Newell in the fourth film , poor Mike!!Alfonso Cauron did a better job of directing in some places but we can understand easily that he doesn't really give a damn about the story. The same goes to the scriptwriters too , shame on you!! There were many other bad points like malfoy's character , the worst werewolf design ever and decreasing the running-time but I think I should end it here. It could of been much better...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
983,arezoothejuventuslover,it didn't excite me as much as the book,6,7 July 2004,the film was not bad but i expected more excitement comparing the book. for instance the part that they were in the tree .when i was reading this part i got so excited that i couldn't put down the book.but in the film this part didn't satisfy me . another part which didn't satisfy me was the part that harry encountered the dementor for the first time. but it had some interesting parts when they were in the defense against the dark art class and they were practicing their lesson for instance when Snape's cloths changed into a ridiculous one. i think as many people has read harry potter series the director would better make a film that attracts the viewer so much that he/she finds new interesting parts in it i don't mean to add new parts to the whole story.i mean something that seems new and exciting.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
984,maree144,"Of course its not the book, but...",10,7 June 2004,"When I went into the theatre, I knew just as Cuaron did, that every page of the book would appear on screen, but I think he did a great job of capturing the essence of the book. I mean it is ultimately about Harry and his journey of accepting his fame and trying to understand the events in his past while trying to deal with adolescence. This film is really fast paced, and I completely understand why some fans will hate it, but it gave me the same feeling I got from reading the book. Whenever I sit to read the books it seems like the pages go so fast, and Rowling always leaves me wanting more, and I think Cuaron really captures that feel. No film can ever really be as good as the book....there is just so much characterization that must be left out, but I think this is the best attempt so far for the three feature films. Visually it was so spectacular! Buckbeak and Hogsmeade looked exactly as I pictured them and the cast was great, even though Micheal Gambon can never compare to the perfection of Richard Harris, I just wish I could get to see more mischief from the twins, because they are the comic relief in the book and they kind of lighten up the mood a bit. Nevertheless, it's a must see on my list and I can't wait to see it again!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
985,pju-1,The wait is over!,10,4 June 2004,"I've been eagerly awaiting this film and was not disappointed. I caught a midnight show and not once did I start to fall asleep. Right away you notice a different director is at the helm, which added a nice touch. Also, there was not a lot of dilly-dallying like in the beginning of the books. Now the movie did follow the book (I think my favorite of the series) and didn't add anything new, there were some things left out (as always). Overall I loved the film, it was much more intense then the others and definitely the best so far. I do wonder how some children will react. The intensity is very high especially at the end. The dementors were everything I thought they would be but what a child might think of them could be very different.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
986,Thewlisian,"Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant!",10,14 June 2004,"I found that the movie was great! Alfonso CuarÃ³n seems like a great director, especially after hearing so many great things about him from interviews with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Very different compared to the first two movies, but still very good. I honestly prefer Richard Harris as professor Dumbledore over Michael Gambon. It's a shame he passed away, because I'm sure he'll be missed greatly. However, the rest of the cast was amazing such as Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. I'm unsure why, but Professor Lupin was, without a doubt, my favourite character in the movie. I really felt for him and Sirius Black. Overall, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone and ensure you'll love it. ^_^",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

There were countless errors not to mention key parts of the plot were missing. The acting was at best decent, though if the film had one up side it was Hermione (Emma Watson) she really was very good. I left the theater laughing at this horrible attempt at a movie. Next time please stay more loyal to the book. By far this movie was the worst of the three and I didn't think the first two were very good. The special effects were alright but I spent so much time distracted by the mistakes I couldn't enjoy this movie.Don't see this movie it is a waste of time, just read the book it is 1000's of times better",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
988,kremer5-1,This Harry Potter didn't meet expectations.,5,2 July 2004,"Our family are avid Harry Potter fans, and to say that this installment of the series left us wondering what happened to the Harry Potter style is an understatement. There was so much important information left out of The Prizoner of Azkaban we wondered if it was the same story. Our oldest child who has read all five books several times (even out of order), and our second child who has also read them several times, were telling us what important things were excluded that lead into the fourth installment. For instance,leaving out Cho Chang who has a significant role in the next two books, or changing the location of Hogwarts all of a sudden- what happened to the field outside? And since when do the students dress in their street clothes all the time they're out of class? The pond in the middle of the woods is not there in the book, it is near Hagrid's hut which is not at the bottom of the hill. No hill in the book. Also. What's up with Fred and George knowing about the invisibility cloak---no one knew except Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore (whom might I add would have been better played by Ian McKellen (Gandolph from the Lord of the Rings). Also, when Snape went into the Whomping Willow he wore the invisibility cloak, in the book. Also. The broom was given to Harry for Christmas and was used in several Quiddich games, which were not shown nor were they mentioned, which brings me to wonder why the Quiddich tournament was is not mentioned as is usually is. And most importantly. The dementors do not fly---they glide on the ground; and the patronous is a stag not a shield. We do not appreciate the extreme(in our opinions) detour from the plot of the books. There were many things that should've been in, and many things that shouldn't have been in this installment. If this one does as well it will only be because of the Harry Potter name. Please do not use this director again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I had seen the first and second potter films, but only rented them and watched them once. I didn't really care until one day I say who was the director. Legendary Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. Because of this, I read and now own all the books and movies in the series. I knew this film would be better because of the fact that this book totally beat the first to books. But once I saw the film, I was amazed. This film is better not only because of the detail and stunning visuals. But because of the way the filmmakers took the essential essence of the books and made a film with new and interesting sub-plot points. All in all 10/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
991,Flower_of_Rivendell,"Its Different, but its Good",8,31 May 2004,"OK this may contain spoilers, you've been warned! So I've just got back from seeing this, and I liked it.Yes its different from the previous movies by Christopher Columbus, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. As the trailers of the Movie, and even the picture show, its a darker movie then the previous two, but then, the book is darker. It shows that the characters have all grown up.The actors picked to play the new roles were both good, and not so good in my humble opinion. David Thewlis, who played Professor Lupin, I'm not sure I liked him, I think I had imagined someone with more screen presence. And someone who was poor, but had those rugged good looks. Thats possibly just me. I liked Gary Oldman as Sirius, he played him very well, at times he reminded me of Johnny Depp when he was playing Jack Sparrow. Micheal Gambon did an excellent job of taking over from Richard Harris. Radcliffe, Watson & Grint gave excellent performances also.If I had any major problems with it, its just the whole movie seems incredibly rushed, its like as if Cuaron didn't want the movie to pass a certain time so everything is very fast. For instance, I think we see the kids in class a sum total of 3 or 4 times. I didn't like how they portrayed the Patronus Charm also... you'll know what I mean when you see it.Hogwarts looks fantastic though, as does the grounds. The Special effects are amazing also, the Dementors are very well done, as is Buckbeat.Oh and one final question: Why did it seem that the kids had walked straight out of the Gap?! Why was there no wizard clothes, or very little.Overall the movie is very good, even if very different from the others, I gave it an 8 outta 10.

Major points were left out while minor or unimportant points were embellished upon. This movie needed to follow the book more closely and probably be longer. (How did they expect to make a longer book into a shorter movie?) The information that they left out of this movie is imperative to the story and I am not sure how they plan to continue the movies without it.Many characters were also a disappointment in this film. Dumbledore being the most obvious as no one can really replace Richard Harris.There were a very few parts that I thought were done well, but for the most part I am extremely disappointed in this movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It was funnier and it showed more on Ron and Hermione's relationship!! I know that they are missing some parts from the book but look at it if they put every part into the movie the movie might have been over 4 hours long or even longer!!! i think that its a great movie and Alfonso did a spectacular job directing it!!! I can't wait to see Goblet of Fire next year!!! I hope Mike Newell does a great job on the next installment!! I do hope everyone comes back for the 4th installment!! They are a great cast and they do spectacular job portraying the roles!! One of the funniest scenes in Prisoner of Azkaban was when the aunt was blowing up and her buttons were popping off and hitting Dudley in the face!! The other part was when Harry was on the Knight Bus and the driver stopped quick because the old lady was crossing the road and Harry went flying into the window and his face was sticking to the window!!! there are even more funnier parts but if i write all of them i will be here for hours!!

994,charliebaron75,Surprised,9,3 June 2004,"Anybody expecting another kids film will be surprised. Everything has grown up. Hogwarts is no longer a fantasy castle but actually seems real. The 'kids' are young adults and the focus on 'childish' activities to appeal to a young audience has been replaced by something darker and more threatening.Despite some critical attack my opinion is that Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have risen to the challenge and their acting ability is far superior to that displayed in either Philosopher's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. While there are huge chunks cut out from book to screenplay, the film is remarkably faithful to the story. Most adjustments make the narrative flow smoother especially for people who haven't read the books. My only issue is the ending which leaves a lot of loose ends, but perhaps this is intentional to make more people read the book and find the answers there.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
995,romola-sanyal,better than the others,8,4 June 2004,"Not bad. Less childish. Though I have to admit I was waiting for more suspense in the movie. As an avid Harry Potter fan I was not disappointed with the movie per se but perhaps it could have been a little longer. That would have allowed those who are unfamiliar with the books to be less confused. I've spent almost all day explaining parts to friends who have never read harry potter. That was too bad because in some ways it seemed the more important dialogues were discarded for more trivial ones. For example, why wasn't Black's situation explained better? Instead we had a part where Hermione and Draco are arguing near Hagrid's cottage. I would have rather seen the former as possibly would have others. Then again, its not easy to capture the intricacy of such long and complex storytelling in a movie. It makes one wonder what they would do with part 4?

Even to fans who have not read the books, the change in the geography of Hogwarts and how the characters dress are easily recognized as a break in continuity.The screenplay is chunked and leaves many important pieces to the overall storyline unexplained.

997,sqwerty,In very few aspects was it poorly-done... Overall it was wonderful!,8,5 June 2004,"Overall this was a good movie, it was much better than the other two. Alfonso Cuaron did an excellent job. The movie included a lot more humor and the actors have greatly improved their performances. It's quite a bit more realistic and convincing. Compliments to the young actors and actresses.Quite a fast-paced movie.I would like to say, however, the casting was not ideal. Gary Oldman, though renowned as an actor and did an extremely convincing job, was not quite correct for the character of Sirius Black. Similarly, David Thewlis was not correct for Remus Lupin.([WARNING OF SPOILERS])I am also disappointed in the fact that the Marauders were hardly mentioned at all. It didn't explain how the Marauders were James' friends and how they fit into the story. Also it didn't explain how Lupin knew the Marauder's Map was a map and why Snape hates them (Harry, Sirius, Lupin, and the others). The movie also didn't explain that Lupin was the one who was ""Haunting"" the Shrieking Shack, and how Snape was the one who had ""accidentally let slip"" Lupin's condition at the end of the year.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

As humans we all have faults - the director and screen writer are human in the fact that they did not follow this book. Why is so important to follow it? Because it is bloody good! All of the suspense and emotion was taken out (for the most part) I would think that viewers who have not read the books would be confused at times. Curon says that the left out parts will be incorporated into another movie - but with what time? Books 4 and 5 are both longer than book 3 - so how the heck could they fit those missing parts into one of the other books? Plus there was a lot of wasted time on artsy poses and things that were not in the book- so why add it if they wanted to make it short and sweet?aside from the missing pieces of the book - I did love the movie!Molly",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
999,brother__d,Not impressed,2,13 June 2004,"I must say that the third Harry Potter movie was greatly disappointing. However, I won't write a lengthy review pointing out how the changes from the book detracted from the film, as I'm sure this has been pointed out (I agree btw). Anyhow, I couldn't help feeling that this film seemed somewhat disjointed, or choppy--The story line did not flow from beginning to end as it did in the first two films. I can't help but blame this on a poor screenplay and the new director's inability. The entire film just seemed a bit cheesy and poorly planned out. I assumed that reading the books and expecting a faithful adaptation caused my dislike for this film; however, my brother who has not read the novels felt similarly (actually he rated the movie worse than I). All in all, I felt the first two Harry Potter films were quite good; whereas, the third is simply AVERAGE (at best).",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The acting is very good but is a different style to the other two films and takes a while to get used to.Some parts of the story can be a bit slow but the main part of the story is very well made and the special effects are brilliant. the story always has you on the edge of your seat and some scenes may be frightening for younger children -definatly worth seeing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1001,kabeyun,Not that great,4,7 January 2006,"My wife & I REALLY wanted to like this movie. We really did. We tried as open-mindedly as possible. We finally managed to stay awake for the entire run on our fourth try. The plot is vague, the pace is slow, and the film wanders about in a floundering sort of way. Characters are thrown in at the last minute (eg: Peter Pettigrew) who are immensely important to Harry Potter's life, but about whom the movie manages to make us care just about zero. ""Azkaban"" touches on much but delves into little, including feeble and fleeting flirtations with Hermioine's maturing sense of sexuality (Who's hand is she holding now? Is that HIS neck she's hugging? Why is she wearing that undersized sweatshirt instead of the Hogwarts robe?).The truth is the movie does have some fairish moments. The special effects are fine, especially the bit with the hippogriff, but not exactly breathtaking. Some plot developments are never really explained and, worse, some are utterly unnecessary (to wit a certain professor's alter ego). ""Azkaban"" is unfortunately too sluggish, uninteresting, and globally incoherent to be much fun. We'll probably see ""Goblet of Fire"" but not because of this regrettably forgettable movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1002,actmeister,Best Potter yet.Comes closest to the feeling of the books.,9,7 June 2004,"Chris Columbus was roundly castigated for his ""slavish"" adherence to the J.K. Rowling books when he directed the first two films. Ironically, Alfonso Curon's very different approach has yielded a film that gives a better sense of the spirit of the books. The Columbus films had a slow pace and a lot of annoying little continuity errors. Half the time there were lenses in Harry's glasses, the other half not, etc. And he simply spent too much time on the wrong things. His direction of the child leads appeared to be about getting a look or expression rather than helping these talented youngsters fully realize their potential.Curon has gone the other way with the same cast and what they have achieved together is real and immediate. He has also found the heart and humor of the Rowling books and translated that to the screen. This is a fast paced delightful film that is alternately dark and funny, just like the books.If you love the books but were a bit disappointed by the first two films this may be the Potter film you've been waiting for.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1003,MauraMellon,"Creative, Charming, and Clever",7,5 June 2004,"Alfonso Cuaron has made a film worthy of the title ""Harry Potter."" Allow me to say: it's about time! After Columbus' slow and obtuse movies, Cuaron's creativity and movement seems like a work of genius. The photography, camera work, set design, acting, and writing are all far superior to that of the first two films. Cuaron has changed the layout of Hogwarts, yes, but changed it for the better, giving character to the landscape with lakes and mountains, changing the castle and interior for a more distinct look. One of my favorite touches is the dormitory, made much cozier and zanier by crooked bunk beds. Columbus' Hogwarts looks like a coloring book; Cuaron's looks like the pet project of a rather batty architect. The director and crew took some artistic license, which, in my opinion, is all for the best. The Knight Bus performs a great stunt, squeezing itself between two Muggle buses; the Leaky Cauldron has crooked hallways and ancient hardwood chambers; Hogsmeade is beautiful in the snow. Talking heads and candy that lets you make animal sounds add to the fun.None of Columbus' dull heavy-handedness is evident here. Instead, the audience must be prepared for hints and subtleties. Cuaron shows the changing of the seasons with the drop of a leaf of the bloom of a flower. The nature of an Animagus is revealed off-handedly during a Defence Against the Dark Arts class. From this bit of information, the audience must put together the pieces and understand why Sirius and Pettigrew can transform into a dog and a rat, respectively. Similarly, you have to catch Ron's constant complaints about Hermione's sudden appearances in class to understand later how she has been using the time turner. It's an active experience; we have to pay attention to get it. Cuaron gives is facts; we have to connect the dots. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have all improved visibly. Once again, the direction helps. Scenes juxtaposing the Dursley's at the table with Harry slaving in the kitchen give a better sense of his emotions than simply training the camera on his face. Radcliffe proves himself in a shot where he listens to Professor Lupin talk about his parents. Since Harry and Lupin are not facing each other, Harry lets his emotions play over his face, and we as the audience can witness them. Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic, especially Thewlis, who makes us feel for him even as he is transforming into a werewolf and attacking his friends. Oldman has the typical task of being an insane murderer one moment and an innocent, loving man the next, but pulls it off with his usual skill. The Prisoner of Azkaban also retains more humor. Aunt Marge inflating and floating into the sky is priceless. Trelawney is a blast. Clever additions such as Harry's accidental ""volunteering"" during Care of Magical Creatures elicit a giggle. The film is sharper, wittier, and more charming.The one criticism I could level is the shortness of the Shrieking Shack scene. The dialogue was too fast here, and Cuaron could have afforded to extend it by ten minutes or so. A mention of the identities of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would also have been good and not taken too much time. Overall, however, the film is such an improvement on the first two that this can be forgiven.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

After I saw the movie on Sunday, my hand was itching for the remote to press play and watch it again....it was that good! I've never had it happen with my hand before. My husband loved the movie too. He said that it's also his favourite out of the three. We are definitely going to buy the DVD as soon as the movie comes out.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1005,gawcdoyle,A second rate film to a first rate book,1,8 January 2005,"This film is unfortunately disappointing in more then one way. Firstly everything in this film seems to be slightly rushed. it doesn't give you enough time for anything to sink in, although some people may like it to be fast paced this is still about a schoolboy; a schoolboy that goes to a school of witchcraft and wizards but still a schoolboy. many of the details which make the story so unique and interesting suffer because of this. For example the hatch in the ceiling to professor trelawney's class (i think the name is right) is no longer there with the ladder, just a boring door.. The fat lady's portrait being replaced with the annoying short knight is no longer there either. it doesn't even explain WHY the gryffindor students are sleeping in the great hall fully making it just seem plain random. The failed patronus spells don't come out as whisps of silvery smoke, they come out as what looks like a silvery disc. Sirius black just didn't seem right, the movement from fighting to deep emotional conversation cut from each other too quickly to be believable. You don't get to see harry's fascination in the firebolt or the fact that he stayed in diagon ally for 2 weeks. Regarding film fluidity carrying on from the first two films: Hagrid's house seems to have changed its position (perhaps magically, but it says nothing about this in the book) Michael gambon does not have the same wise misty voice as Richard Harris had in playing the part of albus dumbledore which detracts from his character greatly. And the order of a lot of things are messed upI suggest to anyone wanting a good adventure to read the book, not watch this film. It makes me very sad to say this is not a good movie, especially since i payed near enough £17 for the DVD to watch it - It doesn't tell enough of the story for new people, and it doesn't include enough of the important details for people that have already read the book. The film is jumpy with its scenes and does not allow you to take everything in.Perhaps what i imagined the images of the book to be formed better in my head then the film showed them. And for someone who would usually pay more to watch the film then read the book, that has to be saying something.I hope other people enjoy it better then i haven't.A sad disappointment with unnecessary changes from the book.It just doesn't do J.K. Rowling justice.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1006,ashfel,What spoiled it for me......,4,3 June 2004,"Well.. I went to see the movie yesterday. Being someone who has read and re-read the books several times (although I don't claim to be an obsessive), I have to say I left the cinema rather disappointed. It's not that I thought the movie itself as a whole was so bad.. but for this budget I didn't feel it made the grade. The quality of the shooting felt to me almost like a low budget British movie from the 1970's, where as the darkened tone of colours may have been effective in parts, it was overkill using it through the entire movie. Personally I LIKED the more colourful fantasy world feel Chris Columbus gave. As well this the movie seemed as though it cut so fast from scene to scene it felt almost as though Harry's school year was over in a few days!The Dementors seemed far too CGI based to be truly scary, and aren't they supposed to glide? I can't remember them flying in the book... Also, wasn't it supposed to be Cedric Diggory playing (seeker) against Harry in the Quidditch match featured in the film. If so then Cedric got struck by lightning? (It will be interesting to see if the same actor gets cast as Cedric)Michael Gambon I felt barely passed as Dumbledore, it's all very well wanting to put his own perspective into the character but personally I preferred Richard Harris' wise and regal portrayal as this gave the character a far greater sense of power. Although yes Gambon played up to the bumbling side of Dumbledore to good effect at times (which in truth Harris didn't do enough of), there wasn't enough of it to make me appreciate it.The fact that no mention was made as to how Lupin or Sirius knew what the Marauder's map did was also annoying (I can imagine for those who haven't read the books it would be yet another puzzling factor of the filmI also felt that Harry's mastering of the Patronus (over in two seconds) and the way the Patronus was portrayed (in terms of CGI) were poor, where was the galloping stag! Even when Harry shot the patronus across the lake, I felt as though there should have been more 'oomph' to it, but instead there was nice ambient light and twinkly flute music. The one thing that annoyed me most about the movie was the complete change of set from the previous two films. I don't mean to seem neurotic about it or anything, but I feel as though anyone watching the films in series on DVD or whatever years from now, will think it surely strange. Not only did the scenery change but it went from lovely English countryside to rugged highlands of Scotland. Although I read the first book before the movie came out. When I saw the first movie it kind of gave me an impression of how I at least thought JK Rowling must have wanted Hogwarts to look, and in this movie, I felt as though it was a completely different place. Not to mention the fact they seem to hang around that outdoor bit with the clock and the bridge all the time (and kids playing the flute?) which has never appeared before. Dawn French as the fat lady. Another cast change, don't get me wrong, I quite like Dawn French, but is it just me or does it seem like every British actor who is remotely any good or famous is trying to get in on this franchise. Rumours of Kate Winslet wanting the part as Fleur Delecour etc. Sigh.....Also, did anyone else also notice that Professor Flitwick was different, and, Crabbe, or is it Goyle... changed to a different boy half way through the film). Also, they pronounce animagus wrong, magus should be pronounced phonetically as may-jus? According to my dictionary anyway... In conclusion, the film wasn't bad, but it just didn't feel like Harry Potter to me, more like an episode of Grange Hill with magic. I thought the quality, style, and scene timing poor. There was not enough from great characters like Dumbledore, Hagrid, Malfoy and McGonagall. (Did anyone else also notice that Professor Flitwick was different, and, Crabbe, or is it Goyle... changed to a different boy half way through the film). The soundtrack was a bit poor, especially considering it was John Williams, the only good thing really was the choir and the revamped Harry Potter theme. I also felt strongly that the film relied too much on the fact that people need to have knowledge of the books to understand it properly. Credit to the actors though, Daniel Radcliffe was more expressive and more natural this time round - he still needs work though, hopefully he'll continue to get better.... Well... that's the end of my rant.. one other thing though.. how are they EVER going to fit GOF and OOTP into single films without making them basically mirages of 10 second scenes briefly outlining Harry's year......?! :(",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1007,provine2,Harry's third year at Hogwarts. He meets Sirius Black and finds him to be innocent.,9,16 July 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie with great special effects. Though they could have gone into better depth of his parents like they do in the book, but I'm sure they had a reason for timing for that. But otherwise, the actors and actresses were all wonderful as their characters. They did not over-act any parts and they did not under-act. I also think that they did a great job explaining everything, making it so if you didn't read or see the first two Harry Potters, then you could still understand the movie. The only bad thing I still think was the depth of the parents. So overall it was a great movie with great effects and great actors and actresses. I cannot wait for the next movie to come out!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1008,NarcissaM,This is what bugs me most (spoiler),1,6 June 2004,"And don't you dare tell me that if I wanted it to be like the book I should get an audio book - there are some things that shouldn't be changed!Sirius was supposed to be handsome! Or at least resemble a man once handsome! Lupin was supposed to be a cool teacher - and wear shabby robes, not ugly, crusty pants that my boyfriend's DAD wouldn't even wear!And I realize for time management they can't make things exact, but adding that blabbering head was just completely pointless. The scene was difficult enough to follow with the speed - you don't need that making things worse!Hermione is supposed to have flaws. ALL of the movies had made her too perfect - she takes all of Ron's lines making her a Mary Sue - and they turned Ron into a total coward. There's no need for that. For those who don't know - RON tells Sirius even with his broken leg that to get to Harry they'd have to kill him first. Ron saved Hermione from that Troll without her dictating to him how to use it from under the sink in the first movie - HE was the one that didn't freak out and lose it when that plant was strangling them and same for Chamber of Secrets Hermione had no idea what a MudBlood was. The girl needs to have a few imperfections and they may as well call it ""Hermione Grainger and her sidekick Harry and his cowardly sidekick Ron""Back to the current movie: It's titled the Prizoner of Azkaban.

1009,ronaldandlauren,Perfect for the Whole Family!,10,6 June 2004,"I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is ""darker"" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful.The three young actors in the Harry Potter series become more and more delightful with every movie. Their acting skills improve with age, and according to my pre-teen son and daughter, so does their ""hotness"" level. My husband and I, my four children and my own parents (ages ranging from 2 years to 51 years of age) all went to see this movie together. We all came out loving it and each of us had a favorite line or scene from the movie. There is something in it that each and every person can enjoy.While it can be a little frightening for the younger kids, and I wouldn't recommend it to parents whose young children are prone to nightmares, it is a fun and wonderful movie. The scenery of the English countryside is absolutely breathtaking and scenes with Harry and the Hippogriff flying across the landscape are amazing - you would swear that the creature is real!There were parts of the movie that were hilarious as well. There are also some cute moments between the group of friends and we start to see a young romance blossom. Overall, I think it touches all of the ranges of emotion, has some amazing actors and actresses, terrific special effects and beautiful scenery. Lovers of the Harry Potter book series will adore seeing the things they have imagined brought to live. Fans of the movies will find that this one is a bit different, but still wonderful, and hopefully it will inspire them to read the books!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1010,swannier,"rushed, and changed",1,5 June 2004,"I went to see this movie, with the knowledge that I had seen the first two and liked both of them. They weren't my favorites, but I did really like them. When I went to see this movie I was very disappointed. I felt like the director didn't stay true to the book the way Chris Columbus had. A lot of the main plot scenes, were either cut out, rushed, or completely changed.I know that there were at least two points in the movie where it would have taken just as much time to keep the plot the way it was supposed to be, as it did to change the plot. He also added a lot of things that weren't in the book, and added in the sense that they were good and did give you a chance to relax, but I felt like they were put in at the expense of the plot, and could have been taken out and instead given to a lot of the plot scenes that really needed the extra time. The actors did develop and gave better acting, but it was wasted on the lack of good videotaping or camera management, and mood music, which I noticed a lack of on more then one occasion. All in all, it was not worth seeing, and if you want to keep your good images, from the book, I suggest that you don't see it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1011,delybytje,Just perfect !,10,8 June 2004,"I just loved the movie, and i'm going to check him out a second time in the movies !It think it is just great that you see the actors like daniël and emma and rupert evolve like they evolve in the story. I am now reading the fourth story of harry potter 'the goblet of fire'. I think it's a movie that anyone must see, it doesn't mather whether you are old or something, just go and watch the movie ! Or buy, borrow it on DVD when he comes out in the videostore (I'm sure as hell going to buy it). But aren't there rumors going that daniël is going to leave the movie after the fourth is recorded ? they are saying he is becoming to old ?

1012,icantthinkofanid,Pretty disappointing and hard to follow,6,18 June 2004,"I was highly anticipating this film ever since ""Sorcerer's Stone"", but really feel that I have been let down. I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan, and I feel that Alfonso Cuaron has left out much of the detail found in the books and the first two movies. This movie felt as if you could never follow the story unless you have already read the books. And this movie doesn't seem to fall into place with the rest of the in-progress series.The most striking change from the first films to this one is probably the set. The school of young sorcerers, Hogwarts, looks absolutely nothing like it did before. The Great Hall has apparently shrunk, the Whomping Willow is now standing right there in the middle of the lawn, and a clock tower has emerged from the building that's pendulum can easily clip students trying to enter the village of Hogsmeade. Hagrid's Hut has moved about a mile downhill, and the Fat Lady has received a change of address and an extreme makeover. Basically Hogwarts is no longer the warm, cheery, magical, welcoming castle from before, but now not much more than a haunted mansion. While this dark forebodingness goes with the dark foreboding plot of the story, it really destroys the feel of the school.The plot is choppy, jumpy. There is only the inflation of Aunt Marge - a funny little scene, by the way - of the little skirmishes and annoyances of life with the Dursleys. There is absolutely no attention on Quidditch except for that one match, the one where the dementors knock Harry out. There is not much explanation about Hogsmeade, particularly the Shrieking Shack - although Hogsmeade, the candy store, is very well done. The appearance of the Patronus is questionable, and the stag, Prongs, Harry's Patronus and the form of his father, only appears once. And could we please explain the Marauder's Map and its creators?Characters? Well, the students are adolescents now, and it really shows in Harry and Hermione. (Punching Malfoy was, well, brilliant!) But Ron is just this little arachnophobic redhead freckle-face who makes about two jokes and has a talent for whimpering. The enmity between Harry and Co. against Malfoy and Co. is displayed only occasionally. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was a poor choice, and we don't hear any of his confusing magic lectures. (Which is a bad thing.) And Lupin's werewolf form just didn't look right. It's called a wereWOLF for a reason....Still, a nice stab at the Harry Potter Hollywoodization Project, although it could have been better. Can't argue with the soundtrack... it is John Williams, people. If you have kids who think they love or at least enjoyed the first movies, make absolutely no move to resist, although remind them that it could be disappointing. If you enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, sure, go if you'd like, but prepare to be disappointed. If you are on a strictly J.K. Rowling diet, obviously don't go. If you just wanna start the summer movies with this, then you might want to make a visit to your public library to prepare. Just don't complain if you don't and can't follow the story. Overall Rating: 6/10. Book-to-Movie Adaptation: 5/10. Casting: 7/10. Setting: 3/10. Plot: 6/10. Scripting: 5/10. Music: 10/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1013,esaf718,Funniest so far,8,24 May 2004,I saw this movie yesterday at a screening in Chicago. I thought there was more humor in this film than the other two. The characters are older and this makes them better actors. There are some new additions to the cast and they add a lot to the film. Harry's uncle is meaner then ever.The new director did a good job of being true to the book. The action focuses less on life at Hogwarts this time. I wish there was more Quidditch. The special effects were good. The end gets a little confusing because there is a lot of time travel. The movie is not too scary and it is probably appropriate for all school age children. I think people of all ages will enjoy this movie. I will probably see it again.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1014,chrispac68,"Good, but missing important points(POSSIBLE SPOILERS).",5,6 June 2004,"My best friend got me started on the Harry Potter books, and I've read every one. The first two movies seemed pretty true to the book, but I felt this one left out some pretty important things. I understand that for a book as long as this they have to slim things down a bit to put it on film, I felt they slimed down too much. In the book you really felt the closeness Harry felt toward Sirrus, and the relationship that Sirrus, Lupin & Peter had with his father, James. I didn't really feel a sense of either in the movie. As a matter of fact, all that was said in the movie was that they were friends of his parents. This book gave the reader an idea of how much Harry is like his father, the movie never does. My biggest pet peeve about this film though, is that at the end, when Harry does the spell to hold back the Dementors, they show the white stag, but never mention it. If the person watching didn't read the book they'll have no idea what that was or why it appeared. It was also never told why Sirrus, Peter, and James turned into animal forms or that James form was a white stag. Which is why Harry sees the stag during the spell. Over all, the movie was wonderful visually, but I was very disappointed in the story. I'm not too sure I'll go to see the next movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1015,Grich1159,"Enjoyable, though not entirely true to the book",8,31 May 2004,"Fairly enjoyable way of spending 2 hours if you enjoyed the first two films. However, this film deviates the most from the book it represents so if you are desperately expecting a re enactment of the book stay at home ! The acting is up to the usual standard, with the principles still believable as 13 year olds (a feat in itself) and the supporting cast are fine, though probably less on screen than the first two.. A time filler that probably wastes Gary Oldman and spends too much time on ""arty"" direction..a new director for number 4 is a relief, though Chris Columbus would have been fine. Despite these reservations an enjoyable film that will keep the harry potter dynasty alive and looking to number 4 next year..",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1016,tim-688,"Ignore the hype, it's not as good as The Chamber of Secrets",1,30 May 2004,"Possible Mild Spoilers . . .Warner Brothers and the new director seem to have messed up with this one. Don't believe the hype, it lacks depth and is just the usual 'CGI v Humanity' battle and the CGI boringly wins. If you like computer games you'll love it but if you like films with real characters of depth and soul then forget it. The previous 'Chamber of Secrets' was a really good film with just the right amount of CGI and humour (Dobbie!) with the characters developed substantially from the scene setting first film. Essentially, many of the well crafted layers of the second film have now gone ..The director has missed a real opportunity to look into the (much hyped)teenage angst of the main characters; there being very few facial close-ups or teenage flare-ups. He seems (director) to have just padded the whole thing out with CGI on a big scale which has in fact just diluted some amazing talent there ie. the eagle/horse hybrid and the hilarious ballooning aunt.The mid quarter of the film is very, very boring with a re-run of the first section by time travel! All alittle complex for kids and ultimately very unrewarding.I would give this film 5/10; first film (Philosophers Stone) 6/10 and the second [and best]film (Chamber of Secrets) 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1017,072adh,Horrible,1,4 June 2004,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The plot is relatively the same as the first two and puts you to sleep and the acting hasn't improved one bit, which is hard not to improve. The entire movie was horrible. I did not enjoy myself once sitting through it as it just drags on and on without an end. I felt like I was sitting through the first two all over again, it's the much alike in the story. The only part unique about this one than the other two was the cinematography/directing, which were both horrible. This movie was absolutely boring, although I didn't expect better coming from the books. Don't let your children see this mindless crap, it's awful.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The performances of the three leads were vastly improved and David Thewlis' turn as Lupin is a highlight. However, the real hero is Alfonso Cuaron who has created a mesmerizing movie which fully encapsulates the darkness of the Prisoner of Azkaban and is wonderfully shot!! The cinematography was spot on as Hogwarts and the surrounding countryside has never looked so beautiful. The Dementors are just as imagined and the cinema was full of fear everytime they appeared.

1019,Bubbaace9,Opinion about the movie,8,4 July 2004,"I thought this movie was a pretty good adaption of the book. It had even better graphics than the first two and you could see a more artistic taste to the directing. I thought that in some situations the movie didn't get descriptive enough and through off people who hadn't read the book. Things like not explaining who prongs, padfoot, wormtail and moony confused why they randomly were mentioned. Also when Harry received the Firebolt was a horrible timing and did not flow at all, it made more sense when he was giving it during the quidditch season. I think the movie should've also showed more quidditch scenes because they won the cup this year and there was quite a few chapters on it. I did enjoy the shrieking shack scene, it was very great portray from the book and it was cool to see it on film. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD so I can buy it. I also can't wait until the fourth movie comes out.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1020,may_iain,My review,10,31 May 2004,"This film marks what I hope to be a turning point in the books adaptation to film, although I should say that I find the first two books somewhat duller than the rest of the series so far.Its darker, a lot darker than the others, Cuaron has done a fantastic job in really bringing the world of the books to life. The Dementors are especially disturbing, you get a single flicker of their mouths, and it's the stuff of nightmares. I will only mention the special effects, as special.The photography is awesome, Seresin pulls off some true jaw dropping panoramas of the Scottish countryside, with close ups on par with his best in Angel Heart. Magic, rather refreshingly features everywhere, and you really get the impression that you have entered a world filled with it.Lupin is portrayed brilliantly by Thewlis, just as I imagined him from the books. Rickman is as amazing as we have all come to expect. Ratcliffe, Watson, and Grint are all light years better than they were in the previous films, we can only hope that these up and comings don't end up as typecast child stars, that would be a waste. Oldman, unfortunately does not really get a chance to emerge as a character due to what seems like heavy time constraints. I look forward to seeing what he does with Sirius in the Goblet of Fire.Which leads me into my only complaint of the film, its been heavily edited to fit into a time slot. This is annoying because you get the feeling that a lot more was filmed and cut out. Overall it just about gets away with some of the story changes, making some composite scenes work quite effectively. I am personally hoping for a directors cut in the near future, as the tapestry that Cuaron weaves is rich and vibrant. A big thumbs up, I don't understand why they are changing the director for the next film though...Oh, did anyone else spot Ian Brown (Stone Roses) stirring a bowl of pea soup magically in the Leaky Caldron :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1021,TheLazyBoy,Simply irresistible!,10,4 June 2004,"This version is very dark and the filming and directing certainly differs greatly from the previous films. I however find this just and evolutionary.The story, bookwise becomes darker every year/part and this movie has finally set the tone. The new cast members are magnificent and truly add to the whole atmosphere and world of Harry Potter. The original cast members have not lost their touch and have only improved. Particularly Emma Watson has been amazing this time round. Her character is so believable, you can just feel the teenage growth her character undergoes and the attitude and natural beauty she adds to Hermione is astonishing. As a dear reader of the books I must say that her casting has been phenomenal. This movie is a great leap forward in many ways and I recommend everyone young and old to see it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1022,ciphmovie,Great movie but could've even better. (Contains SPOILERS),9,17 June 2004,"Liked it ! It's delightful, almost beautiful... I finally watched the movie after days of reading all the reviews (good and bad) here and around. I was affected initially when others posted that some of the more important parts of the book were not included such as the Marauder's Map story, the significance of the stag and a more detailed Shrieking Shack scene. With lower expectations, I enjoyed the movie a lot. It could have been better, missing some of the best parts in the book, but it is a great movie nonetheless. The director is definitely talented in film-making. He does however need to give more respect to the book and its readers. Afterall, the Harry Potter movies would not have attracted as many viewers if not for the books.I do hope that the movie was longer because some parts that left an impression after reading the book were left out. Besides the explanation of the Marauder's Map which everyone is talking about, other parts are -1. Stag - Prongs rode again last night. It would have been great if the movie included Dumbledore or at least someone, explaining to Harry the Stag represents his father, who was gone but lives on always in his heart. The Patronas came from within him. Imagine Prongs returning back to Harry after chasing away the Dementors, gazing at his son and bowing its antlered head before vanishing. Harry did see his father, the reverse of the idea that he thought he saw his father but it was actually he himself who produced the Patronas. That would have been a poignant scene.2. The guilt Sirius felt because he persuaded James and Lily to change the Secret-Keeper to Pettigrew. He knew Voldermort would suspect him as the Secret-Keeper rather than the useless Pettigrew. 3. The Shrieking Shack myth, the Whomping Willow and the tunnel were all created for Lupin. 4. Snape's schoolboy grudge that overshadowed everything else, even sending an innocent man to death by the Dementors. Another way is perhaps to make a longer movie and edit it into an adult version and a children version. The adult version would be darker and more emotional aspects of the book included. The children version would include more vibrance, colours and more happy scenes, like winning the Quidditch Cup.At the end of it all, I'm glad my favourite book of the Harry Potter series so far was brought to life on screen and I truly enjoyed the experience.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1023,tillyhorn,Very good but feeling rushed,8,1 June 2004,"The best Harry Potter movie yet?! Arguably, no. I would say that this film is on par with the last two - all entertaining and magical films.I was a bit concerned that by having a new director the feel of the series would change for the worse. However, new director Cuaron has proved me wrong and made a sterling film. Granted a lot is missing from the book and explanations to why things are happening are rather lack-lustre or just missing altogether. Its quite easy to see where scenes have been enhanced from the book to make them all the more thrilling and I could spend ages moaning about which bits they missed and should have put in but the crew has done well to fit all the book into just over two and a half hours of film. I'm just glad it has been a while since I have read the book!Cuaron's take on the scenery in and around the castle we got to know so well in the first two films breathes new fresh air into the series and adds a bit more excitement to the film. There are new robes, the tables in the great hall for each house have been re-arranged and now to get to Hagrid's Hut you must cross a long wooden bridge. Michael Gambon replaced Richard Harris as Dumbledore perfectly and performances from Emma Thompson (Trelawney), David Thewlis (Lupin) and Gary Oldman (Black) were all very good. I also have to say that Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson appear much more confident in their roles this time round and turn out their best performances yet. My favourite parts are firstly the way there has been a bit more humour injected into the film; secondly, the way the night bus was portrayed; and last, the way they did my favourite chapter in the book, 'Hermione's Secret' because it turned out just as I had imagined!Overall, a very good film. Not quite how I imagined it, feels a bit too rushed in places but very entertaining none the less. 8/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1024,james-prior-1,So So,8,1 June 2004,"OK ! I had the pleasure of watching this at the Odeon in Leicester Square on the 31st, part of the reason I enjoyed the film was down to the excellent atmosphere created by so many fans in one place, and the sheer scale of this old theatre.I've read the books so many times, but wouldn't really call myself a potter nut, and found the film to be good, but not as good as I thought it could be. The acting is great at the whole atmosphere of the film is spot on, a lot darker than the previous two but it fits in with plot line perfectly. The bad points all stem from the sheer length of this book compared to the previous two. Where as they were fairly short books and therefore translated into scripts without loosing to much plot, obvious sacrifices had to be made to squeeze it all in. You really need to stop thinking ahead in this film, and don't assume you know what sort of dialogue or scene you are going to see next just because its that way in the book.A great film none the less, and heres hoping that the next film will be just as good .. who knows though, after all the books keep getting longer ..",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1025,Mysticeagle4,"Harry Potter 3, Great Movie",10,11 June 2004,"It was as I suspected a great movie, the camera man's fading in and out was a little strange, but good over all. The movie was wonderful, and Micheal Gambon as I suspected wasn't great at all, he was OK at best. That is probably why they gave him so few lines which was best for every one. I can't wait too buy it when it comes out to DVD. I wonder how many more movies they will have, but I will but and see all them in theaters. I hope the others keep getting better each one is better than the one before. People are worried because Daniel and rest of the cast are growing older, Daniel is taller than me supposedly and I'm 20 years old. I think it won't matter if they grow even more because they are great actors and actresses. Go see the movie if you haven't already. And I didn't spoil anything.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1026,bebopcowgirl26,The Best So Far...,9,2 June 2004,"It's most definitely the best one in the series of film adaptations so far. The humor throughout the film, makes the 2 hour and 19 minute running time fly by. It helps that the young actors, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, are all developing into very fine actors. The whole cast is wonderful and Alfonso Cuaron should be proud. He did a magnificent directing job. The film takes the heart of the novel and portrays it well on-screen. Though, die-hard Potter fans may notice some major scenes missing from the film that were in the book, they will not be disappointed by the film. From beginning to end, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a funny, suspenseful, enjoyable ride!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1027,Beckangel,Anything but That !,4,3 June 2004,"First of all, I apologize for my English, I'm a French girl so be kind..The Prisoner of Azkaban was a GREAT DECEPTION when I saw it.Yes, this tome is darker than the others, but I didn't really find the book's ""magical atmosphere"". Sure, the movie takes place in the magical world, but the little thing that would make the atmosphere similar to the book, that I found in the two first movies, is not here. It felt empty.There are several parallel stories in the book, the film follow one and when an element is needed which is part of another, it's put there, just for the spectator to understand the one story, and who does care with the chronological order ? I'm sorry, but I do !And did Lupin really have to chase Harry and Hermione for so long, when he has transformed ? He doesn't even see them in the book !! I agree that the book is too long to tell all the story in the film but where is the need to add that ? Why do not take those 5-6 minutes to, for example, take the time to explain the ""Fidelitas charm"" rather than ""Sirius knew where James & Lily were hiding and he went tell Voldemort""... for someone who have read the book, it's an infamy !I spend all the movie thinking ""no it's not like that"", and i heard a little girl besides me saying more than once ""but mum, it's not like that in the book""... I soo enjoyed the two others and this once was so different !!I hope the next ones will be more close to the books.... !!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1028,curseda1,Improvement From Prequels,8,3 June 2004,"In the book, Azkaban has been the best of the 5 series. So far it is too in screen. Alfonso Cuaron deserves the credit. The 3rd installment of the book as we know has been the longest compared to the 2 first and as we have also known they cut a lot of scenes to fit into the 150 mins screening. When still losing some touches, Azkaban has got the best cutting and replacing and modifying some scenes. I enjoy the superb visual effects especially when Harry riding on Buckbeak.When grown to become extremely hot, Radcliffe still needs a lot of polishing in his acting. Overall the movie deserves slightly higher than 7.5 so 8 comes close.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1029,cjurko,very disappointed,1,3 June 2004,"Being an avid reader of the books and an admirer of the last two adaptations I was obviously looking forward to this new release. And whilst I realize the genuine impossibility of a literal interpretation of the books events I have some genuine problems with the film. For one, the layout of Hogwarts changed entirely from that of the first two films. The Whomping Willow is in a completely different position, as is Hagrid's hut. Important explanations were also omitted such as the reasons for Lupin and Black transforming in to their animal forms and the relevance of the stag. The short ending also left a lot of things up in the air....including Harry!! Much of this is surely to do with the introduction of a new director. However, surely with the foreknowledge that all seven books will one day be made in to film then some continuity is needed. The film did have some saving graces. The Hippogriff was very good as were the dementors and Harry and Hermiones time travel sequence. Yet all in all I can not help but feel a little let down that such a classic novel has not been done justice.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1030,spartyinmd,Worst of the Three by far,3,4 June 2004,I will tell you....the third installment goes almost completely away from the book. I was flabbergasted to see the Alfonso was allowed to butcher JK's book as much as he did. It was really sad. As I don't want to ruin the movie for others I will not go into detail except to say that the movie strays from the book on several occasions. There was little to no flow for the first hour of the movie and it seemed like it was a mish mash of scenes just thrown together. All I can say is thank God Alfonso won't be directing any more of the movies. The saddest part is that the acting was so over done that it lacked the punch and the zest of the acting in the first two movies. Even Daniel seemed to be lacking his typical flow.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1031,danomax61585,How Bad can this get? 1/10,1,4 June 2004,"Where do i even start...this movie may be good for those that have not read the books. But this movie really needs to be redone. Does JK Rowling not care about her fans anymore how could she approve this movie... They cut out so much stuff, like you know Christmas....and lots of others things...if you have read the books you will hate this movie as a Harry Potter movie, it makes a good movie just not a harry potter movie, they need to get the old director back this one must not have read any of the harry potter books or was just so high on his horse he thought he could change every little detail and add pointless crap...if you liked harry potter especially the 3rd one which was my favorite book do not watch the movie...i have to re-read the book because the movie was so bad...actually go see it and then we should all write jk rowling a big letter about it i give the movie as a harry potter movie a 1/10 but as a movie a 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1032,WaldoDogwood,Absolutely brilliant.,10,4 June 2004,"I just got back from the 12:01am opening of HP: PoA in NYC, Times Square (June 4th). Now 3:44am :)This was a wonderful movie, and I say this without reservation as a big fan of the books. Of course there were many changes, but overall they carried the viewer through the many twists and turns with an exciting pace and lots of chuckles along the way. Emma (Hermione) was absolutely delightful. Rupert always steals the scenes. Daniel shone as usual, and of course Robbie, Maggie, and Alan along with Emma Thompson were absolutely fantastic. Much cleverness and many laughs. Thankfully it did not end in a triangle like ""Y Tu Mama, Tambien,"" ... of course that would have put an interesting spin on things ... I guess they are still a little young for that. As Umbridge would say, I have ""just the teensiest little"" criticism,about which I will not go into detail because I don't want to give any spoilers, but it has to do with the portrayal of the Quidditch match and the behavior of the dementors. Just a choice I don't quite understand. Alas, only Allah can make a perfect movie. Peace,Waldo",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1033,timlebon,The best so far ..,9,4 June 2004,"In my opinion the strongest of the books, definitely the best film. If the first two suffered from too literal translations into film, Azkaban brings a magic of its own to the screen - dark colours, Christmas card snow scenes - less quidditch! Some of the changes and additions are improvements - incidentally it means that you can't be sure what will happen next, even if you've read the book. A pity that the director isn't doing Goblet of Fire too - now that will be a challengeGreat performances, tremendous atmosphere - highly recommended.We took our whole family, from granny to 2 year old. All enjoyed it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1034,tne_williams,Film is the Knight Bus,6,4 June 2004,"I was disappointed with this film. Caught up in the Potter excitement, I stayed up to watch the 12:01 am premier, only to find that the whole feeling of the movie was like the Knight's Bus. That is - the movie moved swiftly, allowing for brief passing glimpses of the story, all in order to get to the destination (the scene with Sirius, Pettigrew, Lupin, et. al). While I think the visuals were MUCH better than the previous two, I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the novels could even begin to comprehend the story. I understand that Cuarón felt he didn't need to explain things as it was in the first two movies, I felt no connection with Lupin or Sirius, and felt that the other well established characters were caricatures, not developing individuals. This is not to say that the acting was bad. I think everyone did a fine job, there was just too much emphasis on hitting certain plot points along the way to the climax. My husband described it as picking certain pages from the book and throwing them on the screen, with no previous or following pages to help you understand the significance. Perhaps fewer individual scenes would have been appropriate in order to develop the storyline.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1035,crazysquid4cmu,book lovers vs. non-readers,9,4 June 2004,"For those who have read and love the book, they will understand everything in the movie (though will be mad about what is left out). For those of you who haven't read the book, you will probably be lost. There isn't a whole heck of a lot of explaining of events in the movie. My advice to non-readers: 1. Read the book!!! but if you don't have time 2. have someone give you a run down of the some of the details after you see it. Then, go read the book! All in all though, I loved it. The new director really took the series into a new direction and it was great. I liked the new sets and the new Dumbledore works out well and I have to say I like him better than Richard Harris. And, since when did the Weasley twins get HOT??",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1036,bob-1054,Scarier with lots of details,9,4 June 2004,"Much darker than two previous, I would keep small kids at home. The action is intense in spots and the dementors will probably scare lots of folks.There are a few liberties taken with the story line, but a surprising amount of material was included. If you haven't read the book, some of the info will definitely pass you by, but not to worry - just read the book!There is rich detail in the scenery. You get to see a lot more of the portal paintings, the inside of Hogwart's and the shops in Hogsmead. There are also many more outdoors shots, and the interior and exterior of the Dursley's home.You have to see (Professor) Snape in a dress!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

From the ""way too happy Dumbledore"" to the jumbled story line, I just have to ask: ""What was the director thinking?"" At this point, I am not sure that I care to even see another for fear that they do the same to the next movie...Just because the books get bigger, and darker, should they really make another sugar coated version of Harry Potter?????",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1038,BALovely,Simply Grand,10,4 June 2004,"I thought this movie was fantastic. It truly became an entity of its own in its ability to not rely on all of the events of the book so much and still be magical enough to be Harry Potter and convey the message that Azkaban portrayed. The direction was wonderful (I loved the added elements such as shrunken heads and hump-backed bell-boys), and I find that the imperfections of the before perfect setting of Hogwarts and the grounds around it a very nice addition to this movie. I feel that this movie was made more magical with the rocky hills and rickety overpasses. The teenage actors, as well as the older ones that have been in the other movies, did a much better job in this movie, I think that they now have the feel of their characters down. The new characters were casted wonderfully, and they also added to the magic of the movie. All in all, I simply loved it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1039,phturner,Disappointing Diversion from Author's Storyline & Detail,7,4 June 2004,"I am disappointed that it appears the humble but talented work of Chris Columbus in providing an accurate big screen rendition of J.K. Rawlings inspired writings has come to an abrupt end.Whether it is the lack of humility of the director or the languishing attention of the screen writer, author and producer due to assumed unlimited success, this film was a let down for my whole family.We have been incredibly impressed prior with the uncanny ability for the film team to render such gifted story telling, with so much vivid detail, onto a medium which leaves much less to our imagination but still succeeded to inspire a sense of magic. This new film's lack of consistency with it predecessors and written source seems to be a combination of introducing someone who thought their own creative view was more important than those of the author or the loyalty of the viewing public. More disturbing yet is that the new director for HP4 is said to be planning to follow the path of HP3... a second let down?With the potential of creating an unparalleled creative franchise, I think those with the most to lose financially should rethink their new strategy. Since it seems WB cares little for its image with regard to entertainment genius (as set forth in the first two movies and sent to a demise in the third) perhaps the public need rebel at the box office to send a message that we won't pay our due for those who deliver a lower quality product to cash in on momentum alone. You have an incredible opportunity to produce movie history and thrill millions  don't blow it!A saving grace for this movie is the acting of the traditional cast and the new comers, who, although more screen time needs to be devoted to dialog and less to the whomping willow scenery, did a great job of maintaining the story's attitude despite other short comings in direction.I do hope HP4 and follow-ons return to the masterful quality provided under Chris Columbus' direction and that follow-on films are not used as a method for directors to add block buster titles to their resume of film projects.If HP4 is delivered at the level of HP3... perhaps I'll wait for the rental...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1040,j41deep,This Movie is not worth the money,1,4 June 2004,"1. This movie is the worst of the three. 2. The director decided to create a whole new set for the movie....So Hogwarts changes between year two and year three. 3. The firebolt scene is so cheezy, what is he playing at, this is not some cheap B-rated crap he is filming in Mexico, this is a million dollar production, at least take some filmography classes or something. 4. The filming is horrible, completely like a home-video type thing. The camera was too close to the characters. 5. The director also americanized the movie too much....where are the uniforms....they do not go prancing about the school in casual wear. 6. Who gave the director permission to change such large chunks of the script. Skip some scenes, thats OK....but do not change the damn story. 7. The director also rushed the dialogue. These people are English...and when the English speak (properly that is) they speak slowly so it can be understood....not the rushing that he was telling his actors to do. 8. The Quidditch players do not have numbers on their robes. 9. There is no giant clock that you can look out of at hogwarts. 10. The shrieking shack is not a small castle. 11. The entire story-line has no depth...I don't think he (the director) read the series, he probably read only the third book, and that too he didn't understand half of it. 12. Oliver Wood and Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup is a huge factor in this book. 13. Peter Pettigrew is supposed to be shorter than Harry not taller than Sirius. 14. Padfoot is supposed to be bigger than the werewolf. 15. The dementors do not fly, they glide along the surface. 16. And since when do they suck out the life in turns....Their presence alone make it chilly, but the only time they come in contact is to perform the Kiss. 17. The list goes on and on...At least in the other two movies, Hogwarts did not look so small, and it was definitely better filmography....Also if anything was missing it was an entire scene....unlike this one where the story itself was changed....I think JK Rowling would have something to say if she was present during filming...Here's an idea, have her consult during filming, to check the authenticity of the movie....This one was CRAP - sack the Director, get a new screen-write. Another idea, get someone who has actually been to England, and has learnt their culture to be the director, If you can't find one....pick the best you can find, and station him there for a year before you start filming.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1041,sugarnspice568,Chris Columbus....Please Come Back!!,5,4 June 2004,"As many of the Harry Potter fans, I have waited years to have this movie produced. However I was greatly let down when I saw the movie today. The actors are wonderful and I still have much love for them. Daniel greatly reminded me of the Harry from the book, Emma's character had so much more depth and strength and Rupert was still able to put a smile on my face. However, I strongly believe that Alfonso has disappointed me in the outcome of this movie. The movie was rather choppy and unclear. Much of the main plot was changed from the original book, as well as many places from the original movies were randomly changed. It was a very poor adaptation of the movie. I do not blame the actors because they bring the books to life for me. I did not expect an exact copy of the book when I went to the movie, but I expected better. I was extremely disappointed...I believe that this movie would of greatly succeeded under Chris's directing hands. Chris...Please come back!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

However it would seem that the production staff have not given the actual book much notice.Sure they adhere to the storyline, however they miss out a lot of the most enjoyable aspects of the book. I was satisfied however as the aspects they did include made for a solid movie that was a great improvement on the first two.Rating: 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1043,ajp862004,Don't like the change of director,1,4 June 2004,"My opinion of the recently released Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is that the new director totally changed the mood and feeling of the Harry Potter series. Those of you who watched PoA and read the book saw many things cut out, I am aware that a lot had to be cut out for time reasons but in doing this many things were lost that were important in the storyline. An Example of this is how Heromine was able to attend all her classes this was shown briefly in two scene and could have easily been missed. Another thing that was troubling was why was the scenery of the movie changed. The grounds of Hogwarts were totally different than the first two movies.I believe that the change of director could have turned off many Harry Potter fans from the movies. As for myself I enjoyed the first two films and did not like the third.

However, having gone with others who had not read the book, a lot was left unexplained. I found myself explaining 1/2 the movie to them so they would understand. Otherwise, a true joy as always - My son and I look forward to the next one! There were spots that seemed slow and unconnected. But again, if you read the book those lapses disappeared. It was nice to the kids in ""street"" clothes , they seemed more real. It was also nice to see Hermonie show some true personality this time around. She is really coming out of her shell and showing her true colors. The humor in the movie was great too. It broke up the dark and sometimes depressing theme. I would love to know when the next book (book 6) will be out. I can't imagine how she could end with only 7 books. Hopefully she will see fit to continue on with this story.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The ending credits came in with a new detailed style I appreciate, even though everyone storms out like the plague as soon as the credits begin.

At least his movies resembled the books, which is why most people went to see the movies in the first place. I don't want some one elses interpretation, I want to see the story that I read and came to enjoy, come to life as in the first two movies. Spare me shots of leaves falling, birds flying into trees, and extended rides on the hippogriff. I'd rather see the second Quidditch match, see Hermione actually start losing her grip, and get the real explanation of how Sirius, Lupin, James Potter, and Wormtail's friendship.That's about all I have the stomach to talk about right now.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1047,jmcdswan,"Great acting, true to the book in spirit and detail.",10,4 June 2004,"It is such a thrill to see a fine book become a fine film -- more so in this than even in the previous two films in this series. The kids are becoming quality screen performers, and the adult actors are uniformly of high quality. The look and feel of the film are very true to the book, and yet it is clearly very cinematic, not literary, in plotting and style. Our whole family, all fans of the books, enjoyed it immensely.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman really captured the spirit of their characters, their relationship with Harry, and the sense of their relationship with Harry's parents. Emma Thompson is a delight as Professor Trelawney -- one hopes that all of these fine actors will still be available when their characters return in later films. Michael Gambon had some big shoes to fill as Albus Dumbledore, and (speaking as a true fan of the late Richard Harris) Gambon did an excellent job making Dumbledore his own while maintaining the continuity of the character from the previous films. As for Robbie Coltrane, he's a genius.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

If by any chance you are a ferret lover - don't even come close to the advertisement for Harry Potter 3. What you will see at some point is at least a dozen of dead ferrets hanging over from the Hagrid's shoulder, and Hermione feeding a Hipogriff with those. Amaizing!!! Ferrets are the third most popular pet in the world after dogs and cats. Why not showing about a dozen of dead cats bodies??? It's in a way a horror movie. I wouldn't even recommend to watch it with children. Especially if you have a pet ferret in your household. As for the story: unfortunately - there is none :((( So, if you havn't read the book in advance - you'd have no clue on what's going on on the screen.

1049,claflindan,"Harry Potter 3, The Magic is Gone",1,5 June 2004,"What a disappointment. The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best written, most intriguing story of all the Harry Potter books. It has a great plot with many twists. It is the story and the actors that carry this movie. The cinematography and effects can not compare to the first two movies. The colors are dull and the film has a look and feel of a movie that is 20 years old and has faded or has not kept up with the technology of the times. The new Hogwarts looks old and run down and the colorful, magical feel is completely gone. Most scenes seem washed out as if you were watching an old TV set that had very poor color. The actors are superb and Harry has lost that awkward pre teen look. He has matured and has a confidence that accurately reflects his growth in the book. With the great story and incredible actors, this could have been an all time classic. However with the poor job the new director did and the direction they took with the look of the movie,the Prisoner of Azkaban just okay. ""Just okay"" for such a great story and incredible actors should be considered a failure.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1050,realestpinoy,B+,8,5 June 2004,"How difficult is to transform a 435-page book into a truly brilliant 2 1/2 hour movie? In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the real conflict and problem in the movie is just this -- the adaptation could've been better. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed the movie now that a fresh and new director has taken the helm. It's an extremely visual feature that puts the entire series on a darker, more sinister path and saves it by giving it a completely different look, a change I found to be terrific and much better than the previous movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is brimming with pure delight and fascinating eye candy, and the presence of Alfonso Cuaron truly shines.First, let me address my only gripe about this movie. The story felt rushed and underdeveloped, and the only reason I understood it was because I had read the book. Your children may have a high degree of difficulty as the story sweeps past fast, but sometimes I felt this is just what the series of movies needed -- a faster pace. The first two dwelled on things I felt irrelevant or unnecessary, but this movie gets right to the very dark heart of things and becomes a more streamlined and thrilling movie. Overall, the adaptation was okay, but the movie needed to explain things a bit more and throughly explore the characters' situations; now I wonder how The Goblet of Fire will be like adapted *gulps*...The acting was alright, but somehow I felt Harry to be the weakest actor of all the three (he's still great and fits the part perfectly, of course). His scene when he found Sirius to be his parents' killers didn't affect me as I thought it would, and I found that to be one of the most critical scenes in the entire movie. Emma and Rupert are developing actors here too, but Daniel could use a bit more help if he wants to play this critical role to its full potential. The other shining performances I felt really proved terrific was Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Exactly as I imagined in the book...truly brilliant, and as for the new Dumbledore...some people are heavily disappointed because he's different, and his persona is not like the late Richard Harris, but he does a good job replacing him and proving himself to be a good Dumbledore; I still think Richard Harris did a better job.Yet the real reason why ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" proves to be the best in the acclaimed series is the excellent visuals. Alfonso Cuaron's vision is so much more creative than that of Chris Columbus, and paired with some breathtaking special effects and sweeping camera angles the movie has taken on a darker feel that spectacularly delivered. I really like the way he uses the environment to add to the scene and putting the characters and setting in a way as to encourage a certain feeling. It's beautifully dark. I wish he could direct another Potter film because he captures what I believe the Harry Potter series embodies -- darkness (not that darkness is everything in Harry Potter, but I find it more interesting.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is great, but not perfect; small flaws in the pacing and action that outshine the story hinder it, but the visuals save it.

1051,k2-11,A completely disappointing film.,7,5 June 2004,"This film style was a turn for the worse in Harry Potter. The filmquality was grainy. It looked like it was shot in the 80's.Taken as a whole it seems to miss the key concepts of the Harry Potterbooks. The books are a coming of age story. They are aboutfriendships. Somehow the movie completely forgot to develop thefriendships at all. The plot felt disjointed. There was no flow to the movie. It was likejumping around the book and reading a paragraph here and a paragraphthere but the dot's didn't connect. By comparison to the previous two HP films, this one strayed from beinga mystery suspense novel and instead was a 2 hour and 15 minute versionof the last 2 minutes of a Scooby Doo episode. Thoroughly disappointed. Bring back Columbus.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1052,kibby1321,Very disappointed -,8,5 June 2004,"I'm glad that I'm not the only one who was disappointed by this film. I would love to know what the director was ""going for"". The story wasn't just muddled OMG that's an understatement. Any Harry Potter fan is sure to be very disappointed. There were very necessary bits of information left out of this film. What about the relationship with sirius and Harry's parents ?What about the creators of the Marauders map and what their relationship was and wouldn't that have explained the stag? Why everyone was an animingus? Why the whomping willow was planted and the shrieking shack? About why Sirius hated Peter Pettigrew, Snape hated Sirius? They didn't even mention the reason Sirius all the sudden broke out of jail. Wouldn't it have played better with a flashback to the incident that sent him to azkaban, the muggles blowing up and then when there was the confrontation at the end showing how it really happened? I was very disappointed and I can not see how this is going to tie in to the next movie - this is where all the connections should have been made - how is anyone going to understand why pettigrew is helping Voldemort? Not even that relationship was touched on. These movies are for Harry Potter fans who absolutely love the stories written by JK Rowling - this movie, unlike the first two - do not represent that story at all. They moved the Cabin and the whomping willow from the school without explanation - and what, they didn't think anyone would notice? I wish they could re-do the whole thing, new director or not I don't care this one wasn't worth the ticket.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1053,ahunt-3,"At last, a Harry Potter movie",8,5 June 2004,"I have to confess that when my three young sons insisted on taking me to the latest Harry Potter incarnation, I thought it would be a good opportunity to catch up on a bit of sleep. Having read the two previous books and endured the subsequent films, an afternoon of shopping would have even sounded more appealing. So imagine my surprise when I left the theatre having thoroughly enjoyed this most recent episode. Now I don't care that it didn't follow the book exactly, this was a movie. It had a decent script, developed the characters so that I actually cared about them and moved along at a pace that didn't have me reaching for a pillow. Sure there are flaws, Daniel Radcliffe will not win an Oscar and Michael Gambon, though good, did not have the same presence or charm of Richard Harris. However, it is rattling good entertainment and when the time comes for me to shell out £15 on the DVD, I shall do so with a bit more grace.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1054,md-40,Another great film in the series!,9,5 June 2004,"This was another fine adaptation of the Harry Potter books, and one could tell that a different director was at the helm. I came away wanting more though, because the action / story made the time go by so quickly. I thought there were a number of things that were left out of the film that will be important in the later films (in terms of the story). For example, there was no mention of the fact that the names from the Marauder's Map (Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prong) were Harry's Father and his friends. That is important because they picked on Severus Snape as a classmate, which explains why Snape treats Harry the way he does.Still, the film is great and I hope Warner Brothers will take a lesson from Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and consider filming the last three movies close together so we do not have to lose this cast as they grow.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1055,jennlor,I was so disappointed!!!,1,5 June 2004,I have seen all the TV reviews of Harry Potter and I was anxious to see the movie. Don't go. Save your money! It is the worst film of the three that have been released. The worst movie I have seen this year. It left so much of the book out. Some of the great scenes were left out. One scene ended and when the next scene started you were like...uh? It started off OK but went downhill from there. It contained none of the humor or interaction between the characters that makes the books so poplar. I was like so what..who cares what happens to these people in this film. It left me cold. The Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my favorite of all the Potter books and it was just ruined in the movie. I hope that the guy that wrote this screenplay and the guy that directed it will not be involved in the fourth movie.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1056,the90sboy,Fantastic!,10,5 June 2004,"I loved Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I thought it was by far the best out of all three so far. It was more faithful to the book, unlike the other two and much more ""mature"" is the best way to describe it. Harry and his friends are growing up, and it's getting much more serious than it was. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was clever, speedy, well-acted and truly, truly amazing! Well done Alfonso Cuáron! WELL DONE! I've noticed how much the acting has improved also - especially Emma Watson. She played an outstanding role. I'm looking forward to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the next director, who is new again, obviously has a big challenge to live up to. Let's see if it will be good! They've already begun filming and it's looking good. So, cross your fingers!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1057,mattsweetnam,The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great,10,5 June 2004,"I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good..There have been some posts that claim this movie is too dark, i would agree that it's not as ""zany"" as the first movie. But at this stage of the book series, the story gets darker. If you want Zany go watch an Adam Sandler movie. This was a very good portrayal of the book.Matt",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1058,richard-607,Very disappointing ... (think of 'Batman and Robin'),2,5 June 2004,"I went to see the film with five small children (ages 6 to 9) ... while they all quite enjoyed it, none of them enthused about it, which is pretty damning given the huge success of the first two films.My immediate impression at the start of the film was one of poor photography, with all the color knocked back. This was presumably intended to create a gloomy impression, but just made things look less realistic and, because the colour/lighting was the same throughout, any chance of using these to emphasis mood where appropriate was lost.Consistency of settings was poor, in that the settings around Hogwarts used in this film differ quite markedly from the first two films, and seem less faithful to the books. There appears to have been a failed attempt to create the sense of oppression (called for in the story) by making the settings shabby/grim rather than attempting to demonstrate it through the dialogue/acting.The acting generally was fine (I particularly liked professor Trelawny, but Sirius Black was also good, even if a more haggard appearance would have helped) ... but the actors were not given much of a script to work with, character and tension building conversations being omitted in favour of quick jumps between action sequences, leaving the audience uninvolved/unmoved by the special effects. This omission of psychological depth in the scripting in favour of action, to the point where the action becomes meaningless, is the reason that the awful 'Batman and Robin' film springs to mind. The attempts to show the psychology of the story were generally heavy handed and perfunctory and thus counterproductive. Some elements made no sense unless you had read the book (in which case they served as reminders to threads of the plot left out of the file), while others were actually wrong (eg. Harry seeing the Grim in the clouds) in that they created a different impression from that in the book.After the reviews I had read/heard, this film was very disappointing. The impression most reviews give is that the film is dark and scary, but the darkness is just in the photography, not the atmosphere, and the uninvolving nature of the script/production prevents even good special effects being at all scary ... the kids watched it pretty impassively ... no jumps or clenching of tightly held hands etc.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1059,candida-1,"Perfunctory, crude, and gimmicky",2,6 June 2004,"First things first: I took five kids to this. Aged from six to ten. I had been warned it might be too scary for the six year old. At the end they said ""so where are we going to eat?"". The six year old had barely jumped. This is Not Good. The rest of the audience looked the same. Distinctly underwhelmed. It works like this:* Right, we want it dark. Let's desaturate the colour. [Like everyone who's ever mucked about with Photoshop does on their first batch of pictures, and then grows out of it]* OK, we are going to make a big thing about time at the end. Let's have a HUGE clock with a big sweeping pendulum in the hall all the way through. [If you haven't got the point of the big sweeping pendulum by the third time you see it, you clearly have no central nervous system.]* Hey, the CGI people have done a pretty good job with Buckbeak. Let's expand that bit, and squeeze all the boring story and character interaction out so we can have time for some interesting running around in the forest with CGI monsters instead. [PLEASE can film makers stop being impressed with CGI for the sake of it? I know I have.""The special effects are great"" is almost a gold seal for a rubbish film these days.]* And while we're at the CGI let's make the Dementors fly around in the air, that'll make them more scary. [It doesn't. For a lesson in how to make things scary six inches off the ground, watch The Gentlemen episode of Buffy.]This really is the level of thinking on which this film operates. The script has been stripped down to the bare minimum to allow the events of the story to progress as fast as possible. This is fifteen minutes shorter than the others. Why?I don't mean stripped in comparison with the book, I mean in comparison with a script that is ABOUT something. This film is about... well, nothing very much. Nothing actually HAPPENS in this movie, events just follow one another breathlessly. Regardless of whether it starts as a screenplay of a book or just a screenplay, any film needs than mere events. This seemed to have been written in shorthand, because all depth of character, all psychological development, all tension and humour have been left somewhere on the cutting room floor, if they were ever in at all. Same scriptwriter, so I hope it was all there and cut and can be put back to a DVD version. PLEASE.... And nobody tell me there was spare, efficient storytelling and it was between the lines. It wasn't. It wasn't anywhere. ""So where are we going to eat?"" is not the reaction to a good story.And the setting! I can take that they change the castle, filmed things somewhere else (largely on a computer it seems) but they changed the whole tone of the place. Hogwarts WAS a generous building with rolling lawns, a very clearly thriving, well-kept, comfortable, rich institution with some fine mountains around it that could be rather bleak in wintry circumstances. Suddenly it is small, seems to have lost most of its pupils (are extras suddenly costing a lot more?) is permanently miserable and there are WEEDS growing in the TINY main courtyard. Visually, this is a minor, second- or third-rate school on its last legs, not the magical equivalent of Eton. Presumably this is just another clunky shortcut to a dark and threatening atmosphere, but it simply meant that you didn't feel anything good or worthwhile was being threatened: no contrast between the world Harry is supposed to love and the thing menacing it. I gave this a two, almost entirely for the actors, who are doing a brave job with material thinned to the point of non-existence, and couldn't know that they were all going to look so grey and ill in the finished item. I hear there's another director again for the fourth film. Good.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1060,omurthi,Alfonso Cuaron should be sacked for his slaughtering of HP&PoA,1,5 June 2004,"I just saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (HP&PoA) tonight. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.When I first heard that Alfonso Cuaron would be directing HP&PoA I was nervous because I was afraid he would damage the franchise by putting his own personal ""spin"" on the movie. Unfortunately, those fears were well-founded.Unlike the first 2 movies, the storyline for HP&PoA jumped around all over the place. Events did not occur in the proper order--example: Harry receiving his Firebolt at the very end of the movie/school year. Worst of all, Cuauron decided to add content to the film that wasn't in the book in the first place--example: the total re-write of how Peter Pettigrew's existence comes to light.Additionally, he did a terrible job of developing the story and plot and left out tons of important information and events, but decided to waste time (film) by including content not in the book (eating candies that make animal sounds, Malfoy passing flying notes, etc.).Also, what gives with making this the shortest movie of the HP series? Book 3 was longer than both books 1 & 2, yet they decided to cut back the time. Given the fact that a movie now costs $10/person, I would rather see a 3 hour movie that does justice to the book than see a shortened movie that does a hack job on the story. (sorry guys, the movie really suffered by how much you left out). I suspect HP&PoA will perform poorly in the theaters compared to the first 2 movies. I sincerely hope JK Rowling puts the Directors, Producers, and Writers feet to the fire and restores the magic for the 4th movie (here's an idea...FOLLOW THE STORY AS SHE ALREADY WROTE IT!!!). Otherwise, I think they should just terminate any future movies. Better to have no movies for books 5-7 than to have crappy ones that only disappoint loyal fans.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1061,pandjcain,Too much change and opportunities missed,6,6 June 2004,"I'm a great fan of the Potter series! Having said that ... I was disappointed in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie. Things were changed that added nothing significant to the movie. Example, McGonagall! She had such a small part, nothing about her clothing should have changed. Also the trek to Hagrid's cabin became a climbing adventure for no good reason. Energy was spent watching the scenery and distracting from the story. This movie was full of these unnecessary changes. So many opportunities were missed to promote continuity and join the series, not step off in a different direction. The actors did a fabulous job but the director missed opportunities again in not capturing proper emotion during a scene. Ex. Sirius and Harry! Harry is just realizing that his dream may be coming true to leave the Dursley's. He's found a family in Sirius! Sirius is thinking back to fond days with James and the more innocent days of teen year friendships. These are heavy emotions that are part of Rowling's story. The scene missed it! In a fast paced story line, the opportunity was gone. Subtlety and feeling is what brings magic to this story! This movie lost some of the magic!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The movie was chopped up, they left things out & add things that did not matter or was not in the book. they said that they would follow the book and they didn't. we did not like the movie at all it was poorly done but will buy the DVD, only because it is a set. Hope #4 is better. They will have to put some things form this movie in the next or you will not understand a thing. They have to work ever harder to make up for this mess.

There was no Harry Potter feel to it at all! Everything good from the first two movies was ruined in this ridicules excuse for a Harry Potter film! The lighting, the acting, and the sequences were all wrong. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for expressing liberties, but for a series like Harry Potter, the movie should follow the book as much as possible because the books are just so great! Chris Columbus did such a terrific job directing the first two movies, and I don't know why he resigned, but he needs to come back and direct the fourth one, or else, this series may very well be doomed...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1064,BellaMuerte13,Hey,8,13 June 2004,"The movie is very good. I gave it an 8, but if you haven't read the book there are going to be parts where you won't know what's happening because they cut out some of the main points to make sure that the movie didn't run too long. So my suggestion is to read the book first or if you've already seen it and haven't read the book read it now. And the fact that the books keep getting longer is going to be a problem when making the movies because they, everyone involved with the film, have to cut out a lot of stuff so that people will be able to sit through the whole movie. Otherwise, and again, it was a very good movie and I recommend that you see it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1065,tallsuse,Too Gloomy and Several Critical Aspects were missing,3,6 June 2004,"I am a huge HP fan, and I admit I am not his target audience. However, I just have to agree with the previous review about the lacking in this film. I understand that you have to make certain transitions or adjustments between a book and a film. However, there were MANY things about this movie that could have been much better.The film definitely had a much darker feel to it than previous HP films. I understand that the characters are older and the situations are darker than previous books. However, it was so dark, (especially the cinematography) that it just became a dreary movie. For example, any HP fan knows that Harry was very happy to stay at the Leaky Cauldron. However, the set was so morbid and ugly, it makes it difficult to believe he would really feel ""at home"" there. The same goes for the way Hogwarts appeared in this film. Harry always says he ""feels at home"" when he's at Hogwarts much more than with the Dursleys. Again, that was pretty hard to believe given how dark and cold and dreary all of the scenery was.Lastly, I think a few critical parts of the plot were left out of this movie. For example, it's pretty important to this and future books that Harry (and the audience) understand the relationship between Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs. NO explanation is given in this movie of who they are or what their history relevant to the map is. Also, although the stag was shown briefly at the end, explaining that he was actually Prongs was also missed. I can appreciate the intensive tone towards the end of the movie with the werewolf, but it isn't true that the werewolf would have tried to kill the black dog. According to the book, they were amicable as animagus(es). Other examples include...how did Snape find them in the shrieking shack? Why did Sirius bark at Harry back on Privet drive ? Lastly, the character development was lacking. It wasn't very believable that Draco Malfoy would go from total arrogance to a whining, sniveling wimp just because Hermione hit him with the wand. There are several other examples but I will stop with those.Overall, I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but I really hope the future releases will not have the same dreary, gloomy tone. Or if they do, they at least need more humor, better character development, and better explanation of critical aspects such as those mentioned above. Personally, I think adding 45-50 more minutes to the movie for the sake of better flow and development, would have been worth it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

All of the special effects looked sooo real that i actually thought that it was happening and it was real. i sound like I'm ten which I'm really not. it was very the same as the books. and it was very well directed out of ten i give it a ten so you should go out and see it right now!!!!,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Don't get me wrong, I liked some of it. But as a whole the movie sucked. It was like taking the book and slicing it into 1/4. The movie didn't explain enough and left out a lot of powerful, interesting scenes and information. Seriously, that was how long the movie seemed. Actually within the first three minutes I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I left angry. I can understand people saying that one must always expect things to be left out of the book when making a movie, why then stick in a whole bunch of slapstick instead of major plot points?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1068,dya24,PoA critique...,8,7 June 2004,"I felt that the acting was better in this film and Harry's character was a little more developed. Hermione's character was also great, but the movie did not fully capture her growth from the book. For instance, in the book Hermione is overextended with classes, is in a fight with Ron because of her cat Crookshanks, and alienates Harry because of the broom situation and his illegal visit to Hogsmeade (and getting caught by Malfoy and having to rush back only to be caught by Snape). My friend who watched the movie, but didn't read the book, asked what was wrong with Hermione when shestormed out of Divination class. It was confusing because she didn't understand what was going on internally with Hermione's character. Also Ron is hardly developed at all in the film. He's confined to a few one liners, but he it doesn't affect the overall story. I've read some other comments on the apparent holes in the plot line of Azkaban. One important plot twist is the revelation of why Snape can't stand Harry. It's very much related to Sirias Black, James Potter, and Lupin. This is not mentioned in the film, although it should come out in the last act. I think in the book, Lupin tells Harry about these details, or they are revealed in some other way. They may be more developed in the next film. The definite high point of this film was the ending. It was great! I loved the scenes when they went back in time. Harry and Hermione have a real connection and I truly felt the anguish of Harry's character knowing he couldn't change everything that happened although it might mean he could be with his Godfather. I wish the rest of the film could have been as poignant. Overall, great movie and I can't wait for the next one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1069,lee-elliott,Not as good as Harry Potter #1 and #2,5,7 June 2004,"I think Chris Columbus was a better director for the Potter series. The first two movies followed the books from start to finish and gave such background on everything that even if a viewer hadn't read the books, the plot could be easily followed. In watching Prisoner of Azkaban, I really felt if I had not read the books some things were not given as much weight, or were not totally understandable. For instance, the significance of Harry being able to conjure a stag! The book expressed what a powerful wizard Harry was to do that and he's only 13!In the movie, it just happened. Overall this 3rd movie was a little disappointing as compared with #1 and #2.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1070,scortia-1,Lacking that bit of magic and sanity,3,7 June 2004,"I was very disappointed by the changes in this movie. There was unneeded scenes of Hermoine achieving ""girl power"" as Draco gets beaten up... there's no ""magical"" feeling and all the wonderful music of the first two movies no longer exists... really lame jokes such as beating Ron's cast were scattered through out. everyone looks more ""hip"" with modern clothes. If anything, Potter has been dumbed down to standard pre-teen movie jokes. This was mostly the first half of the movie. The first half very much rushed the scenes of importance and jumped around so much that a non-reader would be totally confused. Instead of adding things that were unnecessary the huge plot of book three could have had more time to let each scene be presented. The Shrieking Shack scene was wonderful for the most part... the ""married couple"" line was exceptionally amusing. Oldman and Thewlis were superb... sadly Snape has little character in this movie at all. The ending on the Firebolt really destroyed the feeling of this being an ""epic"" sort of story... lack of closure. So, if anything I can rave about Sirius and Remus but otherwise, I found much of the movie ridiculous and unnecessary and lacking. 6/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1071,JohnnyDeppsGirl51,the best yet,10,12 June 2004,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best yet. The plot was amazing and all the humor in the movie made it even better. Alfonso Cuarón did a great job taking over as director. Daniel Radcliffe(Harry) is excellent as always as well as Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermoine). Unfortunetley for all you Malfoy lovers out there this will be his last movie I believe. =(The whole movie in entertaining and very twisted. You'll be guessing what happened the whole movie.

1072,knata23,Almost but not quite,9,7 June 2004,"I've seen the movie twice now. The second time was better because I knew what to expect. Overall, the movie was good. I thought some of the scenes were too short and valuable information was left out for the sake of time. This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense.If you hadn't read the book before hand, then I think you would have had a lot of questions. Such as, how did Prof. Lupin know about the map and how to use it. Because he was one of the people who wrote it. Something I feel should have been included. The kids acting has improved greatly.

There really is no continuity between this and the previous movies. Hogwarts is not the same as in the 1st two movies. The sets have changed and you don't feel like you have visited the school before. If you have read the book, you'll notice that nothing gets developed; characters,story lines,sub plots and the HP magic.The movie moves along in sort of a jerky and hollow fashion. The director could have added so many minor details without adding to the movie's length and made a great film.

The hippogriff was really well made, hagrid was taller, as tall as he should be (in the book), but that's about it. The movie was too fast, there were no transitions and it should've been much more longer, at least 3 hours. There was no Christmas, Halloween, nor any other scenes that would bring warmth to the movie. In general, it was much too dark and Hogwarts was too small from the interior. The 2 first movies were much better, because they had more magic in it, by that I mean that they were more enchanting to the eyes. Cuaron tried to do a horror movie, Harry potter is suppose to be wonderful, but the prisoner of Azkaban was not! It was a good movie, but only ordinary and it don't deserve to be in the top 250 best movies from IMDb, so an average of 7.9 is much too high for a movie like this.

I was very disappointed in the overall tone of the movie as well. The setting was completely different, Hogwarts looked gloomy and creepy.

Doesn't the director understand that wizards and witches don't wear muggle clothes?! they wear cloaks! everything about the movie was wrong. the three main actors did well for what poorly written script they had to deal with but snape and mcgonogal werent in it enough and the new dumbledore was a poor choice. i walked out of the theater thoroughly upset and disappointed! if you are a harry potter fan, save your time and money. i wish i had.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The big detailed picture and the amazing soundsystem made this the best Hollywood movie I have seen in the last 5 years.Cuarón had a good story to start with. I thought the screenplay was a good adaptation of it. I have not read the book, but the movie was tightly scripted, had a good pace, and enjoyable from beginning to end.Good directors are effective at evoking a sense of place, and I thought that Cuarón did this especially well. The sets were detailed and evocative, and the CGI was used well to make these mythical places (and creatures!) come alive. Too many Hollywood movies these days are piling in the CGI. Cuarón is an artist and he knows how to make a big impact with a little well used CGI.

Opening scene Harry is trying to cast a spell under his sheets (a spell that is not even in the books) but DARN in the books its HIGHLY illegal for wizards not of age to be casting spells outside school (let alone in a MUGGLE neighborhood). A huge change that I saw were FLYING dementors, in the books they just hover over the ground...in the movie he has them chasing him like airplanes...zooming all around. In the book they had to list the ways of telling a werewolf from a normal wolf...no where did I hear ""Long thin legs"", in the books a werewolf looks VERY much like a normal wolf (other then a few things like eyes and snout length). In the books there is only ONE time you will catch a wizard in muggle clothes...and thats when he is in a MUGGLE town. In the movie they almost NEVER wear cloaks or robes and thats after JK Rowling did a GREAT job telling us what each of these wizards normally wear. The first two movies followed the book great, it was like reading every other page. This movie was like a friend reading the third book and then a year later trying to tell you what happened.

The setting had a lot more depth to it and much more interest. The castle changes were interesting too. All of the characters have obtained a more advanced view on their roles and that pleased me. I am a bit disappointed how they have left out a few parts of the book which i felt were important, or at least very interesting in the film. Overall though i found the movie to be exciting and intriguing and i would suggest it to anyone that was willing to listen to me to go see it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1079,Poms01,Details left aside,8,10 June 2004,"This installment of the Harry Potter series had many highs and many lows. With the new director you could certainly sense a different feel for the movie. From the opening camera shot that wasn't as clean as the past two, to the beautiful camera angles throughout the movie, Harry Potter 3 had an independent film's artsy quality. The beautiful way in which it was shot aside, this movie was very rushed. I felt many of the important details were left aside and shouldn't have been. The lack of explanation of Lupin and Sirius was the most disappointing. Those of us who have read the books understand their importance, but those who watched this for the first time were left in the dark.There wasn't even the buildup in the movie about Sirius that the book gives its readers. And holes with the map and the fact that the names on it include Harry's father were awful. Now I did enjoy parts of it. The special effects continue to improve, as do the actors, but I feel the true story was lost with this new director. I look forward to a change in the position for the next one. Oh, and one last thing. The new Dumbeldore was insulting. You can't replace Richard Harris, but you can find someone who doesn't make a mockery of the role. Grade: An unfortunate C",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1080,robsxlt,Movie lacks the fantasy world of the book,1,10 June 2004,"My wife and I have read all of the books and own the first two movies on DVD. We recently went to see the Prisoner of Azkaban and were both greatly disappointed in what we saw. Granted you can't make a movie with every scene from the book but there were too many scenes left out that make you understand a little more about the characters. The softer, darker environment is not as inviting to the viewer as the first movies. It had a too real quality to it where this has always been a fantasy world. The Hogwarts grounds look nothing like what we saw in the first movies, which makes you feel they have changed locations and didn't tell anyone. This director did a terrible job with this movie and I hope they don't allow him to do another. My only suggestion is for them to hurry up and finish the movies before they have to change main actors because of them being too old. We can't wait for the next two books. But, what will we do when it's all over?",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1081,ca-forman,Disappointment,5,10 June 2004,"I was disappointed in this film for a few reasons. I think the choice of director was poor. His darker style didn't bother me but I think the performances he achieved from his cast were stilted in many cases.I was also not impressed with the actor chosen to play Dumbledore. While Michael Gambon appears to be a very good actor, he was not suitable for the role. His portrayal of Dumbledore was not refined enough. While Dumbledore has an excellent sense of humour, he is also extremely distinguished. Gambon tried to be too much the clown.Finally, I do not think the screenplay was very faithful to the book. I hope others will enjoy this installment of the series more than I did.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1082,geekyelfgirl,Best of the moves,9,18 June 2004,"The Harry Potter books used to be my favorites (until I discovered Tolkien), and like the books these movies can't hold a candle to the LOTR films. However, this was definitely a good film, the best so far. The Chamber of Secrets was my favorite in the series, but this movie is much more well done. Still, so many major details were omitted from the film, things that didn't necessarily confuse me, but disappointed me, especially more info on moony/wormtail/padfoot/prongs, because those names symbolize so much throughout the book (like Harry's stag patronus)and even more they are important in the fourth and fifth books too. Also,I thought Emma Thompson was awesome as Professor Trelawney (my favorite HP character), but was underused. The Quidditch Cup was a hilarious scene from the book, an extra 15 minutes or so wouldn't hurt the running time of this movie, so why not include it? Maybe I shouldn't, but I can't help but compare it to LOTR, which is unfair, but still. PJ's changes from the LOTR novels made relevant sense (except for the omission of Glorfindel) and didn't bother me but these HP changes are just too much. Also, in the books Hermione was mildly annoying yet amusing, but in the movie she was downright grating on my nerves. I wanted Malfoy to punch her instead. There was too much sexual innuendo as well...This is a good movie,very well done with nice scenery but I think you can appreciate it more if you HAVEN'T read the books, because then the omissions won't be as glaring and noticeable. Still, 8 out of 10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1083,jlizpeters,I thought it was disappointing but my friends enjoyed it,7,11 June 2004,"I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high for the film, but when I left the theater I was left with the ""that's it"" feeling in my stomach. I was so excited to go, I had been waiting for what seemed an eternity to see the third installment of Harry Potter and it just wasn't as good as it could have been. By far the third book is my favorite in the series but the movie cuts out a lot of the personal interaction of the characters (especially Ron and Hermione). The movie just feels like it's moving too fast. One of my friends with whom I saw the movie, had seen both of the other two movies but had not read the books, by the end of the movie he was actually asking us to explain what in the world had happened, he had got entirely lost. This begin said, This movie was be far not the worst movie that I've seen lately. Some of my other friends actually thought that it was really good (although they were disappointed that there was not more Quidditch). I did think that it had superb special effects (as always). I just think that I liked the directing of Christopher Columbus better. Apparently, the fourth movie is going to have still another director so I'm hoping that the it will be better. I'm not going to let this disappointment turn me off of Harry Potter I am eagerly awaiting the fourth film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1084,phishsihp,Really Bad...,1,11 July 2004,"I thought the movie was bad..especially the end. What the hell is Harry doing? Riding a broom, looking so happy. Childish really. I think the director rush it too much. I thought there is gonna be Pigwidgeon. Where is he anyway?? I think Alfonso did an OK job.. not an excellent one. The movie is all mess up. Most people that hasn't read the book will wonder like how did Prof. Lupin know how to open the Marauders Map, or, Who is Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs? Oh well, the movie has been made and I don't like it. I think the first two is better even though it is the introduction and has not have much things in it. The third one is suppose to be the ""WOW"" one.I just hope that the fourth movie will be better than this one. Just hoping...:S",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1085,steve-j-harrison,Very much a middle chapter,9,16 June 2004,"Azkaban is very much a middle chapter of a work in progress. It moves the Harry Potter story forward by introducing Sirius Black and filling in more of the back story. As a stand alone film though it has weaknesses summed up by Harry himself in the coda at the end of the film when he says that nothing that has happened has made very much difference. In the previous two films there was an identifiable bad guy who got his comeuppance, at least temporarily, giving the films a sense of closure. This chapter doesn't really close it just sets up the next film. As for the new director, Cuaron has made an excellent contribution to the Potterverse. The restraint of the CGI effects is a welcome relief after the heavy handed use of FX in the previous films. Let's hope Mike Newell continues in the same vein with Potter 4.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1086,imrye,Disappointed,6,14 June 2004,"This movie was not of what i expected. The character development was absent and many important parts of the plot were missing. The direction was taken to a new level. I understand the 3rd book was a little more intense and ""horror"" like, but the movie presented itself in a almost ""creepy"" way. Also, there was minimal transitions from the 2nd movie to the 3rd movie, and left little doors open for the next movie. It almost seemed like the series could of ended with the 3rd book. The replacement of dumbledore was disappointing as well. Although no one can live up to Richard Harris's role as the famous Headmaster, the new actor could have tried to fit the role. So i hope with the new direction of the 4th movie, it will be better.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1087,ttkreviews,"Continuity, What Continuity?",1,14 June 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban lacked CONTINUITY with the previous Harry Potter Movies. Taking the reigns from Chris Columbus was a huge task and unfortunately Alfonso Cuaron wasn't up to the task. The first thing that you will notice during is that the cinematography is quite different than the previous movies. I know that the third installment of J.K. Rowling's series was darker than the other two books but Alfonso Cuaron actually made the cinematography darker also. It reminded me of the SciFi movie ""Pitch Black.""Creative differences aside, the Prisoner of Azkaban also lacked the accuracy of the other movies. For example, in the first scene, Harry is reading his text under the sheets using his wand for illumination. Why isn't this a violation of the edict that underage wizards can't use magic outside Hogwarts? Harry's trip on the Knight bus was very good. Harry's arrival at the Leaky Cauldron and meeting with Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic wasn't bad but what happened to Harry's trips to Diagon Alley? It would have been nice to see Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor and Quality Quidditch Supplies and get introduced to the state-of-the-art racing broom, ""The Firebolt."" The Hogwarts Express coach was downsized so much that getting two people, even underage wizards, into the cramped seats seemed almost impossible. What I missed the most was the splendor of the Great Hall. In this movie, it was downplayed so much that it could have been just another room at the castle. It also took me a while to recognize tiny, white-haired Professor Flitwick because he was transformed into a choir conductor with a Prince Valiant haircut and black hair color. I could go on about the lack of continuity. Such as the relocation of the castle and grounds, change in the location of the Gryffindor common room entrance, A new Fat Lady, lack of any real Quidditch matches even though Quidditch played an important part in the book, and a pitiful whomping willow but you get the picture. One of the best scenes in the movie should have been Harry rescuing Sirius from the Dementors. We expect to see a blinding, silvery Stag that charges across the lake to save Sirius. What we get is a silvery image crossing what appears to be an inlet about the width of a small pond shot from a distance. Yes, the flying scenes with Harry and Buckbeak, the hippogriff were great but took too much scene time from the other significant story threads. Like the introduction of Cedric Diggory who will play an important role in The Goblet of Fire. Last but not least, Harry's Firebolt was introduced in the last scene and it looked like it was fitted with ""stirrups!""This was a very disappointing movie. Some critics say that the acting was greatly improved but as fans of Harry Potter I don't think we were expecting performances worthy of ""Citizen Kane"" or the ""Grapes of Wrath."" What we expected is a good fantasy adventure that kids and adults and see together that continues the story about a young wizard learning about his heritage and facing very difficult choices in life. The chain of continuity was badly damaged with this installment. Let's hope the Goblet of Fire can restore it.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1088,Drew7430,Harry Potter 3,10,15 June 2004,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie. The story line was great and the special effects were great as well, not just like the book but great still the same. I've seen it twice in the first week that it opened and still think it's a great movie. I don't understand all this stuff about people saying it's to scary for small kids and some of the content isn't for younger viewers. Watching the movie I didn't see anything that shouldn't have been there. I think people just ignore the fact that people in real life and characters in stories do grow up and change. That being said there still wasn't any offensive material in the movie or material that isn't fit for younger viewers. Sure there were events that were left out of the movie that were in the book but all and all it was a great movie and I recommend it for all to see. Another thing I liked was how from the first movie to the third you can see the actors who play the rolls get better and better. The casting for this movie couldn't have been better and I'm looking forward to the next and future installments that I hope continue to have the same actors playing the rolls!!!

If you didn't read the books, then it was a good movie. if you did read the book, then it was an insult to J. K. Rowling.I like the look of the Dementers though(creepy) and also thought the way that everything got cold when they went by was unique. I'm disappointed how quickly it went. Each scene had about three sentences. That's my point of view at least I thought they had a lot more improve and that brought the film a nice touch.I'm relieved we have a new director for gof. I'd give the film a 6/7 out of ten.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1090,mikkelholstthomsen,Almost there...,9,15 June 2004,"Well... For starters: I liked it very much. It has a kind of darkness to it we haven't seen in a Harry Potter movie before. The only reason i give a 9 instead of 10 is because you notice certain changes. Perhaps because there a new director... But you still use the first 15 min. to find the spirit of the film. I'm sorry that A. Cuarón does not hit the same stile as the first 2 Harry Potter films, but it is a fresh new angle and whether you like it or not IT WORKS. That said...

1091,laulalu,two thumbs up,10,15 June 2004,"I highly praise the job well done by the new director of the third installment of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Altho the plot stretched a bit thin at times, it is completely understandable considering the fact they only had 2 and a half hours to work with, given the length of the book. I have not read the 3rd book yet (in fact, I only bought the first book this past weekend) I did not feel lost at any point in this film. However, anyone watching this film without having either read the previous books or seen the previous movies will have a tougher time deciphering, but that's b/c this IS the third installment. (A friend of mine had that very problem.) I highly suggest that anyone slightly interested in Harry Potter go to see this film, b/c it is the best of the three.

It shows the characters out of Hogwarts uniform constantly. This is a good thing because it shows that they are real people but there is a limit.Some things aren't emphasised enough, for example, the amount of time Harry spent practising the spell which repeals the dementors. In the book he spends hours practising the spell but in the movie its like he does it once and the next time can do it 100 times more powerful. Another disappointing fact is the fact that Hogwarts, Hagrids Hut, the lake and dark forest have been shifted around and split up  this also separates the movie from the true Harry Potter theme.It is a good movie which shows another side the characters and a darker side to Hogwarts but is disappointing because of the separation in the movie to the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The actors and actress play very good, but the plot isn't look like same as the original story based on the book. Lot of dialogs and class events were hidden in this movie, so the result is the film looks shorter than its original story. I shall give 9 for actings, 8 for layer & background settings, and 4 for plot. I request that it is still OK to make 180 minutes runtime.

1094,SiriuslyMad,"A brave adaptation of HP3, but not enough depth.",4,17 June 2004,"I read somewhere that Cuaron did not read Harry Potter 3 before commencing work on the movie. I was therefore NOT expecting too much when I viewed the film on opening day. (Don't expect too much and you are often pleasantly surprised) Mostly, I was disappointed in the length, and depth. The length of the film is relatively short, BUT why? There is so much from the book that was left out, you always expect that. But surely the film could be longer to fit more in. I found myself staring at the screen credits searching for more (I never do that).It was intense, and that is great, but it seemed like Harry was only at school for 2 weeks. I've never produced a movie myself, but surely some more scene repetition could be used to give the sense of depth I felt it lacked.Great use of humor! (almost ""Python"" like) The fat lady even surpassed the book.The movie was predicted as being ""dark"". That it was, but not as I would have expected. I expected a dark mood, but was more taken by the dark (or bleary) scenes. It looked cold and uninviting. Hogwarts looked derelict and unimpressive. Quiddich reminded me of a home movie of a wet day at an air show. And dementors flying? Visually they were OK, but they were too sterile. They are supposed to be vile, but came across as shrouded ghosts.Essential characters were left out. No Cho, Cedric, Percy, or Woods. There are loads of scenes just not there, too many to mention. Some are vitally important (if not essential) to this story as well as to what is to come next.That aside, it is a tremendous story, and even though I only average 3-4 films per year, I will be going to see this one again.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Lousy camera work, choppy editing, poor color quality, etc. And was that supposed to be Hogwarts?! It looked nothing like the first 2 movies. I guess for GOF, the Whomping Willow will be in the middle of the lake and Hagrid's Hut will be on the roof of the castle.I had hoped to one day be able to watch all the HP movies in succession and feel like I was watching one big movie with 7 parts, but obviously that's never going to happen now.I can only hope that one day New Line and Peter Jackson will get to do the series, since they've shown themselves to be capable of bringing great books to the big screen.POA and GOF are probably my favorite books in the series. I know that Cuaron won't be directing GOF (thankfully), but I imagine that GOF will be even worse since there is no way it can be made into a single movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

However, if you haven't seen it yet then be warned, Alfonso Cuaron has completely reworked the set. Hagrid's hut is no longer across the lawn, as in the first 2 films and all of the books, but is halfway down a mountain. Michal Gambon is good as Dumbledore, and Professor Trelawny is brilliant, but Lupin is a disappointment.I know that its supposed to be darker, but Rowling makes it seem like that without the castle and it's surroundings sprouting legs and walking away. However, it is not the surroundings which makes this film, it's the story, and although some of the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing have been cut, it is a pretty good portrayal of the book. All the important stuff is there, and the film flows through wonderfully.Overall it is an amazing film, and although it should have been a bit longer (it's only on 2 hours 5 mins approx.), it will grip you from start to finish.

1098,messrmarauder1,I say... what?,2,21 June 2004,"Well, I watched the film last night. If I were to describe it in a word or perhaps two, they would be ""Scrappily Random"". Granted, the first may not be an actual word... but I think it fits the bill quite merrily.First of all, I'd like to say that the building, the Shrieking Shack was amazing. Although the tunnel leading up to it was a little high... if one read the books, one would know.Moving on...OK, where were the arguments with Ron and Hermione? Yes, there was a few but come on! And the fact that all three of them, Harry, Hermione and Ron all promised to aid Hagrid in the appeal for Buckbeat... that was cut out.Harry's Firebolt wasn't delivered until the end of the film, and when it WAS delivered, it was without the letter! Just a bloody feather!Quidditch wasn't a major area either, and when Padfoot came to watch Harry's game (well, in the book he did), I'd kind of imagined him actually there, stood by the stands, watching... So why was he portrayed as a bloody cloud!That reminds me! The Dementors. Good lord what happened to them? I think one of the Ringwraiths from 'Lord of the Rings' would make a better Dementor than the actual Dementors of the film. And in what reality did Dementor's fly? I was under the distinct impression that they glide not far from the ground... not fly hundreds of feet in the air. From one computer generated disaster to another... What in the nine rings of hell happened with Moony? I was expecting something... something that had actually fur... and I see an anorexic Alsatian that's had all its fur shaved and that has developed the amazing ability to stand on its hind legs. The only thing remotely good about that ""thing"", was it's bloody HOWL!Talking of my second favourite character, why did he step in front of Mr Potter in the DADA class? ""Because I was afraid it might turn into Voldemort."" THE DEMENTOR WAS ALREADY Visible!!!!One more thing, at the beginning of the film... Harry was doing a Lumos spell. WHY was he doing a spell? Did his uncle not mention not 15 minutes after that particular scene that he wasn't allowed to do magic out of school!-groans-I don't know whether or not to curse the director, or curse JK Rowling for allowing it to happen.Please, anyone, someone please don't let the next directed screw up Goblet of Fire.

The very first time I saw it, there were things I missed from the book, of course, but these had faded into insignificance by the time I saw it the second time, the next day, and I could appreciate this movie for the truly artistic piece of work that it is. The hallmark of a great movie, for me, is it's ability to encapture me no matter how many times I see it, and this movie does exactly that. Director Alphonso Curan has completely captured the spirit of the books without necessarily replicating every little detail. The only disappointment that carried over past my first viewing was that the Marauder's Map and the significance of who wrote it was left unexplained for those who have not read the books (like my father).

This third film starts to show us how, and to book fans it's a little painful to watch.The greatly speeded-up pace of the movie resulted in a choppiness that is almost comic book like. If you haven't seen the first two films or read the books, you haven't got enough time or information to figure out the depths of the movie's main characters.Obviously the book had to be shortened for the film, but there were simple things unnecessarily changed in the film that would have worked just fine in its original form. It was merely puzzling not entertaining.The actor who played Lupin simply did not fit the sensitive character of the book. This is probably the last film of the series I'll see.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1102,kurnikis,Amazing!,10,24 June 2004,"This is by far the best Harry Potter yet. Alfonso Cuaron has an amazing vision. The screenplay writing is ten times better than the previous 2 films. They left out much of the book but kept in what was central to the plot. Visually, the film flows & Cuaron does a great job of keeping the story moving along without skipping a beat. The acting has only gotten better among Radcliffe(Harry Potter), Watson (Hermione Granger), & Grint(Ron Weasley). Grint has shown that he can be a real comic relief (the spider dream moment makes me laugh just thinking about it.) Watson is really coming into her own as the brainy girl who just keeps getting prettier. And Radcliffe....not only has he gotten incredibly adorable (he has total heart-throb capabilities), but he's really starting to shine as the lovable orphan destined to save the magical world from Lord Voldemort. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black & David Thewlis gives a flawless performance as the Dark Arts teacher with a werewolf's curse. Emma Thompson pops in and is brilliant as Professor Trelawny (exactly as I pictured her!) The cast of teachers (Rickman, Smith, Bradley, & Coltrane)is always great. I wish there was more of them but there will be plenty to see of them as the movies progress. Micheal Gambon takes the reins as Dumbledore. There is a slight loss of presence & warmth that was once there with the beloved Richard Harris. But Gambon brings his own ""magic"" touch to the role that I'm sure will grow with each film. Over all, I LOVED IT! The film is hilarious although darker than the first 2. This movie has definitely lost it's cheesy Disney-like quality & embraced the fact that it's a whole darker realm of mysticism & magic. I cannot wait for the 4th one. I only hope that Cuaron will come back for 5.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I thought they producers did a really great job but they kind of rushed the movie. It could have been better if they slowed down abit and made the movie longer. But other than that i thought the movie was really well. I also noticed that the actors have gotten better at acting and i thought that made the movie better than the rest.

I was kind of upset that they didn't show more of the friendship of James, Sirius, Professor Lupin, and Peter and why it was so horrible that Harry's parents were betrayed. Also they didn't explain that map more. If I just watched the movie without reading the book I would been confused how Professor Lupin knew how to use it. Other wise the movie was amazing.

1106,soccersweetie576,The best of the Harry Potter films so far.,8,4 July 2005,"I thought this was the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Quite possibly because I couldn't remember the little details in the book, and it had been years since I read it. The first two movies, although good, didn't seem quite like what I pictured. Because I had little preconceptions, I liked it more overall. I thought it was very easy to follow, and a cute movie. It's nice seeing the main actors older, and acting more like teenagers. Their non-uniform attire also makes it better, in my opinion. The effects were good, and beautiful backgrounds only added. Some construe it as darker than the others, and perhaps it is, but only a little. The characters are growing older, after all. It was a good movie, I really liked it, and I can't wait for the next one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1107,zsteinbuhler,10 out of 10,10,2 July 2004,"This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It was one-hundred percent better than the first two. The only down was that the same Dumbledore wasn't there. You can tell. I wish Professor McGonagoll was in it more. She was only in a few sections of the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. There is a few intense parts of the movie that might scare little children. Professor Trawlorny was excellent. I just love here. I saw the movie three times and it was better and better each time. I can't wait till it comes out on video, so I can watch it over and over again. I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie. Again I give It a ten out of ten. Harry Potter Rocks Like Crazy!!!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1108,jos_t888,Brilliant,10,3 July 2004,"Harry Potter series has always been kind of solemn, not much jokes in the whole story. This time, it's different. With Alfonso Cuarón, it has a sense of comedy. There are also some touching part in the movie. You will be excited, amused and impressed. Ron and Malfoy become comedian this time. They are hilarious! I'm so glad that I've watched this movie in cinema, not at home(as I always do). It's really upsetting that Alfonso Cuarón is not going to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He made the movie complete, with a sense of humor. Maybe it's due to the work of the Steven Kloves, I don't know. Anyway, it's brilliant. 10/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1109,JShado_1,Best film of the three so far!,10,3 January 2005,"POA was by far the best of the three Harry Potter films. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have gained more confidence in their abilities. They have become more and more like the characters they play in their own life which has shown in the films.Besides the acting, the film was better shoot than the previous two: In the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the parts picked were sometimes less important than the parts left out. A great deal of the stuff from the books was cut in the other two movies, but this was not the case in this one: It appeared that there were only two scenes out of order from which they happened in the books; Harry receiving the Firebolt (at the end of the film, but early in the book,) and Harry's Patronus (supposed to be a Stag, galloping down the Dementors, but was a dome-shaped shield in film.) Other than those two inconsistencies with the books, the film was virtually flawless; the CG improved a great deal; the Dementors had nearly the same affect as they did in the books  to the reader/viewer.To most fans, the best part of the movie was by far was the scene where Hermione socked Draco in the nose (another very slight deviation from the books, but perfectly acceptable!)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1110,the_tangent,Past Pitiful Performance Repeated,1,6 July 2004,"In one word, the first two installments of the HP series sucked. In two words, they EXTREMELY sucked. And that's not an understatement. I lost faith in the movies being as great as the books.Now that they got a new director, Cuaron, I thought, hey, he might make it better. So I watched it.10 minutes into the movie I thought ""Past performance repeated"". 20 minutes into the movie I popped up my CD Player and listened to music instead.The acting is VERY bad. And, excuse me fangirls, but Daniel Radcliffe does not know how to act. The best thing that happened to Harry Potter is Rupert Grint.Its not as even as funny as the book. They made all the funny parts extremely lame. The funniest part was at the beginning with the Dursleys. The rest was tedious.However, I congratulate Cuaron on 2 things: 1- He stuck to the story brilliantly. 2- He managed to make the movie darker and more mature.Overall VERY bad movie even if you're a fan. Don't know why it stays as #1.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1111,paintballer24261,"RATED 7.7? How is this Possible, These movies are horrible!",6,16 July 2004,"Like so many others I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. It is a totally different story when it comes to the movies. For example I've never seen worse acting in a series of movies before. Yeah I can understand that it is hard to find good 12-year-old actors, but I want to puke every time I see Daniel Radcliffe try and throw out a punch line. In the first two films it was a treat to see one real actor in Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but their replacement is a different story. Maybe I am being too hard on these sad movies because the books were so good, but could they have done no better? Maybe they couldn't afford any better, I mean how much has the three films grossed? Only 2.5 Billion? (Joking) I give this movie a generous 6.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1112,mhschlager,First inspired Harry Potter movie,9,18 July 2004,"We all enjoyed the books, right? Are they exclusively children's books? NO. The first two Harry Potter movies are simplistic, uninspired, bland, yet enjoyable adaptations of the books, and they are evidently aimed squarely at kids, in this they differ from their counterparts. Enter The Prisoner of Azkaban, the first really creative movie of the lot. Child or adult, the movie can be enjoyed either way. The new director's hand really shows, even the CGI is excellent (which in the former movies showed rather fake); couple that with excellent photography, great pacing, fantastic acting, a solid plot, and you've got the entry of Harry Potter into the selective realm of good books turning out as good movies.I simply cannot understand why someone would think it boring or some of the other comments I've read here. It is an excellent effort in execution and commendable in risk taking, two qualities sorely lacking in most movies nowadays.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I was very very excited when I heard that warner bros. were going to film the movies. The first two were exceptional and lived up to my expectations. But.... the third one was waaaaaay below the standards set by the first two. B/c ,first, the acting was horrible,second, the geography was nothing like the other movies, third, none of the big aspects of the book were explained. People who have not read the book do not know why the stag came in Harry's patronus or what wormttail exactly did. The direction, screenplay, writing and editing were very poor.

1115,sebastian-hammer,You need background-information to enjoy this movie,4,27 July 2004,"I think it's really necessary that you've seen the previous Harry Potter - Movies to like this one. I did not - and during the whole film I had the feeling that this Movie was full of allusions and references to Harry Potter Part 1 and 2. Frequently there were scenes in the cinema, when the complete audience (the average age was something between 13 and 16 years, many of them ""Potter-fans"") was laughing and screaming. The complete audience - except of me. Am I to old (22) for such kind of movie? Am I to serious? If yes, why do I like ""Lord of the rings"" and other fantasy stuff that much?

1116,fan98cali,Bad Director,6,28 July 2004,"The new director was horrible. Not even comparable to Chris Columbus. He changed the entire format of the school, Hagrid's hut was in a completely new place!!?? He left out a lot of important parts. For example, why was there a deer next to harry across the lake, he didn't mention that and yet he still put the deer in the movie. I am very glad there will be a new director for the 4th installment. The actors did a great job in this movie though. The end freeze frame was also very lame and cheesy. He tried too hard to focus on being comical than being true to the book. I understand that it is a long book and you have to cut things out but he cut out too many important things in place of not so important things. He also left out the whole cute story about how his dad was one of the guys that made that map he was using, just things like that which made book so good and heart warming.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1117,toneygirl,Best of the movie adaptations so far! Minor spoilers in my quibbles.,10,5 August 2004,"I think this adaptation is the truest yet to the spirit of Rowlings' books, though they clearly streamlined quite a bit. Sure, I missed some of the details of the books, like finally winning the Quidditch cup, but I think that it was actually a better movie for not trying to cover every detail. That's what the books are for -- all the wonderful details. I was sorely disappointed in the first movie, OK with the second one, and pretty happy with this third one.I think the characters got better treatment in general in this film; I've been particularly unhappy with the way Ron was screenwritten in the first two films (whiny, cowardly), and I think this one did him better justice. The student body as a whole also seemed more real, more like actual kids at a boarding school, in no small part because of the more relaxed way they wore their clothing. Give real schoolkids a uniform, and they'll modify it any way they can! Lupin was terrific, and I think the new Dumbledore is pretty good, too; the books have Ron describe him as ""utterly mad,"" and with a quirky sense of humor.'Azkaban' also gives the best look yet at the extended grounds of Hogwarts; in the previous two films, nothing felt large enough to me, set-wise, and Hagrid's hut always seemed to be right outside the castle gate, instead of down at the edge of the forbidden forest, as described in the books and clearly portrayed in this third film. I wasn't expecting such a steep hill down to his cottage, but the books always do talk about the trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) going *down* to Hagrid's hut & walking back up the hill to the castle, so I'm tolerably pleased with this visual interpretation. Quibbles & Spoilers (Get the details you *do* show right):1) In the intro, Harry is practicing magic under his covers in the Dursley's home. What happened to the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry?I'll grant you it's a cool intro, but it's a violation of a key plot point.(And not just for this book, either -- it's very important in Order of the Phoenix, too.)2) Dementors don't fly in the books, they glide, and they don't really need to fly to make the movie work. I can see that it was done to make some streamlining elements work, but it could have been done differently.3) I can't see Harry stealing a lollipop from Neville (in Hogsmeade). From Malfoy, maybe, but not from a friend, certainly not while invisible. I know it was done to give us a point of reference for the moving, invisible Harry, but still - let's be true to our character, hm?4) Why did they change the nature of the Patronus from a creature to a shield? In the books, once a wizard successfully creates a Patronus, it acts to protect the wizard with no further drain on him/her. It appears as a creature with a definite shape to everybody, including its creator. And Harry's Patronus is a stag, like his father's animagus form. There was just no good reason for this change.5) Where did Goyle disappear to, and who's Malfoy's replacement sidekick?Still, all quibbles aside, I really enjoyed this movie. It's really, really rare that I come out of a movie -- even a favorite movie -- without a quibble of some sort, so this movie is no exception.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1118,jengiddens,disappointed,6,6 August 2004,"I was really disappointed w/the third movie. The new director really screwed up some key things. I hated the fact that he changed the scenery. I hated how he left things out and rearranged the storyline. From what I heard about the film, the director was trying to make this installment more ""real"" and a little darker than the previous two movies. He wanted to show that the kids were growing up. That's fine. However, these stories aren't based on anything ""real"". They're fantasy. I liked the magical quality of the first two movies. I liked seeing all the neat magical gadgets that I'd read about in the books. And I definitely appreciated the first director's efforts to stick to the books as much as possible. All the little details that make Harry Potter so special were totally discarded for the third movie. If I was JK Rowling, I would never have approved this screenplay. When the third book is longer than both of the first two, and the third movie is NOT as long as either of the first two movies, that is a dead giveaway that the story has been totally cut up and screwed up. VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED! I hope that the next director will do a better job w/#4.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

It moved way to fast, all of a sudden it was Christmas, then it was the last day..if it would have been longer they could have added more of the better points...and the animation wasn't that good, and the grounds were different than in the first two movies, the terrain was way different, and it should have stayed the same. Personally I think the movie should be re-made with the previous director Christopher Columbus. I liked the way he directed the movies. I think the main thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that it went to fast, Hermione didn't have time to be smart, and Harry didn't get his broom until at the end. But I think the acting got a lot better, especially Daniel and Tom's acting....I liked their acting way better than in the previous movies, but thats because they have had more experience two.~Amy Burghardt~",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

That is the animal that Harry's dad transformed into (all 4 of the friends were animagus) Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and liked the new director much better than the other one, though he was good too.As to other plot holes, most of it is things they left out from the book that they don't show happening but also don't show NOT happening. That tends to happen often in book-to-movie films. I think they did a superb job at not making it to long with tedious facts from the book and not leaving enough out to go too far out from the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1122,darna22,Utterly Disappointing,1,16 August 2004,"I used to be one of those stubborn people who wasn't going to read the Harry Potter series books. However, after seeing the first movie (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), I was hooked! I read everything Harry Potter I could get my hands on. At that time, only four books had been released and the third (Prisoner of Azkaban) was my hands-down favorite. It had so much intrigue and plot development, I couldn't wait to see it portrayed on screen!For me, reading the first two books and seeing the first two movies are essentially the same experience. There are some things that are better in the books and others that are more enjoyable visually. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the third movie. So many details are excluded and so much is inconsistent with the first two films that I am now turned off to Harry Potter movies altogether. I realize that with a new director there will always be change, but I don't think this director does the book justice.Do yourself a favor -- skip the movie and re-read the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I just watched it.It's the best one from all the Harry Potters I havewatched.I recommend it to all the true members of the story.Almosteverything from the story is in the movie(well not everything,it's impossible).There are also great computer effects(not as good as in ""Lord of the Rings"").The movie is stretched on 2 CD's.Of course if you haven't watched the other 2 of them I don't recommend this one to you.It's not that you won't understand anything,it's just that the feeling isn't the same,so if you want to watch this Harry Potter you better watch the other two movies.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1124,ralphiedudelion,"The Best of the Three, But Still Missing Something",9,28 September 2004,"I found this film to be the best of the three movies out thus far, mainly because of the general feel of the movie. It was more on an emotional level than the first two, and good guys and bad guys aren't so well-defined like they are in movies one and two. It wasn't just a battle of good and evil, it was about turning thirteen and the emotional dealings that come with it. Obviously, not every single detail of the book could be filmed since it would most likely take five hours to show the book scene-by-scene. With this film, I didn't mind what they ended up cutting out (for the most part) because they made up for that lack with what I would definitely call good character development and emotional content. My only negative comment about the film is that they left out some information that was necessary to follow the storyline that only people who have read the books would understand. Otherwise it was an excellent film.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

And the dementors looked like cloth over a balloon like you'd use to decorate your porch at Halloween. Many good things, though. Emma Thompson was fantastic as Prof. Trelawny. Oh- Gandalf, uh, Dumbledore needed a manicure, but Michael Gambon otherwise did well filling in for Richard Harris. Pretty scenery, some diversions from the book worked well (e.g.,when H&H went back in time). The Marauder's Map was very well done. Alan Rickman was a perfect Snape again.

1126,FilmandPhotos,Who needs to read the books now?,1,18 January 2005,"Having been unable to see or rent this DVD since its release, I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy for the first time last night. Wow! I've never read the books and now feel I never need to after watching the third and most challenging of the three films (I'd seen the other two and was so bowled over by the plots, CGI and acting of the hundred or more central characters that I didn't feel I was worthy enough of being able to endure a third, classic, masterpiece).It would be too easy to comment on the obvious effort the two lads and ladette put into their performances; I'm sure their special acting talents and line delivery have been mentioned in many woodworking manuals since the film was made. And what about the amazing score? I was humming it when I went to bed and found I was asleep in no-time! The Hippo Griff character rocked. One almost couldn't tell that they'd been able to recycle a pantomime horse and make it look like a different pantomime horse to the one they originally hired. Why weren't the actors inside it credited? That's scandalous! Following the plot was exciting too. It reminded me of being lost in a department store when I was a small child (though you'll be relieved to know I didn't blub this time). Such nostalgia.I just have one small criticism though. Maybe it would be wise to get someone like Tarantino to direct the next one. That scene where the pantomime horse was beheaded; I rest my case.All in all, a roller-coaster of a ride, a maze of intrigue and wonder, a plot that really made me want to rush out and buy-the-book(s); sorry, it had or did none of these things for me. What it highlighted, however, was the realisation that one never really stops the need for anger management and that my constant desire to slap the irritating Herm-My-On-Knee, poke the eyes of that strange and ugly Weezlie thing (what was that anyway; it certainly wasn't human?) and shouting optical, fashion advice to the Harri Porter character (doesen't he know about contact lenses?) kept me on the edge of my seat when I woke up just before the credits.Oh yes, wonderful performance by Emma Thompson by the way; reminded me of, now what was it, oh yes, Emma Thompson in thick spectacles.Can't wait for the next one.

1127,mauricio_today,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (UK/USA, 2004)",8,24 March 2013,"The third year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has begun. This year, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who was accused by the Potter's parents murder, has scape from Azkaban Prison - until then considered as leakproof - and now, everything indicates that he's looking for Harry to finish what he had no opportunity to do.As safety measure, the Dementors - strange creatures that feed themselves with the energies and the soul of anyone who approaches them - are sent by the Ministry of Magic from Azkaban to protect Hogwarts School. But they can make the things become more difficult there too. This time, Professor Lupin will help Harry to discover the truth history of Sirius and why they both are so connected.Within this exciting plot, based on the novel by J. K. Rowling of the same title, Cuarón (The Little Princess, 1995) gamble to its excellent creativity - and good taste - at work with the dark, mysterious and magical photography - so different from the charming and magical world of the first two films, directed by Christopher Columbus - and the ability to work with young minds that developed with ""Y tu mamá también"" (2001).Kloves can put together a spectacular cast to the development of the series: Gary Oldman (""Hannibal"", 2001), Michael Gambon (""Sleepy Hollow"", 2001), David Thewlis (""Seven Years in Tibet"", 1997) and Emma Thompson (""Love Actually"", 2003) are phenomenal actors together to make the fans of Harry Potter becomes increasingly enchanted with the productions. It is important to mention that Gambom was named for replace Richard Harris due to death of it and exceed the expectations of the production team: with his strong Irish accent, managed, along with the dark sphere, given more personality to your character (Albus Dumbleodore) without being noticed as a rookie.Although the amazing cast, the script left to wish. Like the first two films, some details of the story were left out and others being treated only superficially, disappointing a little bit those who also follow the thrilling story of the young wizard through reading. But this point cannot be noticed at first glance: the special effects - in which the team of David Heyman worked hard - even snatch the soul of one who hates the magical world of Harry with the help of the lovely soundtrack composed by John Williams to meet the Scottish sets and landscapes.In this third year of the series, what we have new are the Dementors: vicious creatures that feed on the souls and energies of others, used as guardians of Azkaban, the most safety prison of the wizardry world. They are very similar to the Black Riders from the ""The Lord of the Rings"". But to balance such cruelty, there is the appearance of the Hippogriff: a lovely creature half-horse and half-eagle, along with the Marauder's Map showing the location of all inside the Hogwarts castle, will make young imagination go very far.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is, until now, the best movie of the series. Even having developed his script less than it could, can create expectations of what could be the next film of the series, helping to create the obscure sphere that involves the central plot of the story of the young wizard and making your fans stay remain spellbound with each event.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

1129,embee90,"One movie, hold the sensibility, please.",3,17 December 2004,"Let me start by saying that the novel 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' by J.K. Rowling is great, one of the best of the series, and I say this because of the way everything spins together and then there's the whole Scabbers/Pittegrew twist. But for the movie series, I'd have to say that the third installment is the worst of the bunch.It started out OK, the blowing-up-of-the-aunt part was pretty funny, and the Jamacian shrunken head was pretty cool. The first thing that made me think poorly of this movie was the fact that they BUTCHERED it. Just so that they can fit it in under two and a half hours, they decided to just go along like Lance Armstrong on speed. There are so many parts that were in the novel and left out in the movie.I think that I first started to get irritated was during the Shrieking Shack scene (with Black and Lupin and Pettigrew). That scene in the novel is crucial to the plot because they explain everything in detail. But in this movie, they cut the scene to seven minutes, which left the following sequence of events: Harry tackles Black, Lupin arrives, Snape arrives, Snape gets knocked cold, Lupin reveals Pittegrew. The next thing I know, they're outside the tree again! The only thing they explained was, ""Scabbers is Peter Pittegrew, and HE'S the one that killed Harry's parents."" They don't explain the Wormtail/Moody/Padfoot/Prongs deal. In fact, the only reference that you get that Harry's dad palled around with Lupin and Black was when Harry said, ""My dad wouldn't want his two best friends to become killers."" And it's so subtle that I almost missed it.There's more, but I'm pressed for space so I'll skip to the end: all of a sudden, the forgotten Firebolt now weaves its way into the movie. I think it ended up in the end because during the final days of shooting, the director peeked into the novels and said, ""Oh, crud, Harry flies again and his broom is smashed to bits."" The Firebolt was a last-minute shot and lasted under a minute. Not gonna win any awards there. And the last shot of the movie was Harry on the broom screaming' his brains out in a cheesy let's-all-jump-and-freeze-the-frame-to-end-the-movie-shot. No.The only reason that this movie got the three points is because it had some good special effects and CGI (I loved the tree whacking the dove though). In short, if you want to see what Harry's doing, read the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

1131,JackieLFarrell,Could Spoil the plot if not read the book Disappointed,4,27 November 2004,"I bought this movie 2 months in advance knowing that I would have to have it because I loved the book and have the other two movies. This movie was written where it left out so much from the book that people who have not read the book could not possible have a clue about all that is going in the story. I was expecting some of the things to be missing but they completely rearranged some events! The actors where not dressed to represent the way they are written in the book. I believe the first two movies did a whole lot better at staying with the book and getting to the point than this one. If the fourth one does not improve I might stop buying the series. I understand that you have to leave out somethings but not adding some of the facts left viewers who had not seen the book totally lost and confused. I will say they did a good job on the creatures on this one. If you had to cut things why not the visit to the town. Not the information about James Potter and how Black and the others fit into the puzzle. You started the movie fine but after getting to school things started going down hill. Why not have Mr. Weasly tell Harry about the secret keeper; Black, Petter, and the others being friends; at the end you could of have the teacher tell Harry what his father and his other friends did for him while they where at school and what their nicknames where. At least this would of filled in some of the missing information that is vitial to understand how the Potter family was betrade and why he seen the vision he did at the lake.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

J.K please shoot the director, and reinstate the originals that made Harry Potter a house hold name/and great watching material. (oh and reinstate the original location)which was warm and inviting, to young and old alike. please remember why we were all enthralled in the first place, 1/older people wanted so much to have gone to a school like that?. 2/young people(my grand children)want so much to be enrolled there asap.

1133,kittenmiz,Too many essentials to the story left out,5,11 January 2005,"The first and second movies were golden. This one however left out many important details that I felt really should have been included. Yes, it is a long book so they have to leave out a lot to fit it into a reasonable length movie, but not at the expense of cutting out essentials of the main storyline. One example of the many important features left out: The climax of the film was when Harry was finding out the truth about Sirius. It happened so quickly and so much was not explained. Did they explain how Sirius was able to escape from jail? How did they all know about this secret location below the whomping willow? And they hardly touched on everything about how Black, Lupin, Pettigrew and Potter were all a group of friends and the entire betrayal that occurred. Why was Snape so against Black?...(they never mention snape's history with that group. I mean, it explains why he never liked Harry) And finally, why didn't they explain the patronus looking like a stag? I'm a big fan of Harry Potter books and movies but this one just didn't meet my expectations. I give Harry Potter #1 a 9/10, #2 a 8/10 and #3 a 5/10.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1134,ezines_49,SPOILER - likes and dislikes of the film,9,2 December 2004,"These comments focus on the effects etc. of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and make brief comparisons to the past Harry Potter FilmsI was particularly impressed with Lupin's transformation from human to werewolf - the look of pain in his eyes, the way they changed colour (contacts) and how it looks as though the werewolf was trapped inside him and was breaking out - as if his exterior ripped away to reveal the core. The idea of having the water bottle turn to ice on the train was great - showing that it made them feel cold and icy. John Williams has as usual provided great music that completes the movie. I think it is great that they've changed the look of hogwarts castle in this film to its predecessors. For example the giant pendulum and the covered bridge. It gives a feeling that hogwarts is always changing - just as you think you know your way around it. Michael Gambon has taken on the role of Dumbledore well, i like the way he appeared to make the candle go out and come back on again as he was speaking - it kept interest.I was not happy in the change to malfoys hair - it started long and slicked back which suited him perfectly - now its short and doesn't look quite so evil anymore. There is a lot more emotion and even occasional physical contact in this film as opposed to the previous ones. Hermione reaching for Ron's hand for example. The choir at the start of term suited hogwarts very well - especially as lots of them were holding toads etc. Finally, this is a much darker film and we learn a lot more bad things - particularly about Harry's family. Although this is necessary to the future plot i think there should have been a few more contrasting scenes of happiness and joy - it feels the same sort of darkness all the way through!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I am not a big fan of Harry Potter but this is a film that kept me entertained for the whole film ...... Something that is hard for movies to do despite dragging on in some parts. to me the first two Harry potter films were more of a Seven year old movie and despite minor moments that i found entertaining, that only made up for 15-25 minutes of the movie.And an honorable mention has to go to The introduction of Sirius Black who i hoped would get more screen time in the goblet of fire (Luckily we got to see him again in Order of the Pheonix)overall I give this movie an 8 as it is the perfect blend of humor maturity and darkness and it is regarded as the film the first two should have been (At least the last four were OK!!)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I liked the first two movies. I was worried about this movie because the book starts to get darker and I was afraid it wouldn't be captured in the right way. Alfonso Cuaron did an amazing job with the cameras and the movie turned out very well. The one let down may be that if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't understand some of the story that somewhat is useful to know later in the books...I don't know about the movies. The casting for the movie was excellent, at least in my opinion. I imagined Sirius Black, and the other new characters exactly as they are in the movie. Gary Oldman is the perfect Sirius Black.

1137,maescool,harry potter 3,2,14 January 2005,"I had just read the book when i saw the movie, and to be honest, i was really disappointed by the film. Not only are they not following the book (harry receives his new nimbus2000 at the end of the movie, while in the book it is much more earlier). Besides, they are jumping around in the movie, without a good explanation of the story. (it was not told who did make the map with the secret rooms ). Last but not least, in almost all the movie, the characters are wearing normal clothing If the next movie will continue like that, it will destroy the secret of harry potter itself.

1138,Marvelgirl-2,Harry Potter is a teenager and seriously finds out more about his parents' past.,5,17 December 2004,"Oh my God, it was horrible! First, this man (Cuaron) is a professional director?! I could've done better than that! And it was way to ""artsy""! Like the leaf falling from the tree and the rest of the crap! What's with that!? I wanted to see a Harry Potter movie, not some crazy movie on Sundance about a Goth chick finding love (or whatever).Moving on. . . The cheesy lines! What the-!? Lupin going on and on about Lily's eyes, what the heck is that? That was not just unnecessary, but annoying! If Rowling wanted to say that Lupin used to like her, why didn't she in one of the books? And like Hermione's line ""Does my hair really look like that in the back?"" I wanted to hurl! Hermione would never say that! They changed her so much in this film! She's not a girly-girl, she a beautiful smart girl. And one my favorite characters on top of that. And all the forced Hermione and Ron stuff. I am a Ron/Hermione shipper, but that stuff wasn't in the book, so it's meaningless.Did they change Dean Thomas' actor to Keenan from Keenan and Kel?! Or who was the fat kid that played him? 'Cause it wasn't the same guy. And while we're on that, what was with his cheesy line about catching Sirius? ""It's like catching smoke. . . it's like catching smoke with your bare hands. . ."" I laughed aloud! Don't even get me started about how they left out who the Marauders are! That's just wrong! And the stupid way the camera zoomed in and out so much was so lame. Since when can Dementors fly, by the way? And when did Hogwarts grounds get so hilly? Hagrid got an addition added to his hut? McGonagall didn't get to tease Trelawney? Lupin was tough on Harry? Sirius was all touchy-feely with Harry? Why!? What possessed him to change all that? It drove me crazy! I never would've thought that I'd be this disappointed. I knew it sucked, but I didn't know that it did this bad. I can't say I didn't laugh though, some of it was enjoyable. But I wouldn't've payed money to see it. I really hope the next director is better than this. I wish Columbus would've done PoA. . .The only HP fan that truly says that they loved this movie and that it's the best, is merely a movie fan, not a book fan, and that's pathetic.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1139,harry_potter_fan8,Cool Movie,10,17 December 2004,I am a mad harry potter fan and i think that this movie is awesome and my favorite so far. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. My Favorite character is Hermione and also Harry. The first two were also very good and i can't wait to see the next harry potter film. My favorite part was when Hermione punched Malfoy. I reckon snape is trust worthy and will probably become friends with harry in a later time. The Demntors were very cool and spooky. It has a few differences than the book like when harry rides the Firebolt at the end well he actually rides it near the middle of the story. I would recommend this movie for people aged 10 years and over as it is rather scary and would terrify young children.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1140,bjbcardfan23,The ones that love us never really leave us,9,27 August 2021,"Azkaban was so good I watched it twice. Everything came together so well in this movie. First off, Cuaron directed his ass off. It's not easy to pull off time travel in film and he did so excellently. Also it was nice seeing a change of pace from the first 2. Where Harry Ron and Hermoine are changing from little kids into adolescence, the themes grow darker and more mature.John Williams shines with his best (and last) score of the series. The goat of film composing leaves a lasting mark on the HP series.Last but not least, Gary freaking Oldman. He's such a scene stealer in this movie, and one of the most underrated actors living.This film is why you watch the fantasy genre. After 17 years, it still holds up just as well as it did in 2004. And I'll keep coming back again and again.A strong 8.9/10 and the best film of the franchise.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

I know these are trivial issues...but that glowing deer thing!!! What is going on there?the Film is very good though, I think Michael Gambon should have studied Richard Harris' Dumbledore a bit more.....Talked a bit slower and had a calm demeanor....Don't get me wrong, He is a wonderful actor...it was just tough to think of him as the same character.Overall a very good film and am looking forward to the next one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1142,Mandy96B,"A good movie, but...",7,22 December 2004,"This was visually a great movie, but if you're a loyal fan of the Harry Potter books (I am) then you'll probably be pretty disappointed. They left out some very important points.. The fact that Harry's dad, Sirus, Lupin and Pettigrew MADE the Mauraders Map, and that James Potter was an animagius who turned into a stag (ta da! Harry's patronus). I also didn't think Gary Oldman was a great choice for Sirus. He did pretty well, but just isn't true to how J.K. Rowling describes him. Chris Columbus was much more faithful to the books. This movie is enjoyable if you don't focus on how much it leaves out. So just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is, but don't count on it to be an accurate representation of the book.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1143,ourgang151,Do you think that Cuaron actually read the book?,1,28 December 2004,"Because I'm willing to cut the guy some slack if his decision to make Hogwarts and Hogsmeade look like ""prisons"" if it was all just a huge misunderstanding ... i.e. maybe Alfonso Cuaron thought that he was designing sets for Azkaban rather than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or maybe Cuaron got all confused and thought that HARRY was the prisoner of Azkaban, thus designed a bleak setting for the young wizard.This was a bad movie ... poorly acted, characters not ""right,"" choppy editing, no flow at all, and the entire main plot was missing. If I hear one more comment about how this movie was a ""coming of age"" flick for Harry, I'm going to scream. PoA is all about James Potter and his school days ... it's about Harry finding out more about his parents. It is not about adolescent angst. Again, I ask, did Cuaron or even Steve Kloves (screenwriter) for that matter READ THE BOOK?And honestly, who would care whether or not their parents signed permission slips for them to visit Hogsmeade if Hogsmeade actually resembled that awful place Cuaron gave us in PoA? The only place kids could go was the candy shoppe. What was up with making The Three Broomsticks a bar where underage people could not go?Of course Jo Rowling is out there spouting the company line --- ""best of the three"" blah, blah, blah. What can she say other than that? They've allowed her to ""consult"" on the films out of courtesy only, she's already sold the rights ... Warner Bros. could do whatever they wanted with the material now.They should have waited until all seven books were completed to make these movies for several reasons. 1.) A real Harry Potter fan may have grown up and taken on the project with a loving treatment of the material (ala Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh for Lord of the Rings) 2.) It wouldn't be so bad cutting parts out if they actually knew where the story was headed and how it was going to end. It would be a lot easier on fans to watch it then. 3.) Poor Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint would not have been foisted upon us. Those kids need to rethink their career choices ... they stink.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1144,sparklegurl32,The Best So Far,8,2 September 2005,"This movie is by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies already released. Compared to the other two, this one has much better directing. The acting skills have improved, especially in the children, perhaps due to the actor's maturity. The new scenery in this movie is really fitting: the rolling hills, the steps down from the castle, the bridge: it fits the magical, historic, and mysterious mood of the books and the idea of Harry Potter's world. Many arguments have been made that its inconsistent with the writing in the book, which is true to an extent, but one must realize that exact following of book plots does not always make a good movie. In this respect, I thought the editing was very good. Complaints: Although a much better movie singularly, there is a definitely rough transition between movies 2 and 3. Also, the Dumbledore from movies 1 and 2 was better.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1145,sweetchelsxoxo,"A Dark Turn, but a good turn",9,7 January 2005,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a new dark turn for the Harry Potter series. This movie focuses on emotions of Harry and his friends, rather more than what is going around the castle. In this movie there are many new elements that are quite exciting. The whomping willow is explained, the night bus is introduced, we meet 2 new main characters for the first time, we see Harry, Ron and Hermione start coming into their own - having romantic feelings, realizing who they are as people, having more to say about what goes around them.The aspect of time plays a very big part in this movie, and it was done brilliantly. There is only 2 faults I found in the movie. 1) It wasn't long enough, and 2) A few important things in the movie were introduced, but not explained.However, this movie is very good, and does J.K. Rowling's book justice. People of all could like this movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1146,yimbo64bleep,In Contrast to the other Summary...,9,16 January 2005,"I thought this movie was very good, considering they went and got themselves a new director. The way the movie transitioned and went from scene to scene was pretty well, nothing was dragged out or moved too fast. The only thing that I thought was silly was the end when they froze on Harry's face when he was riding the broom XD Hahahaha, but hey it is a movie meant for kids, so who cares if its childish :) It overall was great though in my opinion. Sure everything that was in the book wasn't included, but thats understandable because if they stayed faithful to the book, then well you know, it would end up 16 hours long or something, so they did fine with what they had. They kept you wondering and interested about what was going to happen next (for those who didn't read the book) and wondering just what it is that certain monsters or spells do. Of course, all of it eventually gets answered anyway, so its all good n gravey, and pretty much all of your questions (or mine were) answered by the end. I dunno why you'd go and strain yourself over something like that anyway, and go out of your way to find some unanswered question or something wrong. You can't ever really bottle perfection, and sometimes just have to be happy with what you have.I honestly didn't read the books at all, because I'm not one with the attention span to be able to do so, but this movie certainly drew me in, and explained things to a non-book person just fine :D The only reason that I might've not been able to know what was going on at times in the movie was because I couldn't make out what they were saying with their accents, or they were speaking to softly at times, but after watching it a 2nd time with the volume up and some subtitles, i got it all fine.But hey thats just me. I'm a Potter fan, and happy with the movies they've come out with so far. This one would have to be my favorite though, seeing as they've come a long way since the beginning and have got more budgeting to do the better CGI and animations and whatnot. But um... yeah.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1147,Muskshark,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,10,18 March 2018,"In 2001, the first movie released by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson in the main character of Harry Potter's book, Harry Potter and JK Rowling's Sorcerer's Stone was released. The third series Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released in May 2004. This is the first telegraph survey by David Gritten in May 2004. It must be said that the efforts so far are inadequate. The first two Harry Potter movies, The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets were more faithful than inspiration. America's director, Chris Columbus, was not an efficient and action-packed studio entertainment directed by oneself. They do conservative work and earn a lot of money. But I could not imagine that Harry Potter movies were not robbed by the audience and provided memories that changed them life. The symbol of the movie is attractive. Rowling oversees most of it, but Cuaron warns the audience of the emergency crisis and uses the symbol as a visual tool to maintain tension. Traditionally, all birds with black feathers, such as pike, crow, genocide, have a negative image associated with them. They are commonly used to represent slaughter, bloodshed, fighting. They are considered in terms of vacuum cleaners, messengers of the dead, evil. There are plenty of crows, but Cuaron takes over the traditional role and transforms it into a symbol of the size to fly around in dirty black clothes like feathers. Even if the dimensions disappear, you can feel its presence in the crow. Properly, this third movie in the Harry Potter series is mature with young stars. At first glance, the story itself is relatively simple. Sirius Black flees from Azkaban's prison, and young Harry is in the hit list. But in fact, this movie is a teenager, all the trials and hardships accompanying it. At a certain level, Harry seems to be a different child at school. He experienced hardships of bullying, abrasions with his teacher, playing with friends. But this is not any school. This is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry has all the other problems. Like an escaped madman, he just might want to kill him.
The plot contains the necessary amount of twist and rotation. The focus is in the past of Harry - Sirius Black is his great-grandfather, but he cannot mention he just entered the league with his name. The use of Rolling's most obvious symbolism is in giving the prisoner Sirius Black that she ran away. Sirius is the star of the starry sky, Canis Majoris which in mythology, is the one of Orion's hunting dogs or the Greater Dog, the brightest star in the sky. So, Sirius is also called a dog star. Everyone knows that a dog is superior to other lower animals for intelligence, obedience and affection for humans. But she will hand it to the magician who is more likely to turn into a dog.
Summer is slow. Harry is at Dursleys of Privet Drive and is preparing for Hogwarts in the third year. Unpleasant relatives hurt his father's memory and let Harry let his feelings get lost. As a result, Harry violates student witches and wizard rules, an aunt who is under attack ridges and appears in the night sky. This is a convenient opening for movies that explore obstacles to overcome and have dreadfully serious problems. In Harry's parents' murder case, Sirius Black who was imprisoned in Azkaban ran away and is looking for Harry. A security guard in a prison robbing the soul called ""Dimensa"" is looking for blacks anywhere, but when Harry and Harry meet, there is a revelation that changes everything.
Among the new visual images are animal ghosts which wander the halls of Hogwarts's Castle and the film's realization of Buck beak the Hippogriff, like Sirius, falsely accused and condemned. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and all the established characters come back. Under the guidance of Harry, as the children of 13 years expect, all the students are quite mature. They are more independent, confident, emotionally developed, less reactive, accepting children. Michael Gambon is new and effective as Aldus Dumbledore, following the death of Richard Harris.Emma Thompson is wonderfully wacky as Divination Professor Sybil Treelawney; who leaps from the pages of the book and onto the screen as if Rowling had written the character specifically for Thompson. Also new is Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewles), who comes to Harry's aid in ways that might befit his Latin name. Remus was the brother of the founder of Rome. In mythology, he was nursed by a she-wolf; Lupin means wolf-like (wolf is Canis Lupis).
In regular, we will decide really bad characters; Alan Rickman is a wonderful achievement as Professor Snape and one of the best things between quality and evil. Snape continues to be content with making student life difficult, but she again shows that she has the greatest interest in her heart like a good teacher. Other plot quarks were going well - as the angle of movement of time worked, the map showing all the positions of Hogwarts was fun.
Remove magic and monsters, what you have is the movie of the next era. Harry grew up and faced both the past and the future. I agree with the reality that he is not an ordinary wizard. The actors grew a bit and I was able to bring more natural performance than the first two movies, but I think that is a very important part of filming and editing of this movie. This gives you a more attractive composition and allows interesting foreground / background interactions on the left and right of the screen. In order to establish a more important moment and shot, the camera is centered and focuses only subjectivity on the subject Since the subject is often photographed on one side from the center by visually framing the subject using sets or props, unbalance is not felt in the resultant image.
I also love how time is becoming a visual flow of movies. There is reference of time everywhere. It is appropriate to think of a story line. From the shot of the cuckoo clock of the Dursley family up to the awesome shot through the huge pendulum which dominates the entrance of the astronomical tower and Hogwarts. Take the beat from the story and return to whooping willow and show the change of the season. However, the shots are slightly different, making them visually interesting. I approached Harry and I feel that I am talking to him. When Harry goes out, the whole screen turns black and we get out of the story with him. Transitions from scene to scene aren't jarring, but fade in/outs, vignettes closing in, soft at the edges, like how one might remember a memory. Finally, the lighting is different from us, it is more suitable for creating a more natural, spooky and unbelievable world than the first two movies. However, filming makes movies very beautiful. There are few shots of movies that are not quite luxurious. The dementors floating outside Hogwarts, the moonlight scene after the return from Shrieking Shack, the flight scene by Buck beak, the first Dementor scene of the train, all beautifully caught, Columbus is the cleanest vanilla in the first two movies.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

You see for my nephews reading this book was really difficult. They are just ages 7 and 8 and not avid readers. They expected the movie to be as the previous ones, somewhat fateful to the books. These kids loved the fact that they were able to see on screen what they imagined while reading the book. Although they did like the movie, they were still disappointed by the fact that this time their imagination did not come to life. The castle layout felt so wrong compared to the previous movie.

This last movie ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", really disappointing.

And it also shows how much Harry dislikes his Aunt and Uncle. To me it is probably the best HP movie because it's the only one that doesn't focus on the crap between Harry and Voldemort but focus's on how Harry finds family in the most unexpected person. I also like how it shows where the teenagers hang out on the weekends other than just the castle grounds. It also shows more insight into the Weasley family and just ho much they love Harry like family. It adds in another feature of the wizarding world: The Knight Bus which is freaking cool. If you like Lord of the Rings Harry Potter is a good movie series to watch.

Rowling because she had created this beautiful world!! sorry for my English, bye bye!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1153,peromami,omg,6,20 March 2005,What happened to this movie? I don't think it was as good as the first 2 movies! The first 2 were awesome! I really believe they should have never changed directors! From what I heard this director never even read any of the Potter books! The actors and actresses were awesome as usual! And maybe they could have spent a bit more money on making professor Dumbledore a bit more like the original Dumbledore! This one seems to be way more younger then the first one! With all the special effects they put in this movie they could have done something with his voice to sound older and to make him look older! As I said before kudos to the actors and actresses for their hard work! The story did not follow the book what so ever! Overall I was a bit disappointed in this movie!,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1154,zgiczi,It grew on me...,7,21 March 2005,"The first time I saw POA I was so disappointed I wanted to cry. I've read the books, so the unexplained parts didn't confuse me, but the people I saw the movie with, people who didn't read the book were left clueless. Now, I'm not one of those fans who wanted to see every sentence of the book on the screen, but important parts had been left out, things that needed explanation. If even just a sentence's worth, but should've been made clear. The names on the Marauder's Map meant nothing to those who didn't read the books, as did the reason for Snape wanting revenge on S. Black. The Hogwarts area layout change was quite rattling, although I find myself wishing things would've looked this way in the first two movies. I liked this arrangement better, but the difference was still jarring. The new Dumbledore was another shock, instead of the wise, twinkling, soft spoken old man we got a bit of a goofball. There is something ""off"" about Gambon's Dumbledore, he is a bit too loud for me, but since he had such a small part in this movie I'll wait for seeing him in GOF before I decide I really don't like him. Aside from him I found the entire cast excellent, Radcliffe and Watson more confident in their roles as ever, but poor Rupert Grint got the short end of the stick: he was more of a buffoon than ever. If that kid decides to leave the series I will not be surprised, his character is not treated very well. A pity, I really like him. Thewlis is great as Lupin, Oldman is just like I imagined Sirius, and Spall is delightfully revolting. I would've loved to see more of Alan Rickman, his character is another one not well treated by the screenplay. The rest of the movie is excellent. The music is beautiful, and the Special effects are incredible. The Dementors, the Patronus and Buckbeak simply blew my mind, although I thought the werewolf was a bit of a laugh. All in all, despite my first disappointment I learned to enjoy the movie. It simply grew on me, after I was finally able to slip over the unexplained parts, and just let my eyes go wide at the beauty of it. So this isn't a great movie, but certainly a pretty one.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1155,mcpartlanddaniel,Very Disappointed,6,30 March 2005,"I'm 16 years old and a very big harry potter fan i have read all of the five books currently written and am very much anticipating the 6th. after watching the third movie, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban i have to say that i was hugely disappointed. this move does not compare with the book, vital scenes were missed from the film which were great in the book. the layout of the castle grounds were changed massively, i feel that this let the film down. Dumbledores character was replaced (i know that this is because of the sad passing of the character who played dumbledores character in the other two movies) but their new actor (Ian Mackelen) i feel does not resemble dumbledore in anyway, the way he dresses, talks and even the small things like his beard. i feel that his acting in the third film does not even compete with the dumbledore who acted in movies one and two. this film for me, is unrealistic and does not come close to the other two moves. yes i know that the other two aren't realistic, obviously, but they made it more realistic that the third. ending was also poor, tiresome and very boring. as the characters go back in time with the timekeeper thing the whole scene becomes repetitive after watching the film for a second time i turned off at this point the rest of the film, i could watch over and over again but when it repeats itself i find myself bored. this part of the story is much better to read than portrayed at the cinema. i can read the third book over and over again enjoying it more than the last. even the whomping willow was changed, instead of having big huge branches and clubs for branches it was thin and looked like a regular tree. i also cant wait for the fourth film to be released, harry potter and the goblet of fire. the special effects should be awesome, i just hope that the fourth film does not let me down as the book is one of my favourites. maybe they should bring in the old director to put back the errors which were made in the third film such as the landscape of the castle.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1156,hyuni8812,Total disgrace to the book.,5,20 November 2005,"The 5 stars are purely for the director's ""effort"" to give this movie a more ""personal"" feeling. Although much of that effort turned out badly, but it is still a Harry Potter movie and has its magic... I guess a single star is a little too harsh.I was so disappointed after watching this movie, because it left out important scenes from the book that were crucial to the overall plot, and instead added some pointless scenes that the director created. I understand that the movie can't have everything that the book has, but Cuaron seems to lack the ability to pick up the more IMPORTANT scenes. I Frankly have no idea where the director got all his crazy ideas.I might be repeating all the errors that other review have pointed out, but this is my opinion as well, so here it goes...If the director had seen the second movie, let alone the books(it seems pretty obvious that he didn't read the books, not even 3rd book), he would know that Harry can't use magic in summer. Yet, Harry practically yells out, ""Lumos Maxima!"" like how many times? then there's the creepy weird man in Leaky Cauldron... Sirius was really disappointing because he looked like a crazy old man. That whole scene in the Shrieking Shack was not explained enough; if I didn't read the book before watching, I'm sure I would have got lost. Also, up till that scene, the movie dragged a little and actually made Harry Potter boring! How can that be? POA book had tons of thrilling, even shocking parts and was filled with unexpected secrets! A lot of people name POA as their favorite Harry Potter book, yet the movie is the worst so far. (well, I haven't seen GOF because I was so disappointed at this movie that I didn't want the same thing to happen again.) ahh, now the dementors. First of all, Cuaron decided to ignore Rowling again; his dementor is a totally different creature from Rowling's. His dementor's face deviates from Rowling's one. Dementors are supposed to GLIDE, which is quite important in the beginning of book 5, yet in this movie they always fly around like the book wasn't even there. And when they perform the kiss, the human soul doesn't come out of his or her mouth in the form of a tiny ball... what a cheapo scene... there's a reason why that action is called the KISS. The ACTORS/CHARACTERS!! New Dumbledore is plain weird and looks like a fraud, when he's supposed to be the world's most powerful, wisest wizard. The actors for Lupin and Sirius look WAAAY too older than they're supposed to be... especially Sirius, who's supposed to be a very handsome man, just covered in filth and 12 years of misery/hunger. He simply looks mad in the movie. But then, Trelawney can partner him for looking ridiculous. Yes, she's a fraud most of the times, but not this fake... Sirius the werewolf was just so strikingly fake that i actually laughed. where did the ""looks almost identical to wolves except for a few differences"" werewolf go? it also looked hairless, for some reason. The DVD. well, what is there to say about the DVD when the movie itself sucks?? it lacks of special features. Now THIS is a complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!! sorry WB, but you gotta do a better job to satisfy hard-core HP fans. the book fans, that is.The magic of Harry Potter comes from the sense of a fantasy world that works like any other society, in my opinion. I wish movies 4,5,6,7 do a better job in following the book's storyline, because just doing that would make a huge improvement. and directors, PLEASE READ the books if you're gonna make a movie about them!!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1157,skaufeld,Where did the story go?,6,28 March 2005,"I know many people think that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great film and I agree that it was visually stunning, well directed, and much more mature than either of the previous films. There's more to a movie than that, though, especially this movie. Prisoner of Azkaban is an adaption of a book, part of a larger series, and ,most importantly, already extremely popular and well known. It is also the favorite of the series (so far) among the majority of those I have asked. There were many important issues to consider when making this movie.I think that too much of the story was sacrificed for the sake of the artistic vision in this movie. If you haven't read the book and never plan on reading the series, but do watch the movies, I'm sorry. You'll never understand how much depth Rowling put into this story, she really went to a whole new level in the Prisoner of Azkaban. There's a depth to the story and details that are weaved together in unexpected ways and you miss the majority of it by just seeing the movies. Its not that I expect every detail of the book to be in the movie, I'm a filmmaker myself, I know that there are limits to what can be done due to movie length, budget, etc. I also realize that a different director is going to have a different vision for the stories, I think that most of what Cuaron did for the film was fantastic. Even the inconsistencies that were introduced by Cuaron I could easily overlook if more of the story had remained in the movie, but its not there and its a shame.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1158,bryang-6,A welcome rejuvenation,8,7 July 2005,"The Harry Potter movie series, so far, stands among only a few movie series that have improved with each successive film--the Evil Dead series and The Man With No Name trilogy to name two others. Chris Columbus, director of the first two films, gained a steadier grasp on his material with the second film, but it was Cuaron, director of this third, that moved the series into a much needed different direction.Columbus, a children movie director, paradoxically does not understand children. In his films, he forms representations of children that cater to an adult imagination; however, these representations are far too stiff and too clever to be true or believable. His films are entertaining because they appeal to this adult imagination, but that can only take the Harry Potter series so far. Cuaron stepped into it and yielded to the young actors a measure more freedom of character movement. The young actors, because of this freedom, act more like real kids, rather than cute representations.Rupert Grint, playing Ron Weasley, in this film does not rely on the quizzical expression that frequented his face in the first two films, and his punchline voice, though it remains, is clearing up nicely. Emma Watson, as Hermione Granger, has gained strength and confidence as an actress; she possessed both in the first two films, but has more-so now.Daniel Radcliffe, as the title hero, still needs some tuning up: his dialogue is more halting in this film and he can't quite manage the clunkers screenwriter Steven Kloves throws at him--when, for instance, he swears vengeance on convict wizard Sirius Black. Despite this, Radcliffe plays a better Harry Potter in this film, one who is more a troubled loner and tumultuous teenager, one who is a truer manifestation of the hothead Rowling created.In an otherwise cartoonish--though not unpleasantly cartoonish--first third, Radcliffe brings this troubled teendom out when he runs away after an upsetting episode with the Dursleys, his foster family. He seethes with anger, confusion, and melancholy.The filmmaker, whether it is Cuaron or Kloves or others, risks more in this film. Some of these risks are silly, whether it is an allusion to drug use when the boys are sitting around trying candies that have different joke effects on them, or whether it is an allusion to another boyhood activity when Harry makes his wand incandesce underneath his bedsheets.The biggest risk was changing Hogwart's locale. The terrain in this film feels natural and vibrant, and though they acquaint the audience well enough with the new hilly school-grounds, the audience may be put off, or, worse yet, confused after having familiarized themselves with the setting during the first two.The filmmakers also risk confusing the audience by glossing over some of the plot details in the assumption that most the audience has read the book. Columbus, at least, enunciated every significant detail.Cuaron, however, should be congratulated on the risk that paid off the best: putting more emphasis on characters than effects and putting more control into the young actors' hands. This most of all makes Prisoner of Azkaban the engrossing, entertaining, vibrant film it is.The visual effects--and they're considerably vital in a franchise such as this and worth consideration--are absolutely astounding, Buckbeak the hippogryff especially--another leap forward from the first two.Also, listen to the score by John Williams as you watch. It's a treat too.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1159,TweetM2,bad,2,11 April 2005,"The movie was really bad. So much was taken out and changed that my mom and sister, who never read the books, kept asking constantly,-what happened? who's that? I basically didn't like it at all. So many people here who saw it came to school and were all talking about how bad it was. The only good thing I can say was how funny Rupert Grint(Ron Weasley)was,and of course Dan Radcliffe(Harry Potter). The effects were good such as the Hippogriff, Buckbeak, and the Dimentors(except for the fact that they were flying in the movie). The first two movies were a lot better. I really liked them, although they too could have had a little more of the book in them.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1160,rston84879,Vital information was left out of this movie that should effect the rest of the sequels.,5,15 April 2005,"I cannot believe they let this movie be made this way after staying relatively close to the story lines in the previous two. There is never any mention about how Professor Lupin knew what the Marauders Map was and how to activate it... hmm I don't know, like maybe mentioning that he was one of the four that made the map in the first place.They also neglect to clarify the fact that the reason Peter Petigrew and Serious Black can turn into animals is because three out of the four members of James Potters circle of friends became unregistered animagus to help keep Lupin out of trouble when he turned into a werewolf. That is why his father appeared as a Stag in Harry's petronus.Having the new broom delivered at the end of the movie instead of having it given to him right after his old one is destroyed was ridiculous. They should have included the fact that he was not allowed to ride it at all because the teachers were afraid it may be cursed. They pretty much neglected the whole Quidditch aspect that all the stories build on.These are things that have to be explained before moving on to the next movie and they did not do a thing about it. I looked for these things on the DVD with hopes that they just shaved them to save time, but sadly it was not addressed there either. All in all I hope they do better with the next movie or I will shun them all together and stick with the novels. If they can't get the basics right they should not make the movie at all.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

The move was good but true HP fans will be in for a shock at the things that where left out of the movie, it is a must to read the book first.I hope that JKR takes a hard look at this film and puts her foot down with the next movie and keeps it very close to the book, the new director needs to take a leaf out of Chris Columbus's's book of Dir.

1162,javajunkie_03,Best film yet!,8,26 April 2005,"Alfonso has done a fabulous job with the latest installment in Harry's journey. Prisoner of Azkaban has more mature, darker tones than the previous two films and gives glimpse of what is to come in the rest of the books.All the kids have grown as actors over the years and it's obvious in this film how talented they've become. The additions to the cast in David Thewlis, Gary Olman, Timothy Spall, and others are perfect as our favorite characters from the book.For those that have read the books a few things have been changed but the main story lines remain the same. For those that haven't, the story should flow nicely with the previous movies and be easy to understand.If Goblet of Fire continues with the example Cuaron set it's sure to be just as enjoyable!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Actually, it was Azkaban that did it for me. I like the third film better than the first two, and don't mind any of the changes made to the plot. It now reflects Harry's inner feelings and development, and this is OK. Cuarón's work is much more artistic, and creates an atmosphere that Columbus failed to achieve. I have watched this film so many times now that I fully appreciate it on its own, separately from the book. The time-turner sequence is an accurate portrayal of events, and actually clarifies the rules of time-traveling.However, I think that before watching the upcoming film, Goblet of Fire, you should read the book first, or you won't understand much of the story. A book which is that long can not possibly be adapted to screen without making considerable changes. I am very much looking forward to Goblet, nevertheless, and can't wait to see how the new director manages to tell the story.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

Books of course are always better because you jam more information and don't have to worry about time, I understand this. The first half of this film was jammed packed with so much information they should have just had a scrolling story like star wars does. The characters in the first half of the film was so dry I couldn't relate to the characters. The first two films left a lot out as well but it still felt it was following the story. Showing a cleaning witch for a funny scene in the movie or the womping willow killing a bird? What does that have to do with Harry Potter. Or the firebolt at the end of the film?! I felt thats a key part of the movie because it shows Harry in defeat. Which doesn't happen much in the films. I got to like oliver wood in the first two films and he just wasn't in this one?! Malfoy had no key part in the film they should have just not had him in the movie either. They talked so much about this director Alfonso Cuarón I think hes terrible. I saw Y tu mamá también I thought that movie was not good. Great expectations was a terrible adaption as well. He needs to stick with ""Y tu mamá también"" films.

1168,MaryME229,Harry Potter and the Canon of Azkaban,6,14 July 2005,"I saw this opening day and was all excited because it was my favorite book in the series. Well, let me tell you. What a let down. As a movie by itself it was relatively okay. It just left to much unknown. More than one person who hasn't read the book has asked me question because they didn't explain things in the movie. My friend was utterly lost about the Maurader's Map and why Harry's Patronus came out a stag.The movie just left to many plot holes for people who were uninformed. My group of friends and I (huge Harry fans by the way) came out of the movie down-hearted. In the whole series, my two favorite characters are Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. I thought they screwed- up the portraying of these two men. Lupin, in the books is reserved and sensitive, not brash to Harry and a show tunes fan. Sirius is supposed to be sickly and dirty, but not decrepit and tattooed (anyone else wonder why it looked like he had a menorah on his chest). The story was almost so far from canon that I wanted to scream.Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, I must say this is probably the most entertaining, but the farthest from canon. If your a canon freak like me, stick to Chamber of Secrets.

1173,djbords,Wonderful!,10,14 August 2005,"Summary: The novel starts on the night before Harry's 13th birthday, when he received gifts by Owl Post from his friends at school. The next morning at breakfast, Harry saw on television that a man named Sirius Black is on the loose from prison. At this time, Aunt Marge came to stay with the Dursleys, and she insulted Harry's parents numerous times. Harry accidentally caused her to inflate. Harry left the Dursleys house and is picked up by the Knight Bus, but only after an alarming sighting of a large, black dog. Then he is dropped off at Diagon Alley. There, he saw Cornelius Fudge, Ron and Hermione. When the students boarded the Hogwarts Express train, they were stopped by an entity called a dementor. Harry faints and is revived by Professor Lupin, their new defense against the Dark Arts teacher. Soon afterward, the students arrived at Hogwarts. Harry and his friends had their usual day to day, to-do: classes. Their classes were all interesting, well except for Divination, being one of the most imprecise magic taught at Hogwarts; Hagrid, as the teacher in Care for Magical Creatures, and Professor Lupin's ""Riddikulus"" spell, used against boggarts, and were the only ones that were great, for some. Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, had experienced great problems and trials such as learning the Patronus charm (for Harry), Hermione being secretive (because of her secret), saving buck beak from execution using Hermione's time turner, saving Black from terrible misunderstanding. But, all these were surpassed since their friendship gave them, Harry and his friends, to forge on the path they believe in which lead them success.Review:A. Setting Wow, I love the direction! The setting, as described by the author was amazing, definitely! For me, the setting is highly unbelievable but I don't know why but it tends me to believe in fiction. B. Characters The characters character in the novel are great because maybe in real life, that is what their attitude in day to day living. The actors acted much better in this one.C. Plot The style fits the movie perfectly which makes the plot quite interesting, since it makes the reader/viewer curious of the next event, especially for good readers because they try to picture out the situation then makes some guess of what will happen next.D. Theme The Duality of Life and the Importance of LoyaltyThe theme is circulated throughout the story. It is shown by Lupin, who spends much of his time as a professor and then another part as a man-eating werewolf, but that's a minor thing. We understand that everything ids capable of having two sides, good and evil. We also see this when Hermione starts to break rules, Buck beak's execution is reversed through a simple intrusion through time, and when Black was found out to be innocent.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

There is a lot of suspense and many exciting parts! Some younger children might be scared of the dementors and other creepy parts, but children 10 and over should be fine. The movie is almost as good as the book by the same name which was written by JK ROwling. Many parts from the book are included in the movie. An interesting thing about the movie compared to the other two is that the actors are wearing normal ""Muggle"" (non-wizard) clothes instead of the Hogwarts robes.

Some of it was okay though, but still, someone needs to fire that director and get the old one back. Some people say that the new Dumbledore was pretty bad, but he seemed okay to me. Actually he seemed to be the only okay thing about the movie.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1177,flaviofreis,O Melhor filme da Saga!!!,8,8 August 2019,"Alfonso Cuarón deu a este filme uma personalidade, sendo o melhor filme da Saga. Do início ao fim você fica preso a narrativa, sem barrigas ou cenas que não desenvolvem o filme. Parabéns!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1178,jaspercertain05,This movie isn't the greatest at all,1,12 August 2005,When I first started watching the movie I was having troubles with it I was POed how many changes that where made and wished they kept the same people all the people in it and as well as me catching a few glitches in the movie like the scar changing positions in the movie from hiss right brow to his left as in the first two harry potter movies I didn't catch any glitches. sos&cos where greater by far and wished the directors stayed the same and actors needed to be the same for as of professor Dumbodurf needed to be the same character would have mad it a little better of chores the change in the castle was awful how you got to Hacrids place was way off in it you mad it down hill when in sos&cos it was on flat land to it now mad it down hill I now thing lord of the rings out beat this movie by far.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1179,mieke-sommer,Not the best Harry Potter film,8,15 August 2005,"I think this isn't the best harry Potter film, because the characters are sometimes not like the book and many important things are selected.But the three child actors have been great. Only the screenplay is wrong. I think Rupert Grint is the best actor of this movie and i do not understand, that he wasn't nominated for any award. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were nominated , why not Rupert? And sometimes the window blinds don't work like they should. And why there is a choir, it isn't any in the book? Did the director or want to lose more time???? And I think the child actors will be to old in the next film, but casting new kids isn't right, too.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1180,avigailtruderman,"Surgeon's General Warning: If you love movie 3, don't read this!!!",6,24 September 2005,"Although this is my favorite of the 3 so far Harry Potter movies, there are also several things I dislike about it. Let's start with the good. Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (I really hope everyone who's reading this knows who they play but if not: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger) have totally grown into their roles. They are are amazing actors and I loved every one of their scenes--and since the movie is focused around one or all of them at all times, this was really what made the movie work for me. Also very good were Madam Rosmerta and Severus Snape. As for the bad...I'm afraid there's quite a few things. Number one being Dumbledore. I absolutely loved the Dumbledore from the first two movies. I thought he was amazing; he really embodied the character. This guy--Gambon or something?--is pathetic. I'm sorry; he's just not Dumbledore. I am especially disappointed about this because in books 4-6 Dumbledore has some great lines and I'm hoping that he won't mess them up but predicting he will. Numbers two and three are Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Lupin was this greasy-haired, weird man; totally unlike what I imagined a friend of James Potter to be. Sirius is supposed to be handsome. And I'm a woman, guys, and...he's not. What else? Well, there were the Hippogriff, werewolf, and Dementors. The Hippogriff is supposed to be made of glorious colors. He was gray. The werewolf...well, I don't really know what a werewolf is supposed to look like, but I feel he could have been much more scary. And the dementors come in about where the new Dumbledore does. In the books, Jo says clearly, several times, that Dementors GLIDE. Didn't catch that? GLIDE, people. These dementors FLEW. ?????? Sorry? Maybe I missed something, but Dementors don't fly...that is, if this movie was really what I thought it was--an adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and not some weirdo's take on Jo's story. Their hands also looked like they were made out of strips of black garbage bags wound into some sort of hand shape. There were too many pointless scenes that could have been the funny lines Jo has written. All in all, I loved the trio, but hating mostly everything else. I would watch this if and only if you are a Harry Potter fan. As for movie 4...even critical me says WHOOHOO!!! If you've seen the theatrical trailer, I'm sure you agree. It looks outstanding! Go see it!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1181,guitrplyr1992,Great Movie,10,27 August 2005,This is by far the best Harry Potter Movie that has come out. Some of the things were not accurate but all the same it was a GREAT movie the director did not include enough i think. Some of the things were wrong to for example Harry got the Firebolt in the middled of the book in the movie he got it at the end. The also did not leave Snape down at the shrieking shack they took him with them. Chris Columbus did capture the world of Harry Potter very well in this movie and i hope he does the same if not better in the 4th movie and I've seen the trailer and it looks amazing so i cant wait for that and I've read the 5th and 6th books and look forward to those movies too although I'm not sure chris columbus is doing the sixth movie but whatever i hope it will be good cause the books were.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1182,alexandramommaerts,A great movie,10,5 November 2016,"Amongst all the Harry Potter films, I think that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favourite because there's a lot of doubt hanging over the entire story. At the beginning, we don't know who Sirius Black really is. First, he is depicted as a very dangerous man and as time goes by, we realize that he is endearing. The same applies to Professor Lupin. I already liked the previous movies of the saga but I found this one even better! Besides, the film set is quite amazing, the special effects are incredible and I particularly enjoyed the idea of ""the Marauder's Map"". For all these reasons, I warmly recommend this film!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1183,mini_cutiepie,One of the most action filled movies!,10,20 September 2005,"I think that this movie was very well done. The characters were very well chosen, and it captured all of the fans' imagination! Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint were the best people for the roles. I think that Emma Watson is a great role model for all teenagers...especially me! Overall, it's one of the best movies, and I cannot wait for the rest of the movies! The movie was very well done and the cast worked the roles great. One of my favorite parts was when Hermione smacked Draco. Wow! What power! I think that they could have included more detail from the book. I am a huge Harry Potter fanatic!! I have read all the books more than once, and they I can never put them down! J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, and she captures everyone's imagination. All of my friends say that Harry Potter is the best movie ever! I agree with that...to sum up everything, I LOVED Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, and Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe are amazing! :)",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1184,clive-g,Prisoner of Azkaban,3,25 September 2005,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan, have read all the books and enjoyed them immensely. The first 2 films captured the adventure and mood that J.K.Rowling incorporated into the books. They were exciting and full of mystery and intrigue.I waited with baited breath for the third film ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" expecting it to be of the same quality as the first two, only to be terribly disappointed.Prior to seeing it, all I had heard was how dark and more adult the film was and how it had added more to the story. Well all I can say is that I was badly disappointed with the whole thing.The screenplay was badly written, the direction or possibly the editing was poor, and I am inclined to think that it was more the direction. I felt that even though the individual scenes were fairly well filmed and directed, the story just had no flow. The scenes just seemed to start and end and there was no connection or continuity between them.The special effects concerning Professor Lupin's werewolf and Sirius Black's morphing in to a dog were amateur in the extreme. Lupin's werewolf reminded me very much of an old plastacine character called ""Morph"" that featured on Tony Hart's old BBC art programme. Black's dog looked just like a pen and ink drawing. Surely with all the money that is available for the production of a film like this it would be possible to come up with more believable special effect than this.Well at least they have dumped the last director and gone For Mike Newell, hopefully this will bring a re-think and perhaps re-introduce some of the original innocence and fun of the first two films, One lives in hope.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1185,han_rule_12,harry potter 3 is the best movie yet!,10,30 September 2005,"i totally loved the book and the movie but found that the movie didn't have some of the key aspects the book had like who Padfoot Prongs Moony and Wormtail were and it also had other little bits that were left out or changed. I didn't really think the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) was that great, i mean his acting was all good, but his voice (which he cant change so no offence to him) his voice didn't really work with Dumbledore the character. MY favourite character was Sirius Black! and I'm a bit sad we didn't see more of him, but oh well, Gary oldman was really really good even if it wasn't really what i thought he would look like never the less he was GREAT! Professor Lupin was really good too, unfortunately in the movie a lot of his parts were cut down, where as in the book there was a lot more of him. over all Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was EXCELLENT!!! i really loved it! Looking forward to the FOurth movie WHICH IS OUT SOON!!!!!!! YIPPEEEEEE cant wait to see more of Sirius even if its only gunna be a little! Also looking forward to when the 5th movie comes out..that if it does come out, cause i haven't heard anthing about it.see ya's all! SIRIUS ROCKS! GO Gary Oldman!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1186,brisab,Goofs on Scar,5,9 October 2005,There was blooper on Harry's Scar in the last three movies the scar was above his left eye not his right in the Prisoner for Azkaban it was on the right I don't know how many of you caught it but my mom did and so did my 13 year old son.. I enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban very much especially where he got to meet his Godfather. Harry Should of been able to go live with Sirious Black after they had set him free instead of sending back to his Aunt and Uncles house where he was treated like he never existed in their lives just because his mother was chosen to go to Hogwarts and not his Aunt as well. Rating all three movies together I give them all 100.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1187,eleneluyckx,extraordinary good,9,30 October 2019,I have seen this movie multiple times and I still enjoy it as much as I watched it for the first time. It has a lot of good scary moments which keeps it exciting. The film has a great plot too. If you love fantasy and mystery than this movie is definitely for you. You are able to understand it even if you haven't seen de first two movies yet. However the experience would be better if you watched those first. The film follows an amazing story which makes it one of my favorites.,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1188,whscubana,Best out of the Four Films,10,9 August 2006,"While I was skeptical at first of the quality of the film, seeing as the first two Harry Potter films were kind of lame, I was very surprised with this one. I think this is the best out of all the films to date. Alfonso Cuaron is a fabulous director! I think the change in vision from Chris Columbus' pumped fresh energy into the story of the young wizard's trials at Hogwarts. I especially loved the motif of time that appeared consistently throughout the films. The images of the Whomping Willow throughout the seasons and the repeated use of clocks and ticking noises were a great touch! I really feel that Cuaron was especially tuned in to the spirit of the story, and that spirit definitely comes through in the movie. Also, Gary Oldman rocks, so it was totally awesome to see him play my favorite character, Sirius Black!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1189,Heinali,Not bad but could be better.,6,25 October 2005,"Cuaron covered the basis of the story well and included some good foreshadowing but in reality I believe this movie should only get 6/10. Key plot points were dropped out of the movie or put where they ruined some plot points. In the movie Cuaron has Harry receiving the Firebolt from Sirius at the end of the term. While in the book the broom was received at Christmas to where Harry could continue with quidditch but Hermione told McGonagall who confiscated the broom, due to this Ron and Hermione got into a fight. Now I think getting this in the correct sequence is just as important as foreshadowing because we know that friends who like each other do get into fights over dumb and not so dumb things. Although I did love the dementors and Buckbeak, both were awesome uses of CGI.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1190,NikolajBugge,Major difference!,8,22 December 2018,"Both in terms of the actual story but also in the way the film is crafted, there's a major difference between the two first movies, and this one! And it's great! It seems more dark and gloomy, better framed, the CGI is obviously better and its great to work with more screentime for some of the superior, english actors. Emma Thompson as Trelawny, David Thewlis as Lupin etc.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1191,luvmyman34,Michael Gambon,8,30 October 2005,"I was very disappointed in the portrayal of Dumbledore by Gambon. Richard Harris brought dignity and a sense of stature to the role , mainly thru his wardrobe. A wizard in his position should be dressed in grandeur, not in what looks like a night robe and skullcap as portrayed by Gambon. I don't think he changed his clothed once in the movie where Harris had many different robes and hats (all wizard approved). And his dirty fingernails...yuck! He must also use ""just for men"" to remove his white hair and make it gray! Peter O'Toole would have been a better choice and wished those involved would have listened to Harris' family on this matter. From what I see of the previews of the Goblet of Fire, his attire and bathing habits have not changed. D.L.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1192,azkaban_5,Awesome movie!,10,1 October 2017,"The best movie I ever seen, because of the knight bus! When I see the Double Trouble song in this movie, that's my favorite song in this movie! Harry is now a teenager (like a middle school student) and in his third year at Hogwarts. His friends are Ron and Hermione, and this movie is better than Studio Ghibli. I see this movie in a TV channel named HBO Hits.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1193,somechick_73,Excellent,9,26 November 2005,"This movie was excellent. It could have been a little better, but the acting and the directing was obviously excellent. I recommend this movie to all Harry Potter fans. I think Emma Watson did a good job acting, and Rupert Grint is getting better as well. As usual Daniel Radcliffe did an excellent job playing Harry, he makes a very excellent Harry. Due to the directing and the continuation of the storyline, the characters grow, and the actors grow along with the story. The book was just as great, and if you liked the movie you will most definitely like the book, and I recommend it as well. JK Rowling is an excellent author, and I'm glad that this movie was created, for those who don't like to read, movies are excellent, and I seriously recommend this movie for all movie fans, and all Harry Potter fans alike.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1194,itsyagirl27,entertaining from start to finish,10,3 January 2006,"Like the first two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a brilliant movie that never ceases to bring something new and entertaining to the screen. There is always an excellent new idea brought into the plot creating more visual entertainment for the audience. There are so many different twists that it seems impossible to not continuously be kept on the edge of your seat. Harry Potty has been said to be strictly a love or hate movie, but in my opinion, it's absolutely phenomenal. The thought of someone being able to have such a wide imagination to think up these peculiar yet unique ideas is beyond me. The graphics, the casting, the acting, everything is simply extraordinary. From start to finish it proves to be nothing less than exceptional. It leaves you with a great feeling after watching it. This is definitely a movie you want to go out and see!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1195,zainababdi,This film is certainly not 'Riddikulus'!,10,1 June 2018,"The Prisoner of Azkaban, the third installment from the Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is the movie that introduced me to the world of Harry Potter. I had not watched or read any books in the series previous to stumbling upon the dvd for The Prisoner of Azkaban, and as the credits were rolling at the end of the movie, you could see the astonishment and longing in my eyes for more of Harry Potter's story. This movie is truly impeccable, from the special effects, to the actors, to the storyline itself; you could say this was the movie that changed my life as I knew it. The movie opens with a scene that did not stand out to me right away but after watching the entirety of the series once, I went back for a second, third, and fourth viewing and each time I noticed more and more themes and details. Here, I noticed Harry standing up to Dudley (his cousin and childhood bully) when he taunts him and insults his dead parents, rather than keeping silent and repressing his anger, which is what Harry had usually done to comments like that made by Dudley and his parents. This interaction stood out to me because his decision to stand up to Dudley this time, and so early in the storyline, meant that the pattern of Harry's passiveness was broken and he was finally going to defend himself. I don't want to spoil too much of the film for you but you'll notice throughout it that my theory is proven correct.Another reason I fell in love with this movie is the dynamic change in Harry and Hermione's friendship as they get closer. Throughout the whole movie I was hoping and rooting they would become a couple because they would be absolutely perfect for each other. They are complete opposites but their personalities complement each other: Harry is impulsive and very much emotion driven whereas Hermione tends to thoroughly think her decisions through using logic and facts. Let's talk about the production of the movie for a moment, the budget for this film was roughly between $100 and 250 million dollars, and that money was utilized amazingly. The effects in this particular film were a combination of CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery which just means the special effects are created using computer software rather than old fashioned stunts or practical effects-which is the other special effect used. There isn't a lot of CGI used in any of the Harry Potter films because the director Alfonso Cuarón preferred using stunts to add a more sense of realism to the films. In an interview for Harry Potter: Page to Screen, Alfonso is asked why he doesn't utilize CGI and he responds with, ""Low tech has a certain charm, Because when you realize something was done practically instead of digitally. It makes it that much more real."" And that is true, a lot of the film feels very real. For example, the dementors and the patronus that Harry casted looked very realistic, as well as the magical animals; the hippogriff, centaurs, goblins, etc. While we know magic does not exist in the real world, watching the wands light up across the screen, objects whizzing about, and seeing things made accessible by the flick of a wrist makes you feel as though it could be possible in the real world, that it should be possible in the real world. Whilst watching the film The Prisoner of Azkaban, I felt many different emotions but one thing was for sure: this movie would absolutely become a classic and one of my personal favorites. One of my favorite quotes from the film is said by Sirius towards the end, he is speaking to Harry and says, ""The ones that love us never really leave us, and you can find them in here."" As Sirius is saying ""in here"" he touches Harry's heart and it was such a beautiful moment. This film is captured beautifully and the director did not leave out anything key from the books, rather all your favorite details are included and showcased during the film. Overall, I give this film a standing ovation, and I hope it leaves you with the same heartwarming feeling it left me with.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

1198,dooder35,An unfortunate waste of time and money.,1,20 January 2006,"Thus far this was the worst movie in the series. My family and I are staunch readers of the Potter series and were exceedingly disappointed in this movie. I can not understand why Chris Columbus stopped directing. He was true to the story and the elements which are necessary to the plot. I disagree with putting the Hogwarts students int to ""muggle"" clothing. It takes away from the feel of the movie. Dressing differently is part of the whole package. They are not meant to be like ""us"".I found the acting improved. I think Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, although a little over acted. Over all the actors were wonderful and did the best they could,considering what they had to work with. After this movie I believe I will stick to the books and forgo any more of the movies, unless Chris Columbus is directing.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1199,flutequeen84,"Overall, fantastic",9,9 August 2006,"Until Goblet of Fire came out, this was my favorite of the movie series. The visual effects and scenery are magnificent (especially when Harry's riding Buckbeak), and the music fits this description as well. Some people say that John Williams' music is trite, but he wins my vote in this film. I think it's interesting how he helps evolve Harry's character from a wide-eyed child in the Sorceror's Stone to an adolescent determined to make something of himself. What disappointed me: They left out a couple of parts that I would love to have seen, such as when Harry hexes Malfoy and his group (thinking they're dementors). And of course, before that, the firebolt. They should have put that in the middle of the movie, where it belonged in the book; then the Malfoy scene would work. And it also would have been fun to see Gryffindor's Quidditch victory. But other than the above mentioned...this one is a triumph. I don't expect any movie to follow the book word for word, and it'd be boring if it were done that way. Kudos to Cuaron.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1200,Tommelot,"good movie, one bad actor",7,22 April 2006,"First of all I would like to say that I really enjoy the Harry Potter movies although there are some things that need attention I thought that in Harry Potter 1, 2 and 3 Daniel Radcliffe's acting really spoiled the film because once you notice it, it's all you can think about and the bad thing about bad acting is that you really do notice it.Thankfully the acting in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire improved greatly. I heard that Daniel Radcliffe actually had to have acting lessons for 'the Goblet of Fire' because otherwise the director wouldn't direct the movie. I do like the fact that this movie is so similar to the book although naturally a few things had to be cut out and sometimes it doesn't completely fit so it's a necessity to have read the book. I love the setting and I'm glad that this movie had become a bit more 'grown-up'. The performances of Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are really good. All in all it's not my favourite Harry Potter flick but I sure think it's worth seeing. However, with most films based on books, read the book first.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
1201,mcasperd,Good film.,6,4 July 2006,"It was a good film overall. The scenes would occasionally stray away from the book, but heck, remember the Shining? An excellent film, sometimes completely different from Stephen King's version. I'd give the shining 8/10. It was important to show the relationship between Harry and Remus Lupin as the movie did. The trio of friends has grown as well! This probably makes the film more popular for the youngsters! :-D Anyway, the hipogriff was cool. Like I said before, it was a pretty good movie! I just had one problem, I just HATED Gary Oldman as Sirius. I wanted Sirius Black to be at least SOMEWHAT handsome! A charming film, really. I can say without a doubt that I was very pleased when leaving the theater. I recommend this movie to all who loved the book!",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
