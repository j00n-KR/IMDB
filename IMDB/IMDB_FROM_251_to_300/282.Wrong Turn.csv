0,Leofwine_draca,Didn't care much,4,4 September 2021,"When I heard they'd remade or rebooted the original WRONG TURN (2003) I was surprised given that it's not 20 years old yet, but sure enough this 2021 reboot is now available for viewing on Netflix and I've just...well, endured it. The original long-running film series wasn't particularly great to begin with although one or two of the sequels were quite entertaining, but this moves away from mutant mayhem carnage into something slightly more original. Once again we join a group of friends who unwisely leave the trail to go off hiking in the woods, but the rural dwellers they encounter are very different from the grisly horror tropes of the original.While I do appreciate the differences in approach this time around, the sad truth is that the twists and turns simply don't make this very horrific as a film. What starts out fairly atmospheric with some shockingly gory moments just ends up descending into something approaching tedium, so much so that they resort to shooting fantasy dream scenes to add in more violence. There are some gory moments but a general shying away from exploitation into more thriller territory, but of course it suffers from the usual lack of budget, indifferent performers and cliched writing for the characters and action. In the end, I just didn't care much either way.",Wrong Turn
1,SnoopyStyle,some interesting second half stuff,6,7 April 2021,"Scott Shaw (Matthew Modine) is searching for his missing daughter Jen who was hiking the Appalachian Trail with her friends. The small town locals don't seem to care. Six weeks earlier, Jen and her five young friends suddenly get a flat tire. They arrive at the small town to start their hike and it goes downhill from there.The kids are unprepared and a bit annoying. The rooting interest is a little thin. These characters get less and less appealing. One of them should be over-prepared and the movie can play around with that. They already touch on it with the girl changing the tire. It can add a scene where a character lays out the props with the possibility of them being used later in the movie. The first half is basic horror-in-the-woods movie. The characters are rather iffy. They're dumber than they should be. They are presented as smart young urbanites but a couple of the guys are as dumb as movie frat guys. The second half becomes a cult torture horror movie. It's better when the characters stop being so dumb. It's more interesting with a couple of interesting ideas. It does some really interesting stuff. If only the first half is as good, this would be one to build upon.",Wrong Turn
2,nogodnomasters,A Blessed and Idea America,4,6 March 2021,"Hikers get trapped and captured by an isolated group of Nordic style woodsfolks. Jen (Charlotte Vega) is being sought by her father after being missing for 5 weeks, apparently the parents of the other 4 don't care.This does not appear to be connected to the Wrong Turn series. This clan is in Virginia and the cannibals are in West Virginia.This is not a group of cannibals, just QAnon looking and acting people. Watchable, but not great.Guide: F-word. Sex. Brief male butt nudity.",Wrong Turn
3,Tweekums,Decent enough horror set on a wooded mountain,7,6 September 2021,"As this film opens Scott Shaw heads to a remote town in Virginia to look for his daughter, Jen, who has gone missing while hiking the Appalachian Trail with a group of friends. The action then jumps back six weeks and we see Jen and her friends arriving. They are a diverse group of liberal Northerners who aren't exactly made to feel welcome... they are warned to stick to the trail. They haven't gone far when this advice is ignored and soon they are in real danger. They trigger lethal traps and encounter a group known as The Foundation that has been living an apparently isolated existence since 1859. This group take their privacy seriously and have very strict laws.I must state that I haven't seen any of the previous 'Wrong Turn' films so can't say how this compares... it also meant I went into this with no real expectations about what should happen. It turns out it was a decent enough horror film. There are plenty of reasonably scary moments as well as quite a few unpleasant deaths. The protagonists aren't particularly likeable; they may be diverse and politically liberal but they have their own prejudices. Without going into retails I thought the way friends crossed paths with The Foundation; the various traps were fun and the Foundation appeared scary. On the down side one really does have to suspend ones disbelief; The Foundation might be a danger to hikers but one can't imagine the authorities would be ignorant and tolerant of people disappearing on a particular mountain for a hundred and seventy years! The setting looks great even though it was filmed in Ohio rather than Virginia. Overall I'd say this is worth watching but not a must watch for horror fans; just don't take it too seriously.",Wrong Turn
4,paul_haakonsen,The title actually says it all for this reboot...,3,14 March 2021,"Well, the track record of all the ""Wrong Turn"" movies that has been spewed out since 2003 haven't exactly been top notch entertainment. Sure, most of the movies have been semi-watchable, but they've never ranked more than less than mediocre in my opinion.So it was with a healthy doze of skepticism that I sat down to watch the 2021 reboot of the ""Wrong Turn"" franchise. In fact, the whole reboot of a less than mediocre franchise just seemed so pointless and unnecessary. But hey, perhaps they would manage to get the formula right this time around. Right?Wrong!This 2021 reboot from writer Alan B. McElroy and director Mike P. Nelson was the worst one yet. So what they did here was take a less than mediocre movie franchise, dumbed it down and made it even more laughable.Now, we are used to the six previous movies having inbred cannibals running around in remote areas, preying and terrorizing those that stray into their lands. And guess what, it's gone here in the 2021 movie. Yeah. Instead we are given a group of descendants of pre-American Civil War people that opted to isolate themselves in the mountains, as they foresaw the end of the United Stated with the impending Civil War lurking around the corner. But wait, it gets better. Apparently living secluded in the mountains turns people into what best can be described as caricature versions of Vikings, but wearing animal skulls to cover their faces. Thank you Alan B. McElroy for giving us such glorious material.And these reclusive mountain people, known as The Foundation, apparently are free to venture into the nearby mountain town to sell their trinkets, and people pay them no heed. Yet at the same time, people fear and loathe these people with a vengeance. But letting them roam wherever they like? Yeah, pretty amazing writing right there.Completely gone was the atmosphere and feel of the previous six ""Wrong Turn"" movies, and we are given some cheap imitation instead. An imitation that didn't really have the same punch or impact to it, mind you.Now, it wasn't all bad. Because there were some interesting enough violence scenes in the movie. Such as the rolling wooden log for example, or the fire poker. But there just wasn't enough of these things in the movie to even remotely make up for all the shortcomings that was the 2021 ""Wrong Turn"".And it should be said that the acting in the movie was actually adequate, and was up to par with what you have seen in the previous six movies. Sure, these are not Shakespearian performances by any level, but you know what you get with these types of movies. It was, however, a surprise to see the likes of Bill Sage and Matthew Modine in a movie such as this.The characters in the movie were bland, so very, very bland. There was little backstory for the characters and equally little motivation show as to what drove them to go on. So you have a gallery of one-dimensional characters running around in a cheap imitation of ""Wrong Turn"", yeah, not exactly the recipe for a winner. And I was amazed at how quickly the friends were to shrug off the deaths of each and every of their friends around them.Without spoiling the ending of the movie, then I have to say that I was laughing at the ending to the movie. It was just so far out there and just made no sense no matter how you look at it.I suppose if you are unfamiliar with the previous six ""Wrong Turn"" movies, and happen to get to watch this 2021 abomination as your first introduction to the franchise, then there is something to be enjoyed about the movie. But keep in mind, this movie is not as entertaining as the previous six movies - though they were themselves less than mediocre.My rating of the 2021 reboot ""Wrong Turn"" lands on a mere three out of ten stars. This is definitely the weakest addition to the franchise, and a fully unnecessary reboot. I am very tempted to say that the movie's title here, ""Wrong Turn"", pretty much summarizes what the writer and director did here with the entire franchise.",Wrong Turn
5,Coventry,"Having fun with the Mountaintop Hillbillies, are we?",4,2 November 2021,"Remakes (or re-stylings, or re-imaginings, or whatever they are called nowadays) come faster and sooner. The original ""Wrong Turn"" was only released in 2003, and not even twenty years later the reboot is here already. Usually US-remakes only come this fast when the original is a foreign horror-hit, like from Japan or Scandinavia or something. But then again, society changed a lot since 2003, and a remake actually can be justified.As per 2020, it's not longer acceptable to send a bunch of dumb, heterosexual Caucasian teenagers into the backwoods. It also isn't allowed anymore to depict mountaintop hermits as inbred freaks with bad dental hygiene and fingers missing. And so, now, we are supposed to be believe that interracial gay couples and uptight oncology-students go for primitive hiking vacations in the West-Virginian woods. We are also supposed to believe that a handful of families can live in a secluded community for more than 200 years without their bloodlines getting affected by inbreeding or lack of qualitative living standards. Fine by me, but then at least have the decency to name your film ""Woke Turn"" instead ""Wrong Turn"".In my humble opinion, writer Alan B. McElroy and director Mike Nelson should have given it a different title, and started a whole new franchise. The first half may qualify as a remake, but the second half is another film. When the plot runs out of annoying hipsters to slaughter at the 45 minutes' mark, ""Wrong Turn"" takes a U-turn itself. I won't reveal too much, but Matthew Modine thinks he's Liam Neeson, and his daughter is tougher than a crossbreed between Lara Croft and Natasha Romanoff. The plot is hopelessly implausible and improbable, but luckily there's some good gore to enjoy, and the climax is quite (unintentionally?) funny.",Wrong Turn
6,zardoz-13,A Change in the Villains,8,14 June 2021,"The remake of Constantin Films' hair-raising horror movie ""Wrong Turn"" (2003), starring Eliza Dushku, boasts neither ghastly, bone-crushing carnage nor villainous, Appalachian, hillbilly cannibals. These inbred yokels slaughtered anybody who blundered into their neck of the woods. Not surprisingly, by the time the ""Wrong Turn"" franchise spawned its fifth grisly sequel, the films had sacrificed their spontaneity and spent their sadism. Not only has ""Domestics"" director Mike P. Nelson and original ""Wrong Turn"" writer Alan McElroy reimagined the franchise, but they also have given the villains a makeover. Now, they are no longer ghoulish, redneck, flesh-feasters, but an obscure society known only as ""The Foundation."" Migrating to Appalachia on the eve of the Civil War, they carved out their own utopia on a mountain because America was sinking into anarchy over slavery. Meantime, the new ""Wrong Turn"" imitates the venerable M. Night Shyamalan movie ""The Village"" (2004). The small, 19th century, Amish-like community in ""The Village"" had abandoned society and thrived in seclusion under its own edicts. They created legends about eerie woodland beasts to dissuade their own from forsaking the fold, too. Similarly, the Foundation perpetuates its own xenophobia. Nevertheless, they venture out when necessity prompts them either to stock up on staples or take slaves to replenish their numbers. Moreover, they have sown booby-traps on their outskirts to deter intruders and trap wildlife. Whereas the original ""Wrong Turn"" featured three hideous, brain-damaged hicks, the Foundation bristles with intelligent descendants of Nordic origin who have taken extreme lengths to maintain their existence. Hardcore ""Wrong Turn"" zealots may find this reboot less than savory, but the new ""Wrong Turn"" lacks no shortage of suspense.""Wrong Turn"" opens with Scott Shaw (Mathew Modine of ""Full Metal Jacket"") cruising into a scenic but sleepy Appalachian hamlet. Checking in with the local sheriff, Scott explains he has been searching for his daughter Jen. According to Scott, Jen had kept him abreast of her whereabouts on a weekly basis, but she hasn't contacted him for weeks. Traveling with her African American boyfriend Daruis (newcomer Adain Bradley), Jen (Charlotte Vega of ""American Assassin"") and two other couples-a gay and a straight couple-had planned to hike the Appalachian Trail. The sheriff gives Scott a missing persons form to fill out but assures him Jen is probably sunning herself in the Florida Keys. Scott isn't so sure. At this point, Nelson and writer Alan McElroy roll back the timeline and plunge us into a flashback. Dated 'six weeks earlier,' we find ourselves riding with a bunch of happy-go-lucky millennials. A tire blows out on them, but Jen repairs it while the guys stare at her in awe. She brags that her dad taught her two things. ""How to bait a hook and change a tire."" Later, after they check into a bed & breakfast, the older lady who owns it cautions Jen about hiking thereabouts. ""Keep to the marked trails. The land here can be unforgiving."" Predictably, our hikers ignore her advice. Later, at a honky-tonk bar, a creepy, low-life local, Nate Roades (Tim DeZarn of ""Fight Club""), warns them about hiking, too. ""There is something dangerous up there."" Fifteen minutes later, with all preliminaries dispensed with, our protagonists hit the Appalachian Trail.No sooner have they set off than Darius suggests a side trip to a historic Civil War fort. Jen repeats the B&B lady's warning about sticking to the trail. Reluctantly, Jen gives into Darius. Four hours later, with no sign of the fort, Darius relents, and they head for the hiking trail. Suddenly, a gigantic log plummeting downhill for them like a runaway steamroller sends them scrambling for safety. Nelson does a terrific job of orchestrating the hysteria of the moment as they dodge the log. Alas, one of them doesn't survive. Although we don't see the log pulverize him, the aftermath is an immaculate but gruesome sight. The ill-fated fellow has been crushed to death between an upright tree and the heavy log that pinned him against the tree. Hopelessly lost and distraught, the survivors decide to camp for the evening when it starts to rain. The next morning they discover their cellphones have been stolen. Another guy steps into a trap, and he is dragged several yards by a huge chain before he disappears down a rabbit hole. Later, the rest stumble onto a barn cluttered with unclaimed camping and hiking gear. The next thing they know Foundation sentinels wearing antlered deer skulls and ghillie suits--who have been watching their every move--take them captive! Things take a nasty turn for the survivors when they appear before an aloof Foundation tribunal. Suffice to say, everybody winds up paying the piper a heavy price. For example, they blind one of our heroes and confine him to a cave for an eternity.Far more ambitious than its predecessors, ""Wrong Turn"" may baffle gore hounds yearning for nothing more than a bloody good yarn. This ""Wrong Turn"" remake spews political and social commentary galore beyond anything found in the original. Most people don't ogle these epics to embrace diverse thinking as much as perverse maiming. Make no mistake, ""Wrong Turn"" serves up its share of scary scenes with ghoulish characters. However, it never surpasses the nerve-racking, ritualistic slaughter in writer & director Ari Aster's decadent chiller ""Midsommar"" (2019). The three original ""Wrong Turn"" villains: Saw-Tooth, One-Eye, and Three Finger would wrestle with identity problems in this change of pace reboot. Nelson and McElroy complicate cut and dried characters and cliches. Typically, splatter slasher villains are infidels, while their victims are blameless. Here, the villains emerge with surprising shades of grey. Like 'final girls' in all vintage horror movies, Jen Shaw triumphs over her adversaries despite the wholesale evil she has suffered at their hands. The finale is a white-knuckled, nail-biter! While it mashes up suspense and tension with gory prosthetics, ""Wrong Turn"" qualifies as several slices above the average slasher because it features a feisty heroine.",Wrong Turn
7,grantss,Dull and formulaic,2,4 September 2021,"A group of friends set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. After getting lost they stumble across a sinister man in a strange outfit. This meeting will have a profound impact on their lives and see their lives threatened by a strange cult.The 2003 Wrong Turn was a surprisingly decent horror movie, with a reasonably good plot and good performances. The success of this film caused the producers to create five sequels, all of which were incredibly bad, being made for the money and falling back on the usual horror clichés and formulae.This film is essentially another one of those sequels, relying entirely on the Wrong Turn name without bringing anything original to the table. Quite dull and formulaic with a middle section that doesn't make too much sense.Avoid.",Wrong Turn
8,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Unimpressive and highly flawed reboot,3,27 February 2021,"After his daughters' disappearance, a man sets off in search of her and missing friends and learns they got stranded in the woods where they encounter a society of backwoods hunters living by themselves and must try to get them back any way he can without running into the locals around the area.This was a decent enough if highly flawed effort. The main factor that appeals, which is pretty much the only factor that works well here, is the opening setup that shows something happening in the woods around them. The series of traps and encounters with the group getting picked off by the various items left around bring about some rather enjoyable times here, especially once they realize the woods are crawling with the society members attempting to pick off the group one-by-one. There are some suspenseful encounters within here as the group is unaware of who's out there while also providing this one with tons of aftermath gore that's quite brutal and dark even without the on-screen kill-shot. That's really all that works here. There are some big problems with this one. One of the main issues is the generally overlong and unnecessary running time that doesn't warrant the excessive length. The setup here is the main issue, taking the two-pronged approach with his search for the missing group and then going into their full adventures in the town looking to go hiking before stumbling into the group. To switch back-and-forth between these two stories throughout the rest of the film stretches the film out far too much, especially with overlong courtroom sequences or plot-points that aren't required. So much of this one is unnecessary that it could've lost many of these extra scenes and storylines without affecting it. Moreover, the film really doesn't seem logically plotted about how the society operates and why it's supposed to be a frightening experience. The take-off on a doomsday cult living out in the woods throwing plenty of traps out on the mountain that denotes a secret society living out there which comes off inherently stupid since it takes the fearful ability of the group out of the film just by being innocent hunters unaware of who they really are. The basic groundwork of the society is completely missing as to what they're setting out to accomplish being out in the wilderness being out by themselves, which isn't even anywhere near as bad as the fact that the plot twist at the second half makes it out to be them as sympathetic and unwilling to hunt anyone in the first place. The last negative to deal with here is a series of utterly unbelievable and mind-numbing decision-making that goes into this one. From failing to report anything about the strange behavior of the locals to the inane idea of failing to recognize they've killed someone and should report it to the authorities or not even realizing that they're being hunted in the first place after one of the group is murdered. The whole idea of taking the offer to join their society only to then betray everything, later on, should've been seen coming from a mile away and sets up the utterly moronic finale which sets off a round of stupidity that ends this on a sour note, holding this down overall.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",Wrong Turn
9,trashgang,not that bad as many do say,7,16 March 2021,"Not connected at all to the Wrong Turn franchise. Why this title I don't know it only make people angry who do love the francise. Nevertheless, skip the title and you are in a rather good flick with some gore attached.The story itself is simple, on a hike, being warned by locals not to leave the trail, they do leave it to come across a community not to be discovered.All well, some statements about the cruel world and then the things really go wrong.I didn't found it all that bad as people do tell. Just relax and enjoy this sometimes brutal flick. The ending i did like.

10,deloudelouvain,Not very satisfying.,5,15 July 2021,"I don't know how many more Wrong Turns you can make but at one point enough should be enough. And even though this Wrong Turn is not connected to any of the direct-to-video sequels of the original Wrong Turn it's still basically the same idea. In this case there is The Foundation, something new added to give this story a boost but that in my opinion didn't really work. There are just too much ""oh really, you really did that? , and Yeah right..."" moments that made this movie just a bit boring. THe cinematography is okay, and so is the acting. The story or the plot on the other hand is just not that great. It's a waste of time, a rewatch of the first movies would have been a better idea.",Wrong Turn
11,thesar-2,"Finally, The Right Turn",9,8 March 2021,"1986's The Fly was almost beat by this, but being the second-best horror remake and one of the best remakes of all time is still good.This movie was SOOO amazing, it single-handedly renewed my faith in post-credit scenes. Thanks to the MCU, I hate them, but this is by-far the best one I've ever seen.Right away, I loved the cast and characters. These weren't your stereotypical carboard cutouts and this is coming from someone who loves the Friday the 13th films. And then, when the first death occurred, I even went as far as to tear up.Getting ahead of myself. The synopsis/setup reminded me, but way better, of 2009's Friday the 13th ""Reboot."" We see the dad of one of some missing young adults who never made it out of the woods they were hiking in months prior. Dad's relentless to be reunited with his daughter. And now, we're back to the group months prior and their (insert movie title) and encounter with the people of the woods. They don't seem friendly, people die and there maybe no escape. Will that father ever find his daughter? Or any of her friends? And who are these people who seem hostile?This isn't just a remake or reboot of the original Wrong Turn...this is a reinvention of the concept. They give you exactly what the first did, and then actually wrote a script. I haven't been this impressed with an update in about a decade. Or more.Everything worked. From score, to cinematography, to acting, to twists, to genuine tension and depth, to scares and mostly realistic occurrences. Okay, I will be frank there.The movie does stretch my suspension of disbelief with how these kinds of Woods People would really be dealt with by the United States Government. No spoilers, but once you watch, you have to know this would really play out a bit differently. So, be warned. As genuine a ton of this movie is, you still have to give it a bit of a reach.I loved this movie. I had NO IDEA how much I would when it began - hell, I was even discouraged by the almost 2-hour runtime. Which, thankfully, was never an issue. I never felt bored or thought scenes could've been cut much.HIGHLY recommended. Even for non-horror fans who like thrillers/action movies. But, definitely keep in mind: it's absolutely a Hard R.***Final thoughts: And now...no new sequels please. I know for certain I've seen the original Wrong Turn and liked it enough. But I don't believe I've seen a single sequel. Never interested me. I have seen many videos on the series that showed me enough. Since I haven't seen parts 2 through 6, I can't officially say to skip them. It's safe for me to say, see the original and definitely see the way better remake.More final thoughts: Cheap me. I had the option of buying this for $9.99 or renting for $5.99. I opted for the rental thinking I might like this, but not enough to ever see again. Wish I had spent the extra $4.",Wrong Turn

As a one who saw 2003 version many times back in the day, i was surprised that this 2021 version wasn't just a remake but its basically has little to do with the original. This one is way more toned down in reality, and had a pretty interesting ideas on its core. Sadly they weren't explored more, but i liked the idea of Foundation. I also like main valiant who seemed more human that many human but at the same time was doing some pretty heavy stuff.Overall, ""Wrong Turn"" (2021) is definitely not a copy / paste of the original.

Other than the car aspect this Wrong Turn is epic more horror than expected but the main characters aren't very likable where as unfortunately I wouldn't mind if they all died. Its a very mediocre adaptation of a masterful horror! So many bad things happen that's not exciting for the genre; one of few occasions where I support the villains.

Soon they find out that they are not alone there when a community of people approach them. They live in the mountains for many years and they have other plans for them.Since I had already watched the previous ""Wrong Turn"" movie I knew what I was about to watch, at least the main plot of it but still I enjoyed the changes. The direction which was made by Mike P. Nelson was good and entertaining, full of suspense and action. The interpretation of Charlotte Vega who played as Jen was also very good and I believe she did a nice job. Finally, I have to say that ""Wrong Turn"" is a nice horror movie and I recommend it to every person has already watched the previous movies of this franchise and also to those who wants to watch a simple horror movie.",Wrong Turn
18,cruise01,Decent thriller but does go in a different direction for a reboot.,7,25 February 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Wrong Turn is a pretty fair horror film about a group of young adults who go on a hiking in a redneck forest. Where they come across something that is taunting them and hunting them down.If the original film never came out. This movie would have been so much better. I loved the original movie more cause it delivered the horror thrills and gory fun. The reboot is the opposite. Has a similiar concept. This time playing with the idea of a group of liberal teens travelling in a redneck town. Coming across with not so nice people. The group of friends are three couples. One that is in a interracial relationship. And another a gay couple. While they get stares in a bar. When they go out in the woods. They face against traps. People wearing elks head and blending in with the woods. Even with the same script writer of the original movie. It does take things differently. Without giving away spoilers on the twist with what the teens face. The film does lack in scares. And gore. It has some quick shots of a bloody dead bodies. But nothing too extreme. The films climax following the lead girl Jen (Charlotte Vega) trying to escape. And fighting for survival using a bow and arrow. Giving that Lara Croft Tomb Raider feel. Does offer some entertaining thrills. It does take away from that horror and intense tone.The cast ensemble was pretty decent with there characters. Charlotte Vega did fair. Matthew Modine playing her father who is on the search for her in the woods after being missing for weeks was good too.The ending does give an uneven tone with Jen coming across something. Which loses its horror tone.Wrong Turn could have been better. The original is way better. If it was not for the original. This one would have worked. The creepy people in original was terrifying.

19,eddie_baggins,A sad attempt at rebooting a franchise and a poor excuse of a horror,2,4 March 2021,"In an era of random remakes, re-imagining's and reboots, one of the last series that I would've had pegged down for a freshly minted jumping off point is 2003's horror outing Wrong Turn.A decent enough if instantly forgettable gore-filled outing, the mid-tier early 2000's hit had managed to spawn five other films in the Wrong Turn catalogue that now becomes a sixth with Mike P. Nelson's reboot of the series (known as Wrong Turn: The Foundation in some territories) coming our way to introduce a whole new audience to the world of backwood's murder and horror because you know, its a bit too hard to come up with a whole new horror film these days.A lazy and almost instantly unlikable picture, one where you wonder if you're actually supposed too care if the main characters die and one where you will constantly be yelling at the screen trying to give characters advice in light of their increasingly poor choices and actions, Wrong Turn is neither scary enough, inventive enough or smart enough to recommend as the film ticks off a series of genre-related boxes that will have even the most forgiving of horror hounds finding a reason to recommend this unneeded series entry a hard prospect to achieve.Filled with a bunch of stereotypical mid-20 year olds that get lost in the deep dark woods on a seemingly pleasant hike along the Appalachian Trail only to (who would've guessed it?) find their dreams of country life interrupted by some unfriendly locals and some conveniently located traps that seem to be waiting at any corner of the forest our gang find themselves wondering around.Those seeking bountiful gore and redneck cannibals such as were found in original Wrong Turn outings will be as disappointed as Matthew Modine must be with his current career trajectory, as Nelson's film forgoes these series staples for some odd new angles that seem to have sprung up out of folky horror's like Midsommar as Charlotte Vega's kind-hearted Jennifer and her more annoying friends begin to understand more about the people that roam the uncivilised woods they have wandered into.You never expect anything grand from a film such as Wrong Turn, with films like this needing to be watched with expectations in cheque and brain switched off but we deserve more as an audience than what Wrong Turn provides and as a marketed horror event, this fails in almost all key areas in a marketplace that is filled with far better ways to spend near two hours of your time.Final Say -A scare-free and unimaginative horror outing that fails to justify why it needed to reboot a series that was never that great to begin with, Wrong Turn is a poor way to start off 2021's horror offerings and a glaring reason why this franchise should remain dormant from here on out.1 rampaging log out of 5",Wrong Turn
20,Tweetienator,Too Many Wrong Turns,3,15 February 2021,"This horror movie is so pc or en woky that the director and writer forgot the horror - this German movie is an excellent example of what's wrong with many, if not most, movie productions these days - too many people who have a ""mission"" are involved or people who just ride comfortably and without taking any risk on the wave of zeitgeist. Really, I confess, I was on one side annoyed but on the other side fascinated - in past times people wanted to make a horror movie to entertain and maybe add their footprint into the making of the art of horror. Today, people seem to be contend to ""clean"" everything with total pc stuff and call it creative and progressive (I call it comedy) but just use an overused plot and make necessary woky changes. Orson Wells would have a lot of fun these days. Anyway, back to the movie - production, effects, gore and acting is below average. Wrong Turn 2021 - a movie nobody really needs (besides a certain kind of people). Watch the movie with the same title from 2003 again (no matter if this movie is related to the franchise or not, if not it is a money grabber too) and your time is far better spend.Last note: in a certain sense the title of the movie is what one could be tempted to call prophetic.",Wrong Turn
21,Fella_shibby,A solid turn in the script.,7,19 February 2021,"This reboot and the seventh installment of the series starts with the similar premise where a group of friends go hiking in the Appalachian Trail and inspite of being warned not to wander off, they find themselves captured by a very violent and hostile community of people who have lived in the mountains for hundreds of years.I saw this without watching the trailer or reading anything bah it. I first thot that it might be the usual inbred cannibals eating human flesh and killing trekkers and city fellas but got pleasantly surprised.
It has some brutal kills, tension filled moments but zero nudity.

23,jtindahouse,A highly entertaining fresh start that the series was desperately in need of,9,13 February 2021,"I've always had a soft spot for the 'Wrong Turn' series. Number one and two were excellent, three was okay and five is a guilty pleasure of mine. Four and six however weren't great and were a sign that the series could do with a fresh start and that's exactly what they got here. The original writer came back but the story is quite different this time around - and I really liked it.I think the thing I like most about these movies is that they are inheritantly dark. They are made with a very mean spirit. They are absolutely ruthless with their characters. Characters don't just die, they die painful and agonising deaths, or worse they don't die and are left in a situation of horrible torture. Even though this film has quite a different set up to the original series that same cruelty was certainly present.I liked the characters in this one. Some were likeable, some were detestable and others were middling. But the strongest character was undoubtedly 'Jen' played by Charlotte Vega. She was an ideal heroine that was highly likeable while also multi-layered and bad-ass when she needed to be. Too many entries later on in the original series just simply didn't have good enough characters to carry the film.The only part of the film I'm not entirely sure how I feel about is the ending. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't the ending I wanted. It felt a little sloppy. I'm referring to the entire final scene and not just the very final moments. Otherwise though I had a great time with 'Wrong Turn' and was highly pleased to see some fresh life bred into this series that could maybe give it new life going forward. Check this one out when you can.",Wrong Turn
24,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,30 April 2021,"The problem here are the good guys. They come across as purely horrible people. When you first meet them they irritate you, and they do it in the same vapid way people that have a BA in BS think they educated enough to decide what is best for everyone on earth living in situations they have never experienced....... and that attitude carries over to their interaction with the locals, who they insult and belittle in a way that is framed to almost side with the protagonists.So, when the killing starts, they have annoyed you to the point that you want them to lose, and you want to see the backwoods cannibals eat them... just so you don't have to hear them drone on and on in their pedestrian hipster snobbery any longer.So you there is no suspense, no hope that the protagonists make it out a live, because the film took enough time to make certain they irritate you to no end. And that kills the suspense.And then, on the other side, they muted the backwoods hillbilly cannibals too in both appearance and Deliverance style redneckiness, so there is really nothing grotesque or horrible about them, and, instead, so they really aren't frightening, not so deformed, not at all horrific.In fact, the only thing that makes them remotely decent is the fact that they are killing the other characters that annoyed you to the point you wanted to walk away... about 10 minutes into the film.",Wrong Turn
25,jadavix,"Lame reboot that rips off modern folk horror, but can't even approach its forgettable original in terms of quality",4,14 February 2021,"Here is a forgettable re-boot of all those ""Wrong Turn"" movies, a series which is mostly known for the surprise it evinces when people realise how many of them were made. Most were only aware of the first one, which was itself pretty forgettable: oh, so it's ""Hill Have Eyes"" in the woods, just nowhere near as good.The treatment of this premise here is so far from the source material that you wonder why they even bothered rebooting it. Why not just make a standalone movie, with a different title? The characters here didn't even make a ""wrong turn"" - they went too far into the woods.Furthermore, the movie is clearly inspired by the recent resurgence of ""folk horror"", ie. ""The Witch"", ""The Ritual"", and especially ""Midsommar"". Evoking these movies only illustrates how far this one falls short of them.What no folk horror movie has ever had is a sense of humour. This was what enlivened the Wrong Turn franchise, especially the second one, which was easily the best in that it was a splatter-flick that also served up an effective satire of reality TV.True to its inspirations, this new ""Wrong Turn"" has no humour whatsoever, but nor is it anywhere near as original. It's the seventh movie in its series, after all. The movie has some quick, throwaway scenes that try to establish its cult as an entity to be taken seriously. Who goes to a Wrong Turn movie for that? And if you're in it for serious folk horror, you've already seen ""Midsommar"", which raised the bar for depiction of cults in movies. ""Wrong Turn"" is lower than worm turds.",Wrong Turn
26,stevendbeard,Startling Twist,8,28 February 2021,"I saw ""Wrong Turn"", starring Charlotte Vega-American Assassin, Another Me; Adain Bradley-The Bold and the Beautiful_tv, Riverdale_tv; Bill Sage-Power_tv, American Psycho and Matthew Modine-Stranger Things_tv, 47 Meters Down.
This is the 7th movie in the Wrong Turn series-including the direct to video ones-and it's a reboot of the whole shebang. This one is not connected to any of the other movies-hence, the reboot-with nary a cannibal in sight. Six college aged kids go hiking in the Appalachian wilderness and run into a group of people called, 'The Foundation'. Charlotte and Adain are 2 of the kids that crosses paths with Bill-the leader of the Foundation-and his survivalist followers.When Charlotte turns up missing, Matthew-her father-decides to go looking for her. Instead of cannibals being the enemy here, the Foundation-a group that formed before the Civil War-takes their place as the protagonists. You see, the Foundation saw the war coming and wanted to start a new country after the war was over, so they have been around for hundreds of years. Of course, they also like to wear animal bones and skins as masks and clothes and they like to set traps in the woods, as a way of surviving. If you look closely, there are parallels to be made to the political climate in the America of today; In the kids group you have a bi_racial couple-one is black and one is white-and you have a gay couple to cover the politically correct contingent. On the other side, you have people just trying to live their lives and not be bothered by anyone telling them what to wear or do-ironically, they do love to wear masks here. There are no opening credits but don't leave early. Just as the end credits start, the movie's story continues in the background and there is a startling twist ending.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

The storyline focuses on a group of friends hiking the Appalachian trail in Virginia that get a little too off the beaten path and run into some people living off the land with a host of traps and various problems for the group of friends. This movie is directed by Mike Nelson (The Domestics) and stars Matthew Modine (Full Metal Jacket), Bill Sage (We Are What We Are), Emma Dumont (The Gifted), Charlotte Vega (The Misfits) and Tim DeZarn (Fight Club). This movie is pretty awesome. I'll start there. It was so good it made me watch the first one again directly after to figure out which one I liked better. They're very close. I liked the first one better in terms of storyline; however, I liked the kill scenes and ending in this one far more than the first one. Our screening included an interview with the cast and director and they explained why this had a very different storyline than the first one, and their vision was good, but it wasn't as fascinating as the original; however, the full circle elements at the end is very good (and reminded me a little of The Village). The action scenes and kill sequences were wonderfully intense and gory and a must see for horror fans. My fiancée and I kept looking at eachother the entire movie saying, this is surprisingly good, especially compared to many horror films we've recently watched together. Overall this is far from perfect, but a better than average addition to the genre that is definitely worth your time. I'd score this a solid 6.5-7/10.",Wrong Turn

31,jewelch,Really Liked it,7,21 March 2021,"After the first 2 films in the original Wrong Turn franchise, the quality of the sequels became... questionable? They were good for brainless splatter, nonsensical nudity that border lined on softcover por? and not much else. A reboot was much needed and appreciated.
This is unrelated to the story of the first 6 films but while it's not your typical ""Wrong Turn"", it's absolutely a ""Wrong Turn"" film. It's just added some depth, class and originality into the mix (as well as a bit more budget). And while not a perfect film, it's a massive improvement over at least the previous 4. It's smart, different and solid. As soon as you think you know what's going on, they flip the script and turn the whole story on its head.

33,Pairic,Mountain Horror,8,28 March 2021,"Wrong Turn (2021): Always listen to the guesthouse owner when she warns you about the forest, don't unnecessarily rile up the hillbillies in the bar who in their own crude way mean well. Of course the six New Jersey students on arrival in a small rural town in Virginia ignore all advice. They head off on the Appalachian Trail, drifting off the beaten path. They soon have a deadly encounter with a tree trunk rolling downhill, crushing one of them to death. The realisation that this mightn't have been an accident dawns on them when they encounter traps. Soon they are clashing with strange figures dressed in leaves, skins, antlers and animal skulls. This reboot shifts the dynamic of the previous franchise straight into Folk Horror rather than Killer Hillbilly territory. Literally a lost society, the Foundation, which controls a mountain territory, living primitively but occasionally going to town to sell craft goods. A violent film but not all of the violence is on the part of the Foundation. Heads are bashed literally to a pulp, stabbings, shot with arrows and guns, impaled on spikes in a pit, blinded. Not a film for the squeamish. But there's also psychological horror at work here as the mountain folk emerge literally from nowhere in their camouflage and the tension of the chase rises and falls. An interesting addition to the American Folk Horror Canon. Directed by Mike P. Nelson from a screenplay by Alan B. McElroy. Pay to view on YouTube. 8/10.",Wrong Turn

35,valleyjohn,What's the point?,6,27 February 2021,"Ive seen this called Wrong Turn 7 , Wrong Turn : The Foundation and just plain Wrong Turn . It's supposedly a reboot of the original which was released in 2003 of which I haven't seen but they felt it needed remaking less than twenty years after the original.I'm not sure they should have bothered.Despite warnings to stick to the Appalachian Trail, hikers stray off course and cross into land inhabited by a hidden community of mountain dwellers who use deadly means to protect their way of life. Suddenly under siege, the friends seem headed to the point of no return -- unless one man can reach them in time.To give it it's due , the first third of this film is very watchable. The first section where the dad is looking for her daughter and the scenes where the group have to contend with backward locals isn't bad .
Even the first bit where they are on the trail is interesting, if not a little bit predictable but that's about as good as it gets until the last ten minutes.The whole foundation thing is what makes this movie ridiculous and quite frankly, dull.
As if a community of people would be living secretly in the woods for for 170 years , who picked off people walking The Appalachian Trail wouldn't catch the attention of the authorities, is ridiculous.Also the leader of the group , in fact all the members of The Foundation aren't menacing enough to make the film that scary .I'd have preferred if the film had gone down the Southern Comfort route and it would have just been the rednecks who were picking the group off , one by one .It's not the worst film in the world , in fact it kept me mildly entertained throughout and the last ten minutes are quite fun too.I would imagine this will appeal to true horror fans .
Sadly I'm not one of them .",Wrong Turn
36,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Take with this Reboot,7,20 April 2021,"Now for this movie, I was intrigued when I saw this was coming out. I think the original one is fun and rather enjoy the first sequel. I've only ever seen up to 4 for that original series though. Seeing this was going to go to theaters, at least on a limited basis due to the COVID pandemic, gave me a bit of hope, but it didn't come to one around me. I did finally give this a viewing at home now that the renting price tag has dropped. Aside from that, I just knew this was a reboot. The synopsis here is friends hiking the Appalachian Trail are confronted by 'The Foundation', a community of people who have lived in the mountains for hundreds of years.We start this movie learning that we're in the state of Virginia. Scott (Matthew Modine) is entering town as he's looking for his missing daughter. She disappeared six weeks ago. Her and her friends were hiking on the Appalachian Trail as the synopsis states. This town was the last place she called from and the local sheriff doesn't seem to do anything to help.It then takes us back to the events that get us there. Jen (Charlotte Vega) is Scott's daughter. She is on this trip with her boyfriend of Darius (Adain Bradley). With them are a couple that are engaged to be married of Milla (Emma Dumont) and Adam (Dylan McTee). The other couple with them is Gary (Vardaan Arora) and Luis (Adrian Favela). This group gets a flat tire and while it gets fixed, they rent rooms for a couple nights at a local bed and breakfast. That night they go to a local bar where they have a run in with some locals led by Nate Roades (Tim DeZarn). It is through this we get a better look at the group and learn about them.Jen hasn't found herself. Her father wants her to work for him, but she isn't sure that is it. Darius works with improving communities with inclusion as well as making them stronger. Milla is a doctor. Adam is an app developer and a hot head. Gary and Luis own a couple of bistros in New York City. Adam starts the issues with Nate, but Jen also shows that she can talk her way out of things while also insulting them. On their way back to where they're staying, they see someone looking in their vehicle. Adam throws a bottle at them before calling it a night. Someone is watching them though.The group is told to stay on the hiking trails, but Darius wants to see a local Civil War fortress. This leads them to a place where they see a plaque. With the Civil War looming, some families decided to start a community on this mountain. Darius is intrigued by this, but the rest of the group is tired, hungry and annoyed. It all takes a turn when a tree is rolling down the hill toward them, killing a member of the group. They have to camp out and someone seems to be stalking them still. When they wake up, Milla is missing. They also encounter some people that might be living off the land up here as well. They don't take kindly to outsiders.That is where I'll end my recap of what we're getting in this movie. I'm going to re-iterate that this is a reboot here. We're taking the concept that we got in the original and doing something completely different here. This is still a slasher film, but we aren't getting deformed people through in-breeding. Despite that being taken out, they're highly skilled still in hunting people and quite intelligent on top of that.To start with the positives here, I like the changes that this movie is giving us. It is interesting to start with our group of millennials here. Everyone in the group is doing big things except for Jen. She hasn't found her place yet is all that is wrong there. We see though that she is still quite intelligent and can talk her way out problems. I will say she does get out of the bar scene, but she does upset them in the process. I do like that we have a group of characters here though that are distinct. Having Darius work for a non-profit that comes into play with the community they encounter. Milla is a doctor; Adam despite his attitude is successful and then we also have this homosexual couple that owns their own restaurants. We don't spend much time on this, but I know each of the characters.This last part here though really makes sense as this movie is looking at stereotypes and misconceptions. Jen is college educated, but can change a tire. Nate makes a comment about the group not working hard and that is when Jen goes on her rant which points out that Nate's liver is most likely failing. Adam and the rest of the group make assumptions as well that is wrong about the people of the area. First would be when they see the plaque. They assume it is a bunch of racists that formed The Foundation. Darius points out that it happened before the Civil War though. I'm not going to go into spoilers, but I will say we see the community; it breaks what we think of these people living off the grid like the do here. There are more interesting reveals the more we learn about this community for sure.I do want to go a negative here though with the story, I don't like where they decide to take it. The lead up to all of this is good, but it is after this part that it lost me. Part of my issue here might be that I had something else in my head for movies of this series and we don't necessarily get that. It really does feel like this movie wanted to make more of a political statement than actually give us a more interesting story. I don't want you to think I hated this though. For what they gave us to start with, it just feels the direction they went was wrong for me.Since I've delved into the story and the characters, I'll go next to the acting. I do think that Vega is good as our lead here. She seems so young and carefree, ready to take on the world once she finds her place. I love seeing the change that comes over her in order to survive this ordeal. She does actually find her lot in life. Bradley is good as well. There is the leader of The Foundation who is Venable and portrayed by Bill Sage. I think he's good there. Dumont, McTee, Arora and Favela all are good as the rest of that group. I like the role they have for Modine. Aside from that, I think Daisy Head, DeZarn and the rest of the locals work as well.Then I should next go to the effects. This movie does have a fair bit of practical effects. Most of the blood that I saw looked good. I like the weapons that are used to hurt people. They do a lot with traps. I also really like the camouflage suits that are used. It is legit just taking different things in nature and I dug it. There is some CGI here as well. Some of I'll be honest doesn't work for me. I'm glad they don't use a lot of it though. Aside from that, I really like the cinematography. They used the depth of focus well for me and seeing people appear behind characters is creepy for me. I'll give credit to that.Really the last thing I want to cover would be the soundtrack and sound design. I think both are used well here. It really does feel these characters are lost in the woods. Creating this language that is used within the community also was good. The actual music selections work as well. From what I remember they did use a lot of string instruments and it helps to build the tension. I'm also a big fan of the song they have over the credits which is sang by Modine's daughter Ruby and it is slow, creepy rendition of This Land Is Your Land.In conclusion here, I really think that this movie does some things really well while also dropping the ball as well. I'm a fan of the different take on this series with the reboot. I even think that interesting duality between our two groups of characters work and the social commentary from it. With how good the set up was for me, I think the movie just goes a way that loses my interest. As someone who likes commentary, it seems to want to make a statement more than actually making the movie worthwhile. Again though, it isn't horrible by any stretch. I will also give credit to the cinematography, the practical effects and the soundtrack. Overall I'd say this is over average despite my issues.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10",Wrong Turn
37,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Wrong Turn,6,26 February 2021,"""This can't be happening"". Oh but it is. I just viewed 2021's Wrong Turn. As a horror flick, you'll initially think it's a living, breathing nightmare. Guess what, it's much worse.Wrong Turn is the seventh issue in the Wrong Turn film series. On its own, ""Turn"" is a combination of The Village and The Blair Witch Project coupled with the stylings of early 2000s Rob Zombie. As something about a group of hikers who get lost on the Appalachian Trail and run into a bunch of settler savages, ""Turn"" is tasteless, sadistic, and well, unabashedly nasty. I mean, can you even rate this thing without feeling contrite? I don't know but I'll give it a try.Manifested by a little Stockholm syndrome and the general ability to creep you out, Wrong Turn features a doozy of a long shot ending and an early twist involving the Appalachian mountain men (and women). The pic is edited capably with a few brief flashbacks and the acting is on par with most millennial characters who are in distress.""Turn"" is obviously a visionary work from an unseasoned yet unfettered director in Mike P. Nelson. Nelson not showing restraint or any kind of cinematic tact, pushes the envelope on how callous human behavior can be. His ""Turn"" is not a movie but an experience (I'm not sure if that's a good thing). Let me put it this way, if Mikey's goal was to upset the audience in a ""tusk-y"", ""dueling banjo"" sort of manner, he done did it.All in all, Wrong Turn would be best appreciated if it wasn't part of an 18-year film franchise or came out in the late 90s (before every other slasher redux). To recommend ""Turn"" would not be heedful. It'd be saying that it's just a movie and hey, ""the bloodier the better"". I just can't do that.",Wrong Turn
38,Kamurai25,"""The Foundation of Education""",8,20 June 2021,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This has very little to do with the original other than weird people hunting people in the woods.This movie surprised me quite a bit, I just didn't expect it to take the story form that it did. The cast all did a great job, and the story is well written in layers.The movie also does something I've noticed some movies have been doing somewhat recently where the movie ends, but continues with what feels like a new story, related to the first. Other movies have done this (though much more sloppily) in the past, but I feel like writers have started to do this on purpose, to very good effect.The movie is good at keeping the audience in the dark to what is going on, and being brutal with the characters in rather interesting ways.If you like slasher / horror at all, definitely give this a watch.",Wrong Turn

Their fight for survival & the means for escaping increase as they find themselves hostage to The Foundation who deliver brutal justice to anyone who so much as trespasses into the home in the mountains.I found the film to be a let down. I was expecting it to be pretty good given how well the trailer sold it to me. The characters are unlikeable, entitled Millennials. Within the first 10 minutes of the film you could tell it was set in 2021, as when the group had broken down in the middle of the road did I count a couple of snipping wke messages/actions. I.e, a woman changing a car tyre as a way to make the male driver look emasculated. Classy.The other issues I had with the film was the length, 104 minutes? Seriously? If I recall, the 2003 film was only 87 minutes long. This film is overly beefed up with way too much talking & dragged out scenes which add nothing to the film & leave you feeling frustrated. The action involving the death scenes with the traps was while ace, was too few & far between, even the gore wasn't exactly up to my standard, never mind up to the standard of the original Wrong Turn films.The lacking of the deformed inbred hillbilly's was another let down & have instead been replaced with tribes like people with hypocritical views on justice & lifestyle. I felt the hillbilly's being taken away from this film strayed to far from the original concept of the 2003 original & the 5 sequels that followed.Overall, the film was disappointing, however albeit with the creative traps, alright ending & funny after credits scene I gave it a 4 out of 10. But it overall it's not as good as the trailer leads on to be, the film is far too different & drags on for way too long.4/10.",Wrong Turn

Overall a decent horror.",Wrong Turn
41,arungeorge13,Wrong Turn? Or Underwhelming New Direction? You Decide! [+37%],4,12 February 2021,"The Wrong Turn franchise had progressively gotten worse after Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) to the point of no return. When the screenwriter of the original Wrong Turn (Alan B. McElroy) was tapped to pen a 2021 reimagining, it did get my hopes up. Wrong Turn (2003) wasn't a great film, but it sure as hell created an interesting, larger-than-life trio of disfigured antagonists that set the ball rolling for the gorier sequels. I was curious to see how the writer would take the franchise in a new and unseen direction. Director Mike P Nelson, who helmed an underwhelming The Domestics (2018), lends raciness to the film's first act that actively sustains viewer attention.It's the same ""group-of-friends go missing in the Appalachian backwoods"" storyline but the opening set-piece acquires a 2021 upgrade. The first kill, along with its bloody remains, make you think that our cannibalistic killers are lurking somewhere nearby. But that isn't the case, as it suddenly turns into a bizarre-cult-based thriller with relatively little novelty. The other big letdowns are the performances of the leads (a tad too B-filmish) and the dialogues (downright awful/laughable at times). The antagonists here are just weird people in deer masks - not scary or intimidating enough beyond the very first time we see them.Wrong Turn turns into an even more tiresome flick in its final act, with too many false finishes and twists that fail to make sense. The universe of the antagonists don't intrigue, neither does the action. It all boils down to the 110th minute where the ending literally plays out over the film's credits. It's a shame really; the first 35-40 minutes or so really suck you in - a lot happens in that stretch - characters (of different ethnicities, professions, and sexual orientations) are established quickly, the action is brisk and well-choreographed, and the first few kills are different from what one expects in a Wrong Turn film. The rest of it doesn't even feel like a Wrong Turn film (nope, I did not enjoy the ""inbred cannibals"" reference towards the end) and one would have to forget the original film in its entirety before seeing this one.I did not care to look up who the actors were as none of the performances really stood out. Even their characterizations were pretty weak. The screenplay takes too many pretentious liberties and it's unable to strike a balance between gory, thrilling, and most importantly, entertaining. I doubt there will be a sequel for this!",Wrong Turn
42,omendata,Very Disappointing - Watch the Trailer it has all the best bits!,4,16 February 2021,"After seeing the exciting trailer for this many months ago I was expecting something perhaps as good as the original but sadly all the best bits were in the trailer as per usual.For the life of me I cannot understand the reviewers who say the gore and horror was overkill? I found it one of the most tame and non-scary films I have seen in a long time compared to the palpable horror of the original. For instance the scene where the guy gets crushed by the tree was the first inkling that things were not going to be good as you dont even see the tree hit him all you see is a log rolling then a bang and then the camera pans to a squashed badly made prosthetics head that Stan Winston or Rob Bottin would have laughed at.Then we have the ridiculous cult in the forest who have been around for hundreds of years, it was like a bad cross between The Village and The Wicker Man but none of the horror or good direction of either one; what were they thinking?This was in my top ten Horrors To Watch this year but sadly it goes down as the worst 10 horrors list of the year for me - very disappointing!",Wrong Turn

45,Stephen_A_Abell,Lazy Writing And Stereotypes Hinder The Film And Make It Hard To Take.,6,24 June 2021,"Welcome fellow movie fans to my review of Wrong Turn 2021The Story receives a 1 out of 2:
Foremost, I don't believe Wrong Turn should be called a reboot. Even the title is a tad erroneous. One: nobody in this film takes a Wrong Turn. The group is lost in the woodlands, and their predicament is due to their failings. Two: it retains no semblance to the superior Wrong Turn. The writer, Alan McElroy, litters the script with less-than-subtle hints about backwoods cannibals. But none turned up to the woodland party.McElroy proceeds to bore the pants off the viewers in the first third of the film. He achieves this staleness by giving the audience every stereotype in the book. The local hicks play mysterious instead of merely informing tourists, ""Don't mess with The Foundation folks in the woods. They will kill you!"" No, instead, they cast aspersions of what could or will happen. Naturally, the young 'ens think it's all tourist BS to drum up business, so they shun their advice.Next, you have the locals that dislike outsiders, even though the tourists generate money for the small town. And what little town USA wouldn't be complete without a sexist, racial Sheriff, only too happy to look away when an outsider getting assaulted(?) Yep, welcome to Stereotype-ville.The severest thing McElroy does is present the audience with the near-perfect diversity of friends. Not merely do they include an interracial couple, but we also have an interracial homosexual love-match, and taking up the rear are the bog-standard soulmates. I'm amazed he didn't appoint a couple of the group members with physical and mental handicaps. All of this may sound a little mean and a tad prejudice, but It isn't. I love the idea of a diverse group of friends. However, McElroy and the Director, Mike P Nelson, make it appear more fanciful and more artificial than realistic. I would have loved for them to more natural. God forbid, and Jesus help us if this is the way Hollywood perceives people. For me, this is the most disturbing element of the film.As for the writing, there are more than a few inconsistencies throughout McElroy's script. One of the trashiest being the rolling log scene. Evidently, he hadn't seen HISHE's Prometheus send-up. A tree log has started to roll down a hillside towards you; what do you do? Easy, you move to the sides and watch the bugger roll past you. But what if you're standing in the middle of the oncoming trunks path? Not so easy, but you stand your ground, judge the speed of the log, and then try to jump over it. In the film, the advancing danger is a fair distance from the group, which would provide ample time to move to the sides. Strangely, they opt to run down the hill. The idea isn't a bad one if you run diagonally away from the rolling lumber. Get to one of the sides and observe it roll past. Unfortunately, their lame-ass plan ends up in one fatality; I bet you can guess who dies first. As per the book of stereotypes, it's one of the homosexual guys who kicks the big log. What's extra disturbing is the guy's boyfriend can't shift his gaze from the smashed physiognomy. I'd imagine most paramours wouldn't want that image of bloody destruction to stay with them. But he's not merely transfixed by the gory mess, he's determined not to leave him. To the extreme that he wants everyone to stay. They're astray in the middle of nowhere, but he wants his palls to remain there so ""they"" or ""whatever"", won't snatch his boyfriend away. This guy requires significant psychiatric help before he captures somebody else's heart. The group persuade him it's better to get help, so they leave. He virtually walks backwards through the foliage, so he can constantly regard the beautiful vision of his demolished boyfriend. The kid is the utmost terrifying element of the film.Even though there are way too many poorly written and structured scenes and characters throughout, McElroy does achieve one brilliant piece of writing. He flips the bad guys.In the early stages, we perceive The Foundation members as evil wrongdoers. But they are not what they appear or what McElroy and his group of diversity buddies make them out to be. It's this revelation that infused the script with refreshing life. Up until this point, my attention was wavering and I was laughing at the nonsense on screen. Suddenly, a question confronted me, and a critical one at that. Were The Foundation right in its ways?Regrettably, McElroy swiftly slides in some contrarieties, and I'm back to guffawing. Slipping back into writing discrepancies is a shame because I'd hit a thought-provoking moment. Such moments are glorious things and need expanding. Lamentably, he squandered the opportunity and went back to the more basic foolishness of the narrative.The Direction and Pace receive a 2.25 out of 4:
Fortunately, the direction is marginally more constructive than the script. Nelson isn't as polished or as sharp as some of today's directors, but he isn't terrible. There are a few interesting camera angles. I specifically admired the one where the group discover they've spent the night in a graveyard. We note the camera is fixed at a jaunty angle and placed close to the ground as Nelson gives the audience a beautifully timed slow pull out from a close-up. When the camera halts in the final frame, everything is revealed; the closest is the grass fronds, behind them and to the sides are the gravestones, further back are the group, and behind them stand their tents and the forest. The excellent composition of the scene contributes to the eerie atmosphere. Regrettably, there are too few to push this film above average.The Performances get a 1.25 out of 2:
Only one actor in the cast is memorable, and he is Bill Sage as Venable. This guy possesses some serious screen persona and is perfect for the capable and astute leader of The Foundation. Indeed, when we observe him in common attire sitting at a family table, he is still ominous and oozes danger. It's a shame McElroy didn't break this character out earlier in the script.The rest of the cast do their best with their bog-standard and conventional personas. It's a shame because the heroine of the piece, Jen, portrayed by Charlotte Vega, needed to be stronger and seeing her transformation in a smidgen more detail would have been ideal.And my Enjoyment level hits a 1.25 out of 2:
This Wrong Turn is a picture of two halves. Regrettably, it's the first half that may bore the pants off the viewers and have their thumbs hovering over the off button. I nearly hit off a couple of times myself. However, I was laughing too much at how farcical the scenarios were to push the button.The second half of this movie is the one audiences will enjoy and remember the most; when McElroy flips the switch on the backwood folk's ideology. But, as I stated before, even this possesses pitfalls.These ratings give Wrong Turn a 5.75 out of 10:
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone; it's just too laughable, and the more earnest sections aren't strong enough to hold the narrative. Go and watch the original Wrong Turn it's much better and more entertaining than this hogwash.If you decide to stray from the path, you'll find yourselves at my The Game Is Afoot and Killer Thriller Chillers lists. At this place, you can take note as to where The Foundation Folk found camp in my rankings.Take Care and Stay Well and Get Inoculated.",Wrong Turn
46,gedikreverdi,It's not like Wrong Turn but it's not that bad either,6,1 June 2021,"Jennifer was too apparently the final girl right from the get go. The traps weren't amazing but the score and the actors created a creepy atmosphere. The first guy that was hit by the giant log that's coming down the hill was really creepy with his skulls smashed in. I expected the guys with skulls to be some mutants like the previous Wrong Turn installments but they were just descendants of those who founded the foundation after fleeing from the city thinking America would be annihilated. Jen saved herself and a friend of his by telling them they'd use them but when she tried escaping with his father who also ended up in the foundation as a captive, he didn't want to go but keep being a part of the community. There were many people down in the dark and she shot her friend whose eyes were scorch before leaving. Some from the town helped them get away and they came back home. But the man from the foundation who was his husband and the father of his unborn child came over to her home. She pretended to accept going with them and killed them all in the RV except the little girl.",Wrong Turn

If there is an opportunity for anyone to erase this from existence I really hope they do. Epic fail. But I'll try and give you one example of the terrible writing of this film. So one of the protagonists brutally bashes in one of the faces of these guys thinking they've killed his girlfriend. She turns up alive and well, so realizing their mistake decide in true horror movie fashion they're not going to say anything or go to the police when they make their way out and home. Did they forget one of their friends just had their faces crushed by a falling log 5 minutes earlier? What's their plan? To just go home and pretend like that didn't happen? Maybe just brush that off and make out like they never knew him or something? Terrible, lazy writing in an awful film. This is one example of a film, I mean you can like it on a personal level that's absolutely your choice. But there is no question whatsoever that this is objectively a terrible movie.

53,johannes2000-1,"Reasonably entertaining, with some severe gore",7,7 November 2021,"When the title of a horror movie begins with ""Wrong turn"", you know what you're in for, and here it's basically the familiar premise: a group of clueless young people, out in the middle of nowhere, leave the official path, get lost, and fall into the hands of relentless sadistic people. For a change here the latter are not deranged cannibalistic hillbillies, but a colony of people that for more than a century live hidden in the forest.It's all pretty exciting as long as we follow this group of mostly annoying twenty-somethings through the forest and see how one after another falls into devilish traps and gets horrifically killed, with some hefty gore as a result. But once the colony-people are introduced it gets a bit ludicrous, people looking like scruffy serfs from the middle ages, wearing weird masks and talking in some sort of Scandinavian lingo. Luckily for us they maintain some ruthless laws with harsh death penalties, so we are confronted with some extra gore here, but after that things get a bit tedious. The whole section of the father (Matthew Modine) going into the woods to search for his daughter is a repetition of everything that went on earlier. In fact this dad-storyline doesn't really add anything, the daughter could as easily have escaped without his help.The last sequence of the movie (you know, when traditionally you think that all the horror is over, but it's not!) is really original, especially the ultimate scene, when the credits already roll, so be sure to keep watching!!

60,TwistedContent,"A Welcome New Adventure, Flaws Included",6,20 February 2021,"It's hard being a fan of ""Wrong Turn"" franchise, because for the most part it has not been very great, downhill since day one, a franchise that turned into an ever-growing cacophony of hillbillies slashing and laughing, and teens screaming their guts out. This time around, however, a new page has been turned, as the original writer of ""Wrong Turn"", Alan B. McElroy, returns with his own reboot, directed by Mike P. Nelson, whose first feature ""The Domestics"" made me content with this choice of leadership. Result? Most definitely a different ""Wrong Turn"", new kicks, new flaws.6 friends travel to a small town deep in West Virginia, to endeavor on a hiking adventure on the Appalachian trail, where they will be confronted by the Foundation, or a community of people who have been living in the mountains since the civil war. Meanwhile, Jen's (Charlotte Vega) father (Matthew Modine) is on a mission to find his now missing daughter.Whatever the flaws are, and we'll get there, ""Wrong Turn"" reboot looks, sounds and feels like a pleasant step into a very welcome different direction, and that's without losing tasty trademark violence. A much more self-serious and atmospheric wrong turn than the last five. However, frankly, it could also very nearly be a movie with a different name. The freaky looking hillbillies have been traded in for a tribe of people unaware of world's updates since the 1800's, living as one, under the strict rule of themselves, and their appointed leader Venable (Bill Sage). They clash with main heroes, the millennials, who previously clashed with the other odd gun-toting locals, and here's perhaps the biggest flaw of ""Wrong Turn"" - how it is pumped with a heavy-handed formulaic tale of morality, prejudice, misconceptions, and social commentary of how divided we are. In service of this plot, ""Wrong Turn"" has plenty of typical story coincidences and conveniences happening to steer the ship exactly where needed. The amounts of story threads laid out is apparently a little too much, for some of them go nowhere, and consequently the actually longest ""Wrong Turn"" film to date indeed feels the longest too, as the pacing is uneven, and the third act is a little scattered. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the very ending, however implausible - Don't run when the credits roll. Other than that, 17 years of technological development since the first movie have given us an aesthetically handsome flick, with no loss in style and gore, so visuals ain't the problem at all. Very nicely mossy atmosphere. Acting's neither, although some characters prove to be very thin, and a mere service for a moot point.The latest ""Wrong Turn"" is fresh (for the franchise), adventurous, and atmospheric trip of horrors, very nicely using various nature locations, and giving off slightly medieval vibes leaning into the second half of the movie. Where and how the stories go, might not be awesome or impressive, but if you are knowledgeable of this franchise, I truly believe you won't be majorly disappointed.

Since the beginning characters are warned about a mysterious danger in the forest, and everyone tell them to stay on the main path, but of course, they don't listen and there issues start to arise. I mean, screenwriters were not really creative in setting up the whole story and I was going to drop it. On the second half, when the group is captured by The Foundation, things start to get better: there is a nice twist and by the end it turn to be a decent ""horror"" movie.Acting is all over the place and in general is not very good, with a few exceptions such as Bill Sage and in a some scenes also Charlotte Vega, but I would suggest to the rest of the cast to change career or to take classes, because clearly they are not cut for it.Do not approach ""Wrong Turn"" with big expectations: I was curious how they decided to remake/reboot this franchise.

67,leesimon-26357,Odd choice for the Wrong Turn series,6,25 February 2021,"I can't figure out if being a part of the Wrong Turn series makes this worse, or if I give it some credit for taking the slasher-in-the-woods genre to its 2020s evolution.
The sexually and racially diverse cast of protagonists is definitely a huge bummer. These kids are the most stereotypically douchy millenials that no one likes (unless you are one, and then you still don't like each other as much as compete for wokeness among one another.) And their dialogue is pure, wet garbage. So that was incredibly annoying.
Then it occurred to me that old slashers had douchy teens too, they were just the douchbags of the 1970s-1990s. So it is a good thing that Wrong Turn has evolved its douchbags to today's standards? The same could be said for the ""woodland cannibals,"" updating the concept from uneducated yokels to ""doomsday prepper-types."" It's hard because I don't remember hating the 1970s kids, but I sure hate the 2020 ones.
I would have liked this more if it wasn't associated with the series.
Having said that: good production values, great locations and setting, pretty good gore (though insufficient times,) and good soundtrack throughout.
I also liked the ending.",Wrong Turn

They soon encounter an isolated group of deadly mountain people.2021's Wrong Turn might be the most far removed from the 2003 original. It's much more ambitious and daring. There are a few trip ups in pacing and character building, but it's bold in expanding on the lore while getting quite creative in the process. The narrative can be a little all over the place at times, but the story is a fun direction for the franchise to move in. It's a fun, unpredictable, folksy horror film with some pretty insane and bloody deaths.It's a tale that offers plenty of twists and turns, a few genuine frights and an allegory that, while a little heavy-handed, reflects the current divide in modern day America. It's a smart and gruesome tale of the future vs the past that breathes new life into a franchise that had long-since become a lumbering, grotesque monster.This film is extremely strong on its own merits as a stand alone film and a welcome addition to the franchise.

88,Golden_Hope,A Structural Mess of a Movie,5,7 March 2021,"This movie wasn't awful, to me at least. People seem upset about it because it is being marketed as a remake of the original movie. I have never seen the original so I can't compare however I do know that it is extremely different.I actually think that would have solved a big chunk of the complaints if they had just called it a different name. Not wrong turn. It seems distinct enough for it to be its own thing.For me, I appreciated the ""twist"" because it was refreshing. The way they handled it however was the issue. This movie was being pulled six ways from Sunday in every direction. It's is an absolute mess.It tires to Villainise it's protagonists while making it's villains look good but then chickens out and just scraps it all for a boring story. It has really interesting ideas in here that it just puts out to die. I actually think that the big reveal in the middle of the fun should have been the end. It would have been a real guy punch and really shocking.Speaking of endings, Jesus Christ this film has about 5. Mid way though the first act seems like a climax and I was like ""no this can't be the end yet it's just started"", then again the second act seems like a climax but where was still so much time left. Then you get to the real climax in the third act and it ends...oh no wait it doesn't it goes on again. So then it has this other ending tacked on but no wait that wasn't the real ending either so it carries on again then it finally has its ending and the title card appears....then it still goes on and had another final scene Immediately after the title card shows. That is just insane to me. It was just so structurally bizarre.Even the beginning is strange and feels out of place and should be moved to else where in the movie.This issue also reflects in the run time, this movie is too long for this sort of story. I think they just didn't want to cut things. There is so much that could have just been left on the floor but they wanted it all in, that's why it has 100 endings because I think they thought they were all too good to throw out.You could maybe watch it but don't expect it to be like the others in the series.",Wrong Turn
89,nashw82,A Refreshing Reboot,7,7 March 2021,"While this doesn't follow the cannibalistic inbred tropes of the original Wrong Turn, it is a welcome reboot and a far sight better then every single one of the sequels.
This is clearly updated for the 2020s as we follow a group of educated and diverse individuals and there is not a single inbred hillbilly to be seen. This good looking group of individuals are keen to hike the appalachian trail but a detour in search of a missing landmark leads them into dangerous territory.
The group they encounter is a welcome change from the tired old bad guys of the original series; a community of families living off the grid in a rudimentary but fortified compound.
When the group of college students runs afoul of this community they need to make some life or death decisions. Mathew Modine gives a solid performance as the clueless father in search of his missing daughter who has no idea what he is walking in to. On that note, most of the cast turn in solid performances on both the good and bad sides of the fence.
While it doesn't go anywhere that it is entirely unexpected it definitely gives a welcome change on a tired and worn out franchise. Die hard fans of the original series will (and do) hate it just for being something different.

Anyway, They go in the woods and of all the people, the Black dude has to do the dumb thing that the white people in these movies typically do. Ignore the warnings, do dumb things, go off path. Usually white people do that in these movies. But the only black dude in the main cast has to be the one who gets everybody in trouble. Lol. Eh, im half black. Usually black people dont go camping in the woods or do dangerous stuff. They usually run AWAY from it. Anyway, glad he was cast. It couldve just been all white people in the main cast. So, the liberals start dying in the woods, lol. Wow! Seems so cliche or stereotypical. The sheriff is racist, The locals are racist. That's what it seems. The liberals start dying. I thought they'd all die by the end. So, adam, the most annoying in my opinion. He was so disrespectful and prejudiced towards the locals and everybody! He was so messed up. If anybody deserved to die, it was him. He even tried to hurt the cute girl, Ruthie! She was so cute! His girlfriend was second most annoying. Her screams were so loud, i had to adjust the volume! Glad she died but shouldve been quicker. I felt bad for the gay dudes. They actually seemed like they loved each other. The female lead was very annoying until she converted to the foundation ways. She was SO ANNOYING! But she got smart. She lied for adam and got her gay friend blinded, lol. If she told the truth, that wouldnt have happened! She had to be dumb!She was the exact type of girl who gets on onlyfans. She had TWO MASTERS DEGREES(art history and dance, lol) but before i could mock her for that, she was self deprecating and joked that she makes coffee for a living. Do not get degrees in dumb things like art history and dance! Or psychology unless you get a masters in that but by then, you'll crazier than any future patients. Good luck! Maybe onlyfans is a better option. College is a scam in most cases. Anyway, She was annoying typical white liberal female. But she learned and got smarter. I respected her by the end and was shocked at the ending. Wow! The last 15 minutes were crazy. Unpredictable.I will say that i was surprised that there were black people in the foundation. That was cool. I read a review that said this was pro trump movie?! DUMB REVIEW! How was this pro trump?! What?! I guess some people are obsessed about trump, lol. Wow! I thought the writing interpretation of virginia locals were slightly over stereotypical but whatever. And the fools hating on this because it's not like the other wrong turns, that's dumb! I havent seen those other films, but i dont think they'd make me want a remake to them. This was great! Maybe they shouldnt have marketed as a remake but I liked it. Wasn't perfect but it was good! Definitely above average. Glad the victims died, well some of them.Edith was so HOT! Even if she stank from never taking a bath, she was so sexy and beautiful. I want Edith as my wife! Lol. Her sister, Ruthie was adorable and smart enough to know who was friendly and not. She wasn't scared of Jennifer, even by the end, when most children would've been after all the madness. Again! The black dude was so DUMB! Lol! He couldve been working at wall street making millions but wanted to work non profit?! Lol! Dumb! And he lead his friends to their doom! Lol. Fun movie! Not predictable.Oh yeah! Another really big issue i had was with the Paid hunter dude and his son! They were the ones who should've survived but they died so fast!

If you are here just to have a good time and have cannibals go after the protagonists then you will 100% be disappointed because this film is completely different.

""Wrong Turn: The Foundation"" changes up gears and a man of New Delhi heritage is the first to die horribly in those damn woods and in broad daylight.
Look away it's gruesome.
Did someone yell, ""Timber!""
Fun Fact: Daisy Head plays a member of The Foundation and is also in real life the daughter of Anthony Head from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". He starred with Eliza Dushku who was the lead actress in the original Wrong Turn (2003)
""Wrong Turn: The Foundation"", as its known in Oz, is a clever mash up of ""Midsommar"", ""The Village"" & ""The Hills Have Eyes""
Yes there will be Cannibalism, Inbreeding, Torture, Unique Killings and Buckets of Gore in this intelligent, classy, horror, thriller.
So be prepared or just hide under the cinema seats.
Remember This Land is Their Land, so NO trespassing allowed or there will be consequences and a Kangaroo, or should that be Deer Court.
This so-called ""reboot"" of the series is not directly connected to any of the first half a dozen movies.
Other than the link with Alan McElroy.
The original screenwriter and creator of the first ""Wrong Turn"" is back in his dark as night cage sweating away over a hot iMac and HP Printer.
Don't leave early because the film continues during the closing credits and points in the direction of a possible sequel.
Crazy I know!
The films title doesn't even appear until the end of the movie, which seems to be trending in 2021.
This franchise is just like that song that never ends...it goes on and on my friends.

The only thing this has to do with the original franchise is that this movie references it in one throw-away line towards the end - blink and you miss it - so it was bound to piss some people off. It doesn't really even make sense for this movie to be called ""the wrong turn"" - no wrong turn was made, since they intentionally wander off the road repeatedly, they don't actually choose the wrong way to turn, like it was in the original ""Wrong Turn"" movie, so they pretty obviously only did name the movie this way, to catch more attention.

It is so condensed at the end that the important ending is still rolling when the credits start. Having said that, the ending is one of the best redeeming qualities of this movie, so if you managed to stay awake during the first 115 minutes of the movie, make sure not to miss the ending. It is actually good!The original story from the original movies have been drastically altered. Is it for better or worse? I would say it is not a good choice, especially if you are going to call the movie ""wrong turn"" as a reboot. The movie is not as scary or gory as the rest of the series and definitely not as other horror movies. It is almost amateuristic at times and very cliche (stupid and hysteric characters, bad police, etc) the acting is good enough to keep you watching but it is not actually good at any point.A sad thing about this movie is that it extends a big-ol' middle finger at the fans of the original 'wrong turn' and that you should not do. It is a mixed bag of things you've seen before (like the excellent Midsommer and Antebellum) but not done nearly as well. At the end the production quality, the weird paste and the 'B quality' of the movie, made me rate it the way I did. I won't tell you not to watch this, but do come in expecting a 2nd-tier movie.

It's almost as if they tried to pass it off as a remake to gain attention, but most certainty just caused lots of disappointment.I will admit it is decent as a stand-alone movie, but not anything fantastic.

I thought with Matthew Modine in it the film would have something of interest and while its true his scenes at the start lend the film some depth the rest of it is a bit of a mess.You don't really get to know any of the characters before the film starts, its like they thought having an ethnicity diverse cast was all they needed to do to save having to write different characters.There was some attempt to update the 1960's origins of 'a bunch of local yokels meet some city folk they don't like' but the writing is just pretty poor throughout. the 'make up' isn't very convincing either and when you are watching a scene often the lighting alters half way through and then goes back again.

I was expecting a reboot of the original 2003 Wrong Turn. Story is completely different and it doesn't involve red neck cannibals. So I was surprised that I was watching something where I didn't know what was going to unfold.5 teens/ young adults go on a hiking trip in Virginia, insult the locals in a bar by referring to them as rednecks. This draws negative attention to them. The following day they go on a mountain hike, warned by the motel lady to stick to the trail, obviously they don't and a trap is triggered by one of them, this results in a horrible accident and they can't find their way back to the trail. They then realise that they are being watched and possibly hunted. That's as far as I can go without spoilers.It was a watchable thriller (not so much a horror) I don't want to spoil the plot, but it had it's good moments minus a few bad. I'm just not sure why they have named it to look like a reboot.

It is nothing more than backwoods misery. The ""gore"" people are claiming to be something special was in fact nothing special. Why should we care about these characters that die so fast and are meaninglessly mistreated, when our lead character is so willing to join the bad guys and become corrupted herself. This movie wishes it was an edgy 70's exploitation film, but there's nothing to really like or love about this film. The plot is pure misery, the characters, are pure misery. There is also zero connection to the other Wrong Turn films. I didn't hate it, I was entertained briefly, but by no means can I bring myself to ""like"" this film. It was just not very good. Really nothing great to write home about here. Why make a film that is just pure awful misery? Can't there be some redeeming quality other than revenge. I much prefer the campy original Wrong Turn with Eliza Dushku, at least that film knew it's job was to entertain. Glad I only Redbox'd this film and nothing more. Miserable story.

I'd rather they maximised on the cult side and minimised the whole ""teens going on a trip and getting lost in the woods"" side.The ending was a bit all over the place as well, it seemed like there were ten endings all rolled into one, just when you think you're going to see that fade to black, something else crops up. I'll give it points for keeping my attention, having some nice twists and turns, and for it being a well shot and acted production though, it's just a shame that it feels like there was a real missed opportunity with it that it didn't take.",Wrong Turn
142,jimwt66,This is not a sequel for Wrong Turn,4,12 September 2021,"It was not a bad movie but it lost a star for trying to pass this off as a sequel and it lost a star for the dumb ending. They should have made this as a separate movie. I would say the movie Deliverance is closer to this movie than Wrong Turn is. But it would also be a disservice to Deliverance.I thought this was going to be another ""redneck"" gone bad film the way they started. If anything, it leaned towards the millennials being in the wrong and deserving of what they got, except for the ending.They said in the movie that the people in town leave the people in the mountains alone and they leave town people alone. Were the mountain people really going to kill them or do as they claimed? I don't know which and with just going what we can prove, the millennials were the murderers and were subject to the punishments given out.One could argue that as long as people left them alone they had an perfect lifestyle. They said they had no cancer or disease, everyone was judged on their actions and not their looks. Everyone chipped in and helped their society survive. They even allowed the millennials to change their sentence to staying and helping the community.I disagree with the ending. It should have ended with them escaping or being killed while escaping. Once again it was not the Foundation that were the aggressors. We all know that most movies would make it harder for them to progress if the actors made smart choices so of course they have to make stupid choices.Being told to stay on the path because you may not come back if you stray...What do they do? Go off path. Then it just goes downhill from there with the hikers being in the wrong. Were the punishments the Foundation handed out harsh, sure. Were they deserved, I lean towards yes. The guy killed the Foundation member when there was no proof that the Foundation member did anything wrong. Then they finally all agreed to not say a a word about it. Then when the hikers are on trial they are warned not to lie about who killed the Foundation member. What do they do, lie. In some areas killing someone gets you the death penalty. If you participate in anyway in a federal crime you are also guilty of that crime, even if you are just someone who helps hide it.Anyway, it was a decent movie if it was on it's own. It was in no way a Wrong Turn sequel and should be forced to change the name.",Wrong Turn

This film is not titled 'Wrong Turn 7"" for a reason. They're simply using the namesake because they own it, and because they know it will get more attention, & word-of-mouth from potential consumers that way. The idea is to produce an updated/fresh version of a horror movie in which a group of attractive young people inevitably take a ""wrong turn"" in situation in which horror ensues. This film does just that in spades . The kills are original, and the plot is different than the normal deliverance type situation you might expect them to get into. This film should be viewed & reviewed on its own merits, & not because you didn't do your homework before watching it to figure out it's not a sequel or a remake. It does what it set out to achieve in thrilling & unpredictable ways. Everyone who is complaining that it's nothing like the earlier films are correct-this film is not a sequel, nor is it a remake- one has nothing to do with the other. The movie itself is a decent horror movie in its own right. I'm tired of seeing ppl give it such unfair ratings & reviews when, in reality it's really a very above average horror movie. It may not reinvent the wheel, but it's definitely got enough edge-of-your-seat action with great newly inventive kills. I really enjoyed it. I'm actually glad I looked at these poor reviews before watching the movie because my expectations going into it were so low, and I was very pleasantly surprised.

The story sets when a group of friends while hiking they are confronted by people of the mountains. The original Wrong Turn (2003) was a good film and over the years it became a film series. The sequels were never in the level of the first film, every single one was bad and it mostly became movies to watch mostly for the gory kills. I was surprised when they announced a reboot because I thought this film series should have been concluded along time ago but at the same time, I was curious if they could somehow save the storyline. I wasn't eager to watch it but I was expecting a great film.This reboot could have been magnificent but it wasn't because the main focus of the film was targeting the reality of the social-political problems in an ignited triggering way. This film was a total mess from the start by having characters without direction and forcing upon that concept. The first hour was dreadful to watch but after that hour the film finally got so entertainingly good. The main character made the other half of the film fantastic to watch and during that time it felt finally like a fresh Wrong Turn film. The ending was incredible and so badass, it made me yearn for the film to not end but it doesn't erase how badly the story started to unfold. They chose the wrong way to tell an origin story for this new take of the Wrong Turn and if it wasn't focused on the social-political it could have been a great film to start this reboot.The composer Stephen Lukach brought the right kind of music to build up the perfect suspense even though the script was not good the music gave me chills throughout the scenes.The main cast performances were all over the place and I can't truthfully say anything negative due to the bad script mainly towards the underdeveloped tangled background of every character. Although I can say that after the first hour when it finally stopped taking roots over the political issues, there were two main actors who were magnificent Charlotte Vega and Matthew Modine.

How do you even rate a film like this, which pretends to be part of a franchise, written by the original entry and called a reboot, which only resembles the source material in location & title? When the film tries to act like an entry into the franchise the dialogue and characters are cardboard and cliche. Then, when it becomes something different about half way through, it becomes more interesting and creative, but at the sacrifice of betraying its audience. This seems like it was a separate script, which some suit thought was ""close enough"" to Wrong Turn and decided to rope it into that franchise to sell it in a harder film sales climate. The film concept isn't bad, but I'm angry that I was fooled to watch it. Ironically, this writer started his career with ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"", a film which had to make sure audiences knew the lead villain had returned after part 3 audiences rebelled when they went to the cinema and Myers was no where to be found.

After finally getting around to that and sitting through the entire film, It's difficult to sit here and say what I thought of it. This version of Wrong Turn is totally different from the original franchise and threw me a curveball that I was not expecting given the direction that it took. If you separate this film from the originals it's actually a decent and fun horror movie. I don't personally believe that this film should've been titled Wrong Turn but thats just me. Given how different this film is, it still suffers from unlikeable characters and excels in gnarly gore and genuinley scary scenes much like the older films. This is a movie that gets better the longer you have it on. When the film began I was pretty hesitant but by the end it had totally won me over. It takes a bit of patience to get to the good stuff but Wrong Turn does get there... eventually.",Wrong Turn
162,misanthr0pist,An impressive reboot of a fun franchise,6,22 February 2021,"Really torn about this one. There's a lot to love, and a fair bit to be disappointed by.First off, the set design and (especially) costume design was top notch; and easily my favourite part of the movie. Overall story was entertaining and it didn't drag, which I was a little worried about, characters were likeable enough, though not very developed. I also appreciated the fact that there weren't too many jump-scares, and it wasn't *as* predictable as I expected. It also didn't rely on too many horror movie cliches which was also welcome.Unfortunately, the writing verged on the edge of laughable in some points, which nearly ruined the film for me, and the third act kind of fell apart. It also seemed to shoehorn in one-too-many of the PC checkboxes, which felt out of place and almost forced.All in all, I enjoyed my time with this one for the most part, though I probably won't be rewatching it soon.",Wrong Turn

She is a smart and resourceful badass. I also like how they took it in a completely new direction, so I didn't know where it was going.The character development on many characters could absolutely be way better, but at least I cared about the most important ones.When the credits rolled I was very happy I gave it a try, so I recommend if you're fine with a slightly clishéd horror, but with a twist that leaves you satisfied.",Wrong Turn

This is not a sequel to any ""Wrong Turn"" movies, it is a reboot. That doesn't have to mean that everything is the same as in the former installments.And you know what? I actually commend the filmmakers for taking a different approach this time. Unfortunately, some seem to be that well-trained at accepting the same story with every reboot that they can't understand how someone can get a bit more creative for a change.Don't get me wrong - this is not a great movie. Some would argue that it's not even a good one, but all I know is that this is at least watchable, unlike so many reboots and remakes - or Captain Marvel.There is actually a lot happening, even if the film slows down a little too much at times. But the cinematography good, the soundtrack a bit generic but decent, the acting mostly pretty good - and there are some pretty gruesome deaths to behold, although never in a voyeuristic way.Forget about the original and open yourself up for something new, I'd say.

166,TruView,A DARK film with meaningful subtext,10,12 September 2021,"The average moviegoer might fail to appreciate the nuance in some of the harrowing depictions of this production. Even as the title hints a cautionary tale, it will not be enough to prompt more than a passing glance. We often forget and thereby find it harder to believe that life can easily devolve into petulant acts of cruelty and backwardness; which can then be made to appear like wise old forms of arcane law. Of course the real skill of the writer(s) is evidenced in the concealment of that truth within a damning but serviceable half-lie: Individuals of modernity vis a vis trenchant and abject beliefs seeking to turn the clock backward will likely yield to cowardice instead of persevering despite the odds.This will be the second film that I rate a 10. Its stellar execution as a suspense-thriller is only slightly above average but its realistic performances by relevant cast members adds to the film's overall credibility. Even more impressive, is how it convincingly argued the values of the mountain folk so contrary to our own. There's also something that was said in one of the earlier scenes between the quiet embrace of two lovers discussing life plans. That same something is alluded to later on, significantly impacting circumstances. Character foibles add greater context, enriching the story well beyond surface level entertainment. Lastly, the graphic violence and barbarism of the mountain people visited upon other unsuspecting hikers send a startling jolt of reality down one's spine reminding us that people go missing all the time for a variety of reasons. And NOT all of them are actually dead -even if they are presumed to be. This will definitely be one of those films I come back to over he years.",Wrong Turn

2. The franchise takes an interesting turn (as per the trailer) and it's ""okay"". The lead villain is actually a decent actor and pretty creepy but we didn't sign up to Wrong Turn for this. We want hillbillies.

The fact people know about the ""bad"" people and that they murder others, and they choose to leave them there is just stupid too.

Where to start, because certainly this film was a mixed bag, you've got some truly gruesome scenes, but the in between scenes do get a little slow, though this reboot does give a new take on the original franchise, replacing inbred hillbilly's with the foundation, who are basically a cult from pre civil war. The film was certainly enjoyable but the moments where the film kinda stalls has made me reflect more over the film itself. I would probably recommend this film as really for a horror film and for being a new take on the wrong turn series it definitely lived up to these points, but what bothered me were the slow points and the ending bit with the dream like sequence, if we'd cut the dream sequence before the actual ending I would have been happy. I would definitely have to say this reboot was welcome, I'm torn however over the star rating, whether a 6 or a 5.5, these are the moments I wish half stars were an option.

The Wrong Turn movies are about mutant, deformed, inbreed cannibals that hunt down hikers. This movie was about escaping from a backwoods cult. It has no connection to the other Wrong Turn movies whatsoever. They should have just called it ""Off Trail"" or something. There is literally no reason to call it a Wrong Turn movie or connect it to them in any way, because it's not and has no connection. It's like, imagine if you went to see a sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien movies, and instead of Xenomorphs, Face-Huggers, and Chestbursters, we got something like Independence Day. Yeah, they're aliens but it's most definitely not part of the franchise and has nothing to do with it. But if using another series' popularity wasn't enough, it wasn't even that good of a movie.

184,sorendanni,"Should not been in the Wrong Turn franchise, but Antebellum fans will like!",9,5 July 2021,"I was quite a fan of the original Wrong Turn (2003). So I fully understand all the die hard fans who find this new one a disapointment. The problem is that this is an actually unrelated story and story telling, pretending to be a Wrong Turn remake/reboot. I think this is a shame, because as a standalone film, this one is very good.Where Wrong Turn from 2003 was a teenage slasher pure sang, this is a completely different kind of Thriller. The new film is a complex one, with layered storylines and underlying social messages. I found especially interesting the background: the locals in a sleepy town in Virginia choose to live with a dangerous cult in the woods, rather than having a Federal intervention and some FBI intervention.Much of the background is actually about the relationship between 3 diffrent groups in America today: Left-Liberal Jankees from the North, Right-AntiGov Working Class in the Deep South and then the Anti-American cults and closed communities that completely move away from society and established their own system. This is quite a lot more compared to the encounter with the Inbred Rednecks in the original.Therefore, I believe that the new film has much more in common with the folloing recent American Arthouse Horror films: Get Out! Us and Antebellum. This is very different from what the fans of the Wrong Turn franchise are used to and I would have just given this movie a different title. This is a movie for a very diffrent group of thriller fans!However, if you can put yourself over this unfortunate choice, and most of all if you are a fan of Antebellum, then you have a great film! The new Wrong Turn was interesting, unpredictable and with many plot twists during its full run. Everything is very nicely filmed and the acting is of very high quality.

This is not a wrong turn film.,2,14 February 2021,"I came here to see teens (that are actually adults pretending to be teens) getting killed by disfigured-mutant-hillbilly cannibals! What is this film????Look, I saw the adverts and assumed they were trying to ""update"" the Wrong Turn franchise by injecting some form of realism/modernity to it. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""mutant-hillbilly cannibals and realism?"" Lol yeah, I know, it's ridiculous, the words go together like ice cream and flies, although, depending on how many legs you have you might enjoy that (Rick and Morty reference), but the marketing really made it feel like it might be a gritty reimagining.I was wrong, the marketing lied, this is not a gritty reimagining, it's a movie that should be called ""THE FOUNDATION"" a wholly different movie that has nothing to do with the Wrong Turn franchise and would warrant a score of about 4 out of 10. However, they tried to use the Wrong Turn name to get an audience, so it gets a 2 out of 10. It's crap in its own rights, but by taking a series name I enjoyed (as bad-fun films lol it's not like the series was winning any awards let's be real here) it's probably put the final nail in the coffin. Thereby killing the franchise for good.Dissecting the film:- The main characters are caricatures of what it means to be a millennial. Basically, they're what an out of touch boomer might consider a millennial to be like if they investigated millennial behaviour solely from twitter. It's poorly written and there's a setup for a twist that's so obvious it may as well have come to my house and crapped in my toilet between my legs as I was crapping.Oh! And don't expect gore on the same level as previous entries. They cut away from every kill (the impact part) and then cut back to show the aftermath. This was a bad choice, cutting away has never been something a true slasher fan will enjoy; we want the visceral gut punch that is blood, organs and disfigurement. It's a shame because the makeup's actually pretty good.TLDR; The main cast are caricatures created by a boomer that investigated ""being a millennial"" by browsing his twitter feed, the script is weak and drops everything already familiar to the Wrong Turn series. The twist is lame, and I could fart a better idea into existence on my worst day.

The ""Wrong Turn"" films are at their best when it's a cat and mouse game in the woods. Unfortunately, that's only the first third of this way-too-long film. The second act sharply jumps off the rails and takes us to kangaroo court. And the third act shows us that it only takes a month and a half for a millennial who runs a sustainable energy non-profit to be brainwashed into being a living-off-the-land backwoods hillbilly who doesn't belong in the real world. The rest is Mrs. Indiana Jones trying to escape the temple of doom with her father, all the while avoiding hidden away genetic rejects which inbreeding in the ""colony"" created. Oh, and the townie rednecks (who beat up her father for, like... existing?) show up to help too, because why wouldn't they.Then, wait a minute... could it be? Yes! A fourth act! Ten minutes before the credits roll we see daddy and daughter (with baby on the way) living well and preparing for pizza and popcorn night! Until, of course, the ""colony"" shows up next door (wearing plaid, no less) and kills the whole family. Or... just kidding! The family's fine. But the plaid is unfortunately real, and apparently convincing enough to bring mama-to-be back up the mountain. Except... more kidding! 'Cause she ends up killing the whole clan just as the drive back starts, save for the little mute girl.

You have to sort of suspend your belief on on several things that go on in the movie to thoroughly enjoy it.I watch a lot of horror movies and I didn't see where this one was going all the time which was refreshing! It really is an intense movie! Honestly, I think it would have made a great Tv show or miniseries because there are so many interesting characters we're introduced too and the movie takes so many twists and turns.The acting from everyone was very good, the actors made some of the more unbelievable parts a little more believable. The woods actually looked pretty creepy, even in the day time! I liked the idea of the backwoods cult-like community. I thought ""Venable"", the leader of the community was especially creepy-actually he scared me more than any of the people dressed up in camo and animal bones!There were some things that kept this movie from being excellent... I found it really hard to believe that no one outside that little town had been able to find that rather large community in the woods, it couldn't have been THAT hidden or far off the trail since the group of friends were able to hike close to it pretty easily and even a group of town locals drive their truck right up to where the traps were set! After being rescued the movie skips forward SEVERAL WEEKS and a lot didn't make sense: why didn't they tell the police about the community? Were they not questioned about the whereabouts of Jens friends? There were several prisoners left and they also just left Jen's boyfriend at the community even though he was likely suffering from being brainwashed-Those people needed rescued! I think they should have could have something on the radio/news announcing that the community was found or something like that right before the events of the very last scene, it really would have made much more sense!Despite some of the more unbelievable things that go on in the movie, its pretty good!

There are no cannibals thankfully as in 2021, I don't think a movie of that vibe will be as well received as they were back in the 00's.However, it's still a good watch and the storyline worked.

We're asked to care about these people? This is 'stupid villains' vs 'pagan viking villains'. Who do we care about in this mess?2. These poorly written badly realised characters are lost in the woods after leaving the trail to find a ""well-preserved confederate fort"" or some bull. Well, they're without a map, they aren't accessing a GPS app on a phone, and there is no plot development as to when and where they got this information, not even a whiff, to help the audience become interested in this detour.3. In fact, mobile phones in general - not one of these morons tries to access the GPS on their phones at any point while they still had them, unbelievable. Also, lost in the woods, sleeping in a tent, before going to sleep all these guys would have been trying their phones and their phones would have been with them in their tents. There could have been excellent and believable scenes in which their phones don't work for some reason, and some apparently supernatural element allows the Foundation to get their phones away from them.4. If a giant log is rolling toward you, run to the side. Running away from the log in the same direction the log is rolling will ensure your death, DUH! If the writer cared to try, there would have been a Foundation local in a tree or something that strikes one of the hikers with an arrow so that he ends up trapped between the tree and the rolling log while the rest of the group narrowly escapes sensibly by running perpendicular to the rolling log's path. Are we to believe the giant rolling log is a 'deer trap'?!4. They guy that's trussed up after being snared on a chain and dragged through a pit of venomous snakes has every right to strike out at his apparent attackers. The writer is asking for sympathy in a situation that couldn't have garnered any toward characters that everyone already thoroughly hates. That's just dumb.5. These radical pagan apparently iron-age Foundation people sure have a lot of makeup and 'salon hair' going on. Not believable.6. Oh yeah, and, ""Don't kill us -- You need non-profit administration and infrastructure!"" I'm not joking here, they really try to be addressed by the pagan viking Foundation people with the promise of skills in non-profit administration and infrastructure!?7. Stupid Dad has a gun with no extra ammo and he's outnumbered so he shoots three of his six rounds into the air? Bad writing and directing.8.

It is, an unoriginal mean spirited and cheep series of Hicksploitation trash. They are nothing more, than cheep cash grabs, with no soul. This is hardly the only undead horror franchise, that just churns out sequel after sequel, direct to the bargain bin. But, unlike Amityville or Hellraiser, which started out with great movies, considered classics, the first Wrong Turn was a bland forgettable, Texas Chainsaw ripoff with no heart. So, you can imagine my surprise, when this latest instalment turned out to be genuinely good. It takes the tired premise of the original and flips it on its head. Instead of another, group of brain dead party people, we get a diverse group of characters with personalities and goals. You feel much more for people like this, than the bland cardboard cutouts, we normally get in horror nowadays. It also means, you suffer with them, instead of just wanting them dead. This movie isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's an entertaining fun ride, with its roots planted deeply in folk horror. I'm not going to spoil any of the plot, because I think you should go into this movie blind and let it happen to you. If you like folk horror with a message, then you'll be in for a treat.

When however one of the guys (who looks like Christian Pulisic) gets captured, the movie turns into an utter mess.He is being carried by two people (who conveniently don't speak English, which all the other tribe members do), and then escapes and kills one of the two tribe members.All his friends aren't happy he escaped or anything, but just shocked how he can be such a bad person, and completely turn on him. WTF?Later in the movie they are all being trialed by the tribe, and the tribe boss claims, they never intended to kill the guy they captured, but only to bring him to the road and help him... WTAF? How should we believe this, if they have killed everyone else they captured?When asked why he did that, and if they had done anything to warrant a tribe member being killed, the friends just stupidly look at one another, and feel in the wrong...
Did they forget that two of their friends had just been killed? BY TRAPS OF THE TRIBE? Forgot to mention. Whoopsie!There is a lot of other crap, but the worst other thing I want to mention, is passage of time.Nothing feels, like a lot of time passed, besides longer fake beards.

How long was the father in the village for?This is all presented very poorly.Also, they always talk about this being a huge mountain, where this tribe lives. But is it? It all looks like a normal forest.Idk, this is not a good movie and really fell apart in the second half.It is not a Wrong Turn, really. No mutants, no taking a wrong turns.

It was still relentless and brutal survival horror but it took some twists and turns that I was not expecting. It's still a ""a diverse group of teens head in to the woods, take a Wrong Turn and run in to the wrong people"" movie but by the end has become a very different beast. They probably shouldn't have called it Wrong Turn but it is the original writer and he has absolutely updated the formula here. I really like this iteration.",Wrong Turn

A lot of suspenseful, jaw-dropping moments that made us react. The filming was brilliant and the back story was fascinating. It's crafted and presented in a way it almost makes you wonder if a society like it could actually exist. There is a lot of intellect that went into the movie that makes you feel like you are there. The cinemaphotography is excellent. The acting is believable minus a couple of moments. All in all we were more than impressed with it.

To be honest (had they changed a few aspects) I could see this being worked as a prequel (they definitely didn't try for that angle though).I all but hated the original and thought that this was quite well done! As a stand alone movie, it has reasonable pacing, likeable characters, and a decent story.Yet, even though I didn't like the original, I also had hoped to see how they would've revamped it. I was looking forward to how cool they could've reworked it all.Was this movie groundbreaking? No.Did it feel like part of the Wrong Turn franchise?

But half way through we enter a strange community of a confederate doomsday cult complete with their own customs, laws and a barbaric justice system. It was so well done you could actually see their point of view and understand why the boyfriend might choose to stay. Our heroine really held the movie together, transforming into a believable Katniss-type figure with impressive bow and arrow skills. It was also highly unpredictable the way the guy from the bar turned out to be a good guy, and the hired hunter met an unexpected end. I also loved the twist at the end just when we think life has returned to normal, the founder himself shows up at her house. On the downside the acting was hit and miss especially from the father and the cute kid. Also the dialog was a bit too basic and the invented language brought an unwelcome humorous tone to the courtroom scene. 7/10.",Wrong Turn

I wouldn't want to be related with a project such as this.I can't say anything good about it. It is just terrible written, bad acting and overall a mediocre story. Here are some inexplicable things:How it is possible that the authorities haven't investigated the place. There are multiple reasons for that. The so called Foundation isn't as isolated as it seems, so if many people is gone missing in the area and the place is crawling with traps the logical thing to do would be investing.Why the crazy ones have created a new language? We are told that they founded the town because the believed in some sort of apocalypse thing. So they should be speaking English. What is the point in changing the language? I will tell you: no point whatsoever, like the whole movie. Besides, some people speaks English, why some do and others don't?When the father goes to find his daughter to the mountain with two of the locals one of them tell him that he is some sort of an expert, and that they have to watch out for traps. Next scene he isn't leading but instead following his buddy, and of course, he fall into a trap and both die. Wonderful. And why the father would take the rifle and the pistol when he can just take the pistol... There is no danger right?What's up with the boyfriend of the daughter? He decide to stay in the foundation. Why? They are just crazy. Is this the anarchist society he was hoping to create at the beginning of the movie? Just... (sigh)So what is the point in having walls if you don't have any guard? And if they are so isolated and self sufficient why the hell they go to town to sell cheap jewelry? Why do they need the money for.the end is just stupid. The daughter has a baby with the foundation's leader and when she run away he goes looking for her. He introduced himself as the new neighbor to the her political family and then there is a scene when they start fighting, but it is just a dream or something. But then she goes with him to prevent further killings just to kill the leader and their companion in the caraban they use (because isolated crazy tribes know how to drive them)If you can read this review just avoid this like the plague.

Not another one of these...But then a funny thing happened. Around the 45 minute mark, the movie actually got better. It became more interesting in terms of pacing, story direction and even acting. I didn't really know what to expect at that point.But I was not expecting my displeasure with the first 30 minutes to be abated - I was convinced it was going to be yet another mediocre, self-congratulatory millennial fest of tawdry predictability, but I was pleasantly surprised by the switch in quality and overall delivery of this film about halfway through. Very unusual to have that happen.The acting also seemed to get better. I don't know if this was due to the lack of other screeching banshee characters being killed off or if there was a new director halfway through, but the protagonist had me believing her role much more toward the end of the film than at the beginning. She seemed to have found the character and became much more comfortable with it.Originally, I was going to rank this one as 2 stars simply because of the nauseating ""diversity"" checklist Hollywood likes vomiting into movies these days and the 2-dimensional meat target characters we are supposed to like, but if you can stick it through beyond the first 30-45 minutes or so, you may be pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a well-done movie.There are also a couple of small twists towards the end - not badly done!",Wrong Turn

Don't Watch,3,9 February 2021,I really don't want to spoil anything and I really don't want to give anything away but coming from a guy that's been watching horror movies since a kid. watching the original Stephen King IT' John Carpenter's Halloween' Freddy Krueger' Jason' The hills have eyes. etc... this reboot is officially dead and I really don't want to go into a lot of details explaining everything but I did finally get to see this movie. thank God I did not pay $15_30 at the theater. I had to spend days hours searching the internet and I finally came across a free movie site and I got my hands on it and like I said this is probably one of the most disappointing horror remakes in the history. I'm not going to say that this is the worst movie ever but it's certainly not the best movie ever. they must have paid people to do goid reviews 8 9 10 star reviews.this movie coming from a guy like me that loves horror movies. I'm giving my fair honest review rating and I wouldn't give this movie anything past 3 stars. it is a shocker of Total disappointment.1. if you're going to expect to see cannibals or horror or blood or gore like The originals don't expect it. this reboot there's not many things in this movie that I can say that are good..2. the music was bad. the actors were bad. the songs were bad. they had crappy directors and producers . I think they spent a good share of the money or the budget on making this reboot movie a disaster . there was no good story made. hopefully this will make sense but overall I think they wasted their money on a reboot where they should have kept it like the originals.3. this movie is just so disappointing and they say it's a rated R movie. I wouldn't give this movie anything more than PG or PG-13 and as I keep saying. don't expect to watch this movie thinking you're going to get the real original 2003 cannibal type Horror blood movie because it's nothing like it.4. yes there were two or three parts in this reboot of this New wrong turn movie that kind of kept me on the edge of my seat but that's all it was. if you want or wanting a horror movie that blows your pants off or makes you crap your pants or makes you run to mommy screaming or waking you up in the middle of the night crying cuz you are so dead scared of the horror of this movie you're not going to get that. This is probably one of the worst wrong turn movies in the franchise right now. if I had to choose I would rather go back and watch wrong turn one two and three but after the wrong turn franchise took the route of 4 5 6 etc it became more of a saw torture film where I now despise watching any of the wrong turn movies anything beyond number three. don't even bother but this new wrong turn reboot franchise is nothing more than pathetic and lame with no good story or backstory....it's not the worst horror movie in the world but it's pretty close to it and like I said I'm a huge horror movie fan. If you guys are going to ask me is this movie worth watching. I'd Say yes but once or twice after that... throw it in the trash....5. They really had bad actors that couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. I think my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job. my own cat or dog could do a better job and that is really pushing it to the limit but being honest and being truthful.. this movie is just a huge disappointment a let down. I was going into this movie hoping for the best. hoping to have something blow me out of my seat . having the cannibals return in some shape or form but all they gave us is humans hunting humans because humans came on to this human territory property thing which is just BS...so overall I don't know how to end this review off. the only thing I can say is expect to be disappointed. expect to be shocked. expect to be pissed off and they must have paid thousands and millions of people to do good reviews on this movie or the people must be higher than a kite.. even past horror movies that keep coming out over the past five years have been downfalls such as the new IT movie from 2017 which was a Downfall. Even the new Chucky movies curse of Chucky and cult of Chucky were major disasters.. so I don't know if the directors or producers are going to come up with a another franchise reboot or another Dead Movie called wrong turn or give us a movie 2..but if they go down the SAME route like this one. it's going to end up in SMOKE and getting burried deep into the ground With no escape. and like I keep saying I don't even want to compare this movie to the original that's how bad this movie is . it's not the worst movie but it is certainly the worst movie in the whole wrong turn franchise.. right now wrong turn one two and three are the best. the original TOP 3...Hopefully this will help some of you guys. some of you might like this movie . some might hate this movie but we Can all agree on one thing.they took this reboot movie. gave us something that we did not expect. Which ended up in the crapper being flushed into the sewer. which hopefully it's buried. I did not like this movie. so overall I did the best I could... hope you like this. THANKS.......,Wrong Turn

303,danstonhero,BIGGER BETTER IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY,9,18 February 2021,"Directed by Mike P. Nelson, this reboot offers you so much more in terms of story telling, it clearly shows that the makers have given their best to do something new and different with the franchise, well I know there are some fans of the franchise who hated this film, that's because they expected it to be same another wrong turn film with nudity and gory kills, but this film has so much more to offerThe characters from the previous film specially the most loved character 3 fingers is not there in this film, this film is a complete new take on the franchise, so the people who are expecting just another wrong turn movie with the old style of the films will be surely disappointed, but the people who are ready to watch something new in the franchise in terms of story will surely have the best entertaining time while watching this filmWhen I heard that this movie has got no previous characters added, also it's a complete different movie from the previous films in the franchise, I was ready for it and may be that's the reason why I enjoyed the movie so much, also I was ready to watch something new as well, before watching the film I was bit disappointed hearing that 3 fingers won't be making his appearance in the film but surprisingly after the film started I did not miss him even a bit..as the film is so well written, the characters are so well written that you get engaged with them very wellThe performances are good, the screenplay is fast paced, the concept is novel and fresh, I have never written such a big review to any movie but the reason on why I have written this long review is because I want to make people aware that this is not the usual wrong turn movie, it's more bigger than that and different, watch it with a fresh mind and you will surely enjoy it, being a huge fan of the wrong turn franchise I enjoyed the movie and easily one of the best film in the franchise",Wrong Turn

From someone who has watched the other wrong run films, and before you go there yes I know the sequels were all bad. This reboot/rewrite definitely has its good and bad parts. Good is that it definitely needed redone. The original is decent enough but the sequels to follow tarnished it. It definitely kept me curious throughout just to see how much they changed and the changes were good. There wasnt bad makeup deformed hillbillies, they made it as if just a generation of people who feared the collapse of the government hid in the mountains. Bad being that the horror factor was a little light not really meeting expectations and there was a couple of moments were the characters life choices and opinions create argument and with the way the world is today just isn't something I need in my films there is enough arguing in the world about whose morals and values are more important.

I admit that it was totally different compared to the rest of the film series but it was very innovative. I can say that this movie is very matured because in an early teen's perspective, it was very bearable and possibly likeable. Some of the prior films, I was prohibited to see most of the scenes since many were very ""intimate"". And It was bloody annoying. But from this new Wrong Turn movie, there were less disgusting scenes and is focused on more thrill and excitement. The movie starts with a group (which are very futile characters but hey, it's a horror movie and it's also good to the increasing of dead bodies) hiking and having adventure but some of them purposely didn't follow ""the trail"" and many dumb choices were made but trust me, everyone received what they deserved. The movie also teaches a lesson about a daughter-father relationship which they are ready to put their lives into fatal 'cause they love each other. Many chase scenes, thrills, and heart-skipping moments were in there (less jumpscare though). If it's your first time watching the film series, you should watch this first in that way, you couldn't compare and contrast the original.SPOILER P. S. : The Ending was a total epic scene amongst all.

Effects and direction were acceptable but the problem is with the messy storyline, the acting and the poor cinematography. Given the sumptious setting the movie should have looked far better. I could not pick a side as the victims were as dislikeable as the villains, rarely have I felt less connection with any character in a film - usually there's one shining light, but not here.Given the reception and lack of critical acclaim surrounding this film it seems the franchise is likely dead, any potential future releases will surely be very low budget, some years from now and will return to the original format.I'm all for trying something new but this is instantly forgettable and has zero rewatch value.Don't expect much and its still likely to disappoint. 3 maybe 4/10 - Shame, was hoping for better.",Wrong Turn

354,nicchang,"A new, messy turn for the franchise",5,10 February 2021,"Any fan who's expecting Three-Finger, hillbilly cannibals and elements of the original films is going to be straight up disappointed with the Wrong Turn reboot. Those who are open to see the other turn this film makes... well... that is not easy to answer. Because Wrong Turn (2021) works better as a standalone film than an actual reboot.Mike P. Nelson's Wrong Turn is a huge improvement over the original sequels (although Dead End remains superior). It abandons the cheesy humour of the original films and it wants to be lean, mean and genuinely scary this time. It has new ideas that it wants to work with, especially when it comes to the themes of colonialism, self-determinism and society, and since Nelson understands how familiar (but also beautiful) the setup is, he changes gears to introduce a compelling new setting in an attempt to create new lore for the Wrong Turn franchise. He has material to work with, he can build some competent tension and he doesn't shy away from the practical gore. The performances are also convincing and their fear feels genuine, with Charlotte Vega making the most out of her sympathetic performance and Matthew Modine turning in a likeable performance. Everyone else doesn't have too much material, but their acting sufficiently delivers.There's so much that works in Wrong Turn but there's also plenty of flaws that disappoint. It has some of the messiest writing of the year (so far), especially when it comes to the narrative. It starts off fast, but before it reaches the halfway point, the pacing slows down significantly and the film turns into a bore. By becoming a bit too reliant on the narrative switches, this causes the editing of the story to suffer. Like the previous films, Wrong Turn offers very little insight into the characters and when they're being hunted or killed off, it conveys little impact. The worst offender is that while Wrong Turn has new, interesting ideas in mind, the execution comes across as hollow. There's no real depth or focus on the social commentary, which the original films have never been about, and the ambition behind this is mishandled. The tone also lacks consistency, as it initially acts as a straightforward slasher film, then it descends into the bizarreness and the third act makes the film feel slightly action-orientated, with a conclusion that I found to be jarringly silly. The tonal inconsistencies make Wrong Turn feel like three different movies that never truly come together as a whole and it butchers the overall atmospheric feel.The cinematography of Wrong Turn is nice... when the camerawork isn't shaking during particularly suspenseful moments. That, combined with an editing reliance on jumpcuts and a few instances of vague lighting, can make some of the action difficult to see. I do dig the musical score and sound design, especially in the end credits. Wrong Turn could've been far worse than the average January movie release and it deserves credit for effectively presenting some ambitious ideas. I don't find the end result to be confusing, it's a rather clichéd and illogical mess that isn't sure how to handle its narrative, tone, pace and scares, and while it promises to lead the franchise into the right direction, Wrong Turn (2021) just doesn't get there.Plot and Characters (4/10)

With a noice budget and a cast that actually knows how to act (hallelujah!!), it takes a turn in a different direction from what we've come to know which breathes fresh air into an overall exhausted series of films.
The story follows a group of youths taking a trip to the Appalachian Trail where they, well...end up taking a wrong turn that ultimately leads them to a very shall we say, bloody trail, where they come across a community of mountain dwellers that don't take kindly to trespassers.
Wrong Turn is ultimately an edge-of-your-seat satisfying reboot with enough unpredictability and chills which allow this film to become its own beast that has more on its mind than just a creative kill.

Gotta say, I like it - which is surprising since I'm not a big fan of the original or its brood of direct-to-video children.The first film follows a group of carefree, young, and attractive kids who are hunted by inbred mutant cannibals in West Virginia. In true teen-slasher fashion, the sin-factor determines the order of slayings with the horny weed-smokers getting knocked off first. The flick has a couple decent scares, but is mostly an excuse to watch people get hacked to bits by hicks. And that's fine. I have my blood-and-guts days.This new flick elevates the story from slasher to cult horror. Gone are the inbred cannibals and simplistic predator-pray dynamics, replaced by an intentional society of forest-dwelling Democratic socialists aka ""The Foundation."" Camouflaged in copious amounts of animal skins/skulls and moss, the Foundation has lived as a secluded civilization in the Appalachian Mountains since the 1800s ... and they don't take kindly to strangers. In fact, they've laid an impressive assortment of booby traps across the mountain to capture/kill trespassing outsiders (everything from massive rolling logs, to tiger pits lined with punji sticks and venomous snakes, to spiked maces and sharpened rock slabs that drop from the tree canopy). The traps make for some head-smashing good fun, while establishing an ever-present sense of anxiety. This is bolstered by the director's clever use of a muted color palette, which directs our attention to small details in the woods (like trees with eyeballs) that suggest our hipster interlopers are under constant surveillance by an unseen, nearby presence.What's interesting about this flick is it doesn't have a clear-cut bad guy/girl. Everybody (the kids, small-town locals, Foundation members) is painted as flawed with redeeming qualities. While this approach doesn't stand up to serious scrutiny, it still makes for an interesting movie-going experience that leaves you with a simple yet important message: Don't judge a book by its animal skins.",Wrong Turn

383,fabiovicentini,the only wrong turn is to see in it any redeeming quality,1,14 February 2021,"Let s start from some general remarks on cinema: there must be something extremely wrong in the econ9momy of producing moves, either they are too cheap or too remunerative (the two options sustain each other). I cannot think of any other reason why movies with no ideas nor interest in giving some conflicts to develop get constantly produced with, also, some success.
Another observation regards horror specifically: there is a lazyness intrinsic in the genera that has more and more made them flat and uninteresting (I am one that form almost a year after a breaking up I could watch with enjoyment only horror movies and now I have a rejection toward them). Horrors have two parts: the f9rst in the introduction to character and the second is their butchery. The two conflict with each other; why spending time in giving characters depths if they have to die? In this movies this choice I s bought to the extreme and not even in the final girl there is something interesting to root for.
It start from the greatest effort to distinguish the strong character from the rest: she knows how to change a tire. But maybe she is not the only one, maybe she has pushed the others aside to do it herself. No, that is too much depth; the others have no idea how to do it. That's the length the movie goes to give all in once the role that every character keeps to the end, the expendables and the hero with a single virtue.
Due to the lack of any particular traits belonging to the supporting cast, the main lead suffers as a consequence. I like to consider the movie itself as a communal development that each line, each frame, each character carries trough to animate the plot in a comprehensive becoming; there is no separate element nor isolating driving idea that is not rendered via the participation of all episodes and all dialogues in a single development that is the movie (of which the plot is an abstracted element derived from it only at the end of the movie, when it is already no longer the movie but the memory of it that works). So it does in this movie by making it an experience incapable to even start because nothing it it give it and illusion of spontaneus reality that is creating itself in the moment of taking place.
Thus the butchery part fails miserably because it simply does not happen but remains suspended in a belief of interested concerning the characters faith that has never been seriously constructed.
The lack of any element that ignites its essence is dragged till the end in a ridiculous (this adjective does not help much because the whole movie perfectly matches with it) and rotting last scene that packs so many events into one (along them a spoof of the twist in the last movie of the twilight saga) that seems to covering for all that they had forgotten to put in the movie previously: instead of being a resolution, the ending is a last attempt to animate its dying movie, that, like the consummation of the last action in the movie,remains still on the running of the title credits.",Wrong Turn

385,chelseacrystina,Should have been a stand alone movie,4,11 September 2021,"I feel like this movie doomed itself by marketing it as a ""Wrong Turn"" reboot. The wrong turn franchise, whilst cheesy and over the top, has a pretty strong cult following so fans of the original franchise will have an instant dislike for this movie as it is in no way related to the originals. The only thing similar is the main characters being stalked through the woods.If you look passed the fact this isn't a ""Wrong Turn"" movie, as a stand alone movie it isn't that bad. None of the main characters are all that likeable so you tend not to care if they live or die. There are some glaring plot holes like if everyone knows this cult exists and is killing people, why is everyone so nonchalant about it? Why has no one ever attempted to take them down? How did the Jen suddenly become a survivalist expert with combat skills?

387,LeArgonaut,Pretty bad. Very unrealistic,2,25 June 2021,"Didn't even know this was a reboot until I started reading reviews. I just found the film in itself pretty awful. The acting was okay, but the choices that people made throughout and some of the plot were entirely too unrealistic to look past.Examples:
1. A giant log tumbles down towards the cast, and they all freak out and start running down a steep hill rather than hide behind one of the numerous trees or simply step to the side. The log miraculously doesn't hit a tree until it collides with one of the group members, who sat there screaming instead of trying to dodge.2. Crazed backwoods people for some reason claim to be helping someone by hog-tying them and carrying them away on a stick? There wasn't a better way to do that to make it seem like they weren't trying to kill him? Then they question the rest of the group asking how they could possibly have felt threatened???3. The ending: why and how did the head honcho of the foundation find where this girl lives and travel all the way there just to take her back? He claimed throughout the movie how they live in the woods and that's their life, yet they know how to search someone up, drive a car, buy clothes, gas, etc., and be presentable in an entirely more advanced society than they have ever seen at all. They don't even have money and have never heard of the internet.

I was really interested is the Colony and would have preferred a film based that than another 2/3 lost in the woods film followed by a rushed and confusing ending.

414,sbrooke1980,Better than expected!,6,26 June 2021,"There can only be so many takes on the hootin' deranged deformed cannibalistic hillbillies that Hollywood seems to truly believe exist deep in the Appalachian Mountains. As someone who lives in very rural WV, but still close to the VA border, the only similarities between the villains of the OG Wrong Turn franchise and reality are the mountains and trees. But cinema isn't necessarily about realism and there's obviously a market for cannibal rednecks. Fortunately for the viewer of Wrong Turn 2021, this movie chose a different take on the people who might live deep in the hills. I found this to be a refreshing reimagining that kept me entertained until the end. The VA rednecks of the town are still just stereotypes (in reality the people in the bars here more resemble the college kids than the moonshine-swilling plaid-and-dirt-wearing actors in this movie) but it's a minor gripe. There are some gruesome scenes for those that enjoy that, but it's not the overwhelming focus of the violence (the people sentenced to ""darkness"" are in much worse shape than anyone sentenced to death). The actors here all do well and their invented language is pretty believable- I can't imagine it's too easy to create, teach or learn an entirely new language, even for a few scenes in a movie.I'm almost torn about who the villains actually are in this movie. Obviously no one should be held against their will or put to death because your group took a ""wrong turn"" off the marked trail and into the territory of a community you didn't know exist...but I think many of us daydream about a place where classes don't exist and some go without while others never seem to have enough and the community is made up of all nationalities, races, religious beliefs and still each is viewed as a valuable family member. Maybe I'm just more of a WV hillbilly than I want to admit.I was disappointed in the ending a bit. I wanted her to make them set her father free but want to stay with the Foundation and her husband, but it didn't really show us much of what she went through living there for 6 months so I guess the inference is that it was a much less inviting idealized atmosphere than the citizens of it believed- and some of them were just cold-blooded murderers/rapists/wastes of skin.Generally, I liked it more than I thought I would and more than any of the Wrong Turn movies of the 90s/2000s (was that when they were made?

I thought this was going to be another lazy, paint by numbers remake that does the exact same thing as the original with stereotypical horror characters and lazy scare scenes. But the moment they got lost in the woods the sense of atmosphere kicked in and got me hooked. While I didn't think the characters were particularly original they were well defined and likable enough (for the most part, the hipster boyfriend kind of annoyed me) that I didn't want them to die.And then we got to the big reveal.Without spoiling it, they go in a vastly different direction for the franchise in the second act. And it's legitimately suspenseful, horrifying, disturbing and original. From that moment to the end credits, yes even the end credits were great, the movie had me hooked. While some may complain about the different direction, I think it was necessary and welcomed. There have been six Wrong Turn movies, most of them awful, that are basically just carbon copies of the first one with less effort thrown into them. This one takes the same basic premise of a bunch of people exploring the wilderness and encountering something sinister and takes its own unique style to it. It's own unique style that, in my opinion, actually surpasses the first.Like I said, the first 20 minutes didn't really grab me and the ending felt a little tacked on, but the movie as a whole was so engaging, well made and scary that those negatives didn't hold the movie back.

I give it 8 starts because of that and the movie did run way too long but the reward at the end was worth it.

I gotta tip my hat to the writer for going a completely different direction and making the movie more grounded. 20 to 30 mins could have been cut but the story was absolutely the best thing i have every seen in a horror movie. The movie itself has the best set up and twist i have ever seen in a horror movie. Friday the 13th, Halloween (not the 2018), Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, the original Wrong Turn, I Spit On Your Grave (original and reboot with i love), Last House on the Left (both original and reboot) My Bloody Valentine (love original not so much the reboot) you name it i have seen it.

The visualisation of future events was a really cool touch. And I liked how the movie continued throughout the credits roll. Something I haven't seen done alot.Other than that, it just uses the same old lineral plot points we've all seen a hundred times. A thing that would've changed this movie for the better would've been adding more brain cells to the characters. The decision making was really poor but some of the lines they said were equally as bad.My favourite line is: ""You tell me, who's world is more barbaric?"" and then the leader proceeds to be just that. I know you have to be the bad guy but can't you think of something more clever to say before smashing a guy's head?
Another line was from Darius: ""Do you really think you can go back to your old life?"" Uuh, you mean the life that doesn't involve being stuck in stone age? Yeah.
Sure, I know what he meant by that but from a logical standpoint how is that even a question. Of course you should return.Anyways, this movie isn't a sequal to Wrong Turn nor there is any resemblence to WT 1 or WT 2 other than the ""people get lost, strange people start hunting them"" but if you likemovies that are similar to Wrong Turn then give this a try.

Don't be put off by the negative reviews and absolutely do not give this film a miss as you are worried it won't compare the the wrong turn series.

If you aren't aware by now, this was marketed as a remake of the original 2003 Wrong Turn movie, and I guess that rubbed some people the wrong way because it's so different. This led to lower reviews than it deserves in my opinion.Overall, I really, really enjoyed this movie. At times it seemed predictable--like a lot of horror is--and at times it was pretty surprising. Unfortunately, to review it in any more depth would be to give away more than I'd like. My advice? If you like horror films, I recommend it 100%, and especially that you stick with it because it gets more interesting with time.

They make reference to having jobs in NY City as if it is some sort of accomplishment to live in NY City.This kind of Hollywood rhetoric about the South is complete idiocracy. Even though they portray the South the same way in every TV Show and Movie, anybody that has actually spent any time there knows that quite the opposite is true. People are friendly. Many will give you their shirts off their back - even if they barely know you. There are just as many gay people in the South as any other place and they are not shamed for it. People also tend to mind their own business so this notion that any time an ""outsider"" comes to town, they get harrassed...is absurd.Get over yourselves, Hollywood. No wonder so many people are losing interest in your work. You place more interest in your ideology than accuracy. All that does is alienate half of the country. Good luck with that.

I've seen numerous people mention that the characters are unlikable, but isn't that kind of the point? They're intruders and last I checked, that's not a redeeming quality. With that said, I didn't mind them. Of course there is a stand out who is completely intolerable, but every movie has one of those.Wrong Turn brings ideas to the table, something it's predecessors didn't attempt. It takes an old idea and makes it fresh, while adding more meat to the bones.
The only complaint I really have is the false ending, it could have been cut entirely and made no sense.After the abomination that was Wrong Turn 6, I'm happy to say I finally appreciate the Wrong Turn franchise again. I'm okay with the lack of backwoods mutant cannibals, I'm very happy without Declan O'Brien behind the camera and I am especially thrilled with the amount of though put into a backwoods slasher.....bring on Wrong Turn 2.",Wrong Turn

I'm glad I took a chance on this film. It is a horror film that is lengthy, that is trying to say something, that is action and thrill-packed.

That being said, this is a good movie. I'm a big fan of the original Wrong Turn so I kind of wish they had called this something else, but I did like it. This movie doesn't have the Hills Have Eyes element that the original Wrong Turn had. It still has a group of young people heading into the woods, not listening to the warnings and red flags along the way, and then getting into trouble with the people who live on the mountain. I enjoyed this movie, but I do wish they had titled it ""The Foundation"" (as another reviewer suggested) or something other than Wrong Turn. By calling it Wrong Turn, they obviously upset a lot of the fans of the original which caused it to not get a fair rating from a lot of people.Overall, I definitely would recommend this movie.

The good news here is it far surpasses the original franchise as it steps out on its own using the original formula as a foundation 😉 to build an entirely new story on.It is a bit of a slow burn so if you are expecting a non stop rude like the original series I wouldn't watch it for that. Once the action does start it is pretty intense with a good amount of gore to go with it which should keep some of the tone of the original series.I would absolutely recommend this film but I would suggest don't watch it expecting the original series.

This was a huge disappointment because they were the key signatures of the WT movie franchise.Instead, we had a totally unrelated community living in the woods with normal faces and wrong choices.I also don't get some points in the movie:1)Weren't those people in the woods the first people who started the fight by killing that man's boyfriend by throwing a wood log at them?2)They saw one person throwing a log at them, and they decided that lots of people are watching them in the woods?3)They attacked and killed one of them by assuming he has killed one of their members even without finding her dead body?4)When they were waiting for the judgement, couldn't they also mention how one of them killed one of their members by throwing a log at them? Even his boyfriend had forgotten it!?Etc.These plot holes could've been tolerable, if the movie was not named Wrong Turn.Cause unlike the other parts of the WT franchise, this one was not really slasher-thriller and had nothing to do with the first six movies.

She gave an outstanding performance.The real reason I gave the movie such a high rating was that it was not only suspenseful but there were an incredible number of twists that I did not truly know what to expect. With each twist, there's a new understanding of what has already happened and what you expect might happen.

601,jani-ahonen-1,Not as good as the original one but not as bad as people say,5,25 April 2021,"The original Wrong Turn from 2003 was fantastic and it still today ranks among my favourite horror films of its type. The first sequel to it wasn't as good, and then the remaining sequels from three onwards were utter rubbish. Considering how much people here first complained and hated this 2021 remake, my hopes for this film weren't high. But in the end, it did manage to entertain me reasonably well, which was a surprise.Let me start by saying that all of the actors in the remake were disappointing, especially the male characters who act in such an annoying manner that you pretty much are looking forward to getting them killed off. The first half of the film serves absolutely nothing new to seasoned horror film fans, and I would totally get if someone were to choose to stop watching. It is only around halfway of the film that things start to get more interesting.I do understand why Wrong Turn fans can hate this film since it doesn't really have any of that same real survival suspense as the original film. Plus it focuses more on the cult aspects of things rather than people being cannibals. So while you can argue that there is a link between this remake and the original film, the connection is quite vague, in my opinion.Summary: This is neither a good but neither a bad remake of the original cult classic film as they don't really ""link up"" to each other like that. This remake will be quickly forgotten since there are too many similar films out there featuring young adults getting killed in a forest while being hunted by people with skull masks.While the first half looks like any poorly written and produced horror film, the second half of the film saves the film from being a total lacklustre. This remake will provide decent horror entertainment for a little less than two hours, but if you haven't seen the original from 2003, skip this remake and stick with the classic.",Wrong Turn

614,danman011,Wrong Movie,3,22 June 2021,"Matthew Modine must've lost a bet. Most of the acting was very good, including of course Modine's, but some performances were as painful as the character deaths.There was enough talent behind this movie that I wanted to like it ... but it just made way too many mistakes. I had to pause multiple times in disbelief at how many ""wrong turns"" it took. Maybe that was the secret meaning of the title ...The script is all over the place, with inciting events that make zero sense ... one super dumb decision after another ... you can feel the writers making things happen *just because* ... not because they've established a given character is prone to this or that kind of mistake, not as an organic outgrowth of what's been established ... they just need to get themselves in trouble for the movie to happen, so they do.Maybe we shouldn't expect too much from a horror flick, but the good ones usually have some kind of character growth, and a plot that entertains rather than annoys. This movie has some stuff about the main character's strength and ability to make decisions, something something, but it's just not delivered intelligibly enough to be called actual character growth.Feels like it could have been a contender, but the script really needed more work.",Wrong Turn

618,misterdarwin24,Forget the title and enjoy the film.,7,4 March 2021,"I understand the importance of marketing, so I get the reason why this was put under the ""Wrong Turn"" banner. Be warned the enemy is different from the hillbilly mutant cannibals of the first 6 films. The screenplay leans into those prior conceptions to throw some curves at the audience, but I suspect that would have worked even with a different title.So, putting the title aside, how does it stand up? I'll say I'm mixed, there is a lot of formulaic ""cast must pay for transgressions"" plotting here, and it fluctuates from predictable to insipid to inspired pretty quickly. Many horror films sleepwalk through the tropes, so if I am to recommend one I need something that sticks. Here there are two things that stuck with me - one particularly disturbing scene (your mileage may vary) and the final shot which plays out all the way through the closing credits.Wrong Turn plays on stereotypes, alternately affirming then undercutting them, and aims a critical eye at those who look down on ""the other"". While that adds a bit more depth (not much, but a bit) than most horror films, it also leaves with a bunch of annoying ""hipsters"" and crass ""hicks"" who don't offer a lot to root for through most of the run time.The main cast is so diverse it feels like it was made from a checklist. I couldn't tell if they were embracing diversity or spoofing it. That goes for a lot of this film - were we supposed to root for the Foundation? I'm not really sure which side the films comes down on, but given how many films try to force their views on the viewer, I appreciate not being told how I should feel.",Wrong Turn

I can understand wanting to explore a different notion from the original version but it seems to me the writer and director had a completely different vision for this film which could be resulted in them writing a completely different movie. We have to stop using (in particular horror films) the titles of older films to generate attention. People might appreciate the writing more if it wasn't compared to a cult classic like this one.

A slightly mismatched plot but a plot that develops into something unexpected and very watchable. Brutal gore, sometimes a little forced, but on the whole suited to the film as a whole.

I would have liked this movie a lot more, though, if they had bothered to do a single second of research on their setting. In one scene, a character talks at length about hunting moose and elk, but we definitely don't have either of those in Virginia. That took me right out of the experience, and it would have been SO EASY to fact check. It's lazy writing.

Reading spoiler free reviews on the web let me know beforehand that this wasn't your typical Wrong Turn movie featuring mutant, flesh eating, inbred hillbillies. At first I was kinda apprehensive about the fact that this film would not follow in the original's footsteps but oh well sometimes change is good and for this franchise it was kinda needed. Let's admit the latest bunch of WT films were not that good. This new reboot created some major changes to the plot that hardly has any relation to the original but again it was a welcomed change IMO. Although some of the scenes were borderline predictable, the movie also featured some interesting ""wtf"" and ""oh wow"" moments. After the end credits rolled I was genuinely satisfied with the end product. 7/10 for the suspense, gore, and a surprise ending. Recommend if you love horror in general.",Wrong Turn

Since I neve write a review I think that it's best not to tell who, in my opinion you can spoile something like this.The history it's actually quiet surprising, especially to me that not know about the foundation legend (this i can tell its in the movie resume) I'm not American so I never have heard about the foundation but I think the way that the legend connects with the caracteres makes a good sense, and if you look to a critical perspective it makes a lot sense too, horror movies can do A great job to criticize something (Dawn of the dead and the consuming it's a good example)The locations are good too and the dialogue is almost good.

Yeah there were a few scenes where blood and death were shown.Nor would I say it has anything to do with the Wrong Turn series, reboot or not I personally cannot say it part of that series of films. Before anyone says anything, definition of a reboot is: to start anew, to refresh by making a new start or creating a new version. Therefore in essence, the writer did just that a reboot of the film. Personally though, I cannot say its in the same series, perhaps it could be the start of a new series all its own.

I need actual creatures or monsters without torture involved. That isn't to say this film met that criteria. It was interesting enough to keep my attention with as few eye rolls as possible. The main characters obviously gained no fan base but neither was I cheering for the villains. Poking peoples eyes out, putting them in a dark cave and raping them on occasion doesn't sit well with me. The ending was my favorite. I really connected with the heroine because her trauma was obvious and came through when her captors showed up unexpectedly. I inwardly cheered when the RV veered off the road.

I have never seen the original, and it seems a lot of people are comparing it to that, which I think is actually a bit rubbish.This is a fairly well made film, all the scenes work well, it has good pacing and a good narrative. There were a few cliches, not least including the overly prejudice city folk that the story follows, and especially their extremely generic horror banter.I found the film to be surprisingly atmospheric, had a few good jumps, and one scene which I found particularly disturbing, to the point I'm still running it through my head now. Impressive for a movie to get to me like that.It may well be it's a rip off of the original (though IMDB trivia points out its no way affiliated to it). I like to think perhaps it was inspired by, but not a remake of it, though I wouldn't know as I haven't seen it. Overall worth watching as a fairly decent horror flick. I'd say about on par with The Descent. Will likely watch again, this time with friends at a later date.",Wrong Turn

This movie is truly garbage, I found myself at the midpoint hoping for an end only to find out I had almost an hour left of ridiculousness.
Not one thing in this movie made sense. So everyone in their little village could speak English except for the 2 hunters??? Why the hell did the leader bring the little girl with him to the house at the end? In 6 weeks the lead character became a skilled bowman & knife thrower????

First... you'll start finding mistakes five minutes into the movie and every 2 to 3 minutes thereafter. Second... don't expect to find anything similar to the original movie, the story makes no sense, the characters are completely forgettable (everyone of them) and although the movie have some action sequences, those are completely dumb, not enough to make you want to finish watching this garbage.

Also try to disregard the negative reviews and give it a chance!If you loved the previous films from the same title then be prepared for a whole different take on the classics. This is not a direct sequel from the previous films but a new variation of the universe of cannablism.This film is a decent take on the fast pace of the old previous films. Be prepared for a more somewhat structured story telling where there's less hide and seek. The over the top killing is still there for the characters but if you are expecting the gruesome or edge of your seat film then you will be disappointed! It's a good start to a fresh up to date take on the original films with more possibilities for further instalments to grow from the roots that have been laid in this film.The characters are likeable but the development of the story is rushed from the start. They tried to fit in as much new story or iteration as possible which made the story telling and progression of the story to fall somewhat on its head. Nevertheless it's still a good film to watch. From the rising tension to the climax could have been written a bit better it would have made for a more enjoyable and out of your seat experience.When going into this movie try your best to forget about the previous adaptations and try have a fresh mind for this film, you'll be more disappointed otherwise in what you could take as a watchable film with better acting then the recent instalment of power rangers!",Wrong Turn

773,daniel-erik-554-108898,If You only Read One Review for This Movie Make It This One!,7,1 March 2021,"Let me start by saying I have seen every Wrong Turn movie. For better or worse. And, even as the series went very...very...far downhill, I found each of them to still be enjoyable. Let's be honest, sometimes it's nice to kick back after a long day with a bowl of popcorn, shut your brain off, and watch a bunch of teenagers make poor choices and die. It's okay. You can admit it. That all being said, I agree with the vast amount of comments saying that this film should not have had the title of ""Wrong Turn"". That was the first mistake. Had it be titled separately I feel it would be getting better reception.
Now, on to the real facts. I actually like the story of this one better than any of the other (including the original) wrong turn movies. I hate to keep keep comparing this to the others, as again, I feel it should be a separate entity, but the writer did say this was a retelling of the original story. I found ""isolated pre-civil war cult"" to be far more interesting than inbred cannibals. In fact, I wish they would have talked more about their backstory.
Charlotte Vega and Matthew Modine definitely have the best performances, but i didn't find anyone to be bad or wholly unbelievable. It's typical B horror movie acting. Don't act like you were expecting oscar-worthy performances.
Lastly, besides the title, my only complaint is that the film feels very bare bones compared to what it could have been. I think there is a great and suspenseful film at it's heart, but it didn't quite get there. I didn't really gain a connection to any of the kids before they were killed. Especially the first one to die. It felt like he said three things, screamed, and died. More backstory on the cult would have been interesting. What were they speaking? Sounded like old norse. Two hunters come in that have barely two minutes of screen time before they are killed and they felt like wasted inclusions. I felt more like i was watching a rough draft or outline of the story as the film went on.
In finishing, do yourself a favor and check the film out. It's not great (wow, surprise!) but it is enjoyable. I feel its more of a 6.5 than a 7, but I love a good backwoods slasher, so it gets a 7 from me. Go into it with the expectation of a B slasher film (that isn't wrong turn) and I guarantee you, you will have a good two hours.",Wrong Turn

779,thegrizzlyben,Not-So Wrong Turn,6,7 March 2021,"I'm not the biggest fan of the original so hearing this one differed greatly made it more appealing to me. I was eager to see what made it different and if it worked. As it goes, some of it does. The performances are fairly strong, the characters and motivations more believable than before, the story sets up quite well, and there's even a decent twist midway that gives the film a different trajectory. It offers up something familiar with the promise of something new, and that isn't entirely bad.
However this is not Wrong Turn. The Foundation, our new antagonists, are not the same community we met from the original franchise, and while their actions and costumes are creepy and disturbing at first, beneath it all they're a little too... Well-polished to be entirely plausible. (forest people with great hair and a sharp beard feels like an enormous 180.)
I never thought I'd say ""this film needs inbred cannibalistic hillbillies"" but... it kinda does. While body horror and hostility count for something, the antagonist needs to be top-notch to sell a horror franchise, and this one looked far too ""preppy suburban dad wearing fur"" to fit the bill. Some mistakes were made, but I wouldn't say the film is a complete miss. For those who haven't seen Wrong Turn 2003 or any of its subsequent sequels, and anyone who's willing to overlook the fact that this one shares its name, this film is worth a try. Keep your expectations low and you might very well be surprised.",Wrong Turn

'The Foundation' as some have suggested or something different to 'Wrong Turn', this movie would've been accepted and enjoyed by many more than it has to date.I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected. It's original, gruesome, suspenseful and has a dark grittiness to it that reminded me of the original Hills Have Eyes. There's a couple of twists and turns along the way too. The characters were fleshed out enough and your allegiance to them waivers back and forth. Every character is flawed (as we humans are) but there's only one really unlikeable main character out of our protagonists. There are fleeting moments you actually side with the antagonists but when you discover their barbarity and lack of empathy for others it switches back.So I urge you to disconnect the title with that of the original Wrong Turn, wipe your preconceived slate clean and give this a go.

817,chrisbrownfreelance,Excellent movie when judge for what it is.,8,8 April 2021,I really enjoyed this and recommend any horror fan watches it. Most the bad reviews are because it's not what people expected it to be and are in a huff. Give this a watch with an open mind and you'll love it.,Wrong Turn
818,gokceargentox,It's not Wrong Turn!,2,13 February 2021,This movis is not about the other ones. Very dissapointing.,Wrong Turn
819,santhoshpadamuthum,The worst movie in the Wrong turn series...,3,13 February 2021,Expectations hurts...Totally time waste. Except two or three scenes nothing is there. Especially last 45 mins very boring...if u expect like past wrong turn movies u will definitely disappointed.,Wrong Turn
820,nathandavid-34314,Meh,2,18 September 2021,"Bit of a nothing film. Was expecting more using the WRONG TURN Label! Maybe ""Taken gone wrong turn"" would be a better label with Liam Neeson.",Wrong Turn
821,miahurricane-36193,"If you're expecting Wrong Turn, you've taken a wrong turn.",2,14 March 2021,"Alright so listen, if you go into the movie with any thought or expectations of any of the past Wrong Turn films, you will be highly disappointed. I was highly disappointed. If it was named anything other than Wrong Turn it would be a decent horror movie. That was some dissatisfying to call itself Wrong Turn. I hated it for that reason alone.",Wrong Turn
822,highlander-45310,Good Horror Movie,10,16 May 2021,For a horror movie it's not bad. The only problem the storyline isn't consistent.,Wrong Turn
