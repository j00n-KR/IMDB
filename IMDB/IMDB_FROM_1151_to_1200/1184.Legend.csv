0,TheLittleSongbird,The most underrated fantasy movie of all time!,8,5 February 2009,"When I first saw this movie,on DVD, I was like wow! This movie is gorgeous to look at, a famous trademark of Ridley Scott. The main flaw in this movie is Tom Cruise. He looked confused throughout the movie, but he was still likable. The other flaw, is that the storyline takes a while to get going. But all this actually managed to pick itself up, and do bear in mind it is theme driven film. I was impressed with Mia Sara. She started off a little uncomfortable, but when she turned evil, she came alive. In fact, the personifications of good and evil were one of the main reasons why I like this movie, other than Tim Curry, who is one of my favourite actors. The performance of Tim Curry is what makes this movie. He was unrecognisable, underneath all the Oscar-nominated makeup, but what a performance, it blew me away, in perhaps the most definitive portrayal of Satan ever on screen, both frightening and sexy at the same time! Even more amazing was that he is only 5'9 or so, and he had to wear stilts, also that he was in his late 30s when he took on this role, and I am glad he did. I felt as though I was in a different world when I saw this movie. The supporting actors David Bennent and Alice Playten offered solid support. I also liked the script, a little inappropriate with the goblins perhaps, but not that bad. The outstanding music score by Jerry Goldsmith is without doubt one of his finest and most underrated works. This was evident in the dress scene, Lilli's song, the final underwater scene and the very end. Magical! I liked the American version, but I much prefer the version I have on DVD, the European version, somehow I like less the score by Tangerine Dream . One definite thing that I liked about the American version was Darkness's ""Mother Night"" speech, in the European version he is a lot more mysterious. When this is on TV, it always shows the American version, but my personal opinion is that the European version is better (this is the one I have on DVD). If you are a fantasy fan, watch this movie, and either version. It is just beautiful, and definitely under-appreciated! 8/10. Bethany Cox",Legend
1,bkoganbing,"Visually Stunning, But Not Terribly Coherent",6,19 July 2007,"I finally got to see Legend in its entirety from start to finish in one sitting. Previously I had only seen bits and pieces. Sad to say this is a film whose parts are greater than the whole.Technically it's a stunning masterpiece. I don't think there was a film like this since Paramount took most of it's players in 1933 and put them all in makeup for its version of Alice in Wonderland. In fact the only two in the film who go without any make up because they're the only humans in the film are woodsman Tom Cruise and princess Mia Sara.Tom looks a little lost in this part. Fantasy certainly is something he never tried again in his career. Probably he was wise not to. Mia Sara comes off a bit like a spoiled Jewish American Princess. If her dad the king was around, she'd have just ordered him to buy her those unicorns.However the rest of the cast looks like they're having a grand old time. Especially Tim Curry who steals the film. He overacts with relish his role of the Lord of Darkness, he's the main reason to see Legend.Legend is photographed well and the makeup is in a class by itself. Why it didn't win an Oscar in the only category Legend was nominated in, is beyond me. Still it's a film best consigned to the juvenile audience.",Legend
2,Leofwine_draca,Cruise spoils it,4,16 September 2021,"I wasn't really a fan of this one, soured due to another of those ""perfect"" roles for Tom Cruise, who I found intensely irritating here. The best thing about it is villain Tim Curry, who realises he's in a pantomime and acts appropriately. Elsewhere, the scenery and trappings have aged badly; it's clear Scott was having one of his many off days.",Legend
3,SnoopyStyle,Bloated fantasy from Ridley Scott,4,19 January 2014,"There is good. There is evil. And there are unicorns. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a forest dweller who loves innocent Lili (Mia Sara). When Darkness (Tim Curry)'s minion takes the horn of an unicorn, the world becomes unbalanced. The world freezes over. Lili and an unicorn are captured. Jack and his newfound ragtag gang must come to the rescue.This is a bloated fantasy starting from the bloated opening text. None of the text is necessary. So much of time is over the top. The acting is weirdly mannered and stiff. The costumes are noticeably fake. This is director Ridley Scott's big white whale. He tries so hard for ethereal fantasy that all he gets is clunky surrealism.This was a troubled production. One could almost sense the problems from the film. Scott is throwing every fantasy conventions at it. It becomes overloaded. I see this as an ambitious undertaking from Ridley Scott that mostly fails.",Legend
4,kosmasp,Fading,7,29 April 2020,"Ridley Scott: I think there are quite a few out there who are convinced he can't do wrong. And technically speaking, this is top notch! Listening to his audio commentary you know he is a master craftsman. There is no doubt about that. The story on the other hand did not engage me as much as I wished it would. Maybe if I had seen it when I was younger ... tough to say. On the other hand, never ending story seems to work, even if it is overall ""simpler"" in terms of technical achievements (not saying it looks cheap, quite the opposite).You have Tom Cruise in young (though some may feel he hasn't really aged since then), in quite the tough role. Especially when he gets introduced to us. Now I only watched the longer Directors Cut and I urge anyone to do the same. I don't think the other cut will come close to the experience you'll have with the movie in the longer more coherent version. Good fantasy and nice decent story",Legend
5,gavin6942,"A Decent 1980s Fantasy Film, But Not Nearly the Best",6,8 November 2008,"A young man (Tom Cruise) must stop the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) from both destroying daylight and marrying the woman he loves (Mia Sara). Cruise, along with a forest gump and some elves, have little time and nothing more than hope and love on their side. Will that be enough? In Cruise's early days, some of his films stand out more than others. ""Risky Business"" stands out, ""Legend"" does not. Although considered a classic by many people, the film really is not very good. Cruise is average, Curry is fine as the devil but largely unrecognizable (it could have been any actor with little difference) and Mia Sara is beautiful but rather limited in her acting. You have to love the Gothic outfit, though. Beyond that, it is just a typical story with little surprise or luster. I expect better from director Ridley Scott. He created an interesting world, but refused to explore it. And that is really the big flaw... we have a story of boy must save girl, and that is it. No subplots, no complications... no family drama... barely even character development... nothing. We have the devil who could take over the world at any time by killing a unicorn he has captured, but instead waits until an arbitrary time. How many times do villains sit and talk about their evil plans when they should simply just execute their captured enemy (such as James Bond)? Same concept here... big plans, long speeches and whatnot rarely work.Maybe the full 150-minute version clears this up, but in the shorter version I was simply not impressed either time I saw the film. Although one must single out Rob Bottin and his crew for some amazing makeup and effects. If nothing else, the film has that going for it.If you are a die-hard fantasy fan, check this out. But otherwise, really, do not bother. Not the best work of Cruise, Sara, Curry or Scott. And not the best fantasy film of the era. Rent ""Willow"". By far the better film. This one is just lame. I am sure there is something about the story that people adore, but it was lost on me.",Legend
6,jboothmillard,Legend,3,29 November 2008,"I knew it was a fantasy film, the two main male stars (also the only recognisable stars) and the ridiculous choice of director with Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator), and I totally agree with the critics on this one. Basically The Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) plans to create a world of eternal darkness by killing the last of the unicorns and marrying a fairy princess. It is after Darkness's goblin servants attack the unicorns, capturing one, that Jack (Tom Cruise) is now on a mission to both save the last one, and save his love Princess Lily (introducing Ferris Bueller's Mia Sara, also singing a song), who believes she has ruined the peace of the land, simply touching a unicorn, lol. Jack gets help from some dwarf and fairy friends, including Honeythorn Gump (David Bennent), Screwball (Billy Barty) and Brown Tom (Cork Hubbert), while Darkness prepares his wedding ceremony to poor Lily, and the unicorn is obviously chained up, and yes, Jack saves the day, and everything is resolved. Also starring Alice Playten as Blix, Peter O'Farrell as Pox, Kiran Shah as Blunder, Annabelle Lanyon as Oona and Robert Picardo as Meg Mucklebones. The special affects make-up I'll admit, especially for the quite likable Curry, is quite impressive. It is just a shame the story isn't charming and too many kiddie things for the kids, only Darkness can frighten them off, and how has this film got a cult following? Just a bizarre fantasy film that I'm sure even its own director would rather never talk about again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Visual Effects. Adequate!",Legend
7,Woodyanders,A superior fantasy film,9,6 September 2018,"Noble and virtuous woodsman Jack (an earnest and likeable performance by Tom Cruise) has to rescue his sweet and naïve beloved Princess Lily (a fine and charming portrayal by the beautiful Mia Sara) and the last surviving unicorn from the vile clutches of the nefarious Lord of Darkness (marvelously played with lick-smacking wicked and theatrical relish by Tim Curry), who wants to plunge the world into a bleak never-ending ice age. Director Ridley Scott presents a remarkably vivid and convincing fantasy world populated by all sorts of colorful creatures and rife with a feeling of pure majestic magical wonder with an underlying sense of danger lurking just underneath the pretty surface. Moreover, Scott brings a wealth of visual imagination and an admirably adult and mature sensibility to the fantastic premise. William Hjortsberg's simple, yet smart script not only offers a deceptively familiar good versus evil story, but also a provocative exploration of the fragility of innocence, the persuasive corruptive influence of evil, and mankind's fall from grace and subsequent need for redemption. The lively acting by the bang-up enthusiastic cast helps a lot, with especially stand-out contributions from David Bennent as mischievous imp Gump, Alice Playten as loathsome goblin Blix, and Annabelle Lanyon as smitten fairy Oona. Billy Barty and Cork Hubbert supply amusing comic relief as a pair of bumbling elves while Robert Picardo has a small, but memorable role as hideous swamp witch Meg Mucklebones. Kudos are also in order for Rob Bottin's terrific make-up f/x, Alex Thomson's sumptuous widescreen cinematography, and Jerry Goldsmith's lush orchestral score, which fits the fantasy world a lot better than the out of place more contemporary synthesizer score by Tangerine Dream in the severely truncated theatrical version. The director's cut is the preferable version because the themes and characters are fleshed out a lot more while the ambiguous ending has a haunting quality to it. An excellent and enchanting marvel.",Legend
8,ma-cortes,"Wonderful movie filled with fantasy , adventure , feats and amazing monsters",8,21 July 2013,"This is such stuff as dreams are made of ; this is Legend . Jack (Tom Cruise , though Johnny Depp, Robert Downey Jr. and Jim Carrey were all considered for this character) and his partners such as Screwball (Billy Barty) , Blunder (Kiran Shah) and Gump (David Bennet , recently his Tin Drum) are disposed to do everything to save the world and rescue princess Lili (Mia Sara) who Darkness intends to make his wife from the hands of this evil devil . A young man must stop the Lord of Darkness , the personification of evil , from both destroying daylight and marrying the young girl (Mia Sara was only 15 during the filming of Legend , she was actually born in 1967, so she was 15 in 1982, which is when production for the film began) he loves . There appears demons , Elfs , Unicorns , fairy , and goblin as Blix (played by Alice Playten whose face was designed after that of Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones) . As Darkness (Ridley Scott was inspired to cast Tim Curry as Darkness after seeing The Rocky Horror Picture Show , he had also considered casting Richard O'Brien as Meg Mucklebones) plans to spread eternal night in the land where this tale takes place , by killing every unicorn (the sound of the unicorns at play is actually a recording of humpback whales) in Earth .This breathtaking film contains imagination , magic , thrills , fantasy , adventure and many other things . This is an incredible fantastic movie which features elves , fairies , dwarfs and other mythical creatures . Ridley Scott drew most of his inspiration for ""Legend"" from the 1946 version of ¨Belle and the Beast¨, as well as such Disney animated classics as ¨Snow White¨ , ¨Fantasy¨ and ¨Bambi¨. Impressive production , the production was filmed on the Pinewood Studio sound stage that had been originally created for ¨The spy who loved me¨ . However , filming was interrupted twice, firstly by the studio burning to the ground and secondly, by the death of Tom Cruise's father. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's original score was removed by the studio after the first round of test screenings. In an effort to appeal to ""the kids"", executives commissioned Tangerine Dream to create a replacement. Until 2002, Goldsmith's original score was heard only with the film's European release. Special mention to brilliant and colorful cinematography by Alex Thomson .Ridley Scott admits that comments made by some pot-smoking attendees at a screening got the director second-guessing himself, and influenced him to cut the film from 150 minutes to 98. The director's cut reveals an alternative ending where Jack remains in the forest and Lily goes home alone with plans to see him again soon. The motion picture was marvelous and glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film ¨Someone to watch over me¨ and others as ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Black rain¨ , in which his visual style is impressive as well as his speciality ,the historical genre , as ¨Robin Hood¨ , ¨Kingdom of heaven¨ , ¨Duelists¨ and ¨Black Hawk down¨ . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers",Legend
9,BA_Harrison,Watch Labyrinth again instead.,3,28 July 2019,"Having proven himself adept at horror/sci-fi with Alien (and at pure sci-fi with Bladerunner, albeit not a success at the time), director Ridley Scott thought he'd have a bash at the fantasy genre with Legend... and completely blows it! While admittedly visually impressive at times, the film suffers from a weak story and atrocious performances from Tom Cruise as the sappy hero Jack, Mia Sara as Princess Lili, and lots of hugely irritating children and dwarfs as magical woodland folk. Only Tim Curry and Robert Picardo come out of this with reputations intact, giving memorable turns despite acting under heavy prosthetic makeup (by MUFX genius Rob Bottin).Scott employs virtually every fantasy cliché possible (unicorns, and fairies and goblins, oh my), and cannot resist on filling most of his scenes with one or more of the following: airborne seeds, blossom, snow, glitter, steam, and bubbles (bubble machine courtesy of the local disco equipment hire shop?). The action packed finalé, in which Jack confronts Darkness (Curry) to try and rescue Lili and restore light to the forest, is devoid of excitement: the fight choreography is appalling, and those horrible, supposedly amusing gnomes(?) just get on the nerves. Thankfully, Ridley has since stayed away from the fantasy genre, although he has managed to balls up the Alien series with his disappointing and unnecessary prequels.N.B. This review is of the European version of the film.",Legend
10,moonspinner55,Certainly imaginative...but it's perplexing instead of exciting,2,3 January 2007,"Fantasy story from screenwriter William Hjortsberg has powerful, evil Darkness plotting to overtake Light, personified in unicorns. An eyeful to be sure, but occasionally heavy or silly, with Tom Cruise dreadfully out of place in this Grimm-like setting playing commoner Jack in love with princess Mia Sara. Cruise quickly rebounded from this Ridley Scott-directed misfire, the European version of which runs some twenty minutes longer and features a different score (they got Jerry Goldsmith, the U.S. got Tangerine Dream--which wasn't a bad trade-off). Still, the film's murky narrative renders much of the proceedings incomprehensible, although portions of it are indisputably pretty to look at. * from ****",Legend
11,Quinoa1984,"director's cut: a treat for the eyes, if not so much overall, in Scott's one and only ""kids"" movie",7,2 August 2008,"Legend would probably get, on the 10/10 vote scoring, a full 9/10 for the sheer ""plastic"" quality of the picture. Plastic, I mean, in the purely technical and, damn if I say it, magic of the special effects and design. Even when it should be too sickeningly sweet and innocent, or perhaps on the flip-side too dark and hellish, director Ridley Scott and his production team of designers and art decorators and effects men and costume and creature designers (main one 'Thing' creator Rob Bottin on one of his very best jobs) make this delightful to look at. Scott did accomplish one thing, if nothing else, which was to recreate with sets and actors and make-up the experience of reading fairy tales or watching a Disney movie. It is one of the director's best-looking pictures, and that is saying something for the former production designer's films like Alien and Blade Runner. On that front, it's not only exemplary of what can be done with both imagination and (rightfully laid) homage but what can look almost ahead of its time.This being said, the story and especially the dialog would get a 5/10. Maybe I just can't speak for myself in finding the characters not very engrossing aside from the sheer conventionality placed in the peril between light and dark, Jack (Tom Cruise) vs. Darkness (an awesome devil played by Tim Curry), gnomes and trolls vs. gargoyles and big galoots. The writing is so stuck in simple terms (which for some may work) that it's hard to look past the fact that it is, straight up and down, a pure feat of style over substance. And it's HIGH style, the likes of which give a good name for style and technical prowess, against so-so substance that could be found in any picture book. This goes without saying that Jerry Goldsmith's score (included, thankfully, on the director's cut) fits in very well even when such characters are speaking without much interest, and rises some scenes to emotional heights. But the script, with some bits of exception, lacks the spark of soul needed for great fantasy, and what a director like Jim Henson- working at the same time on Dark Crystal and Labyrinth- understood intuitively.By the end, it's a wonderful marvel that, perhaps, wasn't entirely meant for me as a section of the audience. In my 20's now this was the first time I had seen any version of the film, and yet even with my reservations I could see the film playing very well for young children ready for the bright, sweet innocent side and cold, grim, brimstone-laden dark side (look ye elsewhere for grays), and if one is totally obsessed with fairy-tale fantasy it might strike even as greater. It's a pleasant experience that's magnificent to see (it's definitely *made* for a giant theatrical screen), however lacking in some ways that keep it from true brilliance.",Legend
12,BandSAboutMovies,I love it!,7,7 December 2019,"This Ridley Scott movie has always stood out from his other work to me, as it's quite literally a children's story about the most archetypical battle between the good of Jack (Tom Cruise) and evil of the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry). Much like how the original fairy tales were incredibly dark, this movie is filled with morbid imagery and a villain that may overwhelm viewers, making them love him more than the protagonist.The death of the unicorn in this film is a moment that many 1980's children will remember as quite possibly the end of said childhood.The true star of this movie remains Curry, who is absolutely incredible (as always). He spent five and a half hours a day just to get into the makeup, which then needed a full hour of bathing to remove all the adhesive. One day, Curry grew impatient and claustrophobic, removing the makeup and some of his own skin. He was off the film for a week to recover.Interestingly enough, the European and director's cut of this film don't use Tangerine Dream, but instead feature music by Jerry Goldsmith. There was also a Bryan Ferry song, ""Is Your Love Strong Enough?"" that features Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and a music video for that as well.If you look in n Meg Mucklebones' swamp and when the unicorn is chained up, you can even stop Pazuzu from The Exorcist.Much like many of Scott's early efforts like Blade Runner - and several other films on this list - this movie wasn't considered a classic when it was released. But today? Today it certainly is.",Legend

14,Theo Robertson,Stunning To Look At But Suffers Greatly From Production Weakness,6,28 April 2013,It's impossible to watch a fantasy film nowadays without comparing it to Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY . In fact even Jackson's adaptation of THE HOBBIT suffers in comparison with his earlier masterwork . I went in to Ridley Scott's LEGEND not expecting much . It's a film that rather mediocre reviews on its release in 1985 and cemented the director's reputation as an artist only interested in visuals to the detriment of emotion and narrative Certainly on a visual level there's little that can be criticised even in a cinematic post LOTR world and one can't help thinking that perhaps Jackson has borrowed the visual look from Scott when he adapted the Tolkien books . There is a subtle difference and that is Scott shoots a few too many medium shots in comparison to Jackson . Jackson concentrates on an ambitious sweeping spectacle that shows off the sets and locations to the best of their function where as Scott seems to lack this ambition . This isn't perhaps not a fundamental criticism since one doubts if Scott was allowed the laissez faire artistic control Jackson was allowed . The New Hollywood attitude of film making had ended in near disaster for the studios about three or four years earlier and one can understand the studio producers wanting to be charge of a production rather than the director And this is where LEGEND fails . It's a film that gives the impression that the producers don't know who to market the film for. LORD OF THE RINGS is a rare film that celebrates Aglophile culture where as LEGEND seems to be a film that is trying - and failing to appeal to a trans-Atlantic multiplex audience . Tom Cruise has never been prettier but seems miscast as a hero who is rather rather wet as opposed to heroic . Likewise the whole file suffers from a lack of focus as to who the film will appeal to . The somewhat unrealistic nature fantasy based nature of the film won't appeal to a more mature audience while the very impressive make up and demonic characters will absolutely terrify young children . Interesting too that a common complaint on this page is the incoherent plotting of the narrative . Quite often I found myself asking where the story was heading Insummary this is considered to be one of the weaker films of Ridley Scott . By a bitter irony the directing and visual aspects are in fact the best thing about LEGEND which is a film that strikes the audience that the audience as being a film that is confused as to its market . Certainly it owes more than a bit to Tolkien but by the same token Peter Jackson may very well owe a bit to Ridley Scott,Legend
15,Hey_Sweden,"""May be innocent, may be sweet...ain't half as nice as rotting meat.""",7,3 November 2018,"Jack (Tom Cruise) and Lily (Mia Sara) are young friends in a mystical land occupied by goblins, fairies, all-important unicorns...and threatened by the evil machinations of the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry). Jack will be joined by other heroes like Gump (David Bennent), Screwball (Billy Barty), and Brown Tom (Cork Hubbert) as they take on the challenges facing them, and work to figure out a way to defeat Darkness.Since ""Legend"" is directed by master stylist Ridley Scott, it's not surprising that it looks great, with production design by Assheton Gorton and cinematography by Alex Thomson. Written by William Hjortsberg (whose other credits include 'The Georgia Peaches', ""Thunder and Lightning"", and ""Angel Heart""), it does dawdle somewhat at times, and it becomes clear that it doesn't really contain a lot of story. Still, it's a reasonably engaging adventure that also benefits from a truly stifling atmosphere at times, and characters that are generally amiable without being fleshed out very much.The special effects are well executed, with makeup effects expert Rob Bottin (""The Howling"", ""The Thing"", and ""Total Recall"") doing some extremely impressive work, especially the incredible visage that he and crew create for Curry. You certainly don't recognize the actor at all.The actors are appealingly sincere, with Cruise and Sara representing characters of innocence. In addition to Bennent, Barty, and Hubbert, we have Alice Playten as a nasty goblin named Blix, Peter O'Farrell as pig-faced Pox, Kiran Shah as Blunder, Annabelle Lanyon as the fairy Oona, and top character actor Robert Picardo (another performer you won't recognize) as a hungry witch named Meg Mucklebones. Curry is the true M.V.P. of the production, looming over all with a performance of pure seductive evil.Available in two cuts: the butchered North American release, running an hour and a half with a Tangerine Dream soundtrack, and the richer European release / directors' cut that runs approximately 24 minutes longer, and boasting a majestic Jerry Goldsmith score.Although it's been said that kids might dig this one, it is true that this is more of a ""fairy tale for adults"", with elements too intense and sinister for the youngest of your family.If you've enjoyed other 1980s fantasy features, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.Seven out of 10.",Legend
16,poolandrews,An odd one.,5,17 November 2007,"Legend is set in a mystical world which the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry, insert your own jokes...) used to rule, however light was introduced & eclipsed the evil darkness banishing him to his underground liar. All the light & happiness that has come to the world is inside two unicorns, the Lord of Darkness realises that if he kills the unicorns the light inside will be destroyed & he can once again rule this world with his evil darkness. He sends three Goblins out into the world to find & kill the unicorns, in order to do this they follow a two young people in love Jack (Tom Cruise) & Lili (Mia Sara) who lead them right to the unicorns. The Goblins kill one of the unicorns & the world is plunged into half darkness as to complete the job both unicorns must be killed, Jack & Lili after discovering what they have started set out to save the one remaining unicorn & prevent darkness from taking over their world...This American British co-production was directed by Ridley Scott & is one of those odd films which I can't quite decide if I liked or not. One very apparent aspect of Legend is that frustratingly it exists in several different versions, the European cut, the American cut, a TV version & a 'director's cut' released on DVD. I will be basing my comments on the 90 odd minute American cut which has the electronic synthesiser Tangerine Dream score which replaced the orchestral Jerry Goldsmith one & altered/re-edited many scenes in various ways. Anyway, the script by William Hjortsberg probably didn't resemble this that much (considering the original cut ran 150 minutes) but he still gets the credit, one felt that he was trying to create a dark fairy tale for adults like The Company of Wolves (1984) did a year before but this is where the editing comes in because Universal who distributed it in the US cut it to appeal to younger children much more & one suspects the film would have worked much better as the dark sinister horror themed fantasy it was probably intended to be. Everything in Legend is pure fantasy, the character's & locations are OK but Fairies, Dwarfs, Elves, Goblins & Unicorns are all staple ingredients of many fantasy stories & films so it did feel a bit samey to me at times.This was director Scott's third foray into the world of fantasy cinema after Alien (1979) & Blade Runner (1982) & one would suggest Legend is his most ambitious film out of the three. Entirely set within a fantasy world this looks simply sumptuous, from breathtaking forest landscapes beautifully lit & shot to dark swamps containing horrible creatures to the Lord of Darkness' spectacular Gothic castle which just looks fabulous. A better looking fantasy film you will not see, the attention to detail, the cinematography, the lighting, the special make-up effects, the costumes everything looks wonderful & Legend is a triumph of production design. But is that enough? Is a good looking film enough to save a rather mundane & predictable good vs. evil morality tale? To be honest I don't think so, film is obviously a visual medium but it's also there to entertain & tell a story which is debatable in the case of Legend. There are a few fights with weaponry like axe's, swords & bow's & arrows but the violence level isn't that high. The special effects are impressive, the green wrinkled skinned swamp creature Meg Mucklebones looks fantastic & is a wonderful creation but it's the Lord of Darkness himself who steals the show. In some ways the typical image of the devil, red skinned, horns on his head & hoofed feet he is brought to life with an imposing make-up job. He just looks great, the effects are superb & it's just a shame he doesn't get to do a bit more beside make silly speeches.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Legend is technically flawless & a joy to watch, unfortunately I just don't think the tired story does the breathtaking visuals justice. Filmed partly at Pinewood studios in London in England, despite being filmed in England & co-financed by an English company the longer director's cut has never been released over here. The acting is OK, Tim Curry is totally unrecognisable under all the make-up as the Lord of Darkness while this was an early screen appearance for Tom Cruise who would find Hollywood super-stardom in Top Gun (1986) the following year which was co-incidentally directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony!Legend is a visually wonderful fantasy film of that there is no doubt, unfortunately the standard good vs. evil morality tale isn't that interesting & doesn't come close to matching the spectacular visuals. I don't know, did I like it overall or not? To be fair I'm not quite sure.",Legend
17,CinemaSerf,Entertaining and colourful.,7,10 October 2021,"Ever since I was a nipper, I have always been on the side of a good baddie - Charles Middleton's ""Ming the Merciless""; ""Darth Vader"" - heck, I was even on the side of ""Jaws"" (the fish and the man with the metal teeth), so this film should have been right up my street. The evil ""Darkness"" (expertly hammed up by Tim Curry) instructs his goblins to procure the horns from the unicorns left in the world, thus plunging the planet into perpetual darkness to be ruled by his benevolent self. Meantime, Tom Cruise ""Jack"" and his forest allies - elves, nymphs etc are all determined to thwart not only this grand plan by any means they can, but also to deprive him of the hand of the Princess ""Lili"" (Mia Sara) on whom he has set his horns. The visual effects are charming and effective and Jerry Goldsmith's score marries the light-heartredness of the forest with the evil darkness of the underworld realm well too. The acting - aside from Curry - is neither here nor there. Cruise does his job efficiently, as does Sara - but the film really belongs to the make-up and effect folks who have created the wonderful mystical beings - especially the goblins and Peter O'Farrell's aptly named, porcine, ""Pox"". It's an enjoyable fantasy adventure from Ridley Scott that just ends badly... for me, anyway!!",Legend
18,dbborroughs,It looks good but....,5,16 November 2009,"Ridley Scott's sumptuous fantasy film about darkness trying to take over the world and get his hands on a unicorn's horn. The original US release of the film was a messy affair cut by a half an hour and re-scored by a studio that didn't know what to make of the film. The film was released in tact in Europe and which lead to all sorts of stories about how much better the directors real cut was. Eventually the studio relented and they released the film on home video. I saw the original US cut in the movies and I loved the look of the film. Its one of the most beautiful films, fantasy or otherwise ever made. As an example of set and character design the film is tops. Even in these days of CGI the film still is amazing to look at. The trouble is the film as a story is kind of weak. Things kind of ramble along and there seems to be things that could be sped up. I think the studio was right to trim the film but I think they cut the wrong stuff. It also doesn't help that Tom Cruise is somewhat miscast in the lead. His performance is fine but his boyish good looks shine through and he seems too modern even in fantasy clothes. I like the film I don't love it. It's a great film to see once, but I don't need to own it.(then again I own the special edition DVD and don't see myself giving it up.) Worth a look.",Legend
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Undeniably well-done,7,6 January 2008,"I'm honestly not sure I ""got"" this film. It would be far from the truth to claim that I'm much of a fan of the genre of fantasy. I watched this because of the people behind the camera... more specifically, the work of Ridley Scott, who may have not won me over to the point of fan-dom, but continues to interest me, and Rob Bottin, whose work(within the field of special effects) I've been more interested in as of seeing him in the feature-length behind the scenes retrospect production on The Thing, entitled Terror Takes Shape. The pacing is reasonable. The lighting has moments of excellence, and plenty enough to spare. The acting is quite good, Tim Curry in particular, as the Lord of Darkness(and the make-up and such are fantastic). The effects and such in general are magnificent, and not even necessarily just ""for their time"", either. There are plenty of colorful and creative beings to be found in the film. Production design tends to be great, throughout. Editing is mostly good, but for the few awkward cuts. I watched the regular version, of about an hour and a half, not the Director's Cut. Cinematography varies, there were times where I couldn't tell what was going on. The dialog is... well, usually grandiose, but some words used seem terribly out of place, and take you out of the film, some. The version I saw was about an hour and a half long. There are some themes and such that are perhaps too adult for children to watch this. The film, as a whole, is well-done. I recommend this to fans of fantasy, though I'm not sure kids should watch it. 7/10",Legend

This is a little unfair on Cruise because he is quite good in an early hero role. As for Scott - well, for me, this typifies his work. Right from the start of his career he has been a genius at bringing to the screen impossible worlds. Alien, Blade Runner, Legend - all look absolutely authentic. And the other aspect which Legend typifies - poor storytelling (where, I realise, I am going against the accepted wisdom).

Jack (Cruise's character) along with other enchanted creatures go to the Lord of Darkness's lair to free the unicorn and Jack's loved one who is also captured by the minions.

26,JamesHitchcock,Worked out on the back of a fag-packet during someone's coffee-break,4,6 December 2014,"Heroic fantasy films can be divided into two categories, Before Jackson and After Jackson. Peter Jackson's seminal ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was the first great cinematic masterpiece of the twentieth century, and although never equalled it has at least influenced some very watchable fantasies, notably the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Harry Potter"" series. And Before Jackson? ""Legend"" reminded me of how bad fantasy films could be (and generally were) during the seventies, eighties and nineties. About the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard's ""Willow"", and even that only achieved the modest distinction of being a mediocre film rather than a truly awful one. Having a famous director at the helm didn't always help matters. For a long time I always thought of Richard Fleischer simply as 'the idiot who made that rubbish ""Red Sonja"" – an unfair assessment, as Fleischer had earlier been responsible for films as good as ""The Vikings"", ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"" and ""10 Rillington Place"". ""Red Sonja"", together with the equally dreadful ""Conan"" films, probably damaged Arnold Schwarzenegger's career by establishing him in the public mind as a musclebound hulk with minimal acting skills. ""Legend"" was also the work of an otherwise distinguished director. Indeed, Ridley Scott's previous film had been ""Blade Runner"", in my view one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. ""Legend"" probably represented a desire to follow it up with something as different from it as possible. Scott's original aim was to produce a film based upon a traditional fairy-tale or legend, but could not find one which suited his purposes and so had the idea of commissioning an original story. The film is set in a sort of wooded fairyland which would forever be a place of beauty and enchantment were it not for the principal villain, the Lord of Darkness (or just ""Darkness"" for short). You can tell he is a villain because he looks just like traditional depictions of the Devil, except that his horns are more like a cow's than a goat's. As the film opens, Darkness has just decided to kill off the world's last two remaining unicorns, as (contrary to what astronomers may inform you) it is unicorns which cause the sun to rise every morning. A world bereft of unicorns will therefore be a world of eternal darkness- from Darkness's viewpoint, a Good Thing, but from everyone else's a Bad Thing. Darkness also has lustful designs on the beautiful Princess Lili (or Lily, depending on which version of the film you see). The task of foiling his evil schemes falls to Lili's sweetheart, a young man named Jack, who has the assistance of various characters lifted straight from the pages of some sub-Tolkienesque fantasy novel. Among these are a lisping, effeminate faun named Honeythorn Gump (brother of the more famous Forrest), a fairy named Oona and two dwarfs named Brown Tom and Screwball. (Or are they elves? Or perhaps leprechauns, given that they speak with a strong stage-Irish brogue?) There are also goblins, but as in Tolkien they are the bad guys, so they bat for Darkness's team. You can work out the rest of the plot from here. The lead role of Jack was taken by an up-and-coming young actor named Tom Cruise, at this time in the middle of his 1980s ""pretty-boy"" period, but he never does anything to show why he was, within a few years, to establish himself as a major Hollywood superstar, although, to be fair, he was possibly unlucky with a dull, hackneyed script and some stilted, ponderous dialogue. Cruise was fortunate that he followed ""Legend"" up with ""Top Gun"", made by Scott's brother Tony. This was probably the best of his pretty-boy movies and a huge box-office success. As for his leading lady, the teenage Mia Sara, she shows all too clearly just why, despite her striking beauty, she was never to become a big name herself. The best acting comes from Tim Curry as the spectacularly-horned Darkness, but even he cannot really manage to rescue the film. Indeed, he may have inadvertently made it worse. In a film where the villain seems more real than the heroes, the audience might start rooting for him, which was probably not anybody's intention. Scott originally wanted to film in Yosemite National Park, but financial considerations precluded location shooting, and a complete forest set was built at Pinewood Studios. A lot of effort was obviously put into this, and yet the result is still oddly unconvincing. (Even fantasy films need a certain grounding in reality, and Yosemite might have done for ""Legend"" what the New Zealand landscapes did for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). The same can be said of the whole fantasy universe in which the story is set; it never seems to hang together as a coherent whole in the way in which, say, Tolkien's Middle Earth does. I think that the difference lies in the fact that Tolkien spent many years working out all the details of his imaginary world, whereas all the details of the imaginary world of ""Legend"" were probably worked out on the back of a fag-packet during someone's coffee-break. ""Legend"" is not the worst fantasy film of all time; compared to ""Red Sonja"" or ""Prince Valiant"", which continued the tradition of the execrable sword-and-sorcery epic into the nineties, or to ""The Scorpion King"" which continued it even into the After Jackson era, it can look quite presentable at times. Compared to something like the ""Narnia"" or ""Harry Potter"" series, however, to say nothing of ""Lord of the Rings"", it seems sadly wanting, a low point in Ridley Scott's career. 4/10",Legend

It has fun little special effects and great make up. The acting is pretty decent, all the actors seemed to get into their roles very well.Well, this movie is about Jack and Lily, a forest boy and a princess who are deeply in love and live in this bright and magical land of happiness. I know it sounds cheesy, but it is rather lovely. But the Lord of Darkness cannot survive unless it's total darkness forever, a unicorn who possess a horn that makes all the pain of the world go away, Darkness has decided to take away it's horn and kidnap Lily to make her his bride. But there is one problem, there is one more unicorn that is holding the last bit of light, Jack is coming with his friends to Darkness's castle and save Lilly and the unicorn.This is a fun movie for the family or just a afternoon of looking for a good movie.

28,MovieAddict2016,"A mess of a movie whose ""director's cut"" is as bad as the edited version",5,10 July 2006,"""Legend"" is a legend of film-making because, similar to films by Orson Welles and Sergio Leone, it was assaulted by editors against the director's wishes and transformed into an entirely other picture. The difference between Ridley Scott's ""Legend"" and the other directors' films is that both versions of Scott's films are poorly made.The theatrical version released in America dropped the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack and was cut from 150 minutes to about 90 minutes, and Goldsmith's symphony score was replaced with Tangerine Dream and Jon Anderson (of Yes) on vocals. Tangerine Dream fits the film's fantasy storyline and brooding cinematography - if you've heard their music, you'll already know why.The film as a whole is rather unspectacular, though. Tom Cruise plays Jack, a commoner who has to embark on a quest to defeat the Dark Lord (Tim Curry), who plans on destroying the last of the Unicorns and unleashing infinite darkness on the world, as well as marrying Jack's girlfriend.Watching Tom Cruise run around in leotards for two hours isn't exactly my idea of a fun movie.

I will say they are beautiful and realistic looking in this movie.I really loved the story as well as the costumes, sets and overall look/feel to the film - it is quite a magical cinema. The creatures in the film are great looking - some extremely creepy in appearance.There are two highly trivial things I did not like about the film: 1) The voices of some of the creatures sounded to much alike. It was like these similar sounding characters had high pitched voices as if they were sucking on a helium balloon then speaking (examples: Gump and Blix). That really bothered me - it's a trivial complaint I know but it did get on my nerves for some reason.2) The other minor thing about the film I became irritated with was the relationship between Blix, Blunder and Pox - they were to much like ""The Three Stooges"" for me instead of being as terrifying as they look.My complaints are extremely minor about the film - I will tell you outside of my two trivial gripes the movie is good.7.5/10",Legend
30,Lejink,Grim fairy tale,5,18 January 2014,"A feast for the eyes, less so the brain, is Ridley Scott's dark fantasy fairy-tale. At several points in the film, the viewer is drawn to the wonderful make-up, set design and special effects, but rarely to the actors or even action, in the drama.The story uses the battle between the darkness and the light as obvious metaphors for good and evil but for me was disjointed and haphazard in its wanton introduction of characters, scene progression and narrative drive. It also doesn't help that there's little chemistry between the two star-crossed lovers in the leads or that they're separated for much of the film. Modern eyes too will have reservations about the use of lightly-clad very young child actors as fairies and in particular the scene where the Tinkerbell-type Oona demands a full kiss from Cruise's Jack.Cruise is athletic enough in the lead but lacks presence and doesn't even try to neutralise his jarring American accent. Mia Sara is better as the young princess whose innocence Tim Curry's big bad, cloven-hoofed Lord of Darkness tries to corrupt, although in actual fact she probably looks more attractive in her dark-side transformation.The big pay-day for big-budget fantasy movies about magical ""little-people"" and epic quests in some picturesque never-land was some still 20 years or so away, but I hesitate to call this particular movie a false dawn. Lacking even the slightest touch of humour, it's a rather misshapen, unnecessarily bleak movie which summarily failed to reach the inner-child in me.",Legend

Anyway, it ran at over two hours and, although I normally enjoy the director's cut more, this time I found it really boring.What was a pretty tight fantasy adventure had its first half dragged out, with long periods of little speech or where anything happens.Directed by Ridley Scott, Legend is naturally beautiful to watch and the make-up deserves a special mention for the hideous demon who's trying to slay the last unicorn. Tom Cruise (pre his meteoric rise to fame) plays the young forest boy who's destined to rescue the princess well.Although I'm not sure whether Legend will find many new fans. It's too dark to appeal to the majority of children and too lightweight to be classed as an adult's film.But for those of us with an affection for eighties films set in the days of make-up and story telling over computer-effects and Michael Bay, should still sit back and smile at the classic adventure.Personally, I'll stick to the 'trimmed' version.Good, harmless, Saturday afternoon fun.",Legend

It just does not work. OK the sets are well done and I bet it looked great on the big screen back in 1985. Its no surprise gives director Ridley Scott is a perfectionist, who often goes to great leangths to make sure things look just right. But I'm not sure the movie knows what it wants to be. It plays like a Childs fairytale, but is just too dull and dreary to hold your attention. We have the great Tim Curry, under so much make up he could be played by anyone. Likewise our hero Jack, this is the dullest performance from Cruise so far. The charisma and personality he showed it his last movies is absent here. Mia Sara (whom I love in Ferris Bueller) is bland beyond belief.I didn't really care about anything that was happening in this movie, and it's a safe bet I'll probably never watch it again. Legend tanked at the box office grossing only $15 million at the domestic box office, on a budget of approx $24 million, to end the year the 56th highest grossing movie of 1986.

Ultimate Edition comment!,10,26 October 2001,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time.Legend is a fantastic movie! I have seen this beautiful film countless times. There is just so much in this film and everything is wonderful. The prologue is a very interesting reading and after you hear the bell sounds get ready to see a visually stunning epic of greatness, love, action, and darkness! This movie here is one of the greatest that I have ever seen. By watching the original theatrical version and the Director's Cut of the film on the Ultimate Legend DVD I have realized that Legend is indeed arguably the greatest movie ever filmed and even though there are two versions they are equal. What makes The Director's Cut different is it longer with added scenes, more character development, and has a different musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. The actors that are in this make the characters just so wonderful and full of personality, the music by Tangerine Dream and Jerry Goldsmith is just so extraordinary, two of the greatest score ever written in My opinion, the action is tremendous, the scenery is just so neat, and I just could go on and on. The actors in this as I mentioned are great. Even though Tom Cruise is not one of My favorites his performance is great. A likable character. Mia Sara is just lovely in this film. I just can't believe how Tim Curry played Darkness. His voice is incredible. Curry has arguably the greatest performance ever in this film. Out of all of the dozens of great villains in movies Darkness is My favorite. David Bennent, Alice Playten, Billy Barty, and Cork Hubbert are very good. Ian Longmur and Mike Crane as the Demon Cooks are excellent. Legend is really special.

Besides the airtight direction, it's the stunning MANIMATION of the Fantasy Characters that makes LEGEND a Classic: the head-to-toe makeups MAKE the movie. Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen used stop-motion animation to give Life to their Creatures, but here we have Manimation- Creatures brought to Life, from head to toe, by Monsterwear to rival THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and GODZILLA to ALIEN and PREDATOR and everything that's come down the pike since (the Monster in John Carpenter's second episode of MASTERS OF HORROR, ""PRO-LIFE,"" certainly gives most Monsterwear a run for their money).

40,Anonymous_Maxine,Only dead meat waits for the stewpot,7,5 March 2007,"For me, Tom Cruise has two distinctly separate but equally encompassing personas  the unstoppable, eternally cool flyboy that he became the year after this film was released, and the kooky scientologist nutcase that he has become. That being said, I find it difficult to fit a third personality onto his overflowing iconography, that of a sprightly, forest-dwelling manifestation of innocence that he plays in this movie, although there are times in the movie where he really inhabits his role.I will admit that the first half of the film bored me almost to tears, but it is impossible to deny the set design, the fairy world that was created on sound stages for the film. The atmosphere is simply astonishing, and although many of the costumes and situations are a little too cartoonish (Tom Cruise, for example, punches Satan in the movie), the characters are all clever, there are amazing performances, and Ridley Scott takes one or two opportunities that he still knows how to make you cringe with creepy, slimy, long-fingered creatures. Tim Curry, as the Lord of Darkness, is absolutely phenomenal. This has to be one of the best performances I've ever seen from him.Also in the movie's defense, it is brilliantly written. It is full of powerful statements whose meaning goes far beyond the film as a whole (""What is light without darkness? What are you without me?""). My understanding is that the movie was a box office disappointment, and I would just like to say that, despite this movie's popular failure (and I do think that it is better than it's popular reputation), I am certainly glad that they decided to go ahead with the production and release of Labyrinth the following year!",Legend
41,Vartiainen,One of the ultimate fantasy camp films,6,4 May 2015,"Legend is not a film you'd expect from director Ridley Scott, more known for historic and scifi films, yet when you look closer, you start to see the resemblance to his other films. The definite epic scope, the endless struggle between fluttering good and overpowering, almost invincible evil, the use of heavy shadows and colours, the amazing production values.Legend is an important film for the fantasy film genre because of how it looks. It was one of the first films of its genre where real money was spent on set designs and special effects. And it shows. It's a gorgeous film with a unique look that has influenced most films that succeeded it. Even if that unique look means making the whole world glitter worse than all of the Twilight films combined.The costumes are also some of the best we had seen until then and they hold up pretty well even today. Tim Curry's devil costume is especially impressive on all levels. It's iconic, scary, yet expressive design that's sure to leave a lasting impression.Unfortunately, it's not a perfect film. The story itself is not bad, but I get the sense that Scott bit off more than he could chew or simply couldn't properly transfer his idea on to the silver screen. It has the makings of an epic, but the stages do not reach suitable heights to impress and the characters feel flat.This last point is not helped by the actors. This was one of Tom Cruise's first film roles and while it's not one of his worst, you can still definitely see some of his worst habits and mannerisms in display. Mia Sara as Lili, the resident damsel in distress, is also not all that interesting or captivating, though she has her moments and is hold back by the clichéd script more than anything else.But then we have Tim Curry. And by gods, is he a sight to behold. His character, Darkness, is perhaps the only reason why this movie has gathered a cult following. He defines the trope darkness is sexy, with his smooth voice, ridiculously corny lines that he still makes work, somehow, and general presence that has never fitted him better than here, in an eight feet tall devil getup.Legend is worth a watch for fans of the fantasy genre. It helped move the genre forward, contains some amazing moments and is also very pretty film in general. The story and most of the characters are not amazing, but they're not bad either, and most everyone should find something they like here.",Legend
42,gwnightscream,One Of The Best Fantasy Films!,6,27 February 2012,"Tom Cruise, Mia Sara and Tim Curry star in Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy. Jack (Cruise) is a boy who lives in the forest where his beloved, Lily (Sara) visits him. One day he decides to take her to see 2 unicorns until a group of goblins are sent by demonic figure, the Lord of Darkness (Curry) to capture one of the unicorns so he can turn the world into a icy, dark void. Lily is also taken and Jack must rescue them both from him with help from elves & fairies. It becomes a battle of good vs evil and light vs darkness. I've always liked this film and Tangerine Dream's score. Curry is amazing as Darkness and Rob Bottin's make-up effects are terrific as usual. The film has 2 versions plus different scores by Tangerine dream & Jerry Goldsmith which are both beautiful. It's one of the best fantasy films I recommend.",Legend

The re-added scenes, the restored footage, the creative soundtrack was WAY worth the money spent.This is a tale of balance: darkness/light, love/hate, good/evil. What is also is; however, is a marvelously Ridley Scott-ian directed dark fantasy.This movie is almost 20 years old, so I won't bother with the storyline/plot here, but if you like fantasy; ie: unicorns, elves, goblins, and the like, you will LOVE this movie.The direction is beautiful, the cinematography and filmography are wonderful, the acting is convincing and the portrayals are rich. The character development is deep and well done and the extended DVD version is absolutely the BEST. I couldn't believe my eyes when we first plugged it in. Amazing. Simply amazing.A most excellent movie!! I also wanted to add that this is by far one of the best Tim Curry movies. He plays the Prince of Darkness in a most convincing portrayal. The effects just KICK in this movie. From the unicorns to the goblins, everything looks dead ON. I have always loved this movie, but the DVD Ultimate edition is just that; ULTIMATE. You get all that is promised (for once) in this edition. As a fan of the movie, I am more than satisfied with this version. I literally could not believe what all had been left out of the original!! In this edition, there are no slow spots, no wasted film whatsoever. It's simply a marvelous fantasy, through and through.If you liked ""The Dark Crystal,"" ""Willow,"" ""The Last Unicorn,"" ""Leprechauns,"" ""Addams Family,"" or ""Labyrinth,"" check out ""Legend: the Ultimate Edition.""The standard release of this movie rates an 8.9/10.The Ultimate Edition of ""Legend"" rates a full 10/10 from...the Fiend :.",Legend
44,hellraiser7,Legnedary Adventure,10,24 January 2018,"Fantasy stories were always my favorate kinds of stories but they are also the darkest of stories as each of them contain rather dark undertones but are always about the forces of good and evil clashing. These things are always there because they are a part of life, it doesn't mater whether you believe the legends or not, the existence of good and evil will still be there.This film another one of my favorate fantasy films, it's also another one of my childhood gems. As I stated before as a kid I love fantasy, I loved listening to Grimm's Fairy Tales from my mom, seeing this film it was one hell of a fairy tale. However this isn't a fairy tale for kids entirely but it's one that is for teens and adults, which give the film greater accessability.The production value is just supurb it is just a feast for the eyes, as most to all this was done within a studio which is great and kinda a lost practice in most films. I really love all the set pieces from the forest land down to Darkness's hellish fortress which are all practical, no CGI bullcrap; the world is made so well it really looks like a place that could of existed. The make up work great done by my favorate make up effects artist Rob Botin, the creatures as well as Darkness look real almost like they could exist.The music score is supurb as it's a mix from both Tangerine Dream and my favorate composer Jerry Goldsmith, there are lots of memorable tracks . Action is decent which I'll admit one weak point in the film for me I honestly felt the choigraphy could of been better or a bit longer, but all the same there are some good scuffles like a fight in the kitchen as well as the sword fight between Jack and Darkness which was cool.Characters are soild, Tom Cruse is soild as Jack whom is sort of Tarzan like character just like Tarzan has lived in and with nature so his contact with the outside is limited except for Princess Lily. Mia Sara whom I think is a bit of an underrated actress is soild in this role. Both have a pretty good back and forth, it's true it's not a deep romance, fairy tales were never really known for that what are you going to do. Both have one thing in common as both are naïve as both despite how much in touch they are in the two different worlds they are from and inhabit they are also out of touch with those worlds and the darkness that lies within.However the best character and my favorate in the film as well as one of my favorate fictional villians is Darkness whom is played by my favorate actor Tim Curry. The make up and costume work of the Darkness is just supurb as it is spot on to the Devil figure known from the old legends. He is just an intimidating and slightly terrorfying figure from both his physicality and that commanding voice, I'll admit just looking at the guy as well as hearing his voice made me really nervious as a kid. But what makes the character stand out is that despite what he's suppose to represent there are shades of grey. In his mind he doesn't see himself as evil he never even mentions it once. Despite his hatred for the sunshine he longs to walk and be a part and inherit that world which he has been denyed access to; and we see he's going to do it one way or another. What makes Darkness also interesting is in a way he sort of a dark mirror, most of what he says and feels are is sort of what we all sometimes feel deep inside everyday even when we don't want to admit it. On one hand the film is pretty much a straight forward fantasy adventure which is fine by me, most of the time that's how I like most stories. But on the other hand the film does have some deep substance which complicates the story but in a good way, because it keeps itself simple but at the same time not so much.I really like how the film has some underlying tones of coming of age and the loss of innocence which is reflected in both the fantasy world and both Jack and Lilly, as we see the beautiful fantasy realm turned into a dark forboding icy hell. There is even a beautiful dance scene where Lily is dancing with a dark figure and then suddenly both become one basically Lily's loss of innocence ( on a side note I'll admit Lily looks a lot better that way, what can I say I have a think for girls in black and goths). There's kinda some biblical aligory, in a way you can says Jack and Lily are like Adam and Eve, and the fact that the land has turned is much like Adam and Eve's fall from grace.But also some philosophical territory on the perception of good and evil. Most of what Darkness says as well as a great final monologue at the end really makes you think because there is truth to it, what is it that really creates and cements the existence of good, can good really exist without the other? What truly makes a person good or evil are we ever really one or the other, or are we just a mixture of both walking a razors edge thoughout a dangerous existance? And even if evil is vanquished is it ever truly gone?Like any great legendary story it won't be forgotten.Rating: 4 stars",Legend
45,elshikh4,What if a Bedtime Fairytale Was Directed By The Evil Genie ?!,4,14 March 2008,"(Ridley Scott) is one brilliantly crazy director, fond of building such special worlds, and capable of making their smallest details uniquely every time: the spaceship and the strange plant (Alien - 1979), the gloomy futuristic city (Blade Runner - 1982), and the legendary world which's all in the studio (Legend - 1985), but - this round - the final product was something really detestable!If this movie was dispatched for children, then it's so scary and sickening. If it's an adventure for youth, then it's totally queer. And if it's a drama for grown-ups, then it's a frightfully exotic one. Frankly, despite the strong sensitive art direction and some diligent elements, there is no entertainment or magic. You'll have dark scenes with the most effective sense of melancholia, and so unfamiliar taste, but to inharmonious and unpleasant extent.(Tom Cruise) is just a smile in a toothpaste's ad, and nearly still the same till now, except for some maturity and orthodontics! Having (David Bennent) as the sidekick jinni is an idea from the original hell; this boy with the sharp dubbed voice was awfully terrifying, and inhumanly silly; it's a type of a new character which turned out to be a new very ugly character! The masks were so dull, the pace was so sluggish, even the imagination of the movie was un-childish to a devilish degree as if they designed it all to torture the audience!Everything seemed so misshapen. The try to make the whole thing in studio, or even the atmosphere of a damned world, came out as just excuses to make a Novo fairytale in a monstrosity form, especially with (Ridley Scott)'s heavy minutia. Like being in the studio was the point, yet that, nor its story too, didn't work as entertaining at all. I think this simple dream sunk under the desire to create a huge rare cosmos, so it managed to become eventually a perfect example of immoderate modern style to tell what was once upon a time a cute story. I couldn't fight my feeling during every second of it as antipathetic indigestible and burdensome grotesque, and thank God that (Scott) deleted an HOUR of this, otherwise it would've been a mightier monster!So this movie is a legend indeed but when it comes to intolerability. It's an injurious woeful demon, a swelling version of much simpler much prettier fairy tales, looking like a hard hallucination of a sick (Cinderella), or the story of (The Girl in the Red Dress) but from psychotic wolf's point of view, or it's another nice story for children, with the happy ending, however directed by the evil genie!P.S: ""If Life is A Dream Then Be Afraid Of Awakening""..

47,freemantle_uk,A fairy tale cliché,5,15 February 2010,"Sir Ridley Scott is one of the best directors around, who can take the audience into another world, and is properly going to enter the ranks of great director who have never won an Oscar. When Legend was made Scott's career was clearly on the up, having made the Duelists, Alien and Blade Runner. Sadly Legend was his first flop and showed that had the problem of being a hit and miss director.In a magical world The Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) is rising again, and his only weakness is sunshine. They is only one thing preventing him gaining his full strength, the presents of unicorns. He demands his most wicked of goblins, Blix (Alice Playten) to find them, kill them and bring their horns to him. In the forest are two young friends, Jack (Tom Cruise) and Princess Lily (Mia Sara). Both are innocent and in love with nature and each other. Jack and Lily accidental lead Blix to the unicorns, where one is killed, and the world is plunged into a deep winter. The other unicorn and Lily are capture and taken by to the Lord of Darkness' lair. It up to Jack, and his allies, including Gump, a child-like elf creature (David Bennent) and the fairy Oona (Annabelle Lanyon), to save Lily and the unicorn and stop the evil Lord.There is good make-up and special effects in the film, but that is not enough. The Lord of Darkness does look impressive, yet this film has overly camp feel, with the dialogue and the look of some scenes. A good example is Blix who uses rhymes when being evil and lacked any menace that was required.There are a number of problems in the film. The key problem is the script: it is full of fairy tales clichés, awful dialogue, a uninspired plot and plot holes. One of the big examples is Blix and his teams capture the second unicorn when they could have easily killed it and let the Lord of Darkness take over. They isn't much to the film. The film also seem to lack any real action, that could have made it more exciting and more driven. Not a lot happens and their is no real challenge despite the fact they are fighting the Devil. They are problems with casting. Tom Cruise was terribly miscasted, looking too old for his part and offering a weak performance. Alice Playten just sounded weird and as stated, was pretty camp. David Bennett looked very creepy and it was even worst with Alice Playten's voice. However Mia Sara was pretty good in the film, and Tim Curry was fairly impressive.Despite the good make-up for the film for characters like Blix and the Lord of Darkness, other characters like the dwarfs did not look so good. The set design also looked fairly cheap and not very well done. This is not Ridley Scott's finest hour.If you want to watch a good fantasy film watch Peter Jackson's extended Lord of the Rings films or Michael Vaughn Stardust. If you want a good Ridley Scott you have some many opinions like Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, American Gangster, Body of Lies and Black Hawk Down.2 out of 5.",Legend

Yes. Yes. Yes.

And I can't stand it! I can't! This dream-like fantasy, presented in the mold of a Grimm's Fairy Tale, concerns the doings of the demon ""Darkness"" who tries to gain control over a young, virginal princess who represents the epitome of absolute innocence.Unfortunately, with characters that are not at all well-defined, Legend's ambitious story lacks any real momentum.

49,kevin_robbins,Overall this is a very fun movie that wont go down in history as a classic but should.,9,14 June 2021,"Legend (1985) is a movie I watched from my DVD collection recently with my daughter.

This movie is directed by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and stars Tom Cruise (Top Gun), Tim Curry (IT), Mia Sara (Ferris Bueller's Day Off), David Bennent (Dog Day) and Robert Picardo (Inner Space). The storyline for this picture is outstanding and very underrated, like a more intense version of Labyrinth or Willow. Curry was an awesome villain and the mark-up and special effects were way ahead of its time. Cruise also played the naive hero very well.

50,dee.reid,A much better film than Legend has it,7,29 October 2007,"British director Ridley Scott's film ""Legend"" is a visual marvel, full of beautiful imagery and sounds. It has a fantastic script by William Hjortsberg that remains faithful to classic fairy tale lore of good vs. evil, even while discarding some of the more extravagant (but all too familiar) elements of fantasy such as black magic, dragons, and all manner of sorcery. This is a darker and more brilliant vision of the fantasy genre, something that it desperately needed when we've become so used to bright lights and magic - you know, stuff for children. But in all the beauty and magic, it's easy to see how things such as a complicated story, uneven scriptwriting, and mediocre performances can seriously undermine what could have been a truly great fantasy epic.""Legend"" concerns the classic good vs. evil, light vs. dark, Heaven vs. Hell battle common in most fairy tales. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a young forest dweller who one day invites his beloved Lily (Mia Sara) to join him in watching two of the last unicorns, the most mythical of all forest animals, we're told, as a gift for her. Conflict arises when three goblins sneak into the forest and slay one, stealing its horn, thereby throwing the world into darkness, and turning this once-beautiful landscape into a frozen wasteland of death and despair.It's at this point that I must stop describing the plot. These opening scenes are some of the rousing and beautiful special effects sequences I've ever seen. They're full of life and light, sounds and imagery, that are certainly unlike any other fantasy film I've seen before it. Players Cruise and Sara fit nicely into the forest scenery, and the emotive and surreal score by Tangerine Dream matches it gracefully. Closing my eyes, I can imagine myself in the forest with them, surrounded in this beautiful fairy tale land of special effects. I found myself playing these scenes over and over again because I just wanted to envelope myself in the scenery.In the chaos, Jack and Lily are separated - Jack getting trapped and forced to wander through the blinding snowstorm, while Lily is kidnapped by the three goblins and taken to the depths of the Netherworld. Jack is then allied with his four forest friends - an elf named Gump, two dwarfs, and a fairy - and together they set off on a dangerous trek to the Netherworld to rescue Lily from the hideous, would-be satanic, the Lord of Darkness (an unrecognizable Tim Curry), who wants Lily to be his bride.It has to be said over and over, but ""Legend"" is a beautiful-looking film, with some strong writing and poetic dialogue that are compliments of writer Hjortsberg. The production and makeup effects (by effects wizard Rob Bottin) really bring Hjortsberg's world to life on screen under Scott's careful direction, and that is a strong plus on the part of ""Legend."" In the sights and sounds, however, it's easy to lose track of the characters and their performances, and our feelings for them. It could be said that Scott's direction only focuses on the special effects rather than the players, so it's difficult to really care for anything that happens to them (although there is one eerie and surreal sequence where Lily dances with a demon in the Lord of Darkness's chamber that is deeply affecting upon my second thoughts of that scene).But nonetheless, I found the characters and the actors to be alive and graceful (and occasionally very humorous), even if they are sometimes relegated to the background of special effects. The most impressive of all these characters is Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness. As I stated earlier, he's pretty much unrecognizable under Bottin's heavy prosthetics, though I wonder how such a light-built actor was able to carry on his performance under such heavy makeup. Regardless, Curry pulls it off and succeeds in being a truly memorable villain.""Legend"" is far from being a failure, but it is something different from what we're used to seeing when it comes to the fantasy genre. It's a brilliant exercise in ideas and imagination, brought to life by a talented cast and crew that knew their roles and knew them well. This is what ""Legend"" is made of.7/10(Note: A two-disc ultimate edition DVD director's cut of ""Legend,"" which includes never-before-seen footage and runs approximately 24 minutes longer than the 1985 theatrical version and also features the original score by composer Jerry Goldsmith, was released in 2002.)",Legend
51,MaxBorg89,Good-looking but ultimately hollow fantasy by Ridley Scott,6,17 February 2008,"As revered as it is today, Alien was famously criticized for being more about the eerie mood than the story or the characters. Fair enough, but at least the plot and the cast were good enough to ensure Ridley Scott's blend of horror and science-fiction turned out to be the unique masterpiece it is. The same can't be said of the director's fourth feature, Legend, a fantasy film that aims high but misses most of the time.There's nothing wrong with the picture stylistically speaking: as always with Scott, the visuals are a feast for the eye, totally justifying his claim that, in terms of images, Legend is the live-action equivalent of a Disney movie - a gorgeous spectacle from start to finish! Even the plot seems to be perfect for an animated feature: there's an adventurous youngster (Tom Cruise) living in the enchanted woods, there's a beautiful girl (Mia Sara) he is in love with, there are magical creatures (unicorns, to be more precise) and of course, there is a villain worthy of the name, a demon (Tim Curry) bent on casting an endless night over the entire world. And naturally Jack (that would be Cruise's character) is the only person who can stop it all.So far, so good. Why, then, does Legend fail to deliver something remotely close to a thrill for most of its running time? The story, although basic, has enough appeal, and the pace is practically faultless, so Scott is not to blame. No, the picture's flaws stem from miscasting: as handsome as he may be, this time Cruise simply doesn't have the charisma he generally masters to perfection - even the trademark grin, normally a nuisance, is missing, leaving Jack a two-dimensional hero few will root for. Sara is similarly bland, depriving the romance of all its life force. Only Curry, in a role that sort of anticipates his slimy work in It, looks like he is completely at ease in the otherworldly environment Scott has crafted around him, and delivers an excessive but completely enjoyable performance, as opposed to Cruise's controlled complacency. The movie can be seen once for his effort, but otherwise fans of the director or the star should look for more satisfying products.5,5/10",Legend

This is dark fairy tale taking place in a fantasy world filled with unicorns, goblins and fairies. On the surface this is a classic tale of good verses evil, but has lots of nuanced details and sophistication that I have come to understand much more clearly than my initial exposure to the film in my youth. The cinematography and f/x are exceptional in bringing this world to life and looking believable. Performances are pretty solid with Tom Cruise as the heroic Jack and his love interest the stunning princess Mia Sara and let's not forget an iconic performance of Tim Curry as Darkness. This is very much the Lord Of The Rings for the 80's, but a different story and no CGI. Legend is in my opinion a much underated and classy film that was very imaginative and well crafted.",Legend
53,adamjohns-42575,Someone's got the horn and it's not Tom.,5,22 February 2021,"This film has definitely fallen victim to an Editor/Director who has been given a pair of scissors and too much time on his hands. It does still flow, but it's far too fast and there is no time to get to know the characters before the journey has started and already finished.
Apparently there is a Directors Cut which is substantially longer and better. I would appreciate seeing that, even though this version isn't brilliant. There are other things wrong with it too, but for the most part it's not a bad film, it's just not an amazing film, which it could have been. The story actually has potential.Although I'm not his biggest fan, Tom isn't actually that bad here at all and I love everything Tim Curry does. But the Gump character was creepy and the Dwarves didn't get the opportunity for the humour which they should surely have brought, based on what we did see.It was also distracting that they used whale song for the sounds of the Unicorns. I was half expecting Captain Kirk to beam in and say ""Captain's Log: We have arrived in the late 20th century in an attempt to bring two Humpback Whales to the 23rd century in the hopes that they can communicate with a destructive probe. . ."" It was actually quite off putting.I think a remake of this today, even with the same cast, those that are still with us, would be very well received, until then I will look out for the Director's Cut on DVD, but I'm not paying the £11.42 that they want for it on eBay.

He also has his eye Princess Lily, the love of Jack's life.Legend clearly had quite a bit of money. The production offers large, very beautify sets, great make up, and lots of physical effects including, pyrotechnics, smoke and steam, and showers of glittering snow and sparkles. Sometimes the film resembles a kiss concert (with a bit more plush). There are also, elves, goblins, unicorns, trolls. When we think of Fairy tales we think of light and chirpiness. We do not consider how dark and sinister they can be. On the light side you have films like, Labyrinth, and The Princess Bride, and on the dark side you have films like Willow and this.

So I caught the Ridley Scott directed 1985 film the other night on Encore and in spite of the lack of any spectacular special-effects and out-dated technology which almost made the leads, lovebirds Lili and Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise) seem out-of-it and ridiculous perhaps because my eyes are so used to the technology of today or as many have suggested that it's the 90-minuted-butchered-editing of the US edition of the film which is what I had the misfortune of viewing, though I must add that I did get the feeling that I may have seen the European cut when I was much younger. Tim Curry brought such theatrical terror to his turn as Darkness that trying to find any technical flaws in his delivery of this character, would be an adventure in itself. The scenes involving Lili after she is captured by Darkness' minions and he falls in love with her are quite note-worthy. Sara gave her better acting when she went to the dark side.",Legend

This simplistic story is about Princess Lili (Mia Sara) and her boyfriend Jack-of-the-Green (Tom Cruise) were enjoying a fairytale atmosphere together. Then all of the sudden, Jack points out to Lili two gorgeous unicorns standing together that cross balances the lines between good and evil. As a precaution, Jack tell Lili not to touch them. But Lili's temptation get the best of her as she walks over to the unicorns, a group of goblins take advantage and successfully confiscate the unicorn's horn. Shortly after that, winter comes into effect as and the balance is now messed up. Lily and the other unicorn enter a dark world and are held hostage to the Lord of Darkness' chamber where he becomes smitten by her purity and uses that purity so that she becomes corrupted before destroying the last unicorn. Meanwhile Jack joins forces with a group of faeries to rescue Lili and to prevent this demonic miscreant from blocking out the light. A very young Tom Cruise's character Jack was very painfully underdeveloped. Sure he looks like the typical warrior fantasy hero sporting loincloth clothing and carrying a mighty sword, but overall this is Cruise's most forgettable character in his career. There's no history or any background to hold one's interest. But still his voice and his way of carrying the character makes Jack a definitive hero. The real characters that truly carry the story was Mia Sara's Lili and Tim Curry's Lord of Darkness. Underneath all that heavy makeup and over-the-top dialogue, Curry adds the right amount of malice and yet can also come across as sympathetic. Sure he's as evil as they come, but deeper inside, we see a very lonely devil who think his darkness balances the good and the light. And that is why he's asking for Lili's love as she becomes attached to his dominion. Lili's transformation from the fantasy light-bright princess, to the runaway bride to the Gothic-laden princess was engaging to say the least. Lili's transformations are handled with precision and care and teaches the lesson, that to get by in a fight against evil in fantasy environments means to break some rules and go against moral issues and as she goes deeper to becoming evil, she still manages to keep her humanity alive. And whether good or evil, Lili is eye candy the whole way through. The cinematography was best thing that makes this movie stand out very well. The fairy-tale flowers and forestry is saturated with many vibrant colours. As for the Darkness' chamber, the dark colours is what I would have expected coming from an evil fiend like him. It's not a mainstream film at all, and many people might be turned off by its bizarre ways, but I think it's execution is terrific in terms of trial, temptation, lust, and the fight for good against evil. When I was a child I was totally freaked out by the presence of the Lord of Darkness. He was and is still to this day, one scary looking dude. This is no way a kid-friendly fantasy adventure story. I haven't seen this movie in years, but just today I rented the DVD and it brought back so many memories and the story itself, though thin and very short, but entertaining and enthralling. I highly recommended to children 9 years and older, mostly because the bad guy is one scary demon.",Legend

60,mstomaso,The Director's Cut is Gorgeous!,8,12 August 2007,"I will join the chorus... This is a beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyable fantasy film as long as you watch it in digital widescreen and do not bother with the 1hr 30min version. The Director's Cut(better known as the European release) is worthy of an IMDb rating of 8. The American theatrical release is worthy of a 6.5.This is a fairly straightforward fantasy conceived and directed by Ridley Scott, one of the greatest mainstream directors of our time. The story follows a young man who lives in a forest (Jack, played by Tom Cruise) and a spirited young princess (Lily - Mia Sara) who is in love with him. The lord of darkness (Tim Curry) has sent forth his minions to capture the last two remaining unicorns so that he can banish light from the world forever. Unicorns are attracted to innocence, and so they find themselves in Jack and Lily's company just as the dark lord's play begins to unfold. Before long, Jack and his magical forest friends must save Lily, the one remaining unicorn and the world from the grasp of the dark lord at any price.Even the lengthier director's cut goes by just a little too quickly. But it's pace is not comparable to the incredibly hasty studio chop-job of the American release. The story is epic, but the medium is not. All considered, however, the production team did a great job given the length limits afforded for the film.Cruise does pretty well with a role that must have been a little hard to interpret. Jack must behave as a hero, a young man who has learned most of his lessons from nature, and a teenager to varying degrees throughout the film. Mia Sara is delightful a Lily. Tim Curry and David Bennent (Honeythorn Gump) get pretty close to stealing the show. In all, the acting is fine, but the star of the film is really the camera.Scott has often proved his ability to create immersive experiences in worlds which are somewhat alien (no pun intended) to his audience. Legend does this perhaps as powerfully as his most far-out films (Alien, and Bladerunner). The cinematography, editing, and special effects are exceptionally good, and make the fairly average plot glow. Each scene is a work of art.Highly recommended for fantasy fans, Ridley Scott, Tim Curry and Mia Sara fans and those interested in artfully presented effects. Recommended for fans of Pan's Labyrinth and Mirrormask. Weakly recommended for Tom Cruise fans.",Legend
61,film-critic,The dreams of youth are the regrets of maturity.,4,2 July 2006,"In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature. To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs? That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend. Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together. I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade. I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes. It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs. What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures. We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top ""Price of Darkness"" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling ""bang"". We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light. Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esquire creatures. Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively). Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait. With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait. The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us. Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film. While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping. I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film. This hurt Legend. Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet. With Legend, I never felt that. I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination. I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous ""director's cut"") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie. Scott had some (I stress ""some"") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions. What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters. In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters. Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of ""anyone-itis"". Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask. Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone? Follow this up with some elves and dwarfs that seemed more cliché than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend. I wanted to like this film. I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film. I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a ""direct to video"" release. Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed. Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting. Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together. During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect. Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece. From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.Grade: ** out of *****",Legend
62,vip_ebriega,Visually-stunning and attractive. Think nothing much of the script.,7,9 February 2007,"My Take: Although a slight disappointment, Ridley Scott did drown me with his excessively imaginative visions. If we get a hold of Ridley Scott's paperback-thick portfolio, it's no doubt that this fancy yet admittedly bloated 1985 fantasy will probably at the very least pages. LEGEND, a minor ""why-not-I-got-a-big-Hollywood-star"" vehicle that probably suffered immense flaws of not fulfilling the same amount of greatness we expect from a director of Scott's caliber. Still, It's a good look for pure curiosity sake. Besides, are you gonna pass up the chance to see Tom Cruise play a forest dweller? Younger kids love a good fairy tale before getting tucked in at night. Some adults love watching their own ""fairy tales"", adult-oriented fantasies of course. ""Legend"" is one film the adults can enjoy, that the kids won't regret. It's an adult-oriented fantasy film, with child-like visions of a fantasy world. A world with dwarfs, goblins, evil dark lords, unicorns, fairies and other fantasies straight out from a storybook. But director Ridley Scott fashioned it in a story that the adults will mostly benefit from.""Legend"" stars a very young Tom Cruise, a role before he became a superstar with ""Top Gun"", who stars as a forest-dwelling young man who most save a beautiful young princess from the evil Lord of Darkness with the help of a couple of woodland creatures. Okay, the story isn't exactly like an adult fairy tale, but much of the dialog is fashioned for the suit older audiences. The film itself is very fantastic, it's really like living in a world of magic, wonder and desire. Rob Bottin's Oscar-nominated make-up job on the creatures (especially on Tim Curry) are excellent, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is whimsical. William Hjortsberg's screenplay may turn off a few viewers (and occasionally, there are moments of witless dialogue), but I found it exquisite and rather interesting. It's a slight disappointment to be sure. More could have been done to something as visually stunning and deeply poetic as LEGEND. But no one says what came out isn't worth a look. I was entranced with the film's glorious, dream-like visions. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Legend

The make-up and practical effects in this movie are truly sublime, Tim Curry as the devil is jaw dropping, and the dream like set design is really quite magical, you can see why and how it inspired the Zelda video games.

The Dark Lord decides he would like to have his way with virgin princess, while her true love Jack (Tom Cruise) tries to rescue her and save the world. Long, dark, murky, loaded with black humor and undeniably well crafted. A beautiful film to look at that is hopelessly chopped up in the American version which replaces Jerry Goldsmith's original music with music by Tangerine Dream.

65,TOMASBBloodhound,A lush fantasy. Light on plot.,7,11 September 2009,"One thing I'm coming to realize about director's cuts is that they seldom add much to the original film. It had been over 20 years since I'd seen this film, but one could clearly notice some padding in this new version. Much of it is totally unnecessary, but not bad in any way. Also, they seemed to have done away with the contemporary music from Tangerine Dream. I kind of missed that. I guess the film is still overall a decent effort worthy of a look.The story is hardly complicated. There is an evil creature known as ""Darkness"" played by Tim Curry. In an attempt to end all light on earth, he enlists some goblins to kill the last two unicorns and deliver the horns to him. He should have hired better goblins, as these oafs basically botch the job and kill only one of the magnificent beasts. Darkness sends them back to kill the other, and in the process, a beautiful princess is taken captive as well. Darkness plans to sacrifice the remaining unicorn and marry the princess. It is up to Tom Cruise and a group of fairies (no jokes here, please!) to rescue the princess and the unicorn, and use the last glimpses of sunlight to destroy Darkness.Tim Curry, as the devilish villain steals the show. And that's a problem since he has little screen time. His absences are particularly glaring in the director's cut since no new footage is of him that I could spot. He has all the best lines, too. Considering the extent of his costume and makeup, one would guess he had to spend hours upon hours in the makeup chair each day he was on set. Hats off to you, Mr. Curry. You've always been one of my favorite actors that isn't a huge star.Tom Cruise had not yet become a huge star, but he was on his way. Top Gun the following year would take care of that for him. Here he looks kind of overwhelmed by this magical world Ridley Scott has created. He looks more sure of himself in romantic scenes shared with Mia Sara who plays the princess and his love interest. She is quite good in this film and its a shame her career seemed to peak when she was so young. There are other well-known character actors here and there, but they are pretty well covered up by Rob Bottin's makeup and costumes.The film is a beauty to watch. The sets are so lush detailed that some of them just swallow the actors up. This film was critically lambasted and now really only considered a cult film. Apparently it took much longer than anticipated to make, and was not an enormous box office hit. But great directors like Sir Ridley Scott always soldier on, and make at least two successful films for each one that misses. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Legend
66,gab-14712,Your Standard Fantasy Film (Outside of Curry's Darkness)!,8,29 July 2020,"I am a sucker for any fantasy movie. I can even be drawn in to watch the horrible ones and still find some joy. So, when I discovered that the visionary director behind Alien and Blade Runner directed a fantasy film reminiscent of the tales of King Arthur and Lord of the Rings, I made it my mission to seek the film out. There are multiple versions of the film, so I am reviewing the American version which came out in 1986. The production design and the makeup are true works of art and the visual eye candy really stands out. That said, I wish I could have said the same thing about the story itself. The performances are fine, but the script is mediocre. Thankfully this is a Ridley Scott film, or I am afraid this film would have been utter dreck.There are multiple versions of the movie. As I said, the American version was released in April 1986 to unflattering reviews. Trivia fact time! The film was released in the UK in 1985 with a slightly longer version. The film was cut for American audiences because Scott reasoned that European audiences were more sophisticated. Can you fault him for that? The music was also changed. The UK version has an orchestral (and rather excellent) score that was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The American version had a more techno score from Tangerine Dream. I though that score was also good if you left it alone, but Goldsmith's score is clearly superior. The director's cut was released in 2002 and both Scott and lead actor Tom Cruise disowned the American version.When it comes to directing, Ridley Scott is a perfectionist. He is extremely detailed-oriented. That works for the movie and against the movie. The visuals are eye-popping. From the fields where we meet the unicorns to the evil underground lair of Darkness, everything looked well thought out. The design of the forest was incredible. Scott wanted to film at Yosemite, but instead moved to a studio backlot. Very impressive. The use of practical effects and makeup was fantastic. In fact, Tim Curry's makeup is an iconic vision that will forever be associated with the fantasy genre. Curry spent five-and-a-half hours in makeup every day to achieve his look. Such patience! With most of the effort placed into the look of the film, not much was left in the way of story. I considered the film to be joyless at points and I felt the villain had no motivation for his deeds other than the sake of being evil. I still had interest in the story but nothing like it could have been.This is the typical fantasy which features a plethora of magical beings such as elves, demons, unicorns, and the list goes on. The main hero of the story is a human named Jack (Tom Cruise). Jack is in love with the Princess Lili (Mia Sara). Lili was abducted by a monster known as Darkness (Tim Curry). He wants to turn Lili to the evil side and make her his wife. He also wants to rid the world of the Sun, light, and unicorns by turning the place into an everlasting darkness. Can Jack defeat Darkness, save the girl, and be a true hero?I will say that the actors gave committed performances. That should not be a surprise considering Tom Cruise always 100% gives his best. In the scenes where he dove and swam, that was him doing the action. This may not be his best role, but he does what he can with it. Tim Curry looked like he was having a blast. Despite his character not being well planned out in terms of motivation, it was fun watching Curry playing an evil character under all that makeup. Mia Sara did a really nice job. She was chosen because of her theatrical background and it showed here. I read somewhere that Mickey Rooney could have been hired but he did not look short enough next to Cruise who is a pretty small guy himself.Anyhow, Legend is what it is. You most likely know about it or heard about it because of Curry's iconic villain. Other than that, it is your standard, by-the-books fantasy film. Not awful, but not the best film. If you like this genre, you will find some enjoyment out of this fairy tale (at least the American film). I did hear better things about the UK version.My Grade: B-",Legend
67,Angry_Arguer,"Fairy Tale, not 'Final Fantasy'",10,4 April 2004,"The Concept:  Pre-50s Disney with Scott's mastery of production values and visual space.Ridley Scott is a director who can do little wrong in my book, even here--long considered a failure.  Nonetheless, I will bet money that his movies will be looked back on as a pinnacle of production values 100 years from now.  Perhaps that is why his work has endured unlike lesser beings like Verhoeven, whose 'Total Recall' has dated horribly in less time.This was rejected by critics and audiences, but after 19 years (and the multi-billion dollar success of the 'Lord of the Rings' series) I find this is better than Peter Jackson's adaptation.  When watching this (and remembering BBC's failure with the 'Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe' trilogy), I see that this is to 'LotR' what 'Bridge Too Far' is to 'Private Ryan'.Consider:--No pre-set fanbase, this is before Cruise had real name power.  I don't think Cruise is a good actor, he has been a strutting fool since 'Top Gun', but here his stupidity works.--No computer technology.  I love 80s movies and Scott lets Bottin & Dilley exploit the bigger budgets with better technology.  After all, every makeup trick of the 'LotR' crews originated here and Dilley is probably the best production designer ever, having previously endured the revisionist 'Empire' and the prior benchmark, 'Alien'.--Efficient polarization.  Compare what is here to the later 'Willow', both interesting efforts.  'Willow', of course, is by the Campbell-obsessed Lucas and sickeningly-sanitized Howard.  It's impossible for them to make something truly threatening--necessary for fantasy.  Scott knows how to create lasting menace by starting with the subtexts and settings.  Sadly, Jackson comes from Lucas' camp, not Scott's.Some random interesting points:Frequently when directors deviate from their style, the public ignores it. This isn't the only example.  Cameron got burned with his visually daring 'Abyss' so he retreated to the commercial safety of Schwarzenegger. Spielberg with 'Empire', Kubrick with 'Barry Lyndon', Fincher with 'Fight Club', the list goes on.One thing keeps me from labeling this the best of 80s fantasy--'Dragonslayer'. At first it doesn't sound fair, but 'Dragon' was Disney's serious attempt at doing something dark and serious.  Imagine if it had succeeded... Meanwhile, this is Scott's usual work, intelligent and pessimistic in detail as always, but still typical for him.I should mention the different cuts of the film and, in particular, the music.  Jerry Goldsmith is another who can do little wrong in my book; I'm surprised that Scott hasn't stayed with him.  Oh, well.  At least Scott has Zimmer to help.  Tangerine Dream actually works for the American cut.  It reminds me of Vangelis' touch on 'Blade Runner' albeit with more of an MTV feel.  Unlike 'Blade Runner', it feels like two different films, but the analytical difference is insignificant.Overall, a pure Grimm effort that unmasks 'Conan' as the aged trash it is. Despite Scott's alleged Disney references, little of it is visible.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Legend

Mia Sara is sweet and attractive as Cruise's little princess and also equally conveys a sense of teen age youth.this was also one of those rare film's that employed the iconic Billy Barty as well as a lot of other ""little people"" actors and dwarfs. much like the film 'Willow' which hosted ""real"" little person's and not faked, CGI simulated ones like in 'Snow White and the Huntsman'.i have seen few films that deal so much in symbolism that are as easy to decipher as this. although it's story is told with lots of archetypal and religious symbolism, nothing is ever lost or difficult to grasp, even for many young viewers. like the eerie and atmospheric sequence when the princess waltzes with the darker nature of her personality. symbolic and artistic in approach, but simple and straight forward enough to be wholly comprehensible.'Legend' is a contemporary children's classic that truly elevates children's cinema to a much higher level of sophistication than is usually attempted. still it doesn't ""sell out"" by being too adult or cynical in it's appeal. in fact it strives for simplicity, which is one of the reasons this mega-budget production never seems over blown or over done. it never loses sight of the 'fairy' element or it's simplicity.like the films of Jim Henson, this is evocative children's fantasy at it's very best and a must for every child while growing up.i also must note that the director's cut is far superior to the butchered U.S. theatrical release.",Legend

73,grendelkhan,"Enjoyable, with a few flaws.",7,7 September 2006,"I first saw the American cut of Legend while in college, with a group of friends at the theater. I quite enjoyed the film, although I was not too fond of Tom Cruise as the hero. Looking back on it, I have a better opinion of his performance, as I see that he is trying to play Jack more as a fairy tale character, rather than a more heroic figure.The film is a fine attempt at adapting the figures and themes of European fairy tales into a fantasy adventure film. Ridley Scott proves once again that he is a great visual stylist, although he was still shaky with his actors. The characters are great fun, with the human ones being the weakest. Cruise plays Jack as an innocent, which strips away some depth, but it mostly works. Mia Sara's Lilly is rather bland, until she is being tempted by Darkness. Then, she gets a bit of life in her. The supporting characters are all great, especially Tim Curry as Darkness. His usual over-the-top acting is more restrained here, but his flamboyance allows a performance to come through the heavy make-up. He is both charming and menacing. The Gump is a bit annoying in the US cut, but the European cut (aka Director's cut) makes him far more dangerous.I'm on the fence about the music. I was first exposed to the Tangerine Dream score and liked it enough to buy the soundtrack. However, the Goldsmith score works quite well in the European cut. It has more of a fantasy feel, although the TD score is very atmospheric, especially in Darkness' lair.The film is a lush visual feast, all the more amazing for having been created on a soundstage (which they nearly burnt down!). The transition from the bright beginning to the cold and dark middle really lends atmosphere to the story.The film is an excellent entry into the fantasy genre, one more in keeping with European folklore than American pulp (Conan). The story is solid and the visuals amazing, and the bulk of the performances are good. The DVD is a definite bargain, as you can compare the two cuts. Each has much in their favor, and some problems.

I didn't really take anything from this except it was kinda weird watching Tom Cruise so young.,Legend
75,richieandsam,A classic 80's film... i loved it.,8,13 August 2013,"LEGENDWell... I had never seen this before, but I must say that everyone who loves 80s movies should see this. It is so much fun.The movie is about the Devil taking away the daylight and controlling the planet by killing the innocence of the last 2 unicorns alive.I love fantasy films and I love 80's movies... so this is great for me. The action is classic 80's and the make-up and effects also feel nice and retro. The feel of the whole film is brilliant.I mean the effects were not brilliant compared to todays effects, but for a fantasy film they were great. It kind of had the same feel as The Never Ending Story... another classic film. Every now and then you can see the strings helping the fairies fly. But the make-up was great. The goblins, Devil, fairies etc all looked amazing. I always wished I was part of a world like that. The action and adventure is just such fun.The acting was quite good really considering it's age. The movie stars a very young Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry and Billy Barty. I could never imagine Tom Cruise in a movie like this... but he actually suits it quite well. He did a good job. He made this just before Top Gun. Mia Sara also did a good job as the princess. This was her first movie before she appeared in a few other well known films. But Tim Curry is the star of the movie. Tim really is a legend. I love him in a lot of the movies he has made. And this is another one to add to the list of great performances.This film is great escapism which is the reason I love movies so much... it is the perfect way to forget all the worries in your life and escape into someone else's adventure.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Another classic film from the 80's.""May be innocent, may be sweet... ain't half as nice as rotting meat.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Legend

77,peefyn,A children's book come to life,6,22 April 2016,"This is a review on the theatrical version, I have not seen the director's cut. I find it likely that I would prefer the director's cut over this.For good and for worse, this movie is like a children's book come to life. One without fantastical drawings of unicorns, demons, and other creatures you'd expect to find in a European fairy tale. And it's done beautifully. The make-up is fantastic, and holds up perfectly. The sets and locations are all stunning. The cinematography as well. They've taken the wonder you get by quickly browsing through the images in such a book, and made it into a full movie.But that's also the problem. The characters are uninteresting, and you don't really connect much with any of them. The plot is unimaginative, and could be summarized in a couple of sentences, without skipping any major details. This is also similar to some fairy tales and fantasy stories, but they are usually only a few pages with little text on each - this was a one and half hour film. It's just too thin.",Legend
78,LivingDog,Only visually stunning,5,15 July 2007,"I found the story to be wanting. It is too simplistic and inconsistent. That is it raises more questions than it (is supposed to) answers. E.g. Lily is a bit of a temptress and is supposed to be ""pure""??; Jack is a bit clueless trusting Lily who immediately breaks his trust??, the lord of darkness is emotionally confused (he ""loves""?? has a ""heart""?? and a ""soul""??? - too much).It's just a fantasy story which has no basis in reality and only serves to entertain - a true definition of ""escapism."" Visually this is stunning, and the makeup in general was fantastic, but the makeup on Jim Currey is phenomenal. The lone actor who was convincing in all of this mess was Robert Picardo. His portrayal of the character ""Meg Mucklebones"" was both comedic and fordobing - a true actor cannot be better made. (I remember his portrayal of the Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager - one of the three bright spots on that show.) As for this ill focused conglomerate of juxtaposed ideas = 5/10 - at best!PS: I enjoyed the commentary on the DVD by Ridley Scott but only in that it explained the movie. E.g. he has just mentioned that the character Lily is a temptress! She must be the pure temptress version of a princess virgin?!? :/-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",Legend
79,RiffRaffMcKinley,"Like most other European things, great in Europe, horrible in the United States",9,31 August 2007,"Ridley Scott's ""Legend"" is a terrific bit of fantasy, a stunningly surreal look into a mythical world of wonders.Unfortunately, I don't believe what we got here in America *was* Ridley Scott's ""Legend."" It was an impostor. It was a goofy, clunky nightmare full of plot holes and ridiculousness, armed with a wacky Tangerine Dream score that ruined the whole thing. That movie was cut down from a perfectly entertaining 114-minute movie with a story that *made sense* and a purely beautiful Jerry Goldsmith score.Does something not seem right to you, too? I have no idea why, for Sagan's sake, Universal Studios mangled this movie for its transatlantic journey. They chopped nearly 25 minutes. They did unspeakable things to the soundscape, and not just by changing the musical score. And tragically, they still kept the scene where you can see the Lord of Darkness' horns flopping up and down.The American version is hideous (even though I still like to watch it). So if that's the only version you have seen, no wonder you don't like it! I suggest you go out and rent the ""Director's Edition"" before it's too late! Because the ""American Version"" really only goes to prove that some things (including ""The Office"") should stay on the proper side of the pond.",Legend
80,kgprophet,Middle Earth before the Advent of Digital Effects,7,3 November 2018,"In the era of digital effects, you appreciate more and more the amazing the degree of craftsmanship that went into some large films pre-1990s. ""Legend"" was the film Ridley Scott made after ""Blade Runner"". Scott became an expert in creating sets for the BBC in the 1960s. His vision of the future in ""Blade Runner"" is widely accepted as one of the most influential to our culture, decades after it was released. I thought ""Blade Runner"" was an incredible and immersive movie, dripping with production design. Here in ""Legend"" they built an entire enchanted forest on a movie set. When I first went to see this movie in the theater, the enhanced visual look and especially sound had me mesmerized. Not knowing the controversial history of this American release compared to the European release, I knew only that I really like the music of Tangerine Dream, especially their work for the film ""Thief"". Here, they introduced to audiences the multi-timbre synthesizer sounds that felt like angelic voices.There is a scene where the princess, the female protagonist of the movie, wants to touch a unicorn. The scene looks like an illustration from a fairy tale book come to life. And that's exactly what is magical about this film. Set after set is a living breathing location from a picture book. With that you can really appreciate the vast amount of work that went into making a magical world come to life without the help of digital scene extensions that are all the rage these days. This film feels like an equal to ""The Wizard of Oz"", in terms of the large and detailed production design for a fantasy film.The male antagonist is Tom Cruise. Here, such as the casting of Mia Sara as the princess, are mainly featured for their looks. There is not a lot of great dialogue amongst the cast, but a good use of post-production audio manipulation makes some characters larger than life. This was a relatively recent innovation in sound design in 1985. It is common to recreate some dialogue (perhaps 25%) that was shot live on film. But ""Legend"" totally recreated almost all dialogue to allow each character to be given a certain (digital) alteration to make the characters more distinctive. Tim Curry as the master of darkness (if not the Devil himself) becomes a monster on the screen with his voice altered to make him more massive and intimidating.The first act of this film recreates this fairytale world so convincingly, I actually felt a tear in my eye thinking how you could really feel yourself as being a part of a world with such invigorating life and beauty. Cruise's character is named Jack, and is perhaps like Tarzan, someone who lives in harmony with nature. I felt a connection to that character, as someone who also likes to climb trees and commune with nature. You can also buy into the Princess being pure of heart, with a love for the simple life as well. As mentioned, the scene of the Unicorns has an enchanting feel as well, all thanks to the very particular eye of Ridley Scott.The supporting cast consists of goblins, elves, and the like. Gump is played by David Bennett, who had an unusual lead character in the infamous ""The Tin Drum"". Here he seems possessed as the lead elf. This band of characters help Jack save the Princess, after she is kidnapped by Darkness. Complaints from critics were that the story was derivative, and tried to be too generic in order to not be a copy cat of other famous fairy tales. The prologue of this film explains that the world see here was this ""Middle World"" that gave birth to the Legends we all are familiar with today. But again, we can't really even mention something like a ""Middle World"" without acknowledging that this is derivative of J.R.R. Tolkien. My reaction was that the film has such a confident foundation that fits the story, you are not bothered by the similarities. Since the release of this film, which I saw three times in the theater (and again recently at a revival showing), I have continued to find this film magical in it's creation of the fairytale world, long before the advent of digital effects which allowed ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy to be made.As for the music, it was a controversial decision back then to be forced by the influence of MTV on society to put modern music into the soundtrack. Another period fantasy released around this time was ""Ladyhawke"", an engaging story that is well made, but has the inclusion of music from the Alan Parsons Project. It is like fingernails on a chalkboard listening to modern pop music being played over a period piece. Tangerine Dream's score is more of the World Music genre. That is, pleasant new age synthesizer chords with world instruments like an ethnic flute. That works for the moments of angelic enlightenment, but perhaps not so much for other scenes needing more tension and complexity. The original conventional orchestral arrangement for the soundtrack was composed by one the 'legends' of the industry, Jerry Goldsmith. His soundtrack along with about 20 minutes of the film was cut for the U.S. Theatrical release. Having watched the film with both soundtracks, I was equally affected. Both versions have positives and negatives. For instance the additional dialogue that is in the longer version is not that great, and the shorter version doesn't omit any of the terrific sets. There is one glaringly bad moment in the Tangerine Dream version that immediately takes you out of the movie, and that is the epilogue with a song sung by Jon Anderson from ""Yes"". The song is corny, and the particular type of voice Anderson has is distracting when added here.I still give ""Legend"" (both versions) a 7 for the hypnotic visuals.",Legend
81,alainenglish,Fun-filled fantasy romp,9,18 February 2008,"One of Ridley Scott's 1980s films, ""Legend"" has a lot going for it in terms of special effects and performances. The simple fairy-tale storyline sees a brave young elf Jack (Tom Cruise) rescue the beautiful Princess Lily (Mia Sara) from the vile clutches of Darkness (Tim Curry).That's really about it, story-wise, although there's plenty of fun along the way. Some fantastic design gives real life to the forest world where the film is set, along with the fire and shadows of Darkness' lair. In his quest Jack meets, befriends and occasionally has to outwit elves, trolls and sea creatures. It's played pretty low-key most of the time but it's still good fun.Jack is brought to life well by Tom Cruise. He isn't much of a leading man presence in this picture (that would come when he made ""Top Gun"") but he still captures the character and fits in well with the movie environment. Mia Sara has the typically thankless role of the damsel-in-distress, but she acquits herself well in a good scene where Darkness seduces her. As for Darkness himself, not only does he look fantastic but he's played with absolute relish by Tim Curry who savours every moment.

Forget the cast's performances. Forget the cheesy music. Ignore the questionable editing. Just LOOK AT IT & immerse yourself in the world he's created. This is surrealistic, beautiful ARTWORK.

83,OttoVonB,Ridley Scott's Dilemma,8,18 September 2002,"In the early 80s, Ridley Scott was THE man. Blade Runner might have flopped, but it did not dent his budding reputation as a master visualist. It also did not prevent him from attempting to revive a version of Jodorowki's mad Dune project, until family tragedy put him in search of lighter fair.Legend certainly is ""lighter"". On paper, it is an honest attempt to explore a more universal and less adult-oriented genre. It is so different from Scott's three preceding films that it is easy to understand why it completely baffled audiences, self-defeating last-minute changes in post-production notwithstanding.Legend is a fairytale, the story of Princess Lily and her forest-dwelling friend, Jack. All is well until Jack shows her one of the last unicorns and unwittingly allows the evil minions of the Lord of Darkness to kill one of them. The world is then plunged into darkness, as Jack and friends journey to the dark one's castle to save Lilly and retrieve the unicorn's horn. Not what you'd expect from the director of Blade Runner and Alien, then...The resulting film has its moments. Visually it rivals anything Scott has ever done, which is to say it looks absolutely stunning. The iconic Darkness - played with absolute glee by Tim Curry - is a triumph and the world on display comes across as a turbocharged, backlit take on Arthur Rakham's illustrations. Where it falls short, however, is in a script that doesn't quite cross over to adults and in post-production adjustments following a catastrophic preview screening.Jerry Goldsmith's score is the most inspired fantasy score until The Lord of the Rings. Why it was replaced at the eleventh hour by Tangerine Dream - who did wonders in that short time - is a real head-scratcher. The film also exists in a number of versions, none of which completely worked until a director's cut was released on DVD.Perhaps the greatest flaw on display here - which makes it even more interesting as a case study - is the weird mismatch between the weird, gruesome and slightly kinky nature of the film's second half with the naive romanticism of its first half. It simply is not too clear who this film was intended for. Still, it is worth your time.",Legend

The youthful Tom Cruise was perfectly cast as the forest boy Jack and Mia Sara was just right as the girl. But the makeup job and prosthetics that made Tim Curry the Lord of Darkness was outstanding. a film with brownies, fairies, Unicorns, goblins. What more could a fantasy film deliver, and a a bonus the plaintive voice of YES front man Jon Anderson singing the song over the final credits.

87,refresh_daemon,Beautiful and lacking good storytelling,4,2 May 2007,"I think that there was some period in the 80's when fantasy stories became really popular with directors. Jim Henson has his Labyrinth, Ron Howard (with the help of George Lucas) had his Willow. And Ridley Scott, well, he has Legend. At this point in his career, he'd already directed two of his greatest works, and here, he tries his hand at the fantasy genre. It's just too bad that he didn't have a good script to work with.The good: The imagery is immensely gorgeous. Everything is shot so beautifully that you wish that you could see that sort of thing in real life. This doesn't let up for the whole movie. There is no point in where the pictures aren't pretty.The bad: It's just really too bad that the rest of the movie more than falters. The story is lame. Essentially, evil dark prince guy wants eternal night, so he gets the horn of a unicorn. He also kidnaps a princess with the second unicorn (one of two, if they die, the world is forever engulfed in darkness). Princess likes Forest Boy and they flirt about. Forest boy has to rescue princess and save the world.Yeah, it's a simple plot that works really well in fairy tales, but the execution is awful. There is no weight to any scene. No drama. No sense of ""uh-oh, trouble"". Even though the fate of the world is at stake, we don't care. And the characters don't really seem to either. When Forest boy gets into potentially lethal combats, we don't fear for his life, or even care if he lives or dies, or the world is forever frozen. The characters are all very shallow, with the villain being *gasp* two-dimensional. I found myself pounding my head on the floor to try to add some drama to the movie.That's pretty much what I can say about the movie. It's essentially the boy/girl that you find pretty, but once you talk to them, you find them about as interesting as a ham sandwich on white. And that pretty much nullifies the watchability of the film. If I had been watching it alone, I wouldn't have finished it.If you must watch it, you don't need to see it through. You can fast forward, or better yet, mute it and use it like a screensaver. It might be more interesting in that context. 7 on the visuals, but the story is a 2. I'll give it a 4/10.",Legend

89,Quebec_Dragon,Legend 25 years later... hit or miss,5,7 May 2010,"I first saw this celluloid fairy tale back when I was a kid in theatres. I don't remember liking it much at the time (made me uncomfortable and queasy actually) and in fact, the only thing I really remembered from the film itself was the big red devil. Perhaps I wasn't sophisticated enough then to enjoy it properly so why not see it again as an adult and give it a second shake...My main opinion during and after the screening (of the director's cut) was that although the decors and the makeup of the creatures are great even by today's standards, that the movie dragged, mostly in the second half. It felt long and I even yawned a few times. I don't know if it's because the pace is wrong, the film lacks action or the story is not engrossing enough but I was bored too often. I also expect some kind of sense of wonder in fantasy films. It happened with the unicorns, although unfortunately their horns were wobbly at first breaking the illusion, and it did happen with the grand entrance of the devil (seen on the cover). It did not happen much other than that. I loved the devil played by Tim Curry in heavy costume and makeup making him unrecognizable. His deep operatic yet comforting voice (slightly modified) is perfect, his expressions are very good and his movements are quite believable. He's the best representation of a traditional devil I've ever seen. Although the main human actors are played earnestly and rather well by Mia Sara and a young Tom Cruise, I was mesmerized by the character of Honeythorn Gump, the apparent leader of the small fairy-folk. He looks like a child but his big expressive eyes, his often severe facial expressions and the way he moves are reminiscent of someone older, kind of appropriate for an elf having lived for a long time. The actor playing Gump was 19 years old which would explain some of his performance. I found him fascinating yet somewhat sinister. I didn't find the comic-relief goblins and gnomes particularly appealing or interesting. To be fair, they were buried under tons of makeup making them less expressive.I watched the director's cut on DVD and the normal shorter US version afterwards. I will not go in details on the differences here but those interested can check this link : http://www.figmentfly.com/legend/different4c.html . Neither version is perfect but I think I preferred the director's cut in part because of the classical music score (instead of Tangerine Dream's new age synthesizer remade soundtrack for North America). The relationship between the princess and Jack (Tom Cruise) is also more ambiguous, my favorite character other than Darkness, the elf (?) Gump, has more screen time, the appearance of Darkness is not spoiled right at the beginning making his first ""real"" entrance a lot more dramatic and the fun swamp ""sorceress"" is there longer. On the other hand, with the shorter US theatrical version, you are less likely to find your mind wandering or being bored In closing, Ridley Scott the director said he was proud of his film despite all its problems (main set burning, big commercial flop and critically panned at the time being a few) and that at least, he managed to get that kind of film (fantasy fairy-tale) out of his system. Not the most ringing endorsement if you ask me... Scott might be proud but I would not call Legend really good even today. it's passable but it pales in comparison to other fantasy films of the eighties (Willow, Princess Bride, Neverending Story (only the first one), Labyrinth, etc) that should be rented or purchased long before Legend. However, Legend has several redeeming features pushing it above the lower dregs of that genre. Legend was middle-of-the-pack for that era but suffered from expectations that were too high.Rating : 5 out of 10",Legend

Ridley Scott hired writer William Hjortsberg, being a fan of his work. Ridley Scott credit aside from direction was that he mostly wanted there to be a unicorn and for the villain to be named Darkness. Legend revolves around Jack who must stop Darkness, for darkness plans to kill the second unicorn so that he may come out of his dungeon. Princess Lily was shown the unicorns by Jack, she touched one and has unwittingly led the unicorn to its death due to her innocence. She is kidnapped with the second unicorn, now her friend Jack with the help of Gump and screwball must save the unicorn and her or the land may plunge into an eternal darkness. They shot this film in a 007 stage in pinewood studios so they could achieve the lighting for Scott's vision, the trees are mostly made out of plastoid Styrofoam and the set was extended with mirrors. The direction and production are what help make this movie give it that enchanting fairy-tale feel. Ridley even brought the fairy-tale genre back to its roots with this film in the beginning when we meet Jack and Lilly the lighting which he wanted shows the child-like innocence within most fairy-tales you see in Disney films but as the film progresses it shows off its dark and Grimm aesthetics. Assheton Gordon's (production designer) set also had real tress and birds, with the noise inside it made it so difficult to record the dialogue and so some of the lines had to be dubbed which can be off putting for some people but it didn't bother me because when it is quite noticeable in the scene in which Lily is crying her facial expression says it all. But it did not work in Tom's favor when he was with the wounded unicorn. Mia Sara and Tim Curry as Princess Lily and Darkness are my two favorite actors/characters in the film. At one point the stage caught fire and the 007 stage burnt down. Luckily it was rebuilt in 1985. The story is very simple and is full of action, adventure, horror, romance and suspense. The movie mostly focuses on Jack, Lily, and Darkness as you can imagine by my synopsis. There are four cuts to this film, this is the only I have or ever will see. Because it doesn't contain the tangerine dream musical score and Darkness is hidden throughout most of the movie making his reveal that much more of a surprise. Rob Bottin who worked on the Thing 1982 had the difficult task of visualizing all the creatures in the world of Legend. Ridley wanted the character of Darkness to be sexy but also half goat, Rob felt there hadn't been a definitive version of the devil on screen and he clearly succeed with his creation. this is my favorite of his work. If anything because of how intimidating Tim was behind all that makeup. The music of the film is quite lovely and creates a transcendent and child-like feel for the film. Jerry Goldsmith's that is, I did not hear the tangerine dream music. But if there is one piece of music from the theatrical cut of this film that I did listen to its Bryan Ferry's ""Is Your Love Strong Enough"". I saw it on the back of the cover under bonus features and was curious by the song title and Gave it a listen. I love that song, it may be, no it is my favorite love song. Legend in my eyes is a masterpiece, while I may agree it has weakness's the film is a deeply entrancing experience that make up for what I consider to be the ultimate fantasy film. I know for a fact that this is a film I will be re-visiting very often and I do recommend you give it a watch (both versions) but decide which version is your favorite.

92,shaun98,A big letdown,5,31 August 2002,"*possible spoiler*On a technical level, ""Legend"" is a visually stunning film. It boasts excellent production values, gorgeous cinematography, and seamless special effects. Sadly, it is also a failure of storytelling. Ridley Scott knows how to paint a pretty picture, that cannot be denied; it is simply impossible for him to make an ugly-looking movie. However, his grasp on plotting and characterizations is less certain. Prior to this unfortunate project, he already had ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" under his belt, so one would hope that his ability to make good science fiction would translate well to the fantasy genre. No such luck. Legend draws visual and thematic inspiration from classic Grimm Brothers tales and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" yet he fails to capture the awe and wonder of the best fantasy literature. It looks just right, but the pacing is slow, the plot is thin, and most of the characters are not well-defined. The conclusion is too perfunctory to be of much interest, and as a whole the film is cold and aloof.Most of the actors are lost in the movie. Even Tom Cruise's thousand-watt personality is overwhelmed by the setting and turgid pace. Mia Sara is perhaps the most visually appealing element of the film, but when you think about it, her role as the princess is rather thankless, especially when you consider that her ill-advised actions were partly responsible for everyone's problems in the first place. However, David Bennent manages to escape this fate, as the leader of a band of elfin. His character is one of the few that truly come to life. Likewise, Tim Curry is effective as the charismatic villain, who deserves more screen time. Much has been made of the edits forced upon the project by the studio, but even with a director's cut finally available, it is still clear that ""Legend"" should have been subjected to additional rewrites before being filmed. I have little doubt that from the start they put a great deal of effort into what it looked like, but not nearly enough into what it was about. Scott seems to have forgotten that you also need a heart and soul for this type of project, so that the viewer is emotionally invested in the characters and their plight. Otherwise, you're left with an uninspiring technical exercise, great to look at but hard to care about.

The Jerry Goldsmith score is wonderful, maybe one of his best work, altough I've listened to some of the Tangerine Dream score and must say it's not bad, either, it's just a different approach, and I think it's interesting to have two different soundtracks for the same movie.

97,mik-19,"""She is so sweet I could eat her brain""",7,1 May 2005,"I haven't seen the Director's Cut of Ridley Scott's generally despised fantasy movie, only the 89 minutes version that was originally released, which is the one discussed here.Mia Sara is Princess Lily who is the innocent cause for the killing of one of the only two surviving unicorns in the world, and her forest beau, Tom Cruise, sets out with an entourage of sprites, fairies and fireflies to find the Prince of Darkness, played by Tim Curry, retrieve the magic horn that he took from the unicorn and correct all wrongs. Since the maiming of the unicorn the world has frozen over, and perpetual darkness reigns. Will he save the day? Will light ever return?20 years ago they didn't need CGI to conjure up all sorts of wonders, blue-screen and state-of-the art photographic inventiveness did the trick. And just under the thin sugar-coating of the varied lenses used in Alex Thomson's gorgeous cinematography lurks a powerful, dark and harrowing adventure, one definitely not suited for children, if you ask me. More Brothers Grimm than Hans Christian Andersen. Just have a look at some of the lines, delivered so lustily by god-awful goblins and other monsters: ""She is so sweet I could eat her brain!"" is one, ""May be innocent, may be sweet, ain't half as nice as rotting meat"" another. And I love this one, articulated by cute young Lily: ""I hear a throat begging to be cut!"".But does it work as a work of art? That's a high order, I know, and maybe the Director's Cut will satisfy this ideal challenge. Still, the version I saw came a very long way towards that goal. Characters are cardboard ones, certainly, as pertains to the genre. 'Legend' has more style, more intelligence and more sardonic wit than 'Star Wars' which it resembles very much in themes and plot.The sets are amazing, and the over-all look of 'Legend' sublime. That is all very fine, no fantasy epic would be even half-baked without that. On top of it 'Legend' has abundant humor and slapstick, and the thrills are genuinely scary when watched today.The actors are not required to exactly delve into the intricacies of human existence, but Sara and Cruise (was he ever that young? his trademark toothy grin was already there!) are sweet and natural, and Curry larger-than-life and funny and naughty as the evil, evil Lord of Darkness.",Legend

Tom Cruise is his usual hunky, goofy self as Jack, the nominal hero, and Mia Sara (Whatever happened to her?) is ethereally lovely as Lily, the heroine. But it's the performances of Tim Curry as Dark Lord and the young David Bennent at Gump that dominate this film. Curry, in a role that easily exceeds his Dr. Frankenfurter for sheer bizarreness, is as scary, menacing a figure as has ever been seen on film as a thinly disguised version of the Devil. And Bennent, better here than he was in ""The Tin Drum"" is utterly beguiling as Honeythorn Gump, a Puckish character who's always hep for a new adventure and always willing to help out a friend. Annabelle Lanyon is a charmer, as well, as Oona, Gump's fairy girlfriend who secretly has a yen for Jack, and Billy Barty is his usual enjoyable self as Gump's assistant fairy, Brown Tom. Finally, was there ever a more utterly loathsome creature as Alice Playton's Blix, Curry's nefarious goblin assistant?Highly recommended, all around. See it",Legend

101,latsblaster,A legend that can be now and forever: One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen,7,13 June 2003,"(I have seen the European version) ""Legend"" has a very poor script which makes the plot thin.
I would recommend spectators to see the director's cut, I think that might include a bit more story and depth that the version I saw might miss.
Tom Cruise's acting in ""Legend"" is not as bad as some say. He makes a better performance here than in other trash-movies he made in the late 80's. Overall the acting in ""Legend"" is good, but maybe I am not convinced about Mia Sara's part Lili. Tim Curry ... at his peak, of course. ""Legend"" is the proof that one dimensional characters can be entertaining as long as the direction and acting is good. ""Legend"" has great Cinematography by Alex Thomson, good costumes and make up, superb set decoration and production design. The only problem is that Ridley Scott uses a bit to much close ups instead of using distance shots which is more common in fantasy-movies. But all the close ups creates a feeling of intense and suspense. And all this together makes ""Legend"" more beautiful than you can imagine. You can find many weak spots on ""Legend"", but you can also find much quality in it - visual quality, which I think is important for any movie.
If 'Legend' would have been done in the 90's, it would have been more famous, more popular and a movie that people remembered. It was made in a time when fantasy didn't have the status it has today (even if many fantasy-movies was made then). ""Legend"" might have been inspired by one of my favorite movies - ""The Dark Crystal"". It is not as good as ""The Dark Crystal"", but still good enough for any fantasy-lover.

102,Manthorpe,A childhood favorite.,6,13 November 2004,"For me, this film is some sort of a guilty pleasure as I first saw it at a young age while growing up and remember enjoying it immensely. Upon viewing it again very recently, while I realize it's not that great of a film, it's not necessarily a bad one. Also, given the extremely different material compared to his previous work, it is simply mind-boggling to think that the same director also created ""Alien"" and ""Bladerunner"".The film fails for being simply, how do I put it.....gay, particularly in the beginning. The romance scenes are way over the top to the point that it's hard to imagine Scott watching this film without feeling some form of embarrassment. During several moments during the beginning sequences, I thought an overly-eager elf of some kind would bust out of the woods, bend Tom Cruise over a log and mount him....much to his enjoyment. That's how gay the beginning is. The acting isn't necessarily terrible, the direction is simply off. More than needed to set the rest of the film up. As it moves further it gets better, especially the end which is why I like this film and don't bash it into oblivion.If there's one single redeeming quality for all of those who feel this movie is bad, they would have to admit that the Lord of Darkness played marvelously by Tim Curry is simply amazing. Quite bluntly, the very best personification of any devil or Satan ever put on film; the epitome of such. It's enough to give one chills. Marvelous costume and makeup job. However, without this, there's not much here other than a little kid movie with decent costumes and some impressive imagery. 6/10",Legend

You could still make an ""Excalibur"" or ""Dark Crystal"" or even a ""The Sword and The Sorceror"" and be taken seriously. Really. So a young and basically untested Tom Cruise got to work with ""Blade Runner"" Ridley Scott on a fantasy film that was his Magnum Opus. Tom, Tim and Mia Sara did a film you couldn't do today, didn't joke or parody it, and it was a morality tale for the ages. My only ""spoiler"" is that people reading this review will see it on a TV screen. Poor SOB's. I saw it on a 70MM screen, and you will NOT experience the same film I did. If you ever see it being shown on any size movie screen, get there. It's a one of a kind.

105,roystephen-81252,"Beautifully photographed fairy-tale, but the theatrical version is seriously botched",4,5 March 2016,"First of all, I must admit that I haven't seen the much longer director's cut with Jerry Goldsmith's original score, but I will definitely check that one out and perhaps come back to re-evaluate Legend. The director's cut of Blade Runner completely shifted my opinion about that movie, and I see a lot of potential here, as well. (Moreover, the extended cuts of both Kingdom of Heaven and Gladiator are also better than their respective theatrical versions, and having seen what he cut out of Prometheus, it is safe to say that it's always worth giving a chance to the outtakes and long versions of Ridley Scott's movies.)Legend is a gorgeously designed and photographed dark fairy-tale, but unfortunately the theatrical version gradually sinks into boredom and falls to pieces by the end. The beginning, however, is stunningly beautiful. Thirty years later, the visuals are still jaw-dropping and for that alone, the film is definitely worth a watch. No other fantasy film has such a dreamlike quality that carries the sense of fairy-tale magic.Ridley Scott's fourth feature film could have been his fourth classic in a row – or is it? It all depends on the additional 30 minutes I have yet to see.",Legend
106,H_Spengler,Love/Hate,6,11 January 2009,"I've got a real love/hate relationship with this movie. I never before in my life watched it until a few months ago. The first time I watched it (original theater version)it didn't interest me enough to prevent me from taking phone calls, doing other things, surfing IMDb, etc. Upon reading different readers reviews and the message boards on IMDb I decided that I wouldn't write my review until I had viewed the much acclaimed ""directors cut."" so now having watched both versions i'll post my review.I must say I prefer the Goldsmith score, Tangerine Dream isn't horrible, just hokey in most spots and that song at the end is horrific. The only time I preferred the Dream score was during the mushy parts. Otherwise, Goldsmith's score was more appropriate for the action and fantasy parts of it.I also prefer the director's cut..BUT there were certain parts of the theater version that were better than the directors cut. The opening of the theater version was better than the director's cut IMO. The entire scene spent with Darkness talking to his father is him in a chair with the creepy green eyes (theater) vs. unseen off-screen voice talking to a shot of the fireplace (director). (I can understand that perhaps Scott wanted to save his villain for a grand unveiling towards the end of the movie, but I still prefer the theatrical version.)There are also extra scenes and extended scenes in the directors, that fill in the story to make in more coherent, interesting and ""questy"" feeling. This is why I prefer the director's cut, it managed to hold my attention this time.There's plenty more than I wanted to see of Cruise squatting and crouching, and close ups of both Sara & Cruise with unibrows, but these are minor annoyances. The make up and effects are excellent (Goblins, elves, Darkness etc.) before movies started getting CGI'd to all hell. Tim Curry is without a doubt the best thing about this movie. As ""Darkness"". He's decadently evil & seductive. (And unrecognizable underneath all the makeup & prosthetics.) The only thing recognizable is his voice (and even then you sometimes have to really listen to hear it.) He's not in the movie nearly enough.I believe a IMDb poster recommended to ""watch both versions and make your own cut."" I'd have to generally agree.

I am still convinced that if not for Curry's role of the Lord of Darkness than this movie could have been nearly a total loss. Although I like the movie I never found it to be appealing enough to watch over and over again. Other Then Curry's underrated character role I think it can be forgettable. Plus the effects are a lot lamer than most films at the time. I use my iamginationa nd just get past that. But the movie itself just never seems to get anywhere and at times reminds me of a typical medievel movie. I am not sure. I gave it a decent 6 rating because I choose so many other movies over this one but it was good enough to watch every now and then and Curry plays a great role.

After several amazingly incoherent dialogue and action I had to bow out on a scene where some goofy creatures were speaking in accents so ridiculous that I knew there was no possible way I could take this film seriously. As such it marked only one of a handful of movies I stopped early. I'm not sure why, but I even watched ""Dune"" (Machlachlan, Lynch) and ""A.I."" to the end.

111,Herbest8,One of the greatest fantasies ever put on film,5,15 May 2009,"This fairly standard sword and sorcery tale stars Tom Cruise (who was just as boring before rising to super-stardom) as Jack a peasant boy who falls in love with the beautiful Princess Lily (wondefully played by Mia Sara). The crux of the story is that the Lord of the Darkness (Tim Curry) has captured one of the two magical unicorns that keep the sun shining and has plans to marry the Princess so he can rule the world. Along with a fairy, an elf and two dwarfs, Jack takes it upon himself to stop Darkness and restore order. As one might guess,the story is not only standard but also muddled and not particularly exciting but this is just a gravy complaint when one looks at the film more broadly. The make-up, production design and special effects are simply breath taking and Tim Curry delivers the best performance of his career (sorry Rocky Horror fans) as the Lord of Darkness. With the sole exception of Cruise, the entire cast which also includes Billy Barty, Robert Picardo and Alice Playton deliver some terrific performances.As an example of the film's beautiful make-up, I must admit I'm still shocked that Robert Picardo, AKA The Doctor from ""Star Trek"", is the one playing Meg Mucklebones. the same goes for Tim Curry who is flat out unrecognizable as Darkness.With all due respect to Jerry Goldsmith, I prefer the American score with Tangerine Dream and Bryan Ferry as their score and ending songs provides a rousing finale to this amazing film.

I guess Ridley Scott was trying to do a fairy tale for the MTV generation and for the most part he succeeded. The score by Tangerine Dream is beautiful and enchanting, it gives the movie a timeless feeling like that of a fairy tale. The set design is top-notch I especially love the set for Darkness' lair it's very gothic and opulent. The make-up effects by Rob Bottin are great, I especially like the makeup design for Meg Mucklesbone and Darkness. The actors are all good even though they are essentially playing archetypes. Tom Cruise is good as the plucky hero and of course the ever reliable Tim Curry is great as Darkness the villain of the piece. He gives a lot of humanity to what is essentially a cartoon villain. Mia Sara is great as Lilly the alluring princess of the piece. Her seduction scene where she succumbs to the darkness is probably the best scene of the movie.

114,TruPretender,"LEGEND: Gothic, Grim, Beautiful, Enchanting, Magical, Dreamy, Fantastic, and ultimately Constant.",10,22 January 2006,"Ridley Scotts' fallen masterpiece ""Legend"" has, in it's own rite, become one of the most infamous, if not fascinating, legacies in Hollywood. In 1984, Ridley Scott, director of the famed sci-fi ""Alien"", set out to tell a defining fairy tale. Once he was joined by writer William Hjortsberg, the duo started off on a creative journey to conjure what would become the beloved film ""Legend"". The film was further more given the appropriate elements for the general fairy tale. The Princess, the Hero, the Villain, the Goblins, the Fairies, and the other magical characters and creatures such as the Unicorns and Honeythorn Gump. Seeing as the film is intended to be a definitive fairy tale, this would also mean tracing the modern genre back to its' roots, Grim style. Indeed, the completed product was pure in it's woven fables. Just as it is tender, and bright, is it also dark, surreal, nightmarish, and ultimately entrancing. More of the film deals with the overshadow of darkness in the magical land. A proper way to show the sudden switch from light and happy, to dark and fearsome indeed.In the story, we have the world, happy, beautiful, completely compelling in its' own nature. The dark truth lies within its' own reality. Darkness once ruled the world, but has since retreated into the lower levels of the earth, to groan and complain of times in a better existence. The world is happy, because the Unicorn, a very dear, and sacred animal, rules the land. These gorgeous creatures know only love and laughter, and thusly, protect the world from evil. They are attracted to one element in man kind, innocence. Princes Lily is pure at heart, as well as mind and spirit. Her soul friend, Jack, leads her to the creatures, as a gesture of love and affection. Quite unfortunately, however, the Lord Darkness has sent his own army after the creatures too. Once both sides are at the right place, and the wrong time, the Unicorns are harmed, and the earth, in danger. Thus begins a journey full of action, adventure, and suspense.Tom Cruise has only performed well in this one film, for me anyway. He is actually quite affective, and believable as the hero Jack. He shows both strength and bravery, to contrast with confusion and fear of the unknown. Very plausible indeed. Mia Sara is so gorgeous, naive, and pure as the Princess. Her characteristics consist of a blind ambition, love stricken playfulness, and of course, Innocence. Never, has this genre seen such a perfect portrayal. Now, Tim Curry turns in one hell of a performance. Thanks to modern film-making, Curry is a frightening, disgusting, and yet sexual portrayal of ultimate Darkness. The three stars are all mixed together in a real Fairy Tale, with a message at the end. (note, this message is only seen in the 2002 restored Directors Cut).I do not feel the need to bring up the controversy that ensued the principal photography, as it is well known by fans and film buffs of all kind. What I can say, is that Ridley Scott was certainly determined to give us the product of his imagination. That said, he gave us a real fantasy. he has given us a real story of magic,, love, hate,adventure, and all kinds of elements that create what a film like this should be. One thing to truly be mentioned, however, is the late Jerry Goldsmith. This master at film composition of the musical persuasion, gave us his ultimate best, and that was being generous and forgetting about getting stabbed in the back during the processing of ""Alien"". Again, the great musician was tricked, and his beautiful score was thrown out the window from US versions, leaving the film to sugary and sappy. Even worse, important scenes were cut, leaving much of the film uneven and seemingly rushed. Sad enough, this kind of treatment happened a year earlier with 1984's ""Supergirl"". Fortunately, however, we were given the true version of the film in mid 2002, and rightly so. The film has since then, been seen, and loved by fans as myself, who loved it way back when....as well as now.The best I can say, is that this movie has a full blown mastermind to it, and the producers and creators etc finally gave the film justice. Same happened with ""Supergirl"" in 2000. Bottom line, this film is brilliant, and touching, and an ever- glorious masterpiece!",Legend

117,mhajs,Ridley Scott: one of my favorite directors. Legend: one of his worst movies.,5,24 November 2005,"** out of ****It's because of the fact that Legend is so weird, weird to a point of even being misunderstood (my case, for example), that makes this movie, one of the least spotted to gather the family and watch a true spectacle. And that is even weirder to have as a conclusion to it, since the movie is directed by Ridley Scott, director of classics such as Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator. Unfortunately, after the success of Alien and Blade Runner, it wasn't this time that Scott proved himself once again author of another masterpiece. This fantasy movie can get a little confusing, since we don't really know how to absorb it.The cast includes actors such as Tim Curry, Tom Cruise and Mia Sara, mainly. There are credits also for David Bennent, who plays Gump, the leader of the forest group which gathers the protectors of the unicorns.The movie tells the tale of a prince of darkness, lord of evil, who cannot live under the effects of the sunshine of the dawn. He commands his goblin slaves to destroy the unicorns living in the forest, beings that contain so much power, that ""one could rule the universe with it"".We meet the main characters, Jack (Tom Cruise) and Lili (Mia Sara), he, a young warrior, who there's not much to tell, since the movie can't explore the main character in a significant way, she, the princess of the kingdom which rules the region, visits the houses of the forest, where she meets her friends, poor residents of the place, who inspire sympathy for her, as she is sweet and of good heart. These are the actors who almost don't have a job in here. Sometimes, seems like guilt of those bad elaborated productions of the 80's. Some actors play so insignificant roles that we even think we're staring at mannequins. That's well shown, in the scene where Lili enters the room and finds a man on a sleep. No, he doesn't have any lines on the movie, only snoring.Legend could be a much more interesting movie, if we could see beyond what we actually can, a horizon with borders not so distant, limited by sets that almost look like theater stages like forests without skies, the inside of caves and castles and swamps with such concentrated fog that even the actors might have had difficulties walking through it. We could have seen the princess' castle, the dining room with the king and queen, we could learn more about the characters. That's what the movie, mainly, lacked.On to some other characters. Blix, one of the lord of evil's goblins, captures one of the unicorns, one of them falls victim of his own horn's cut. It is part of a sacrifice done by the lord of darkness in order to eliminate light once and for all so that he can become immortal. The trailer almost convinces. Looks like we're dealing with a movie that will present us a truly living hell, sinister and dark as the spaceship Nostromo or as the constantly nocturne city of 2019's Los Angeles. But no. In the beginning of the movie, there are thousands of musical scenes, practically, all of them, uneven. The unicorns are captured and Jack and friends must go to the lord of evil's castle, find a way to destroy him, rescue the princess and save the unicorns. But almost nothing of what happens on screen is acceptable. Jack finds a gear composed of a sword and an armor in the middle of nowhere. Thank god if a had that same luck and have found a bullet-proof vest in the middle of a gunfighting.When Lili meets the prince for the first time, she doesn't convince, making it clear that her character can't control her emotions, once she smiles, once she cries, a completely artificial performance. Brown Tom and Screwball are other two characters who are so clumsy, that have a horrible synchronization between them. Oona is a fairy who doesn't know if she must helps or if she bothers. In a scene where our heroes get trapped in a dungeon cell, she refuses to set them free just because of a kiss that Cruise denied giving her. Two seconds later, she is opening the doors. The flaws go on forever.Credits go only to make-up and art direction/set decorations categories, which are perfect as always.

In fact, it's pretty awful.Tom Cruise plays Jack, a forest dweller who takes his girlfriend, a princess, to see unicorns. She touches a unicorn, taints it, and suddenly the world is spiraling out of control at the Lord of Darkness (Tim Currey) attempts to kill the last unicorn and never have the sun rise again.All the Ridley Scott trademarks are here and, if I can commend the movie on anything, it's the cinematography. But it's otherwise a very lackluster movie as far as being pretentious goes. Seriously, people love this movie for being so mysterious but the bright white unicorns opposing the devils is pretty solid, easy to understand symbolism. The light and dark thing is also pretty simple. There's none of the origami or anything that made Blade Runner a thinking person's movie, it's just an example of a dumb fantasy movie (which the 80's produced quite a few of).On top of the failed attempt at pretentiousness is the unmemorable characters, the boring performances, and, to top it all off, the awful action sequences. Tom Cruise obviously does no stunt work here as the action scenes be sure to cut Jack's face from the frame.Legend is better than Scott's G.I Jane but it's not at all a good movie. Some like to say it's adult fantasy but I could see a child watching this and getting the gist of it. Save the forest, light and dark coexist, yin yang, all that.Legend sucks.",Legend
119,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,Storybook nightmare that would make the Brother's Grimm proud,8,28 August 2000,"Legend is probably one of the most visually interesting films I've ever seen. It's a fairy tale, filled with beautiful and horrible images and it left me breathless. Funny, I've never really been a fan of fairy tales, in cinema or in story books as a child, but give it to Ridley Scott to direct and you have quite an experience. I've been a fan of his for a while now, and it's good to see him back on top with last summers hit Gladiator. RIDLEY RULES! Okay, I'll try to refrain from any more fits of orgasmic glee about Scott, back to the film at hand. Lotta eye candy to be seen. Opening with the forest full of flower petals (?). Goblins wadding through snow drifts up to their necks. But most of all, the castle of Darkness. I had forgotten how gruesome the devils' kitchen actually was. Was this movie originally intended for children? It seems a little unlikely, though I know both children and adults can enjoy it. I liked it as a kid, and if anything I probably enjoy it more as an adult.Cruise and Sara both do well enough in their roles. This is almost the forgotten' Tom Cruise movie. But the star of this show is Darkness, no ifs', ands' or buts' about it, baby! Is that really Tim Curry under all of that make-up and prosthetics? Can't be! Did he work out for this role? One of the most stunningly beautiful villains in the history of film, the work that must have gone into his costume alone... it boggles the mind. Those horns are just incredible. Darkness is the most visually interesting cinematic interpretation of the devil that I've seen (though if he's the devil, who is his father' that he is seen speaking to?). I'm torn as to whether the humpback whales mating' sounds that play when we see the unicorns is neat or annoying (I'm leaning towards annoying). I've also heard that they replaced the original musical score with something more child-friendly', which is disappointing. But this works mainly as a visual feast. This one deserves an 8/10 stars, so see it if you haven't already. G'night!",Legend
120,kristoffe-brodeur,A beautiful tale of innocence,10,13 November 2020,"When you want to be innocent and then maybe a bit of a devil, this super fantasy is right out of a comic book fairy tale. The music is wonderful in the rock or classical version of the film. The acting is super fun and beautifully character like, and the shots are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen.Tim curry is the devil's son, and what a crazy amazing fx costume and voice he has in this. Tom and Mia do really wonderfully falling in love with each other and overcoming trust. The monsters throughout this are so wonderful and charismatic, it's like a dark version of Labyrinth. And if you want to know something really cool, the forest was built in a giant sound stage slash hanger. Wow, right?Enjoy it, I can't imagine fantasy lovers or dreamers would be anything less than thrilled with Legend. It's beautiful, even if for those wonderful unicorns in the river bathed in woodland light and shadow as well.",Legend
121,MC1-Bjornson,Mediocre Film That Looks Great . . .,6,23 May 2007,"'Legend', The Director's Cut (1985/2002), Unrated, One Hour & 54 Minutes --and-- U.S. Theatrical Version (1986), Rated ""PG"" by the MPAA, One Hour & 30 Minutes. Content includes: Mild Adult Language, Some Mild Sexual Innuendos, Violence and Some Disturbing Imagery.My Take ** (Out of ****) or 6/10 on the IMDb Scale.'Legend' is triumph of art direction, make-up, costume and set design. It's a great movie to look at, but not much else. That goes for both versions of the picture, The Director's Cut or the U.S. Theatrical Version.'Legend' wants to be a mythical fairy tale. It tells of Darkness (Tim Curry), a demonic overlord, who has been banished from the world to his dark kingdom to reign in exile. The world is a beautiful place of perpetual springtime, complete with sunshine, tweeting birds, pollen in the air and tree blossoms in abundance. The world is kept pure and protected by two unicorns who both harbor goodness, truth and light.However, Darkness is plotting his return to the world for a hostile takeover. If his lackeys can take out the two unicorns, then Darkness will once again rise to dominate the world. This is not very appealing to Jack (Tom Cruise), a young man who lives in a storybook forest. Jack shares a romance of innocence with the lovely maiden Lily (Mia Sara). When Darkness makes his move for world domination, the world is plunged into a chaotic dark winter. Darkness kidnaps Lily to corrupt her and make her his dark bride. It's up to Jack and his motley crew of fairy friends to put the kabash on Darkness before all hope is lost . . .Sounds like the groundwork for a fun picture, doesn't it? Unfortunately, that's not the case. For as visually arousing as the film is, it's highly underdeveloped. 'Legend' is all style, with no substance. That's too bad. Everything looks great and the adventure could have been a really great one too.One problem with 'Legend' is you don't care about anyone or anything in it. There's nothing interesting, funny, witty or imaginative about any of the characters, except for maybe Darkness. We've all seen this kind of story before: Evil is out to vanquish good, the young lad becomes a hero to save the girl and set the wrong things right. It's a timeless story. No doubt, we'll keep seeing it time and time again. When it's done right, we love it. A good example would be the original 'Star Wars' (1977). But 'Legend' doesn't do it right. We're not gripped in the slightest.Tom Cruise as Jack spends a great deal of the picture looking scared or bewildered. Sara Mia, better known as Matthew Broderick's girlfriend in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' (1986), is an adequate damsel in distress. Naive, but nice. The scene stealer is Tim Curry as Darkness. He looks great! He is layered in make-up and paint, but he truly looks like the devil, complete with gigantic horns, goat ears, red skin, yellow eyes, a Charles Atlas figure and goat legs. Oddly enough, Curry's performance shines though the latex making Darkness convincing as a sinister presence.As indicated, the rest of the characters are fairly one dimensional clichés from other (& better) fantasy tales. They're only here as plot devices, completely devoid of any other purpose, to get you through the movie from Point 'A' to Point 'B'. You don't care for them or empathize with them in any way or about their plight. To make a movie like this work, you should at least care about the outcome of it's characters. If you don't, then what's the point of watching it in the first place? The Director's Cut is more whimsical. It's about 24 minutes longer and has extended dialog with longer scenes. Most notably, this version firmly establishes the lovely Lily as a princess, while the American version is decidedly ambiguous about her background. Also notable is Lily's singing in the forest and to the unicorns. This is more storybook like and I suppose this behavior is to be expected of maidens.The Director's Cut boasts a lyrical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's beautifully done and serves the storybook aspect of 'Legend' very well.The U.S. version is scored by the rock group Tangerine Dream. What I liked about this score is that it's a departure from what is traditionally heard in this kind of picture. I thought this score was a fresh approach to the 'fairy-tale'/'storybook' genre.Director Ridley Scott has described his director's version of 'Legend' as being the more sophisticated of the two versions. In some ways he's right. Then again, both versions of the picture are rather muddled and lack coherence or any real direction. Both pictures feel choppy, unrealized and cobbled together from other fantasies minus the spark that makes the good ones work in the first place.Does 'Legend' have a saving grace? It's a visual roller-coaster. It's great to look at. It reminds me of fantasy paintings that have come to life. Too bad that the life we see in the movie is lifeless. If you can get around that fact, then either version of 'Legend' at it's best will be excellent eye candy with terrific cinema-photography and great music, whether it's Goldsmith or Tangerine Dream as the music provider. In my opinion, The Director's Cut and the U.S. Theatrical Version are on they same par in terms of quality. One is not better then the other. 'Legend' isn't that good to begin with. To be fair, it's not bad either. If it wasn't for the film's visual style, there would really be no reason to even consider watching this picture. 'Legend' is a missed opportunity that left me wanting more from it then what I was given . . .",Legend

123,EyeoftheBeholder1,"Beautiful visuals, but the script lacked the sense of true danger!",6,19 February 2010,"This film can be considered a tragedy in the sense that it's truly one of Ridley Scott's most beautiful films, and I have seen all of them. The costumes and set design were amazing as well. However, with the amazing visuals comes a script that feels almost under developed. I feel like there was never a sense of true impending doom which the characters would be facing. I can't put my finger upon it, but something was terribly off. And that is such a shame, because with the proper script, this film could be a true legend instead of a cult classic.I think I spotted an error as well in the film. The elf people were shown waving towards the camera, with 2 unicorns beside them. However, one was killed, the other survived. Didn't the prince of darkness say the surviving one was the last of it's kind? I'm sure he said that. And if he did say that, why are 2 being shown during the credits? I'm also getting the feeling the writers and Mr. Scott, wanted to hint that the events of the film could have been a dream all in the mind of the princess. Anyone else get that? P.S. The distributors really need to remaster this film for a blu ray release. I just watched the standard DVD on my hi def TV, and this disc just doesn't cut it anymore.",Legend
124,shawny11_2001,"A Flawed, Beautiful Masterpiece",7,15 July 2003,"At least in the Director's Cut with Jerry Goldsmith's original score. That version of the film is by far the ultimate and most elegant experience.
The reason it's flawed is that it could never be perfect, no matter what could be tweaked. It just doesn't feel like the grand masterpiece it should've been, and I know of no way to give this film that feel.
Ridley Scott is a true genius filmmaker. He incorporates so many experiences and questions and dilemmas that the common man and woman go through when they age. Jack and Lily's adventure is the personification of those childhood experiences that turned boys into men and girls into women.
Tim Curry...the best one dimensional character in cinematic history. He is an absolute joy to watch and listen to in this film. His voice is chilling, his image is nightmarish, and he is just amazing to see.
This has always been one of my favorite movies. But now that I've seen the DC on DVD, it has cemented its place in my list. 8.5 out of 10 (Mainly because I feel flaws, but really can't explain them well)",Legend

Here you have a movie made like 15 years ago and it was better than the top of the line version they put out now. This is the reason CGI graphics are stupid. The make-up and costumes in Legend are flawless. You can see shadow, sweat, texture, and a lot of effort put forth. If George Lucas was smart he'd hire this sfx team for his next project. Um, the story is very simple like a fairy tale but this is a children's movie anyway. Hopefully, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings will be more in the style of Legend and less Phantom Menace.",Legend

But I would buy this film if I saw it at a car-boot sale, for one reason.  The character Darkness.  Played by Tim Curry, he is the finest example of make-up transformation I think I've ever witnessed.  He looks like he's wandered out of Hell and straight onto the set.  Those reptile eyes, over-sized horns, hairy arms and legs, cloven feet, blood-red skin.  Run in fear, Tim Curry is here!  Otherwise, this is tosh.",Legend
127,bjoernidler,So beautiful!,8,1 March 2019,"This is not a children's film. If you see it as a children's film 'Legend' fails. It's too dark, strangely paced and not as talky as most kiddie flicks today.See it as a beautifully shot fantasy, full of stunning imagery, great costumes, archetypical metaphorical characters. Then it delivers and stands the test of time. I just saw it on bluray and it looks amazing. Ridley Scott's style is in full bloom. Here, really every frame is a painting.The story is really straightforward and simple. I want go into detail. It's basically your typical 'hero rescues princess from the bad guy's lair' story. What some people don't seem to understand is that this simplicity is intentional. The viewer is part of a fight, metaphorical and literal. It is the fight for innocence (impersonated by the beautiful Mia Sara) and how easy it is to corrupt innocence. This is what Scott is telling us in my opinion.It's a valuable point if you take a look at the world we live in nowadays. I work with children every day and I can't help but notice that even 10-12 year old kids have lost part of their sense of wonder, childish joy, curiosity... in a word, their innocence. This film shows that it's the easy thing to lose and the hard thing to maintain it.
Scott's dreamlike visuals appeal to our sense of wonder and ask us to just sit back, enjoy it and not to worry too much about storytelling, twists and turns or even realistic characters.But even if you leave all that aside, you can enjoy 'Legend' as one of the most beautifully shot films you will ever see.",Legend
128,edwardjamessmith,A great film in its right.,10,29 January 2008,"""Legend"" (1985) has to be one of the greatest fantasy films I've ever seen. It's better than ""Willow"" (1988) which I didn't really like that much. Ridley Scott's talent is just mind-blowing. He knows how to make a film from scratch. After seeing Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down and finally Legend, I've just seen how great this guy is with his vision and style of film-making. When I first heard of the film, I didn't even know Tom Cruise was in it. The score composed by Tangerine Dream fits the film perfectly and helps tell the story. Ridley Scott's brother, Tony Scott has also made great films: TOP GUN, Beverly Hills Cop II and True Romance. The make-up effects are brilliant for the time. Tim Curry's reincarnation of Satan is quite disturbing and he plays a brilliant performance which is unforgettable. ""Legend"" is a film that you can't miss out on so if you see it anywhere on DVD, buy it and you won't regret it.",Legend
129,juubei-2,Classic fairytale without the need for cg effects? Is this legal?,9,8 August 2006,"This was one of the first fantasy films I ever saw growing up and it had a lasting impression on me for many reasons, least of all the visuals, which are (like all of Scott's films) well-crafted and almost illustrative in their design. What really stuck out was the mythic quality of it all, and even at a young age the undeniably sexual overtones in the exchanges between the Lord of Darkness and Lily. I think people don't give kids enough credit but they do pick up on these things. I remember being taken aback when Lily's character dons the rather revealing dress late in the film and being shocked at her general demeanor afterwards; how her personality seems to change. All seemed right in the world when Jack and Lily return to their platonic relationship at film's end! Having viewed the director's cut recently I've found my own perspective has changed dramatically with time but I still like this movie for much the same reasons. A lot of the intensity I felt seeing it back then must've been due to my age, and feeling one with the character of Jack -- something I can sadly no longer do. The fight scenes play out to me rather comically now but back then they were frightening. Its a testament to Scott's direction that this film wasn't too violent for children, while really walking the line of what is acceptable.The Lord of Darkness make-up is simply outstanding and has only recently been topped with the likes of Hellboy. Once I was old enough to understand it was in fact an actor in a suit I was blown away to learn its actually Tim Curry underneath all that. There's no shortage of wonder on display here, but I think his was just the perfect idealization of evil, or Satan, EVER put to film.Overall the director's cut leans a little towards the over-long side, and while I haven't heard the tangerine dream score in years I'm sure it suits this '80s fantasy better than a stuffy orchestral score. But as Scott says in the commentary, it is an operatic film and that is how I see it now; almost more like a ballet or a play than a historical fiction like Lord of the Rings. Thank god I was in good hands, or I may have been turned off of fantasy forever! This is one to be passed down, and I look forward to seeing it light up the eyes of my future children.",Legend
130,lone-wolf-007,Phenomenal,10,21 December 2008,"This movie came out over twenty years ago and there still has been nothing like it since. The look of the movie is gorgeous. Every detail seems to have been addressed. The forest looks alive and full of wonder whereas Darkness's abode looks dark and dangerous (yet mesmerizing). The movie also deals with several themes such as temptation and love. It also has the usual theme of good verses evil but it is handled with expert care. The acting is very good too. Tim Curry is fantastic as Darkness. He delivers his lines perfectly. It is a wonderful performance that makes that character stand the test of time. Now Tom Cruise as Jack and Mia Sarah as Lily are a little more straightforward but they fit in the overall context of the story.Now the two different versions are different. The U.S. version is superior in my opinion. The tangerine dream score fits the movie better. It gives it a dream like quality, almost haunting. Whereas the longer director's cut has a Jerry Goldsmith score which in my opinion is not as good (especially when you hear the tangerine dream's score). The U.S. version is also shorter (about 90 min.) but it seems to work. The director's cut runs almost 2 hours and there are places where it drags and has singing and an ending that is not really satisfying when you consider all the characters have been through. There are a few scenes from the director's cut that should have stayed in the U.S. version (especially the scene with the swamp witch Meg) but it does not detour you from the overall viewing experience.My score is for the U.S. version alone. It is a fantastic movie. Yes there are a few flaws and character development is not as strong with some characters but all in all it is a great movie. I would love to see a sequel or a reboot of this. A PG-13 rating would not hurt either. I am surprised no one has even thought of doing it (especially with the success of Lord of The Rings). There is a audience for good fantasy films if done right. This movie is a good place to start especially since it has a heart to its story that a lot of films seem to lack.",Legend

I endured it though and was no happier at the end than when I heard Jack(Tom Cruise) didn't use weapons. Dumb fairy flicking, fawn frolicking figment of some losers imagination. The effects of blowing pocket lint, obvious masks and spaceball-esque costumes ruined any hopes for production value stars. The plot was same old good vs. evil gotta rescue damsel in distress. The films only star came from the makeup. Tim Curry was buried deep beneath a frightening mask of one of Satan's avatars. Well done and haunting. Very believeable.

133,Svperstar,"Good fantasy movie, but whats the big deal about the directors cut.....(very very minor spoilers)",8,24 December 2002,"After seeing LOTR2 I was in the mood to see another fantasy movie, I remember reading years ago that the studio that green lighted Legend made Ridley Scott cut it to peices including the soundtrack to make it have a wider appeal in theaters. I liked Legend a lot as a kid so I picked up the special edition dvd.The original score does fit the movie better, MUCH better. Thats for sure, but as for the actual content of the movie......um whats really different? The pacing is slightly slower in the directors cut which I liked but its not different enough to feel like you are seeing another ""side"" to the movie or to give you a much altered perspective on things, it certainly wasn't ""chopped to peices"" for the theaters as I had read, color me disappointed. From 1-10 I think the DC deserves a maximum .5 higher score maximum rating over the theater version.That said there were some changes in the DC, one of them I liked very much even if it was small.Very Minor Spoilers Follow.
Anyway, in the theater version the two main characters make out while laying down in the very beginning,in the DC they don't, Princess Lily just kisses Jack on the head. I guess you could say that makes them more ""innocent"" in the DC but I don't think its that big of a deal.There is an evil chair with eyes in the DC that talks to Darkness and watches Lily later on in the movie, Lily is asked to sit in the chair and talk to Darkness and she refuses, again, its not a big deal and doesn't really effect the movie.The one thing I liked most in the DC was when Lily touches the unicorn in the beginning, the scene was longer and more suspenseful.Also Lily seems to be slightly less innocent in dialog then Jack, I don't remember exact quotes but you get that feeling from what she says.
End Spoilers.
Visually this movie is beautiful, 2nd to only LOTR as far as fantasy goes, many frames from this movie would make a great picture for a computer desktop, great looking DVD.It also hads interesting Directors Commentary.If you want to see a good family safe fantasy flick then pick this up but if like me you just wanted to see the Directors Cut you will be let down.",Legend

The make-up for Darkness was greatly designed by Rob Bottin (if Chris Walas' astonishing makeup for The Fly wasn't unveiled that year, I would have totally wanted this to win the Makeup Oscar) and the score used when he steps out of the mirror to meet/seduce Princess Lily (Mia Sara) is well done and reminiscent of Vangelis.

Jack gains help from characters like Gump, Blix, Screwball, Brown Tom and Oona. They team up and try to save the one last unicorn from which the Lord of Darkness will rule the universe if he obtains it. Let me start by saying, I only watched it because of Ridley Scott. He's a great director and he does very well in this too. That's the only reason. Not because the premise intrigued me, or because of any actors, nothing. Just because of Ridley. And I must say, I actually kind of enjoyed it. It's short, Tom Cruise and the rest are decent in it, it looked really well for the time and it was well directed. Granted, there was a lot of stupid things in it but I didn't mind them because, after all, it is a PG film and it was made in 80's. If you're looking to watch every Ridley film, you might enjoy watching this. It's not for everyone and so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're like me.

136,pmoney13,Lavish but uninvolving,4,11 July 2001,"Legend is fun to look at but a chore to sit through. I wonder if I watch it again with the sound muted I might like it better. The visuals in the film are stunning. Ridley Scott has always been a director who focuses on dazzling imagery, and this is no exception. The way he paints the forests around Mia Sara and the unicorns is sensational, and we soon wish we were there, prancing along in the trees and rivers. Alas, there is one thing that ruins it, and that is the story. The story is a clunky, disjointed mess that makes us turn away just when we are getting interested. It involves a young kid who must rescue his lover and a unicorn horn from the demon Darkness, or else light will be obliterated forever. This is a good setup, but unfortunately the movie goes nowhere, and provides us with so many uninteresting characters that we stop caring about anything. Tom Cruise's little friends, especially the little boy/pixie thing are the worst things in the film, and we root for them to come to harm somehow.
Tim Curry has the best role in the film as Darkness. He makes the most out of a thankless role, where he is stuck under pounds of makeup and is barely recognizable. Curry is sinister and charming at the same time, and you kind of like the guy even though he is kinda evil. Which brings up another point. It's always a bad sign in a movie when the villains are more appealing than the heroes. Shouldn't we be rooting for the good guys? Why do they give us pixies that we hate so much, then make the villain a badass?If this film had had a better story it could have been great. I'd watch it again just to see the brilliant imagery. Ridley Scott made Blade Runner, a film in which the visuals were more prominent than the story. But what made that film great was that, even though the story was secondary, it was still interesting and it still supported the film. In Legend the story sucks, so the visuals are all alone.",Legend

Boring, interminable, and giving no sense of what the rules are in this magical universe. I think I only saw it on first release so I don't quite know what changes were made, but I believe this one was longer.Odd character casting with Tom Cruise as Jack, who spends 90% of the movie in a hunkered-down position (I suppose to put him on a better level with the little people he was working with). Not so bad per se, but he's wearing cutoff oilskins and what amounts to a Speedo. The movie has its serious theme, then suddenly cuts to Rita Repulsa's minions from Mighty Morphing Power Rangers.On the plus side, it has simply the best Devil figure in any movie yet. And David Bennent, who played Gump (the elf who lives in the Forrest) was mesmerizing. Considering his age, it was fascinating to see what he could convey with a simple look. (Especially compared to Tom Cruise's blandness). I would have liked to heard his original voice, though.Interesting also that you had a woman playing a male character (Blix, the Herve Villachaise-looking goblin) and a man playing a female (Robert Picardo, aka Star Trek Voyager's Doctor, as the swamp witch).",Legend
144,docstrange,"There really should be two different ""Legend"" movies listed.",10,25 December 2006,"There's the original version, released in 1986 and on videotape, and the 2002 Director's Cut, available on DVD. The latter version is one of my all-time favorite movies. It compares quite favorably with Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" and is a modern classic.The theatrical release of 1986, shamefully butchered (chopped up and badly re-edited) by the mindless suits at Warner, and with its original Jerry Goldsmith score replaced by the rather trite Tangerine Dream soundtrack, is the version most people have seen. It was released on videotape as a children's movie. What it is, and was intended to be, is a fairy tale for adults. In fact, it's too intense for really young children.It's hard to say that the '86 version deserves any more than the ""6"" it's rated at on its IMDb main page. It is a disappointment, primarily because it's now impossible to watch without think how much better it could be. The feeling and tone of the film were ruined by its treatment.The Ridley Scott Director's Cut, released in 2002, is a completely different movie. If you haven't seen this version, you haven't seen the movie. It deserves a score of 9 or 10. It doesn't look like a movie made 20 years ago. Scenes which are vital to the tone of the film and the meaning of the story have been restored. The sumptuous original soundtrack, recorded with a full orchestra, has also been restored, and this adds more to the film than can be put into words. About the performances: A very young Tom Cruise is excellent as the hero. Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness is awesome; his costume and voice alone are worth the cost of renting or buying the DVD. Mia Sara is absolutely stunning as Lily. She actually plays two different versions of her character, both wonderfully. This was her first role, a risk for Scott on such a big budget film, and she turned in the performance of her career. She's never been better, or looked more beautiful, than in this movie. The elves and fairies, both good and evil, are incredibly real-looking and believable. The costumes are perfect, and the sets are breathtaking, literally. One of the largest indoor sets ever constructed - a huge fantasy forest - was built for this movie.If you haven't seen this version, rent it.

I urge them to do so. I also urge fantasy fans who haven't seen this film to check it out. The director's cut is the superior version, containing as it does more character development and some smarter editing choices, but the theatrical version is not without its merits, containing a charming Tangerine Dream score that is fine on its own terms, but arguably dates the film.The visuals in this film are spectacular. Everything from the set design to the makeup effects vividly evoke a world quite unlike our own. The story involves a forest boy who falls in love with a princess, unicorns, and a villain who knows that good and evil are inextricably linked. Here and there, the pacing flags. Some parts of it are a bit dreary. Tom Cruise (as the forest boy) brings a youthful energy to his performance that his later work lacked, and Mia Sara (as the princess) is suitably naive, yet tough and clever at the same time. Tim Curry, as he often does, steals the show as Darkness, bringing a physicality and richness to a character that easily could have become one-note.Watch this film if you want to experience something challenging and unexpected. I didn't much like it when I watched (most of) it as a child, yet I revisited it as an adult and liked it a lot more. To me, this says that the film is far smarter than your average fairy tale.

It's supposedly ""dark,"" ""deep,"" with a ""message,"" ""a fairy tale for adults."" Those epithets all describe Pan's Labyrinth, a fantastic movie. But this movie, Legend? None of those apply here. It's a silly, slapstick, goofy movie, and ultimately boring.Tom Cruise, normally a fine actor, is unbearably wooden in his role. The girl who plays Lily veers from time to time into a Southern accent from her quasi-British ""princess"" accent. The film's silly, ham-handed, slapstick ""battle"" scenes belie its supposedly serious nature. Lily's inane songs are intelligence-insulting. The long, tedious scenes with the unicorns are not beautiful, just long and tedious. The dialogue is eye-rollingly cheesy.Now, I do appreciate good fantasy. I loved the Lord of the Rings films, Bakshi's Wizard, the aforementioned Pan's Labyrinth... But this film, Legend, is appallingly trite and goofy. Heck, even Dark Crystal compares favorably. I can only suppose that those who laud this film to the skies are looking at it through the eyes of nostalgia; I, having not seen it until now, in my late 30s, am unmoved.

156,GoldenEye,A Wasted Effort,2,7 June 2002,"I should first mention that I had not even heard of this film until a few months ago, from an ad proclaiming the ""Ultimate Edition DVD"" release. Instead of renting that version, I opted for the original instead, and I must certainly say that no director's cut or ANYTHING else could save this movie.Where to start....well first let me say that I saw Ridley Scott's name attached to this and I was hoping for some stylish fantasy action. Wrong. There are only a handful of shots in Legend that even hint of Scott's involvement with the movie. The film's pace seemed too awkward and the overall atmosphere of the film just seemed non-existent.The acting was also something of a failure. Tom Cruise is WAY too poofy and boyish in a role that should require a bold and fearless knight. Mia Sara's character succeeds only at looking pretty(and she is), and the supporting cast of goblins and fairies are useless. The best performance comes from Tim Curry as Darkness, but he is still nothing too special.
However, the biggest travesty of the whole film to me is the absolutely AWFUL music score by Tangerine Dream. Come on. It is beyond me why the stupid producers would scratch Jerry Goldsmith's score for a crappy rock group whose music doesn't even fit with this movie!Overall, the film seems incredibly bland for a fantasy film. The epic scope of Scott's other works SHOULD have been here, but is not. The story is pointless and uninspired, and the characters are duller than most of the film's settings.

Exciting since, we've never been able to see that...but that's just on the second disc of this ""Ultimate Edition"".  The first disc contains a 113 minute director's cut of the timeless movie concerning Good vs. Evil, light vs. dark.  We've got the original Jerry Goldsmith score here.  We've got Lili as a princess.  We've got everything that Scott had imagined in 1985, but didn't release due to poor test audiences here in the states.  So, after 17 years of waiting and wondering, here it is.  And it is breathtaking.I didn't think that having the Goldsmith score and adding a bunch of extra, 'trivial' footage would have that great of an impact on the overall story. I was completely wrong.  I loved the original American version of this movie.  I loved the Tangerine Dream score.  I thought there were places where it was out of sync sometimes, but overall I thought it was very good, especially the unicorn theme (which I still think is better than what Goldsmith has).  But overall, the Goldsmith score is more effective and in tune with the movie.  It is gentle at times, and rough when it needs to be. Adding more scenes with Jack and Gump upon their meeting each other is fun, but something I had already seen much of (I have the taped version from way back in 88 that included this and an extended scene with Meg Mucklebones). In this director's cut, we don't see Tim Curry as Darkness until 3/4 of the way through the movie which is nice because it builds up our anticipation to behold the beast.  Curry and the makeup crew deserve a round of applause. This is by far the best envisioning of the Devil ever.  So, in conclusion, if you were ever a fan of LEGEND, buy this DVD.  If you've never seen the movie, rent it, and then feel bad for yourself, because you could've saved the 4 bucks you spent to rent, when you could've just bought.",Legend

Legend was up there with the best of them.The basic story revolves around the basic story of good vs evil, the loss of innocence and the manifestation of this evil by the Lord of darkness himself. There was no cgi as it was the early eighties and it gives the film a very authentic feel. All the cast give good performances but Tim Curry steals the show as the lord of darkness. I don't think his character could be anywhere near as terrifying if it was made with cgi.The score by Tangerine Dream (who Scott also used in Blade Runner)completes the experience and gives the everything a dream like quality almost like your watching a dream unfold on screen .It uses a lot of self depreciating humor to lighten the mood for the young target audience it was originally aimed at.

The plot is relatively simple,The Lord of Darkness banished to his underworld hatches a plan to bring everlasting night to the world on the condition that the life giving energy harboured in the souls of unicorns is destroyed..using ""innocence"" as bait in the form of Princess Lily part of his plan is ful-filled and it is up the forest dwelling folk to thwart his plan,led by Jack o'Green and various elves,sprites,fairies and dwarves! Ridley Scotts imagination for visual presentation is in itself the stuff of Legends..previous film Blade Runner displays this..but here he really lets his creative juices flow..and whilst the film does lack in its narrative it is more than compensated with its beautiful score and cinematography...for a film made 17 years ago it has aged incredibly well...and compared to recent fantasy flicks like the abysmal Dungeons and Dragons...the effects...with not a hint of c.g.i..are far superior!! Performances are a mixed bunch..Tim Curry as Darkness walks away with acting honours...Mia Sara is also rather good in this her apparently debut role..Tom Cruise however looks rather embarrassed and his reluctance to participate in the feature documentary to accompany the dvd release more than confirms this theory!

167,Joshua Calvert,"The original version sucks, the dir. cut is a fantasy classic",9,19 June 2002,"Since I VHS-recorded Legend (in the European version) from television about ten years ago, I've seen it quite a few times: it had, and has, a wonderful mood to it, reeking oldschool fairy-tales in the Grimm tradition. That is, pretty dark! In the original script, Darkness (the big, red, horned Lucifer-like arch-villain) even f***ed the captured (and seduced?) princess; there's dark for you! That never made it to celluloid, but it is still hinted at (the dancing scene).The forest, where much of the tale takes place, is incredible, and I was stunned to find, watching the DVD featurette, that it was a built set. That forest has a wonderful golden glow to it, with a constant swirling of pollen through the air achieving a great effect.The Goldsmith score contributes to and completes the mood. Not much to say about it, it's just perfect for the film.So, now, I've bought the two-disc Ultimate Edition DVD, where both the US and the European versions are on - so how is the aforementioned?Well, do yourself a HUGE favour, and watch the European version before the US same, if even bothering to see the US one! The Tangerine Dream score is just plain boring (and not at all ""dark"", as I have seen it described) and many scenes have been cut out - because the people behind the movie panicked, and deemed it too ""complex"" for American teenagers!!! This notion must be one of the biggest insults to American youth I've ever heard of! In the US version, scenes, that made perfect sense before, have been cut ruthlessly, to the point where they are either diminished in beauty or now simply stupid. I'll spare you of a reeling off, and settle with two examples:(SMALL SPOILERS, we're talking the beginning of the film)1. When Lily (the princess) approaches the Unicorn in the European version, she sings a quite beautiful song, to calm it. It makes the scene believable (a magical beast like that should be lured in some way, and startled if you just trample up to it - princess or no princess!), and you begin to understand why the protagonist, Jack (a fittingly naive Tom Cruise) thinks Mia Sara is a hottie! In the US vers.: oh, two Unicorns, the only beasts of their kind in the world, can I clap you, horsie? Pah!2. Starting with the US vers. this time: When Jack faces Gump, sort of a head pixie (or whatever) of the woods, Jack immediately tells the truth of him bringing Lily to the Unicorns; Gump freaks, but is all right a second after when Jack says he ""did it for love"". In the European version Jack tries to hide the truth, forgiveness comes much harder, and a riddle game has to be won to achieve this redemption; you sense that the consequences for Jack, should he loose, would be dire indeed!(SMALL SPOILERS end)All in all: go for the director's cut, with great score plus whole scenes and all, at all costs. I honestly don't understand people who recommend the films the other way round - but perhaps due to fond childhood memories of the US version, likely?US: 5/10Euro: 9/10 - the best pure fantasy film after PJ's The Lord of the Rings (which is 10/10 in my book)",Legend

This turn of events leads minions of the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry, in top form) to chop off the stallion's horn – an item of coveted power – and kidnap Princess Lili, both to be brought before Darkness in a master plan to bring eternal night to the world. Now the 'heroic' Jack, aided by his misfit band of elves and dwarfs, must rescue the princess and save the world from its inevitable pitch-black doom.The massive problem with this movie, and there are copious issues, is the fact that it takes so much pleasure in being so damn dark that there's minimal fun to be had – a crucial element of fantasy. Take similar genre films from the time – Labyrinth had the music, Willow and Princess Bride had charm and characterisation, and the one thing that they all shared was a sense of wonder. Legend is too dark and scary for children yet the plot and pacing is too juvenile for adults.Which leads me to the plot – or lack thereof it would seem. We have some basic thematic elements such as good versus evil and all that crap, but it's amazing that with such a simplistic storyline that nothing that is happening on screen is ever really clear, instead it seems to rush through the motions of the plot without focus. This is partly due to the fact that these characters are just so damn one-dimensional that we as an audience simply don't care.The acting by the leads is really appalling. Mia Sara is just plain terrible with an accent that slips in and out constantly, and it's amazing that the fledgling superstar career of Tom Cruise was not affected by this. The major, and dare I say only, highlight of Legend comes in the form of the Lord of Darkness. Tim Curry is super intimidating as the red-skinned demon, delivering an awesome performance with a really fantastic makeup job to boot – Darkness is one of the greatest and most iconic villains in cinematic history.I do also need to point out the elf Honeythorn Gump, played by David Bennett – I was constantly creeped out by the fact he looks like a tween Anthony Hopkins, running around in a loincloth.I understand that this was a troubled production – the sets located on the legendary Pinewood Studios were completely lost in fire and replacement sets were thrown together at the eleventh hour – but it doesn't really excuse this abortion of a film. Although Ridley Scott has made some masterpieces (Blade Runner, Alien) his track record of films such as this make me sceptical of his revered status in the film community.And I am also aware of multiple versions of this movie existing as well. The one that I have viewed does not seem to be the patented Ridley Scott director's cut, but a 90 minute offering with a score supplied by composer Jerry Goldsmith – the original European release if I'm not mistaken.The Lord of Darkness alone cannot save this heaping pile of unicorn crap from being one of the lamest and boring films of the genre. Legend = 100% ironic title.",Legend
173,ilovtheend,A rich fantasy where Tim Curry personifies darkness.,9,2 September 2002,"Ridley Scott tried his best to cover every outcast genre he could and Legend was his Fantasy. Scott has said that he encountered the same problems with this film that he did with Blade Runner:his cut wasn't connecting with people. The ""general"" audience wasn't getting it. So it was recut, a new score by Tangerine Dream was added, and it was released. A great movie for all people, the theatrical release was all I could've asked for. Until I saw the  newly realeased director's cut, that is. If you're a ""general audience"" kind of person, you will love the theatrical cut. If you loved the director's cut of Blade Runner, and you're looking for a little more in a film, check out the new release cut. Both are worth you time. Heather",Legend
174,mijann1972,Leg END,2,5 October 2004,"When i saw the movie Legend in a shop the other day i decided to buy it because i am a big fan of fantasy movies, so you can imagine that my expectations were very high. Fortunately this movie was in offer so the financial damage has not arrived the critical fase. I think that for my feelings i was able to watch that movie for 15 minutes and after that i had a big desire to the end of it. I decided to watch it out for giving at least my critical opinion about it but the only positive thing what i could find is that the special effects are reasonable but the story is really for crying. The story is weak without any excitement or interesting moments and i think that you can equalize this movie with the Princess Bride which also was according to my opinion also not a big success. If you see the script than i think that there should be more in it but unfortunately it has been worked out bad. The special effects course that the movie will not be rated at the most awful number by me but more than a 2 out of 10 i cannot make from it because for me it was simply not great.",Legend
175,reggienunez,Pretty visuals,5,24 July 2018,"Legend was Ridley Scott's follow up to his most personal film Blade Runner. And it was the start of his ""average"" phase. Legend is a decent film- it looks astonishing Ill give it that. But the story is basic and Tom Cruise is simply adequate. Tim Curry as the bad guy actually completely steals the show but overall this is just an okay film filled with pretty visuals. If you want to watch a fantasy there are other better films. Unless you're a fan of Ridley Scott or Tom Cruise I think you can safely avoid this.",Legend
176,The Realms,Great fantasy movie!,10,15 September 2000,Legend is one of the best fantasy movies to date and it's over fifteen years old now. It has the regular plot of good vs. evil but the cinematography is perfect. The story fits the movie and the acting is exactly as it should be for this type of film. You couldn't ask for a better fairy tale on film if you dreamed it up in your own mind.,Legend
177,Al_Truist80,"'And lo, this was the culmination of four years research and countless dollars. And 'twas not good.'",5,4 February 2001,"I usually like 80's fantasy movies, but this one doesn't do the genre any credit. One filmbook describes the film as being like a shampoo advert, and I concur with that. It's supposed to be enchanting but it comes across as trite and tacky. The makeup is largely pathetic, the script hackneyed, the acting unconvincing, the plot ridiculous (how do you stop sunlight using a Unicorn's horn?). There is minimal location shooting and we don't get a feeling of distance between the locations (how far is Darkness's tower is from the forest?) It doesn't even use matte backgrounds! Some of the interiors are detailed, but the camera seems more interested in the actors. The  music is...interesting. But the bad points easily outweigh the good, particularly the directing which is truly AWFUL and the plot which is paper thin. This is a pretty poor film and one Ridley Scott must be embarrassed to have on his CV. If Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is any better than this then it has my approval.",Legend
178,bhusebye,This could be a spoiler...,10,2 September 2011,"This is a story about good vs evil, light vs dark. Love conquers all. The American version with Tangerine Dream, I had my kids watch quite a few times to even out watching Willow(1985 another good kids movie). There is death in this movie and life and rebirth so be prepared to answer any questions if your little ones get scared. There are unicorns, goblins, faeries, The Devil, a fawn, gnomes and I think a quite a few other beasties. This one you might want to wait until they are at least 10 so they don't wet the bed. Good morals to this story to be had so don't let it go to waste because it is fantasy. It is pure entertainment",Legend
179,audby,"Like a root canal, but without the anesthetic...",1,22 February 2003,"This is easily the worst film ever written, proving that good actors, a great director, and a decent score can't cover up a truly pathetic script. The plot of the film is a poorly disguised redux of ""The Lord of the Rings"" -- Dark Lords, innocent heros, mystical powers bound up in unlikely objects -- and could not possibly have been conceived by anyone over the age of six.In fact, judging by the excruciatingly painful dialogue, a six-year-old may indeed have written the script.  The only reason my wife and I continued to watch was because of the macabre curiosity that grips anyone watching a disaster, and watching this film was about akin to watching a slow train wreck, surgery gone wrong, Adam and Eve eating the Fruit, or the slow plummet of a crippled airliner.  It was that bad.  This film is worse than most which have gained infamy -- think of ""Ice Pirates"" or ""Mac and Me"", but then think of having your nails pulled out while watching them.  It's on that level.  The opening scroll gives you a clue as to just how painful the film will be, and it just gets worse when people actually appear on the screen.  Without a doubt, this film had a bright future behind it.However, for those who loved ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", ""Mars Attacks!"", and ""The Scorpion King"", this movie might just provide you with a moment of distraction.  For anyone seeking a top-notch fantasy film, go rent ""Conan the Barbarian"" or ""Lord of the Rings""; you could even get a better viewing experience out of ""Krull"", ""DragonSlayer"", and ""Dungeons and Dragons"".  As for ""Legend"", the only thing legendary about it is the amount of money and celluloid they wasted making it.",Legend
180,Northevenstar84,A beautiful film,8,27 May 2009,"Just to clarify here, I'm talking about the director's cut, not the original American release. I'm not going to get in to the whole argument over which is better.This film contains some of the most stunning imagery I've ever seen. Some of the shots are art pieces in their own right and are capable of standing apart from the film. An example is the shot following Darkness' entrance through the mirror, when he bends down and his cloak twists out behind him. Pure magic.Ridley Scott and his crew built an entire indoor forest complete with real birds to make this film come to life. He puts an extraordinary amount of thought and planning behind the visual design and each of his shots which is the reason they look so amazing. The design of Darkness' character, especially the prosthetics and make up, is truly great. Poor Tim Curry must've sat in that make up chair for hours!Don't get me wrong, the film has flaws. The script isn't perfect and comes across a little cheesy in parts. However there are also some great moments (the scene between Lily and Darkness in his lair comes to mind). The design is definitely the strong point of the film though, and who can resist a film so dedicated to exploring the struggle between good and evil, with a few unicorns mixed in to keep the kiddies happy of course. Basically, it's pure fantasy in it's most self indulgent form.",Legend
181,MerianMoriarty,Beautiful...could have been so much more.,10,25 March 2002,"Having seen all three edits of the film, I must say that I would dearly love to see a director's edition of it.  To see such a magnificent flick in its entirety would be any movie-lover's dream.  Beautiful effects.  Lovely music.  Ridley Scott works magic in an early piece, just as dark as his modern-day classics.  If ""Legend"" had not fallen prey to the demons of screen-editing, it might have been much greater; as is, it is a striking film, with moving themes and a setting of pure fantasy.  A very beautiful film, especially in the HBO/Television edit.",Legend
182,DanceInTheGutter,A fantastic classic,10,28 April 2008,"What I loved most about this movie is that it pertains a happy medium. What I mean by this is that, while the effects, sets, and visuals of the time were outstanding, the movie was not meant to attract just anyone. It was not a movie that claims familiar sensations and thoughts (except the good vs evil basis), but that branches out into the most wild reaches of the imagination. This is a 'cult' movie because its display is fantastic.The themes are simple. Good versus evil, hero and villain, a world of fantasy, true love. But what the director accomplished was deeper, more disturbing, darker, and so much more pleasing to the eyes then you could expect from a 'fairytale'. Even when the scenes are cheerful and bright, you sense how fragile it is, and how mortal the characters are. And when the scenes are dark and evil, you can not shield your eyes or feel afraid. You are drawn and can not look away.It was these effects that played with the mind just the way a fantasy should. You must be left in awe and confusion, and still curious for more.The actors were great (Cruise, unfortunately, being my least favorite choice, and Tim Curry and the boy who played the Forest Sprite being the absolute best). The costumes, makeup, and set are superb.One of my 'must sees' for those who not only love 'cult' movies, but who love to feel the movie, to be a part of it, and to be left inspired.",Legend
183,rexbasior,enter a world where nobody wears pants,7,6 August 2003,"let me start off by saying that the movie is sincerely awful for a lot of reasons, but i gave it a 7 because there are just too many things i absolutely adore about it.ridley scott and some fabulous art direction and set design went all the way after they figured on titling this thing 'legend.' maybe i'll get some disagreements, but the film is just spectacular to look at. every shot looks like a very lush painting from a fairy tale. very romantic, in that it was like nowhere i've ever seen. it looked like they pulled a 'moulin rouge' and used interiors for all shots -- even the forest scenes. the result is a forest i've only seen in dreams i've had. there is also plenty of detail in the evil lair. statues, pillars, weird light sources, etc. someone put some overtime in.i also liked the fact that there was always something floating in the air -- snow, sprites, fairies, fantasy-bugs, bubbles. like i said, dreamy.
i liked that darkness has the two biggest horns i've ever seen. might as well go over-the-top in makeup and costume design if your movie is called 'legend.' wow... that thing is pretty evil.and of course i liked the reason i decided to rent the thing in the first place -- mia sara. where's she been? ferris didn't even know how lucky he had it.anyway, there's a lot of silliness too. the dialogue is like the journal of that weird 6th grade girl who just sat under a tree at recess. sort of like a junior high assignment to try and sound as much like a cliched shakespeare as possible. i knew going into the movie that it wasn't known for dialogue or deep characterization. i figured that the visuals would make up for it, but as much as i loved the vision, the action made me lose interest a few times. and the dwarves and the weird dubbed kid -- yeah, weird.
also... couldn't they find some pants for tom cruise? ick. i guess they felt that since 'risky business' was a success...7/10",Legend
184,phoenix-82,Director's Cut brings out true vision behind Legend,9,10 July 2002,"Just recently Legend was released in the Ultimate Edition, a 2 disc set of DVDs.  This includes both the original US Release and Ridley Scott's Director's Cut.  Some people I know, bit 80's fan I might also say, really loved the original US release, but to me at least the tone of the movie isn't set properly, especially in the music. With 24 more minutes of added scenes and a completely new score for the movie, the Director's Cut brings out Legend as the amazing fantasy it was designed to be.  The movie has absolutely amazing cinematography to bring the wonderful scenes to life.  Just the first scene of the forest just left me saying ""wow"". All and all, if you thought the original release came off a little corny and didn't quite feel right, give the Director's Cut a chance.  If you are one of those in love with the original release, pretend the Director's Cut never existed :) Beautifully filmed fantasy adventure, check it out.",Legend
185,patrick-98,Overlook of the film Legend,10,13 October 1999,The movie Legend is a prime example of evil verses good.  The imagry of the unicorns and the leaves blowing around is unforgettable as are the characters.  The sets provide the perfect background for the story line.  A great film for anyone who is looking for a spectacular get away kind of film.,Legend
186,proinfo,Pretty but Vacuous,4,2 July 2002,"I finally saw this film on DVD.  I had been interested in the film for some time, but could never find a copy to rent or never thought about it until I left the store.  I never got to see the film during it's run in the theaters.The film is very overrated; Plain and Simple.Directors Cut The visuals are outstanding, Story is a little more strong and cohesive. The music score is much better.  But it is still boring.North America Cut The visuals are the only thing this cut has going for it.
My feeling If it wasn't for the big names ""Ridley Scott and Tom Cruise"" this movie would have been left on some dusty shelf along with all the other mediocre 80's films that we dont even remember.Rating 4/10",Legend
187,bdistef,One of the best fantasy epics of all time.,10,26 August 2018,"'Legend' is literally one of the all time best fantasy films ever made. This movie is magical, plain and simple. It also feels like this was the perfect template for so many other great fantasy epics that came afterwards. For example, I think perhaps there wouldn't have been a 'Willow' or even a 'Labyrinth' without 'Legend'. This movie set the bar high, and set the stage for some of my personal favorite movies growing up (most of which are fantasy epics). I know 'Star Wars' gets the bulk of the credit for launching these fantasy epic type movies. But, this seems more of a direct link to others dating back to the 80's, like 'Willow' and 'Labyrinth', and even as recent as 'Mirrormask'. Final thought:
The actors were all phenomenal; especially Tom Cruise (who I typically don't love), Mia Sara (who plays both the innocent and dark versions of Lili so well), and obviously Tim Curry (I mean, c'mon his Darkness is so badass). These characters are all so brilliant!",Legend
188,anatisfairywheel,"Stunningly Little Exploration of the Main Themes of Evil vs. Innocence, but Great Visual Imagery",6,28 November 2012,"I personally feel that the film contains only a rather shallow, stereo-typical, and one-dimensional exploration of its major themes of good vs. evil, loss of innocence, and so on. In fact, much of the film feels stereotypical--strange forest boy; silly & naive girl who does something seemingly perfectly harmless and then gets blamed for ruining everything (and who does an awful lot of crying out for Jack and seems unable to actually take care of herself very well..); and then the pack of fantasy stock characters that almost randomly appear, with little purpose other than spurring the other characters and moving the film along. The character development is quite poor, we never really see into their deeper motivations; and the opportunities to explore questions regarding the deeper nature of evil and innocence, lust, greed, hate, love, and desire are left void--the film brings these things up, only to leave them sitting there at surface level; there is so much here that could have been explored, since it really is not a black-and-white or simple issue, but the film treats these things very simply as just that--a very shallow exploration. A deep exploration could have really been the wind in the sails for this rather standard plot, and really made the film shine; but from a film whose whole premise is based on these struggles, I was definitely expecting a bit more; unfortunately, the treatment falls short of the film's lofty themes and visual imagery.The acting itself was good, and the actors seem well cast, even if the characters were rather shallow and stereotyped. The special effects were pretty good (perhaps almost even overdone) and the photography was also good, if a bit dark and dim (in many scenes) for my taste. It's the very beautiful fairy-tale landscapes and the unicorns that really shine in this film. I give this film a 6 out of 10 for it's decent character portrayal (the actors do a good job with what they're given) and memorable imagery.",Legend
189,baruchandbenedict,Too bad to even write a funny review about,2,20 September 2006,"Aside from some very pretty cinematography, legend was completely one dimensional. It was presented as an epic struggle of good against evil, but there was no depth to the characters or back story at all, and ""morality"" was addressed only at face value - the evil characters were evil only insofar as they hated the good characters and wore all black. There were no ethical conflicts, so you can't really blame the movie's failure on the decadence of its generation like that one guy did. All said, I was surprised by how well they managed to avoid giving any depth to the characters beyond their roles as ""The Good Guy"", ""The Girl"", ""The Dark Lord"", and ""The Completely Unbearable Comic Relief Dwarfs"". I think the bad guy was played by Diablo from that computer game.",Legend
190,Rued,Terrible,3,14 December 1998,"This was a horrible movie; because of my love for the genre, I was recommended this film. However, it turned out to be nothing but a terrible disappointment. The love story is hokey, not to mention the characters, the portrayal of not just the bad guys but all the characters is extremely hokey. The first few minutes or so with the lush garden and the unicorns was a red herring; this movie got progressively worse. Plus, there were elves who I couldn't hear a single damn thing they were saying. But the elements of the movie - the fantastic, heroic, good vs evil, weren't at all explained or heroic. We're just expected to kick back and take this.I give this movie a three. The best of the genre, sadly, is probably Willow, which itself is virtually just a version of Legend, but better done. I plan to write the definitive fantasy-epic, perhaps like with Braveheart with magic. (e-mail is havergal@yahoo.com)",Legend
191,StuartMH,One of the true classics of the genre,9,8 November 2000,"If you like pure fantasy films then you can't really beat this film. Tim Curry, who steals every scene he appears in, plays 'Darkness' and is the ultimate devil (who can forget that amazing costume?!).You'll never regret watching this film, it is a true 'feel good' movie that you'll want to watch whenever you are feeling down.If only Hollywood would make more of these kind of movies!",Legend
192,Redwolfsw,Watch the Director's Cut,8,22 May 2002,"The new Legend DVD, which features not only the US version (which is the one that everybody has voted for here), but the extended Director's Cut (which features half an hour of new footage as well as Jerry Goldsmith's original score) which is far superior and really makes Legend a different, better movie.  The Director's Cut offers more insight into the characters, and a darker perspective on the events of the film.  It was almost like watching Lord of the Rings, which this film reminds me of greatly.  The new cut is really great, and much more deserving than a mere 6.0 rating.  I hope IMDB makes a new page for the Director's Cut so that people will know there is more than one, like with Blade Runner.",Legend
193,gbroagfran,I gave it a 6 out of 10,6,29 December 1999,"""Lord of Darkness wants eternal night, wants last two unicorns (the most mystical creatures of the forest) dead."" Alright, so the plot, I'm sorry to say, is actually kind of corny. The characters aren't that likable; in fact, I thought that Lily was a stupid little girl who obviously didn't love Jack ""dearer than life itself"" by risking *his* life throughout the entire movie. And the standard issue clean cut good guy-bad guy plotline doesn't bring much to the genre. You could predict that Evil Lily wasn't going to slit the unicorn's throat, and that Good will triumph over Evil, and that none of the prominent good characters were going to die. If I was a producer reading this script, I would probably turn it down.However, the direction and the atmosphere more than make up for these flaws. The sets are all gorgeous- virgin old-growth forests with enough pollen floating around to make you break out in hives. The Lord of Darkness' costume, while predictable enough for an evil character, is awesome. All of the visuals are memorable and seamless. Obviously a lot of effort was put into making a movie with a lackluster script seem cooler than it actually is. It worked. 6/10",Legend
194,pettums,This film was truly awful: Really regret renting it.,1,18 September 2000,"This film was truly awful. I am a Tim Curry fan, but he was not enough to save a film which just made you cringe one moment and make you wish for some kind of plot/humour the next.It might have been beautifully photographed, but this can't save it from the script.",Legend
195,Jawss6,A good movie for the family,10,14 September 2006,"There are very few movies out there that are as mystical as this one here, and the movies I have seen that are mystical only show dragons. In today's world dragons seem to be more popular than unicorns, unicorns have always been a symbol of love and purity just like white doves have.When I first saw this as a child at seven or eight I never found it dark, and this is what I have read in other comments that it seems too dark for children. Maybe not all children will understand the movie, although many children such as myself when I was young loved unicorns and dwarfs and even trolls. So what is so dark about the movie, I've watched far worse movies that I see children watching and being afraid of? The opening of the movie was beautiful with the bear wandering about and the waterfall, it looked like a pure fantasy like forest with plenty of sunlight.The trolls make up was well done, I'll definitely say Blix's make up. His curved beak like nose and the scowl on his face, even the pig troll was well done, he looked as if he was half human and half pig almost like a centaur.The Dark Lord his make up was truly excellent, many people always see the devil as having hooves and a furry body from the waist down. I don't remember seeing a tail on him though, no matter the bright red body and the frightening face made him look like a real Satan. In any fantasy movie with a demon or devil that is how many people portray them to look. Tim Curry did a great job voicing him and in his acting, not all actors that play dark parts sound as dark as Tim Curry did in this movie.Whatever breed of horses played the unicorns, it was a good choice they caught the eyes of many horse lovers. I believe they were Andalusians, if they are not please correct me. When unicorns are portrayed in paintings or movies they always make the horn look as if it's a stack of rings, in this movie the horns looked as if they could be real. They didn't glow, it wasn't solid gold it just looked real which made the movie look as if this world could exist in our past.The music had to have been my favorite, it was mystical and it made me feel as if I was right in the movie. And when the music is that good than it means the movie was well done, the special effects, the characters and the directing was all wonderfully done. Too bad there aren't more movies like this today.",Legend
196,1Bliss,Where has all the fantasy gone ?,7,15 September 2001,"I love simple yet well done bits of fantasy as ""Legends"" is an excellent example. I am somewhat dismayed at the general public in slowly steering away from such beautiful tales of mythology and the encompassing genre of fantasy in general. I actually enjoyed this film more than ""The Hobbitt"" of many years ago. I believe I heard of a new version of Tolkien's trilogy is in the making, if so, I look forward to it with todays special effects abilities. If you enjoy works of fantasy, I believe you will find ""Legends"" to be a delightful mix of love, adventure and enough 'story' to keep it interesting. I feel the director Ridley Scott did an excellent job with the tools available to him in 1985. So, pick a rainy day, cuddle up with your love one and sit back and enjoy a journey into a simpler yet exciting world of fantasy !",Legend

198,frodons,One of Ridley Scotts best films!!!,10,6 May 2007,"I just cannot believe what comments pop-up on this site! This movie is 100% perfection!!! I grew up on it, together with The Labyrinth and Willow. For me it is one of the symbols of the '80s. Everything in this movie is beautiful, the story, the cast, effects, costumes, masks, music...literally everything!!! One of Ridley Scotts best films!!! First, those who saw this film for the first time after they turned 18 are too late to enjoy it's magic!!! When my kid is old enough to read, this will be one of the first movies he will watch. You cannot appreciate the story if you don't believe in the values this movie promotes. You have a princess, a hero and his friends, the villain and his minions, a quest, a clear distinction between good and the bad and their eternal struggle. What more can you ask from a fantasy?! So don't judge this film by todays standards when movies are made just for profit with a weak story and tons of CGI! If you are under 18 years old, you can watch it alone....if not, take a kid with you and ask for his views of the film after it is over, and then come and put a comment on this site!!! A must see!!! One of the BEST!!!",Legend
199,elekanahmen-1,A beautiful movie...,10,11 December 2005,"... but if you're going to buy it, spring for the two disc set. I have loved this film since I was a little kid, back before the era of DVDs when I all I could do was watch a battered VHS copy over and over again. The sets and artistry are just gorgeous. Just recently, I purchased the DVD set with the Director's Cut. Honestly, it's almost like watching an entirely different film. And a better one. The story is more complete, many scenes that were chopped to bits are back in their entirety and more coherent, and the ending has changed (and, in my opinion, the new ending makes a great deal more sense). That said, I still have a fondness for the shorter Tangerine Dream version as well. Luckily, the DVD set includes BOTH versions, plus some interesting extras.",Legend
200,rjones-38816,Ultimate Cult Classic,10,24 December 2020,"This should be required for every kid to see at least once. Tim Curry is magnificent as Darkness and Tom Cruise is adorable as Jack. Costumes better than CGI during the Jim Henson costume era (not apart of the Jim Henson Creature Shop though). The story is beautiful, the plot is a classic fairytale fantasy. Richard Picardo as Marley is awesome as well. The music is eery but mystical at the same time. I must see movie if you love or like scifi and fantasy, it also has some action too",Legend
201,zatoichi-2,One of my favs,10,17 January 1999,If you like high fantasy this movie is for you. Ridley Scott does a tremendous job directing this movie.

202,Lucien-3,"A nice thought, but still a failure.",7,12 September 1999,"I haven't seen the version of Legend with the origional soundtrack-maybe i's better-but as it stands now, this movie is pretty much for children. Jack, Lily, and most of the other characters are flat, superficial, extremely corny, and dull. The poor acting doesn't help. The set, though perhapse a bit over the top, was very nice and helped the movie tremendously. The plot, like the characters, was flat and dull. Legend did, however, have a few saving features. The first, as I have mentioned, was the amazing sets and the atmosphere that they created, and the second is Tim Curry.

Good wins over evil in the end and all is well, and yet, somehow, it manages to capture that Brothers Grimm-esque dark side of fairy tales.  It weaves a spell that has caught me more than once killing two hours on a Saturday afternoon on the couch watching it yet again.  Submit to the wonder, ignore the thinness, and enjoy.",Legend

I've seen a lot of comments here about the soundtrack being changed and it being edited, but I didn't know that when I saw it, and I wasn't bothered by it for the most part (except, as I mentioned, those scenes where I was a little confused as to why something just happened).

206,Pendragon-2,"Excellent story line and costuming, great cast.",10,22 February 2005,"This fantasy story is well written. The costuming is amazing, esp. Tim Curry's full-body prosthetic suit of ""Darkness"". You can purchase this in a two-disk set where the second disk is a ""Directors cut"". It is the film as Ridley Scott originally visualised. It is also called the ""European release"" as it is the theatrical version released seen in Europe. The story line is a bit darker, the music score is more of a classical theme but for me it is an excellent re-working of a classic. The director's cut spends a little more dialogue and time giving background on Lily being royalty. The ending is a bit different as Jack waves goodbye to Gump and the other ""forest people"", and then Jack and Lily separate with plans to see each other the next day. Both versions are worthwhile to view. jeff:P",Legend

Still, unless you specifically have something against fantasy, you should like Legend. It's a fun adventure with interesting characters and a great bad guy. Not only is it fun, but it's uniquely artistic, from the cinematography to the plot and thematic elements. I'd say almost every scene could be a painting in itself. It just draws you in, and there's no reason to resist. And I should mention that the music is quite good considering the movie was made in the mid 80s (you all know what I mean).

There are just so many memorable and striking images and a great Tangerine Dream score to make it a joy to watch.  Having said this and having just watched the Director's cut of the film with the original Jerry Goldsmith score, I must say I enjoy Legend even more now.  In comparison, the U.S. theatrical version now seems a bit weak to say the least.  Almost every scene is fleshed out more in the Director's cut and the movie is paced so much better because of this and the Goldsmith score makes the film have a more epic feel to it.  In watching Legend again recently, I couldn't help but make comparisons to Lord Of The Rings which I saw this past year and it surprised me how well Legend holds up visually to LOTR, even though it was made at least 15 years previous to it!  It just shows what a master artist Ridley Scott is with regards to his direction and vision.  Bravo!",Legend
215,ToddyEnglish,The Director's edition is sensational...,9,30 April 2007,"In my opinion the director's cut of Ridley Scott's masterpiece, Legend, holds up with every single CGI fantasy epic(including The Lord of The Rings)released recently. It saddens me that this version did not make it into theaters. With the exception of the ending(the whole ""It was all a dream"" feel)Legend was a brilliantly imagined fairy tale. While the original theatrical release was good(as was Tangerine Dream's score)I thought it was marginal compared to the intended version. Ridley Scott is such a masterful director. I cannot explain it except to say that whenever I watch a Ridley film I BELIEVE in everything presented before me. I truly believed that a world like the one in LEGEND could have actually existed. Whilst viewing the movie I felt immersed in the story and the forest itself. The production team took so much time and care in cultivating that forest. And don't even get me started on the make up and acting. Today's Hollywood should rely less on CGI and get back to men in suits and make-up. I cannot wrap my brain around the fact that ""Darkness"" is none other than Tim Curry from ""The Rock Horror Picture Show."" As a fantasy film fan I rank this as one of the finest. I am just saddened that the powers that be in Hollywood did not give American Cinema goers the benefit of the doubt. The movie could have been more successful had it been told in its original format(sans the ending)...",Legend

Some of the pacing of the film is strange and laborious for the casual viewer.The ideas guiding the film, however, are incredibly powerful.  The ideas on the nature of absolute evil and good are refreshing and spellbinding.  The whole flavor of the film is one of both reverence and aestheticism.  Every scene is visually and aurally indulgent, awash in color and sound and...glitter.In the end, enjoyment of LEGEND comes down to a willing suspension of disbelief.

218,ewanluver13,A great fantasy flick,10,15 April 2002,"Long before Tom Cruise met Nicole Kidman or even got his teeth fixed, he starred in this wonderful little fantasy flick. I think it shows great imagination and hard work went into this production and how only about four or five characters actually used their own faces. The rest were put into extensive makeup. There are elves, goblins, demons, and fairies, as well as humans. (Cruise does a great job showing love even though it was rumored that he and Mia Sara did not get along too well.) Tim Curry does a fantastic job as Darkness, a centaur-like demon decked out with hooves, horns, fangs, and red skin. For anyone who enjoys a 'love conquers all' movie with a bunch of imagination, adventure, and fun, this is definitely for you. I've loved this movie ever since I was a youngin' and will love it for a long time after. Anyone else that loves a romantic adventure should watch this.",Legend
219,racheljg,Great visuals do NOT a movie make.,3,20 July 2008,"I am an avid fantasy fan even as a 26-year old adult so after reading the glowing reviews on this site (and a few bad ones) I decided to give Legend, the longer director's cut version with the Goldsmith soundtrack, a try as I somehow missed it growing up. Oh dear.. after watching this, for the life of me I couldn't understand how people could possibly rate this a 10. Although there are great costumes/makeup and beautiful visuals, especially in the first 10-15 mins, the film rapidly deteriorates thereafter. The characters come off as extremely hollow, and the script is at times atrocious even for an 80's film. I actually felt embarrassed for the actors at some points. But what really annoyed me more than that was all throughout the film things were happening with little explanation or continuity. The characters' motivations are never explored and they continuously do and say things for no reason at all. Because of this, it makes it very hard to care about any of them.There was one unique scene involving Lily and Darkness which other reviewers have mentioned that could have been jaw-droppingly great had it been set up and executed better. While it was a cool-looking scene, I didn't really appreciate it because I was too busy trying to figure out what on earth was going on. And that is how I feel about the whole film, to be honest. With better character development, an entirely new script, and the same gorgeous visuals and costumes, this could have been a masterpiece, but unfortunately it falls flat and loses appeal after around 25 minutes once you have said to yourself ""Oh, what gorgeous scenery, that must have taken them AGES and lots of $$$ to do.. but what about... um.. well.. EVERYTHING else??"" Sorry people, but great visuals do not a movie make.BOTTOM LINE: I have come to the conclusion that the people who have rated and reviewed this so highly are those that saw it when they were kids back in the 80's; therefore it holds special childhood nostalgia for them. But, if like me, you haven't seen this up to now and are all grown up, take my advice and AVOID.",Legend

It is kind of like that dessert that Rachel tried to make on that episode of Friends where she added beef to the whipped cream and other sweet stuff - individually it is all good, but mixed up it's not. So much talent, but the story never gains momentum.  There were good individual segments and times that I was impressed, but, in the end, I felt disappointed.  I'm still not sure why Tom Cruise (post Risky Business and pre Top Gun) was cast in his roll or why he took it.  He just seemed out of place to me in this movie.

In the end it shows you that both must coincide together for the world to exist.

I'd say that this movie is a nice Fantasy movie and one of Tom Cruise's first works. The actors are great actors-to-be like Tim Curry, Mia Sara and the already mentioned Tom Cruise. This movie is the fairy tale you were always told before going to sleep and I'd say it is a must-see for every Dungeons & Dragons player out there or every Fantasy movie fan.

I personally love this movie it is as great as Labyrinth was, maybe better. The score of the film doesn't define it, the score is beautiful and empowers the theme. I believe that this movie should be recommended to all ages. Legend doesn't have to be an actual Legend to be great, not all Legends are what they are supposed to be.

I couldn't imagine anyone else playing this part. *The set was exquisite. I meditate to these images. I immerse myself in that world when I daydream. It isn't supposed to reflect reality people!!

This setting is loaded with enough beautiful images that I would like to get a still and hang it on my wall. *The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream and Bryan Ferry (who I love even when he sings ""Rescue Me"") complements this movie interestingly. In 1987, It's definitely not what I expected from a fantasy movie. Very progressive at the time. I own it. *The costuming was beautiful as well. *Everything else was icing on the cake for this movie. *I have seen this movie countless times, and every time a major event in my life happens (death, birth, marriage etc) I crave a fix to immerse myself in fairyland.It is nice to just let yourself believe the fantasy, even if some of the lines (Tom Cruises mostly) are supercheesy.

Now I'm 17 and this is still one of my favorite movies ever. And it pains me to see critics give it such a bad score. I think it has something to do with the fact that when it was brought to America, it was destroyed in the editing room.

The ""IT"" being....THIS IS AN IDEALISTIC FAIRYTALE LOVE STORY THAT READS LIKE PROPHECY!How this film touches on the LEGENDary heroics of BOTH Jack and Lily when faced with moral adversity, is the sauce that makes this 80s fantasy stand the test of time. It basically tests the innocence and integrity of Lily and Jack in a well balanced, together yet separate way. In Lilys case, she fought off the seduction of greed and materialism. Which isn't the easiest thing to do when you are a ""lady/princess"". When Jack was tempted by the fairy magic, he had to make the decision whether or not to allow the sin of lust to conquer his moral compass but NO, he stood strong. When Lily looked like she turned and was about to execute the unicorn, Jack had to make the decision to not kill her. He believed in her and it paid off. Mirroring his possible sacrifice, she made the decision to free the unicorn, putting herself in harm's way, NOT knowing Jack was there to save her. They both lived up to the purity of their spirits. Of course, these two live happily ever after TOGETHER.Here's where the directors cut that came out later on loses me. After an adventure like that, WHY IN THE WORLD would these two allow ""duty"" and them being from two ""different worlds"" have them BREAK UP and Jack getting left in the FRIENDZONE? How random and ridiculous. If we wanted to be fake realistic, Lily might as well kept Darkness around as a sugar daddy and Jack should've took one for the team and hooked up with the fairy in the dungeon. Smh. Even if they didn't stand the test of time together, there is no way they would call it quits IMMEDIATELY after that adventure.

240,grawulf,The best of its time... only minor flaws in an otherwise classic film,9,11 March 2008,"Fantasy movies were rare and poorly done in those days. I was a teenager then, and as a fantasy fan, I can't tell you how many times I was disappointed. Take a look at the animated versions of the Lord of the Rings, or the Hobbit. Even filmmakers who took fantasy seriously contributed to its stigma, because they couldn't get a few bucks to do a movie right. Now the grand success of 'Rings'and 'Harry Potter' has changed everything, Hollywood is throwing billions at fantasy movies... and still missing the point. Hollywood, for all its glamor and controversy, will never change. Tom Cruise' aforementioned apathy towards this film is testament to that fact. He started out in the business doing a movie that was phenomenal in the genre and a true classic, as time has shown. But he regrets it? That's because Tom IS Hollywood. In fact, I suspect that as 'Rings' was peaking, Cruise was starting to think Legend may not have been all that bad. But after a few more 'Eragon' style flicks, the stigma will be safely back in place, and fantasy can go crawling back into its closet, tail tucked firmly between legs. And fantasy fans can follow, with their novels by Tolkien, Lewis, and Howard safely hidden in their backpacks. Thanks Hollywood.",Legend
241,Gary2012,A fairy tale on film.,9,14 February 2008,"I've read a lot of opposing views here and there are valid views on both sides. I guess it boils down to what your imagination can be hopefully transfered to film for you enjoyment.I've seen my fair share of fantasy films in my life and Legend probably reached to that part of me quicker than any film of that genre than has been done before and since. Lord of the Rings surpasses it on many levels...but Legeng still has the ability after all these years to make me think of pure fantasy, and that's what I believe this film is about. Good vs evil is what most films are about, but Legend is what fairies and goblins and a mystical forests are! Visually I doubt you can find much better even 20 odd years later! Good vs evil in a setting that is set in a purer forum. Character development here are not too strong, but they're not meant to be. They are strong enough to portray love vs evil vs good and bad, and they do it well in the context of the story. Tom Cruise did a good Job as the Nieve and yet courageous Jack, Lily was a the prize of his longing and it came across as undeniable. Mia Sara as lily is the stuff of youthful longing.Tim Curry played the spoiler and he did it to the point of stealing all of the film. He is the stuff of fantasy. The costume was spectacular, and his portrayal of the character was commanding...And over the top cause that what he does well! I enjoyed the directors cut film more as it is longer and tells the story just a little better, but I enjoyed Tangarines Dream's score more as it captured the mood of fantasy ( for me) as set in a mystical place! Jerry Goldsmith had some very good moments, but TD for me layed out a fairytale with my eyes closed better. But at the end you either see this for the pure fantasy it is about or you see it as something deeper that it doesn't pretend to be. It's much purer in it's view on good vs evil and to my taste it hits on every level of that platform. And not to mention it's ability to make for a great dream filled with hope and danger.Pure fantasy...and should be viewed with that intent.",Legend

243,BeyondR,"Great Film for it's time, not just the actors.",10,15 November 2002,"This film contains many small inferences to sex, love, life, and religious beliefs. The writer shows that you do not have to side with ""Good"" at all points and that even the most innocent may be ""turned"" to a darker side to some extent. This film has 3 main players in it that later became well known actors and furthered their skills, yet some of the lesser actors and actresses fell away into obscurity.

I think the fact that they didn't over-do it makes the movie easy to watch. Some of the dialogue is pretty strange, watching it in this day and age, but I find that it draws me in due to it's uniqueness.

I absolutely can't stand this movie. But it really makes me wish Ridley would have produced Lord of the rings like this, instead of Steve, using less cgi.
The author and Ridley must have been intoxicated.
'Ciniastas' claiming this is a 9 or 10 are pretentious.

247,ksirnick,All style and no substance,6,25 February 2021,"The is a review of both the Director's Cut and Theatrical cut of the film. Although there good aspects of both films the Director's cut is just a little bit better. This is film is the perfect example all style and no substance. The film is visually stunning, the set design and makeup effects are outstanding. The cinematography does wonderful job of conveying the fantasy world the film is based in, but the story is lacking structure. More character development is needed, particularly Jack. He is rather generic not terribly interesting hero with a dull performance by Tom Cruise. Lili is better formed character and with a better performance by Mia Sara, but think she too could have been better developed. The winner here is Tim Curry with a wonderfully sinister performance as Darkness. Even under all that makeup he is able to show a range of emotion that helps to convey a more well-rounded villain. The soundtrack is okay. I'm a big fan of both Jerry Goldsmith (Director's Cut) and Tangerine Dream (Theatrical Cut). Neither one of these soundtracks are very good. Tangerine Dream's wins out by being a little more appropriate to the subject matter, although the two pop songs at the end of the movie breaks the mood of the film and are not necessary. Four stars plus a couple extra stars for Curry's performance and the amazing set design, makeup and cinematography.",Legend

Never before had I so hoped the bad guy would hurry up and kill the good guy so I could get out of the theater! Luckily for Cruise this stinker was bookended by two really good movies or his career may have flamed out.Most of the other actors did a decent job, but I think the story was just horrible. Hard to create a diamond out of pig s**t, and they really shouldn't have tried. I know it sounds like I'm being really harsh, but watch the movie and you'll understand what I'm saying. It really is painful to watch!",Legend
250,julesberry3,wow,3,26 May 2004,"This movie is absolutely horrible. There is no getting around it. The plot is not minimalistic, rather, it is boring beyond belief. The acting is horrendous, a self-explanatory example being the mere presence of Tom Cruise. Although it is praised for its special effects, I believe the mental well-being of the people making these ludicrous claims should be investigated. I could go on (exposition? what's that? And development?), but this movie is just not worth it. ""Legend""'s only redeeming factor is the fact that, when watched with friends and mocked thoroughly, it is hi-larious. If you are ever feeling down, watch the scene where the character Meg is introduced; it should guarantee at least three minutes of laughing.However, if you actually enjoyed this movie for its merits as a story and such, I recommend ""Highlander"" and ""The Last Starfighter"".",Legend

252,sethgadman,"Gorgeous on the surface, Hollow at its heart, Legend is a Cinematic Bimbo",5,30 January 2015,"Legend has long lived in my consciousness. It was obviously visually arresting and it couldn't help hold a fascination for me with its incredible set design, cinematography and the greatest makeup effect ever committed to screen in Rob Bottin's Darkness. I've never really enjoyed watching it though, I found it boring with the exception of the aforementioned aesthetics, makeup effects, Tim Curry's performance and Meg Mucklebones. Having read about a Director's Cut I was eager to revisit the film after not having seen it for probably 20 odd years to see if it could be redeemed as I felt it deserved to be.I found the 'Director's Cut' to be little more than 30 mins longer in length and the film as a whole to suffer the same problems I intuited as a kid; creepy and shallow characters, a deeply tedious and unheroic resolution to the crisis set out in the first act and a puzzling rehash of the Director's own work in his depiction of the antagonist's exit.Despite its scope and grandiosity of production, the film just feels small, as illustrated by Jack's 'quest' which consists of putting on some armor, crossing a swamp and fumbling around in the dark with some big trays. Despite Cruise's best efforts in his first scenes, Jack just flatlines as a character for the rest of the film, and the cataclysm proposed by the corruption of the Unicorns never seems to weigh that heavily on the rest of the film. Similarly the henchmen's threat (such as it was) with the underbite-Goblin and his pigfaced accomplice dissipates as Darkness himself is showboated for the last half hour.In spite of the prodigiousness of its personnel and their technical might, Legend is, ironically, an exhibition in the power of good storytelling - in that it is completely devoid of it. This film should be screened to aspiring screenwriters as a cautionary tale of how useless riches are in the hands of artisans without a heart to hold the work together. Despite the Director's Cut this sumptuous looking film has about as valid a claim to a 'soul' as Darkness himself does.",Legend

Besides that all the special effects and make up for this movie were outstanding specially for a 1985 movie!! The reason this is a great date movie is because some of the scenes scare you, but at the same time they help you and your date grow closer to each other because of the way love and purity are shown in all the scenes!! Most guys have to admit that they like taking girls to horror movies so they can protect them and girls like to take guys to sappy love stories, this movie has both combined its perfect!!

There are so many things inside this movie that all have their own special meaning. Tom Cruise played the innocent boy to perfection, while Tim Curry's awesome display of talent left me wondering which side I was really rooting for. I love the part with the dwarfs (is that what they were?) where the one was shot in the ""head"" with the arrow. It was quite comical. Does anyone know who the artist of ""Loved By The Sun"" is? I absolutely love the way that song makes me feel. I would suggest to anyone who will listen that they give this movie a chance, if not a space of honor in their DVD collection.",Legend

His accomplishment in bringing this entity to life is even more impressive considering how much makeup and costuming he labored under. Tom Cruise and Mia Sara are very believable in their roles as innocents in love.I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy fantasy and fable and don't require sex and excessive violence to be entertained.",Legend

I would have to say that my favorite people were the dwarfs . Brown Tom most of all . Oona was wonderfully played and beautiful in her own way .

This movie is actually not that well known despite the fact that this is a Ridley Scott film. The practical effects are stunning especially considering this movie was released in 1985! Nearly Thirty years after it's making I am still amazed with Tim Curry as Darkness. This film allows you to enter a magical world filled with Demons, Elves, Fairies and Unicorns and watch a short battle between good and evil. This film is easily enjoyed by the entire family and should be in everyone's library.

Tim Curry is excellent as the Lord of Darkness and is very frightening. My favourite character would have to be Blitz because of his great one liners. This is one of the greatest fantasy films and also a great romance. I usually hate romance but this has action,romance,horror,comedy which means there is an aspect of a lot of genres of film.

Then the darkness(acted by Tim curry who did an amazing performance in Muppet's treasure island) shows us how much he loves to act by doing a hilarious performance with two fat horns sticking out his head no-one could take him seriously! The slow mo run s unforgettable and him falling for the girl and letting her no it is hilarious!

261,winprice,Legend is one of my all time favorites,9,20 November 2010,"This was an incredible example of fantasy filmmaking from the 1980's. However, although I love both versions of this movie, neither of them got it just right. The first version cut so many important scenes, yet was still good. The director's cut had to do away with the original score, which still remains one of my all time favorites, with the flute and the ending song by Jon Anderson are what got me in the theater for this movie in the first place.I can't wait for the next cut that blends them together. I would like to see them both available on DVD though.If you haven't seen either version of this movie, you are really missing out on one of the great fantasy movies of all time.",Legend
262,pemh_77,Fantasy Masterpiece,9,3 August 2010,"Now, I know what you're thinking,""Isn't Legend the best fantasy movie ever made?"" The answer is damn skippy.Legend is part of my 80's fantasy holy trifecta; the other 2 movies being The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.Legend is about The Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) trying to create total darkness on earth (aka Goblin Paradise) so he can be all-powerful. In order to do this he must kill the 2 existing unicorns on the planet. Well, he doesn't necessarily have to kill the unicorns, rather remove their alicorns. It is up to the nature boy Jack (Tom Cruise), The Gump (a little German dude), 2 elves, and a sassy little fairy to stop him.That is the main plot of the movie, which I think is solid. It's the perfect fantasy formula. The sub-plot is about the relationship between Jack and Princess Lili (Mia Sara). She is a princess for those of you who refuse to acknowledge the director's cut. But we'll get back to that issue. To further the sub-plot, the Lord of Darkness is also after Lili, probably because she was the hottest princess in any movie ever made.This is 1 of 2 movies I like Tom Cruise in. His performance is fine. I think the movie makes him seem better than he actually is. Tim Curry was born to play the part of Darkness. I can't think of anyone better. Mia Sara was the second girl I fell in love with all because of this movie. She was great and really showed some range. She had to play sweet and innocent at the beginning of the film, frightened and confused in the middle, and dark and evil at the end. But my favorite performance of the whole film was Robert Picardo as Meg Mucklebones. Classic! The characters of this movie are rich and vibrant. This is in part due to the acting, but maybe even more so due to the atmosphere and f/x of the movie. The atmosphere is something that Ridley Scott excelled in during the 80's. The sets and cinematography are grand and really bring the viewer into that world.The special f/x of the 80's are my favorite kind, meaning no CGI. The makeup for Darkness, Blix, and Meg is some of the best ever. If this movie were made today (by people other than Jackson or del Toro) then those characters would have been completely CGI. The slime on Blix's face during the beginning while talking to Darkness, oh how it glistens! Now let's get down to business: Theatrical release versus Director's cut. This is my favorite part to talk about. If you're like me, you grew up with the American, Tangerine Dream, theatrical release. I fell in love with this movie. Although I've always thought the soundtrack seemed out of place. For the longest time I thought I was going crazy though. I remembered a scene from this movie from when I was young but wasn't in my theatrical release VHS when I was older. I remembered the Meg Mucklebones scene being longer than the one on my VHS. After years of research, the version of the movie I had originally seen was the PBS cut which is basically the theatrical version with a few extended scenes including the MM scene. I also found that there are 5 confirmed cuts in all.I was introduced to the director's cut in 2005. This version has extended scenes all over the place as well as just flat out new scenes. It also had re-edited versions some of the same scenes. The first time I watched this version I thought it was stupid and thought I never would watch it again. But I had to watch it again mainly because it has the extended Meg scene which is my favorite. After about 12 viewings, I find the Director's cut superior. The only thing I really don't like about it is Lili's singing scenes. While I miss the Tangerine Dream score, the Jerry Goldsmith score is much more appropriate for a fantasy film and adds to the ambiance. The Tangerine Dream score dates it. And we finally find out that Lili is a princess! This has always slightly confused me in the theatrical release. I new she was upper class but wasn't sure about her specific status. Also, on the bonus materials on the Ultimate Edition DVD, there are deleted scenes that I wish were included in the actual movie. Fun fact: There were actually 4 goblins at the beginning who were searching for the unicorns. We see how the 4th one dies as well as how Blunder gets his claw hand.The only real complaint I have about the movie is this: When the heroes enter the layer of Darkness, the goblins are no where to be found. They are literally never seen again in the movie. It would seem to me that they would be protecting the unicorn or the ""tree"" from intruders. I never have really understood what happened with them.Again, this movie is the best fantasy movie of all time; yes, even better than any of the Lord of the Rings movies. Comment if you disagree, I dare you. This is my second favorite Ridley Scott movie. Director's Cut: 9 out of 10. American Theatrical Version: 8 out of 10.",Legend
263,rben777,Jon Anderson Version,8,23 May 2006,"all the Versions are great. But I must say the version with Jon Aderson's song ""Loved By the Sun"" sung where Jack breaks through the water at the end Puts the "" cherry On Top"" and should have been the Theatrical Version, is Of course the Best of All. Will they ever make the DVD with Jon Anderson's Song? I play oblivion with that song playing over the games actual music because it relates to all fantasy genres. A film way ahead of it's time. It's an appropriate argument that if Tom cruise wasn't in it it would have fallen further down the flop rilm charts but I'm rhankful he took the role. Screwball played by Billy Barty and Tim Curry get The Best of show in my book what excellent Jobs they did of putting themselves in the world of ""Legend"" Don't remake this movie You'll fail.",Legend
264,nataleemarick,I was disappointed with the directors cut!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,7,20 February 2006,"There were several scenes deleted from ""Legend""(1985) that gave the goblins and other characters more detail into who they were and how they reacted to their environments and stressful stimuli. I CAN NOT believe that they cut the part where they cut the horn off of the unicorn and reattach it. Who cares if there is a hare in the way? And the fact that they show the removal of the horn on the music video is even worse. I have loved this movie since the first time it came out on TV. I feel as though I have been cheated due to unacceptable director cuts and now the children of today are missing out to. You have failed me. I have chosen this movie as my topic for my ""Film as Art"" paper. I am not looking forward to explaining to the class and my teacher that they can't see my favorite parts of the movie. I knew that this movie would be hard to find but I did not expect the original to be impossible:(",Legend
