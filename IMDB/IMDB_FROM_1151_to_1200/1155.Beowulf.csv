0,Leofwine_draca,Nice try,4,4 May 2021,"A futuristic sci-fi version of the classic Old English epic poem, BEOWULF is one of those movies that put a nail in the coffin of Christopher Lambert's action career. Here, the myopic star looks more cross-eyed than ever, sporting a white cropped hairstyle and moping around a garrison of beleagured troops as they battle an unseen assailant. As for Grendel, he can only be described as a disappointment, a mere PREDATOR riff with some cloaking CGI effects that haven't aged all that well. The film is quite clunky despite the okayish direction and allures of Rhona Mitra who holds her own against the guys. This story has never adapted well to the screen with the Gerard Butler version being the closest there is.",Beowulf
1,nogodnomasters,FEAR IS ALL I KNOW,5,12 April 2019,"For book purists, you will be happy to know this feature meticulously caters to every detail down to the martial arts fighting and black guy with glasses. Christopher Lambert plays the title role. He was able to deliver weapons at a terrific pace but unable to deliver a single line.The setting is unspecified northern pagan with fancy weapons which gave the film a ""Mad Max"" feel.. The soundtrack ranged from metal to dance music with an occasional western flute. The special effects were pretty good as were Layla Roberts' breasts as seen through a sheer gown (Playboy Miss September 1999).The B-Wulf man is unintentionally funny with his dry lines.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Sex. Sheer gown nudity.",Beowulf
2,CinemaSerf,"B.O Wolf - ""do your loins burn for me?""",4,23 October 2021,"What could have possessed the ""Highlander"" himself to participate in this nonsense? Based (very) loosely on the old poem, this tries to modernise the story (it even features tannoy speakers) and give it a contemporary feel - though still using the costumes and weapons of the original time. Our eponymous hero rescues a maiden then takes refuge with Oliver Cotton's ""Hrothgar"" in his fortress - only for them all to be attacked and brutally picked off by the shape-shifting ""Grendel"" - a sort of ""Puff"" the magic dragon type effect with a gravelly voice.... The production and visuals aren't the worst, but the very heavily made-up Lambert - sporting a peroxide coiffure, and the terribly wooden Rhona Mitra (""Kyra"") ensure that this film positively groans as it lumbers along. The soundtrack appears to have found a mind of it's own - and what dialogue there is adds virtually nothing to the ""we all do what we have to do"" style storyline. Whatever you do, stick around for the end - it's hilarious! This film is a shocking waste of good source material that really isn't anyone's finest work.",Beowulf
3,dbborroughs,After a good start this film wanders off in to boredom,4,16 September 2007,"This will be brief because there isn't much to say...Post Apocalyptic retelling of the story stars Christopher Lambert as our hero. Good but low budget action sequence of Lambert rescuing a maiden from a mob opens the film and if you take it for what it is its not bad. The movie soon moves into a castle fortress where any action- mostly coming from interpersonal conflicts- winds down and we have a very talky increasingly dull film.I know that this film is hated by many people and after watching it on Monster the other day I can understand why. The film, after a reasonably beginning just falls off the table (hell its so memorable that I had to see a reference to the new version to remember I saw this old one). The good will of the first half hour is lost by the end of the second and odds are after that you'll be turning this off to find something else. To be honest I got an hour plus into this thing and found I had turned the channel to see what else was on. When I realized that I wanted to see how it ended I found that I had turned back after the movie had ended. Clearly not a ringing endorsement.At best a movie to have on in the background. At worst a snoozer",Beowulf
4,zardoz-13,Not Bad For Its Type!!!,7,7 September 2013,"Before he directed ""Alien Nation"" with James Caan, Graham Baker helmed the first feature-length film about the legendary Danish warrior of antiquity named Beowulf. Appropriately entitled ""Beowulf,"" this estimated $3.5 million medieval fantasy adventure set in the distant but undetermined future after a presumed apocalypse generates an adequate amount suspense and action. People who have perused the poem and passionate about it will probably revile this actioneer with a techno-musical soundtrack. Audiences that don't care about liberties being taken with venerable literary material may have a greater appreciation for this low-brow but entertaining spin on the classic. Nothing in the way of modern conveniences remains, and everybody dresses in leather or lace as if they lived in the 8th century. Basically, you've got ""Mad Max"" clashing with ""Excalibur."" The weapons reflect the influence of an advanced society, and Hrothgar's unique castle is eye-catching. Leading man Christopher Lambert of the ""Highlander"" franchise appears on horseback with a peroxide blond coiffure. He is a warrior who knows a thing or two about combat. Cast as the eponymous hero, Lambert benefits from a memorable entrance into the action. He rides up to a perimeter established by an opposing kingdom as these brutes are about to cut a poor woman in two pieces. The site of a giant chopping table with a huge straight-razor poised over it gives you some idea what to expect from this swashbuckler. Lambert plays the pugnacious hero with his usual taciturnity and gimlet-eyed expressions. Surely, somebody stunted for Lambert because I don't for a moment believe that he could execute all those elaborate back-flips. After he slays a score of warriors, Beowulf convinces the opposition to release the poor girl who fled from the castle allow him passage so he can visit King Hrothgar (Oliver Cotton of ""Firefox"") and help him with his monstrous problem. Hrothgar's daughter Kyra (Rhona Mitra of ""Underworld 3"") looks pretty fetching in those tight outfits. As Grendal's mother, Layla Roberts is just as seductive and her transformation scene during the finale is worth checking out. Future ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" Bond villain Götz Otto plays the stalwart Roland who wields a big sword. A monster prowls 'the Outpost' as Hrothgar calls his castle. Lurid sex works its way into the Mark Leahy & David Chappe screenplay as Grendal's mom appears initially as a succubus to King. Beowulf behaves like a bittersweet hero and rejects Kyra's initial passes. The film replicates events that occurred in the ancient poem. Grendal's severed arm hanging from the ceiling is one such example. Leahy and Chappe depict the demise of Grendel's son and death of his mother, but they didn't have enough dough to depict the encounter with the dragons. I don't think that I have ever seen anybody shove a sword into their victim and twist it with the hilt. ""Beowulf"" cannot compare with later versions of the Anglo-Saxon poem, but it is superior to the usual run of this stuff.",Beowulf
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Slick and enjoyable,7,24 October 2011,"An outpost is continually attacked at night by a beast known as Grendel. One day, Beowulf, a mysterious stranger, shows up and claims he will slay it. That's about it for the similarity to the original poem, by the way. This is set in a post-apocalyptic age, or a revisionist history version of the medieval times(I think the specific term is Steampunk). It is an awesome flick, pure B-movie goodness, and it isn't particularly aspiring to be anything more than that. If that isn't appealing to you, this wasn't made for you. On the production side, it has a nice look to it, with great lighting, distinct designs(those weapons are nifty! And not just the morphy ones that the titular hero produces a seemingly endless supply of... add to that the creature stuff) and genuine atmosphere(in spite of a kickass soundtrack consisting of a mix of rock and techno). It's well-paced and does not overstay its welcome(this is about 83 minutes before the credits... and on that note, guess what the opening titles of this is? Essentially those of Mortal Kombat of '95, they just swapped the text, the iconic background, and put lightning where there used to be fire). The action is great, if it can feel like it's cutting to a stunt double some(and man, is Lambert proud of his ability to do backflips... he does them as much as he possibly can in this), the choreography is well-done and it's exciting. This also gets genuine tension going, and is scary at points. The badassery is through the roof, especially with Christopher, but really, nearly all the males in this are testosterone-fueled stereotypes spouting ridiculous one-liners. The female lead is Rhona Mitra's cleavage, and one can clearly tell why her breasts were cast(I'm not kidding, she shows them every single time she faces the camera in this... in her sheer outfit, she wears the most clothes out of any of the women in this, which is ""hardly any""). For the villain, we have a succubus portrayed by a Playmate who looks and behaves exactly like what her day job is(makes sense, no?). The practical FX are well-done, the CGI is reasonable for the time. For both, they don't rely on it excessively, rather they cut back and forth like before cinema could simply stay on a computer-generated visual, and with the anticipated effect - there is build-up to the monster. There is a bunch of strong, bloody, gory violence, disturbing content, nudity and direct sexuality. I recommend this to any fan of cool, dumb, fun entertainment. 7/10",Beowulf
6,Movie Nuttball,An entertaining film!,8,22 July 2005,"Beowulf is a fair film that has a good cast including Christopher Lambert, Rhona Mitra, Oliver Cotton, Götz Otto, Vincent Hammond, Charles Robinson, Brent Jefferson Lowe, Roger Sloman, Layla Roberts, Robert Willox, Patricia Velasquez, Marcello Cobzarju, Vlad Jipa, and Diana Dumbrava. The acting by all of these actors is very good. The thrills is really good until the nudity and sex scenes appear then it takes away all of the excitement seen previously. The movie is filmed very good. The music is good. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end if there wasn't the sex scene then this would have been a very excellent film. If you like Christopher Lambert, Rhona Mitra, Oliver Cotton, Patricia Velasquez, the rest of the cast in the film, Horror, Action, Sci-Fi, Thrillers, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!",Beowulf
7,Tweetienator,There Can Be Only One,6,23 April 2018,"A nice little movie - the Grendel & Beowulf saga embedded in a post-apocalyptic world. As the fearless warrior we get Christopher Lambert who fights against Grendel the beast, who kills after dark one after another the knights of a besieged castle. Inside the castle the killing beast and outside an army who stands at guard to kill everybody who wants to leave the fortress. This is what I call a good B-trash movie. Reminds me a little of the 3rd Evil Dead movie Army of Darkness - but with far less humor.Again, there can be only one - Grendel or Beowulf!",Beowulf
8,Anonymous_Maxine,"Boring, clichéd story that is clumsily presented in a film plagued by botched direction, awful editing, and goofy acting.",4,6 May 2001,"Beowulf provides a perfect example of why actors should never alter their voices in films, at in a way in which they seem to be trying to make themselves sound like toughened warriors, or at least make themselves sound like they're pissed off all the time. Christopher Lambert's first line in this film (`Let her go.') is delivered in this way, and it's actually pretty effective. He sounds intimidating, and he even makes you glad that you are not one of the people that he is talking to. Unfortunately, he never stops talking like this, and it makes the rest of the movie ridiculous. This is exactly the same way that Wesley Snipes ruined Blade.Besides the awful special effects and the groan inducing performances delivered by everyone involved, Beowulf even sinks to the level of semi erotica, with several misplaced 'almost'-nude scenes that just should not have been in this movie. This is just your basic good vs. evil mediocre adventure film that leaves a bad taste. Very disappointing.",Beowulf
9,sauravjoshi85,A Waste of time,2,5 September 2020,"Beowulf is a Sci-Fi action movie directed by Graham Baker and stars Christopher Lambert, Rhona Mitra and Oliver Cotton.This is undoubtedly one of the bad movies of Lambert and it's a pain to watch. The length of the movie is 1 hour and 35 minutes but the screenplay is so bad that you will feel that you are watching a movie marathon.Acting is poor to average and direction is below average, VFX of the movie is bad and climax is predictable and doesn't excites much. The movie is best avoided and please avoid even if you are a fan of Sci-Fi action movies.",Beowulf
10,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Kickass version of the myth!!,8,18 July 2016,"There are three main films concerning the myth of Beowulf. The best, a wickedly good Robert Zemeckis motion capture version starring Ray Winstone, a lower budget one with Gerard Butler that hovers right around the average mark, and a third one starring Christopher 'Highlander' Lambert, and let me tell you this one defies any classification. It's set in a time that seems like a blend between both past and future, a sword and sorcery realm that's speckled with steam punk technology and very weird production design that looks post modern, yet not. Beowulf, played by the reliably daffy Lambert (an actor of little talent who has grown on me over the years by his craggy presence alone), is a lone warrior with a bleach blond hair dye job and some neato gadgetry in his weapon arsenal. I know, it sounds like I'm making this up. Haven't even gotten to the best part yet, which is the upbeat German techno score that ramps up the Euro feel of the whole thing to soaring heights of absurdity. Despite all that silliness, the film somehow works, and not just as a schlocky write off either. It's resolve lies dutifully in the firmament of its creative aesthetic, and doesn't skip a single odd duck of a beat the whole way. The monster Grendel which Beowulf must face off against resembles something of a cross between the Predator and Killer Croc, a scaly, spiky behemoth that rips through the little villages in the region like a tornado of teeth and claws. It's mother is even weirder: appearing to men in the form of actress Layla Roberts, (who looks suspiciously like a porn star) before morphing into a massive elaborate demon thingy that looks like a final boss from Starfox. Lambert is joined in his fight by sexy warrior Kyra (Rhona Mitra), and led on by King Hrothgar (Oliver Cotton). It's Beowulf like you've never seen before, a Krull esque, beyond the Stars sci-fi rendition that you'll either be in tune with or won't, either love, hate or just be super confused by. It's bonkers, and I love it.",Beowulf
11,Vomitron_G,"Come on, people, dance, not fight!",4,4 December 2005,"The future of fantasy never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert gets to fight the evil demon Grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy-epos. ""Epos"" I said? Er... there's only one location, so you can't really call it an epic adventure, can you? The location is a medieval/futuristic 5 inch tall castle, so how did they manage to cram in all the actors? Oh, I get it, those where special effects. A miniature. Silly me.Here's some reasons why you might want or NOT want to watch this motion picture:Lambert gets to do his sword-swinging tricks over again like he did in Highlander.The sets and costumes are amazingly cool (if you're a 12-year-old).Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of knockers which she likes to show off through-out the whole movie....er, Christopher Lambert has white hair...Every time they start fighting, this over-the-top raving techno-soundtrack gets going. So why are these medieval slayer-dudes fighting while they should be dancing.They don't have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed which seem to work fine. So where's the amplifier? I guess they borrowed it from the techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack.Watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous demonoïd CGI creature coming straight out of any Playstation 2 survival-horror game.If all this got you interested, then go watch it (at your own risk), but don't tell anyone I told you to. I strongly suspect Pinhead visiting the set while shooting, because this movie has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin, then watch Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.",Beowulf
12,TheUnknown837-1,very likely the worst of the always disappointing Beowulf adaptations,1,12 May 2009,"Why is it, I have asked myself so many times, that the earliest piece of Anglo-Saxon literature known to man—the epic poem of Beowulf, whose author remains unknown—has been given the poorest of treatment over and over again when somebody decided to bring it to the screen. I have seen three separate adaptations of Beowulf, two low-budget productions and one big-budget adaptation that all, unfortunately, proved to be nothing more than travesties and unasked-for disasters. And this 1999 film is not only very unfaithful to the original poem, but very likely the worst of the seemingly always-disappointing Beowulf adaptations.The basic plot is still the same as in the poem, but the way it's worked out in the screenplay is alien. A monster-fighting hero named Beowulf (Christopher Lambert) answers a kingdom's cry to fight an evil creature called Grendel (Charles Robinson) and the monster's vengeful, humanlike mother. To state a fact, I'm not a purist. I was frankly not expecting a faithful adaptation. If I got one, I'd be surprised. But I was certainly hoping for something that I could at least recommend as passable. I didn't get it.""Beowulf"" is a clunky, poorly-put-together disaster of a motion picture that boasts nothing, for there is nothing to boast. The acting, even that by Christopher Lambert, an always interesting actor, was unqualified and poor, to be charitable. The cinematography was very dark and gloomy and at times, especially during the special effects sequences, it was hard to tell exactly what was going on (big surprise). Basically, it's a gloomy-looking movie and a very gloomy-feeling movie as well. It's dark, slow, ponderous, uninteresting, and overall a waste of time. And sometimes it seems as though the film's not sure what it's supposed to be. Is it suppose to be an epic? A monster film? A poignant story? Or some clunky love story with out of place sex sequences? And the special effects? Don't even get me started on the special effects. They were awful, let's put it that way, especially in regards to Grendel's mother.But as poor as all of this way, I would have gladly taken it as opposed to these verbose and unnecessary monologues and subplots that seem to twist up and control the movie. Sometimes it's almost as if the screenwriter forgot about the main purpose of the plot. Full of bad dialogue, poor special effects, a lack of vibrant colors, and no interesting moments, ""Beowulf"" is a disappointment of the lowest category. The great poem has yet to be done justice on screen. This is one of the reasons why.",Beowulf
13,PatrynXX,Loved this movie!!!!,6,29 March 2001,"Sure it's a B movie.  Sure the logo ripped off Mortal Kombat.  But fusing techno to a medieval type movie, what wonderful minds they've got. Lovely weapons.  Lot's of action.  (perhaps needed a little more nudity) But was a great movie overall.  Definatly in my list of to buy DVD's. 6/10",Beowulf
14,mentalcritic,This is why you never hire drug addicts to edit films...,1,25 June 2004,"The mind still boggles as to what motivated Dimension Films to produce this script. Perhaps they sensed that with no successes under their belt for the year, their taxation would wipe them out. Producing tax write-offs has been a time-honoured business strategy for entertainers, electronics manufacturers, and working joes alike. And if there is one thing that this production of Beowulf has written all over it, it is ""tax write-off"".I won't get into the literary origins of the story or how faithful the film is to the source material. Instead, I will delve into why it fails as a stand-alone tale. This is partly because I have never read the real Beowulf, but it is mostly because this film, even if it didn't share a title with one of the greatest pieces of ancient literature known to man, would disappoint on every level.Christopher Lambert, as usual, is utterly terrible in his delivery. Every line he delivers is so deadpan and rotten that one wonders if he isn't embarassed that this is what his career has been reduced to. His ability to emote is non-existent. To put a fine point on it, he makes the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger look like the likes of Russell Crowe. Yet, up to a point, he always managed to land a job in some kind of teenie action film despite this.Where it all goes wrong is the editing. I don't know why the director liked the footage of Lambert doing backflips so much that he had to repeat it about three thousand times, but he did. People who didn't think it was possible to make a boring fight scene before The Matrix Rehashed would do well to look at Beowulf. Boring fight scenes have been around for a long time, but this is by far one of the worst examples. At most points, it's not only unclear who is winning, or why we should care, but it is also often unclear who is doing what to whom, or who is even in the fight.The style of modern appliances in a medieval setting had the potential to work, but it is ultimately wasted upon a script that not only makes a lot of potential writers wonder why they can't get a break, it also utterly fails to capitalise on any of the unique settings. The mixture of the modern and medieval serves absolutely no purpose in the story. Speaking of the story, for a film that so utterly scarred my brain, it is a telling sign that I can hardly remember any of it.All in all, I gave Beowulf a one. I'd give it a minus three, but the IMDB doesn't support that. If you're looking for a goofy, badly-made film to laugh at, this is not the one. It is not so bad it is good. It is so bad it's disgusting.",Beowulf
15,stamper,Plain BAAAAAAAD!!!,1,24 February 2002,"There are a lot of things wrong with this film. First of all, it does not exactly follow the story of Beowulf as it was told in the poem of the same name, written by: anonymous. Second of all, there were a lot of bad or lousy things. The effects sucked, the music was not good, the directing was not good (making it like a Mortal Kombat film), the film was VERY predictable and so on and so on. Talking about dumb things: black people that do not work as slaves, men with earrings, plastic body bags with zippers, a megaphone,  pretty see through dresses and modern boots. There are only two things fairly good in this film. The first what are you?' scene with Lambert and Rhona Mitra (Kyra) and Layla Roberts character and acting. She was  convincing. VVVery sexy and erotic. Just as she was meant to be by the script. The only one who seemed to understand her job. The 1st scene scene gets half a point, the blonde (Layla Roberts) a whole one.

16,jessegehrig,See me feel me touch me heal me,1,10 April 2021,"Do you ever wonder who Christopher Lambert is? Y'know, like what's going on with him? IMDb says he was born in America, but if that's the case, where did he get his stupid accent from? Beowulf features in addition to Chris's stupid accent, stupid weapons as well as stupid acting and stupid sets. Depending upon how you see the movie, on cable or on basic TV, or on DVD, there will be nudity, unless you see it on basic TV. Nudity is naked people's sex parts, see when naked people touch sex parts sometimes movies are made, directly but also indirectly.",Beowulf
17,HaemovoreRex,"Clichéd, poorly scripted, badly acted but nonetheless fun",6,1 November 2007,"The opening title sequence in this (an almost carbon copy of the Mortal Kombat intro) is pretty much indicative of exactly what to expect from the rest of this flick. Sure enough, here is a highly derivative story (based upon the epic historical poem) involving lots of sword play, a seemingly indestructible beastie and plenty of heaving cleavage on displayand that in a nutshell sums up the film.In fact, there really isn't much more to say about this unremarkable sci-fi entry although make no mistake, as long as you don't expect too much from it, then it may well provide some fair enjoyment.I say unremarkable, but to be equitable there are one or two factors which lift it above the norm. For instance, the setting in this is indeed intriguing; it may or may not be on earth although the time frame is presumably in the future, after some sort of apocalypse perhaps for here we have a visually lavish fusing of the medieval with the futuristic. Also of note are the rather spectacular array of weapons that are employed throughout the movie; again, representative of a fusing of historical and the futuristic.Script wise this really has to be said to be scraping the very bottom of the barrel but if you can overlook this factor and a few decidedly dodgy performances and enjoy the film for what it is i.e. an action fantasy, then this may well serve as an entirely harmless time filler.",Beowulf
18,BigGuy,Christopher Lambert should have quit after Highlander,2,8 January 2001,"I don't know why I rented this movie...  Well, it did sound like a cool idea, kind of.  But it came off as flat.  Too much mood for mood's sake. The entire story could have been compressed into maybe 45 minutes.Now I have never read the poem, so I can't comment on how accurate it is, but there was Grendel and Beowulf and fighting between them.  Although the fighting often looking like a stunt double of Beowulf, as I can't imagine that Christopher Lambert can do back handsprings all over the place.Actually the scene were Beowulf appears is alright.  Nothing great, or worth seeing this movie for, but alright.  Except what was with the really big straight razor?  Someone should have told them how silly it looked.One last thing...  The mix of hi-tech gadgets with medieval weapons and armour is ludicrous.  Maybe one in fifty times that this is attempted it seems possible.  Maybe one in ten times does it not totally detract from the story.  This movie played the odds and was both improbable and detracting from the story.",Beowulf
19,KoolCatReviews,Oddly enjoyable and very wacky,5,17 September 2021,"In many ways, this is a hidden gem. If you can see past some bad acting and bad screenplay. This is a late 90's film that really fancies itself as an 80's flick. The use of synth music is the bizarre and post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It all meshes together to make a slightly odd film. A fun action romp with a lot 80's vibes. You should only watch if your a big fan of B list movies.",Beowulf
20,Mickey Knox,below expectations,4,28 December 2000,"I've heard many things about Beowulf, maybe because i'm from Romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here, in my country. And i expected a lot from this film. At the end, i was disappointed. It is not as horrible as other users said, but it's definetely bad. It's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and Lambert the one who comes to kill him. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters suck, and the action isn't too good either. Plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film, the special effects, are also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary, but awful). Oh and another bad thing: the music. The movie tries, and manages to create the 6th century atmosphere. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very very bad. I mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where that's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here, that was a very bad idea.Vote: 4 out of 10.",Beowulf
21,Vincent_B,The Mortal Kombat Version,2,13 October 2009,"This movie has nothing to do with the epic Nordic tale of Beowulf and even less about making good movies. The tale is some kind of hash tossed together with a steampunk sci-fi plot using the names and plot frame from the Beowulf tale. It not only rips bits and pieces from movies like ""Highlander"" and ""Mortal Kombat"" but stars Christopher Lambert from both those movies. It was like they wrote parts of the movie after they casted the role of Beowulf. I can almost hear the producer telling the writer, ""Hey, we scored Christopher Lambert for the lead. Write in some Mortal Kombat and Highlander lines and clichés!"". Ugh, not that it helped or hurt this stinker which I only give 2 stars for Grendel's Mom. Who is basically a babe from Bay Watch and Playboy. This is a good guy movie or something stupid to toss on during a party and you know everyone is going to ignore it.",Beowulf
22,asinyne,Pretty original and lots of fun,8,8 November 2008,"I really don't understand why people are bashing this movie. Hey, its no Citizen Kane (thank god) but I felt entertained pretty much all the way through with the possible exception of a few scenes. There were lots of action, the stunts, fighting, sets, and special effects were all done at a very high level. To me this was no B movie. The production and look of the film were first rate. Christopher Lambert probably isn't my first choice in leading men but he did his part well. The monsters looked cool and the babes were definitely juicy. I especially enjoyed the opening scenes when Beowulf rescued a girl from execution (with lots of nifty fighting) only to discover she had rather be dead than re-enter the fortress where Grendel was hanging out. Was the movie true to the poem...who cares? One of the best things about the film was the fact that it wasn't exactly like anything else out there. I can appreciate that. The cast wasn't the greatest but I still enjoyed myself. I you are reading this and you like fantasy, sword and sorcery, or even Tolkein type stuff I recommend this to you. Pay no attention to the low rating, all that tells me is that a lot of people seem to expect everything coming out of Hollywood to be art and that is the last thing Hollywood is about. It's about entertainment and thrills and Beowulf definitely delivers.",Beowulf
23,Tin Man-5,"Superior entertainment, and as faithful to the poem as it could have been.",10,18 October 2000,"`Beowulf' is a theatrical release that went straight-to-video in the United States because of some complications involving distributing. It was picked up by Mirimax around the same time `The 13th Warrior,' the other recent interpretation of the classic poem, went to theaters. Because that film was a flop both critically and financially, Mirimax played it safe and skipped the theatrical release for this, dumping it straight into a Blockbuster near you.Reactions from this version have varied. People have tended to either like it a lot or hate it with passion. There is good reason for this. `Beowulf' is one of the great works of the English language, and it has been studied by both literary scholars and adventure lovers for centuries. It inspired such classic fantasy works as the Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons, and it has and will be reviewed by every English class that ever had, does, or will exist. Because of the difficulty to convert the original poem into a film, a lot of changes have been made, to the anger of a lot of literary purists. For one, the location has been changed to a techno, midievel future, and the great Hall of Herot has been converted to a battle-outpost, where technology has taken a step backwards. Only a few traces of a superior technology exists, such as night vision and methane-run torches, and everything else has been reduced to a typical sword and cross-bow environment, combined with outrageous-looking primal weapons. In other words, we've got Mad Max meets Dragon Slayer. So now, Hrothgar is the leader of the Outpost, and he's got a beautiful daughter named Kyra who's got a deadly secret. Unferth has also had his name changed to Roland for no apparent reason. Some subplots have been added which discuss Hrothgar's relationship with Grendel and his mother, and Kyra's relationship with Roland.The most dynamic change, however, is in the character of Beowulf himself. No longer is he a happy-go-lucky, adventurous fighter for good, but a dark, depressed man who is a little more than mortal. The son of a demon and a woman, he wanders the earth looking for evil. `The only way I can stop from becoming evil is if I fight evil,' he says, and thus is his explanation for coming to this outpost and fighting the evil darkness called Grendel, an evil creature who is terrorizing the place every night by killing all of the guards. Beowulf, sort of like an anti-Hercules, has fast healing power and is decked out with all sorts of cool weaponry. He's got short, bleached hair and he's dressed in Matrix-style leather, and he's a lot more dark and weary than the Beowulf of the epic poem.Such changes are making a lot of Beowulf fans enraged. I am a fan of the original Beowulf poem as well and have been studying it for years, and I can say that the changes didn't bother me. I applaud them, in fact, in their effort to make the story more applicable to the high school/college students who will be studying the ancient work. These changes don't improve the story, but they don't take away from it, either. Any student who might not be interested in studying the text might pick this up and like it, and their interest in the original source will increase. The changes work mostly due to the fact that it film still keeps the whole of the story intact, and it takes it very seriously. Purists need to realize that it would be nearly impossible to make a film about `Beowulf' and keep it 100% true to the original poem. Changes HAVE to be made due to the complexity of the work, and these changes work very nicely.The film as a whole plays like an extended episode of `Xena: Warrior Princess' with a  larger budget, meaning it is dark and brooding when it needs to be, and campy and action-packed with its tongue stuck firmly in its cheek in other places. This style works. While `The 13th Warrior' might have been superior to this visually, this film far surpasses it in capturing the essence of what the poem was all about: A battle with a supernatural foe. The original work was made to entertain and to fill the listener with a sense of wonder, and this film does just that, thanks to a good cast (mostly) and some well-shot action sequences that are both over the top and subdued, depending which is necessary. The setting was also well thought out by the producers. While `The 13th Warrior' used with open spaces, this `Beowulf' captures the clausterphobic feel of the poem, with mostly interior shots of this run down outpost where most of the action takes place. The techno music also works, giving a video-game feel to it in many spots, which is fine because of the video game potential the whole story has (besides, if they had video games in 900 A.D., around when the poem was written, they would have been about Beowulf!).The monsters also work. Grendel is a fish-like monster in the tradition of Predator, with a mist surrounding him at all times. It's replicated straight from the poem, and the Witchmother is also a powerhouse of special effects, who is a combination of Grendel's Mother and the Fire Dragon from the poem (whose scenes are missing due to plot restraints).Christopher Lambert is surprisingly good as Beowulf, playing the part subtly and without overacting. Like in the book, he is a man of few words, just wanting to fight and get the job over with. Though the motives are different: The Beowulf of the poem lives for the fight. This Beowulf simply wants to overcome the evil within in. While I don't think Lambert would work in a literal, literary version of  `Beowulf' (he would have to be a large, brawling person, like Vin Deisel or Russell Crowe), he does fine here, as a hero torn between his lust for evil and his desire to fight it. He's got just the right tone, and his eyes speak multitudes. His understanding of this kind of Beowulf is right on target, and he holds the film together and plays the straight man when the fights get outrageously fun (`I've been waiting for you. Our evil has drawn us together. I'm like you. I'm one of the damned,' he tells an attacking Grendel in the film's best scene action scene, which takes place in the flooded cellar.) . The rest of the cast is effective as well, especially Gotz Otto as Roland (Unferth), who manages to evoke both sympathy and power in a satisfactory performance.All this said, however, there could have been a few changes made. The actress playing the Witchmother is horrible. While the character is complex and she's got some great and very important lines, it is clear that she was cast in the role for her figure only (They probably told her, `You just strut what you've got. We'll teach you how to act.'). Every line she says she ruins, and it is only the rest of the excellent cast which manage to keep the scenes featuring her less-than-adequate.   The ending is also a disappointing, as many of the characters simply cop-out and the resolution never has time to sink in after a spectacular final battle.Nevertheless, this is an excellent version of the epic poem, both fun and thought-provoking. Students be warned though, if you're studying the text at school, this is not a substitute for it. It is, however, a good companion piece for it, and whether you've read it or not, you will find it extremely enjoyable.*** out of ****",Beowulf
24,jake-179,Horrible.,1,9 December 2000,"This movie was truly horrible.  Too bad.  REALLY too bad.  The original story of Beowulf is a classic.  A GREAT adventure story about terrible monsters and great heroics and leadership.  I have been a big fan of the story since I was a kid when I read Michael Chriton's ""EATERS OF THE DEAD,""and I dreamed of making movies.  And I always hoped that some ambitious director would someday make the story of BEOWULF into a great movie.  Needless to say, I was excited when ""THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR"" came out.  And, needless to say, I was terribly disappointed.  So when I heard they were making a futuristic sci-fi adaptation of the story, my hopes were renewed.  But ""BEOWULF"" is even worse than ""THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR.""  They had good set design and good costuming.  When the movie first started I thought, ""Hey, this might not be so bad.""  But after the first few scenes, I realized that the mark had been missed once again.  This movie was not only a disappointment, it was embarrassing to watch!  I felt embarrassed for Christopher Lambert.  He was great in ""HighLander.""  Well, now that I think of it, thats the only decent movie the man has ever made.  I thought the movie director would at least have some decent fight scenes.  But instead, he chose to get a gymnast to stand in for Christopher Lambert and bounce around all over the place.  Why is it that when the hero needs to back away from his attacker they always end up just doing back handsprings?  Why not just back up?  Wouldn't that save a lot of energy and make a lot more sense? Gymnastics are fun to watch, but they do NOT substitute for well choreographed fight scenes.  If you are a director and you are thinking of going that route with your movie, CONTACT ME.  I will come choreograph your fight scenes for you.This movie is horrible.  I tried to watch it.  I tried to give it a chance. But it was just terrible.  I was barely able to stay with it to the end.  I say, avoid this movie!",Beowulf

27,Austin_Powers-1,Evil gathers...,5,12 September 2007,"The film with Christopher Lambert as Beowulf is even a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film. So I'm going to place myself between those two, just for being opposing. But the truth is that I actually enjoyed the film for what it was. Christopher Lambert has never been a favourite actor of mine, mostly because of his trying-to-be-cool look, which I never have been able to take serious. And his role as Beowulf is not helping on my opinion about this, and he even has white hair...'Beowulf' is based on the ancient legend by the same name, which is about the hero Beowulf coming to the land of Danes (Yahoo!) to fight evil. It is written in ancient English in the year 1.100, and now comes the movie.So, if you are able to summon lot of bad acting, smart action, bad one-liners, distorted rock music and cheesy special effects, you have an action movie - with Chrisopher Lambert. But 'Beowulf' ends up being a mostly enjoyable film anyway ,looking very 80'-ish and having a lot of unintentionally funny moments.This film is, if anything, perfect at a DVD night with the guys.",Beowulf

Enough about him, onto the movie...Well, here's another case of taking a great idea, such as the Anglo-Saxon epic of the same namesake, and destroying it utterly. The plot was ridiculous. It resembled almost nothing of the epic poem, minus the names of a few people. The monsters were poorly done. Adding that whole ""motion-sickness"" feel to them was funny at best.

34,angry127,Classical Masterpiece of Enigmatic Proportions,9,5 January 2006,When reviewing films that rile the mind one must hearken back to the works of Tocquesville. This film borrows from the distinctive and urgent causes set forth by the originating story of the time beforehand. There is a point during the movie in which Christopher Lambert engages in battle; sword fastened and balls split apart. The veins of Christopher Lamber pump large fluids into the internal organs of Mr. Lambert. I was pleased to see the circulatory system work correctly in this individual. This film is not just a masterpiece but one so good I could not give it 10/10 stars. When viewing a work of art with the adrenaline pumping music of the Nordic time the star disregarded represents a large degree of appreciation for the love and admiration professed by such amazing people of the washed up Hollywood disaster. Set your mind free indulge the Beowulf and be fulfilled.,Beowulf
35,captaincameron,Mind numbingly bad,3,12 January 2014,"I try not to include spoilers, but always check the ""spoiler"" box in case I slip up. While this might be considered a spoiler, the only thing that they didn't really %^&* up in this movie was giving Rhona Mitra a penis. And there may be a director's cut out there where they have done that. I like Christopher Lambert. He's hardly Olivier, but his movies are generally good quality B flicks. Nope, not this one. Basically we've died Connor McLeod's hair white and given him a seemingly unlimited number of hand-held crossbows and a few other weapons, including what appears to be a sword that throws the wheels from a 1970's Spirograph. And there was eye candy--Rhona Mitra, always gorgeous, bounced around in a push-up bra and shoulder-less shirt quite often, and Grendel's mother was smoking hot. But Lambert and the ladies could not save this. The supporting acting is awful. The castle that has no electricity but somehow has a speaker system is confusing. The soundtrack could have gone the techno route or could have gone the sixth century sword and sorcery movie route. Instead, they tried to do both. It's not the worst movie out there, and if it is one and I am too drunk to figure out how to use the remote control, I'll watch it again, but I can't really recommend it too highly.",Beowulf
36,Calios,"Had the material to be good, but not the writing or the intention",5,8 December 2000,"This is a sad statement about Hollywoodizing a good story. Christopher Lambert and Rhona Mitra did fine jobs with the sorry script (could see that they could hardly keep a straight face when leading up to the big non-sex scene). Rhona makes any movie worth watching as her presence (sad character outcome though) made ""Hallow Man"" better than it would have been without her. The dialog seemed forced and not natural, at one point kind of preachy and just plain inappropriate.The script had so many holes that it would sink quicker than the Titanic pointing down. I even considered stopping or fast-forwarding through parts. What's bad is, I could have wrote a better script and with the same actors minus the techno-stuff made it seem really like an 8th century epic.This story is begging for a good movie and wouldn't be hard to do. Grendel in the movie was done pretty close to what I imagined, but beyond that nothing else was. Gee, I thought for a second that this was going to be ""The Predator"" in retrospective, being that alien (same approach to battle and even physically similar) and it's mum marooned on Earth, or something like that.Still wondering if that was Ray Park doing the stunts for Christopher Lambert, but he's not mentioned in the credits... and maybe that's the way he wants it.Advise, don't watch if you want to see a visual translation of the classic poem, but check out if you like gore, violence, techno music and a two very strong sexy women showing cleavage.",Beowulf

Chis Lambert arrives at a castle under siege and the back-flipping fight scenes begin. Back-flips seem to be a here-to-fore unknown secret weapon in fantasy/Sci-Fi swordplay.  There is a taste of suspense, kinda borrow from Alien in that we don't see the Beast(Grendel) that Beowolf is to fight for most of the film(it's kinda sorta invisible) and there's some sexual tension between the princess and Beowolf. There are weird half broken futuristic weapons (chainsaw swords?), but it really boils down old fashioned kicking butt.  The payoff special effects at the end of the movie just aren't up to standard and it takes a lot to ruin a story that is over a 1000 years old.  Lambert seems like a perfect casting for the part at first, but you can't help but wonder when the highlander storyline is going to kick-in for real. He looks kinda like Ted Danson with the grey cropped hair and the gravely voice he uses gets tiresome after a while.  In the end, you're left to wonder whether things would have been better off for village if he had never shown up.

When I saw the monster I was really sure.Then comes the fight. That big razor has got to be the worst idea for execution ever. The dialogs were void, and Beowulf is really the medieval Snake Plissken(Escape from NY), with his clothes and that ""I don't care, I'm a cold survivalist warrior, but I'll save the day anyway"" attitude. He had TWO (John Woo) multiple-shot crossbows and many gadgets on his pocket. His trenchcoat, samurai-like sword and martial-arts moves are totally anachronic. When I saw the castle and the other people, I thought: ""Is this a post-nuclear middle-age?"". I couldn't check, because I turned the TV off then. That was really enough and life is short enough.If you want to know something from real Beowulf, though not accurate, watch ""The 13th Warrior"".

This movie was hilarious because it couldn't decide what it was and mixed modern with medieval and created a ridiculous product which was mostly swords and sorcery. All is going well until out of nowhere I see loudspeakers! Film wasn't so bad as some surprisingly decent acting (the hot Layla and her father) and the absolutely awful acting and throw ins (the Americans who happen to be black and speak like they are from New York thrown in to provide ""comic relief"" in merry old England who are out of place in every way) which provides you with a slasher film that is truly something to laugh at and somewhat gripping at the same time. The CGI is OK part of the time and, for a relatively higher budget low budget film, is hysterically bad at the very end. A CGI alien combined with the cutaways to see ""blood on the sword"" and close ups when it is obvious that the budget had to be cut at the end and couldn't spend more cash on the CGI! I've seen A LOT worse, and this one is not nearly as bad, e.g. the few minutes I saw some cheesy Godzilla films or those super low budget D&D type adventures with mind numbingly bad scripts, acting and special effects.

I think,5,22 January 2007,"This was my first exposure to Beowulf, so I didn't find my views of the film coloured by the closeness (or lack thereof) of the plot or anything of that sort. Just had to point that out since I find peoples reviews of adaptations are usually heavily based on source material. First thing I want to point out is that the ""futuristic setting"" barely comes into play. If you're expecting a big sci-fi film, or avoiding the film because of the sci-fi you should know that the only real futuristic elements are a high tech telescope, a castle that doesn't even look like anything, and the pizza cutter of doom wielded by one of the extras. I suppose the soundtrack gives it a sci-fi type feel, since it makes use of a lot of techno. Unfortunately I found the soundtrack quite uneven. Some of it was good and suited to the scene, some of it was so bad I turned on subtitles and muted my TV. Most of the soundtrack just had me thinking ""do I know this song or did they just rip off a song I know?"" The music wasn't the only uneven thing though, some of the acting in this film was atrocious. Lambert manages to keep his wry charm, Rhona Mitra was quite impressive, and Layla Roberts was good at what little she had to work with. Everyone else ran the spectrum from mediocre (the king... was he a king... I was kinda lost on that) to something that looked like the role was filled by the first hobo they could find (the assistant weapons master). Fight choreography was sadly lacking, so don't expect an awesome action flick. The monsters were kind of lame, so don't count on oohing and aahing at the effects. In truth, this film had the potential to be very great as a bad film but the few descent actors and good bits to the soundtrack raised the bar so it was mostly just bad. Personally, I like Christopher Lambert and I like bad movies, so I liked it... just not as much as I could have with a bit of tweaking.",Beowulf

This script is obviously, hellishly silly, but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all. Lambert is always weird, and usually kind of boring, but for this one he's gone into Dolph Lundgrin territory: I can't help but just start laughing every time he talks.I will give this movie some credit for being completely scatter-brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one.Warning: if you are planning on watching Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish, hyperactive-catatonic daze. It's true. When I was done with my Beowulf spirit journey, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk. There was a dead wolf lying next to me, and I later found I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf was sitting on a hastily-constructed stone altar nearby, enshrined with candles and wilted flowers. The tape told me to walk. I rose and I walked.",Beowulf
53,thebrawler,Lamberts best in awhile,6,27 March 2001,"On the case at Blockbuster it recommends ""The 13th Warrior,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and ""Highlander."" As a fan of these films I was delighted to see that Beowulf did fit in among them. Although some of the acting was weak the overall performances were fantastic considering that it is a movie that was never released in theatre's here. I feel that Lambert has made his best performance since ""Resurrection."" A movie few have seen but which I would recommend if you're a Lambert or serial killer fan. Rhona Mitra was extremely hot and Oliver Cotton gave a wonderful performance. Overall I would give it a six of ten...for the type of movie it is I would say they did a fantastic job.",Beowulf
54,snortch,Surprisingly GREAT movie!!,10,2 September 2002,"This movie REALLY surprised me as how GOOD it was!! With Christopher Lambert in it, it had to be good, but this is his best performance since the first Highlander movie. The soundtrack blew me away with its mix of metal, chanting, and eerily echoing music. The acting was above par and with the updating of the ancient Olde English tale to a futuristic/medieval setting; it's a feast for the eyes and ears. Grab the popcorn and a soda and ENJOY!!",Beowulf
55,Don-147,Better than any sleeping pill I've ever known,1,2 August 1999,"I've seen this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. At about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was booeing. Boring dialogues,  badly choreographed fighting sequences, a  terribly dumb story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors hadn't much to do, except for looking concerned or (in case they were female) showing their breasts in the right light. Even Götz Otto, who was among the audience admitted afterwards that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers. Be warned, folks, of the cheapest fantasy movie ever........",Beowulf
56,gaiafaye,A great movie... for a laugh.,3,27 February 2004,"We screened this movie in a club as an example of how classic literature can become twisted into some of the most awful movies of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the ""techno-futile"" future should have been enough of a hint. I think that word describes the movie itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie, the effort was completely futile. Not to mention that our club advisor told us that it allegedly couldn't get a distributor for two years.This cinematic failure is littered with cheesy, cliche dialogue that's worse than angsty teen poetry. Beowulf's character changes halfway through in a way that is in no way credible, and whenever he's in an action scene, he's constantly flipping like a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a ""token black guy"" whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And, of course, the daughter of the leader of the outpost Grendel is terrorizing is a total vixen. A vixen whose breasts are exposed throughout the entire movie. A vixen who wants to fight the creature, yet she never puts on armor. And her weapon of choice is a little carving knife. And despite their dire situation, she still dresses up for dinner, in a dress with a see-through skirt that exposes her short-shorts underwear. There are a couple scenes that could pass as soft core pornography, and in the second scene they even reuse footage from the first. I thought the portrayal of Grendel was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, which featured a display of CGI that might be decent for the 80s, but is totally ridiculous for a late 90s venture. I could go on, but you all should watch this film for the fully laughable effect yourselves.The other club members and I did manage to have fun watching this by taking a cue from MST 3K and mocking it the whole way through. I'm still reeling from an extra's weapon: a perpetually spinning pizza cutter on a pole.",Beowulf

Easy to follow - if you don't see this movie because the story is so difficult to read, throw the story out and get this movie.  As usual, Christopher's performance is stunning and the black leather fits him like a glove. I don't know why this movie it isn't running on the SciFi Channel right now.

Ok, so the time frame wasn't a true Medieval setting, it did have a rather Mad Max flare.I now see why this went straight to video.  I picked this one up because I like the Beowulf story, and I think Christopher Lambert has the potential to be a decent actor.  The costumes and weaponry were all right, and some of the acting was ok.  However, the storyline was pretty much doomed from the start.  It has been a while since I read the original epic (or most of it anyway), but I think they got a couple of names right...that is about it. Oh yeah, they got the part about Beowulf fighting Grendel right...at least in the general sense.All in all, I think this was a one time viewing, and I would recommend friends putting this at the bottom of their viewing list....WAY at the bottom, below watching paint dry.",Beowulf

64,CipherCode,A wonderful film!!,10,19 October 2000,"This is Christopher Lambert at his best!  I had pretty low expectations when I saw this on the shelf (after Fortress II and Highlander 4), but Lambert kicked butt.  We had great effects, suspense, and an interesting mix of sci-fi and folklore.  The music was fun, the fight scenes were great.  The only thing this movie lacked was that it strayed far from the original story of Beowulf.  If you ignore that story of Beowulf, this becomes a great god-man verses god-monster movie.",Beowulf
65,hursta218,"If you watch, be advised, you have been warned...",3,3 January 2001,"I rented this movie the other day simply because I know the story of Beowulf, and Christopher Lambert was in it.  It sounded interesting, a futuristic version of an ancient classic, but the film did not impress me.
The soundtrack was excellent, and the acting was okay, but the main problem I had with the movie was the changes in the plot.  I did like the futuristic twist on the movie, but I like Sci-Fi (a large part in my mistake in renting this movie).The movie did stay somewhat true to the original, but the changes in plot did not help at all.  One of the major changes ties into the twist in the movie, but it destroys the movie (in terms of the original).  This movie seems more like a movie with characters named from a classic than the classic itself.  In fact, I can only think of about four characters in the movie that are in the original.The monster Grendel could have been done much better.  Sometimes CGI characters are done well, but this one was not.  The dark lighting in the scenes, combined with a purple haze about Grendel took away from the evilness of it.  Grendel is supposed to be the son of a great evil, not a purple cloud that kills people.  The whole business about Beowulf hurting Grendel was poorly done.  Grendel is supposed to be protected against weaponry, so why did Beowulf commission a special weapon?If you like the original Beowulf, pass this one by.  If you like violence, watch Beowulf's introduction about ten times to get your money's worth.",Beowulf

Not funny-but shows what filmmakers will do to make a film and save $. This Beowulf is a film to watch with a group of fun friends. It is the futuristic version of the story made by the makers of Mortal Combat. There are wild physical and special effects, with creative set design modeled after Claes Oldenburg. The music for the action sequences was added later by Miramax and some love it others don't. It has a following in Europe and South America, where it had a theatrical release,-those who adore Christopher Lambert, Rhona Mitra, a playboy bunny, and much more- will particularly enjoy it. A I was watching the film I found myself laughing at times when I wasn't supposed to be- but that made it particularly fun. It also shows how a film can be at war with itself- the producer and director at war with each other. The story of much of Hollywood! Be in an alerted state watching and have a blast.",Beowulf
67,Ratty_Randnums,How can you not love this movie?,10,3 October 2012,"Beowulf is up there with ""Army of Darkness"" in terms of pure enjoyment for those who like swords, monsters and cheese. Though lacking the grand scope, budget and self-aware humor of the aforementioned classic it makes up for those losses with a very fun post-apocalyptic setting, great action and an engaging visual style. Lambert gives a good performance as the titular tortured demon hunter and Rhona Mirtra is so stunning and sexy in this it's a wonder she has not become more well-known. All of the cast turn in excellent performances for a B movie honestly. None of them, with the possible exception of Layla Roberts, mug or wink at the camera. This all ties together with a fast and fun adrenaline pumping techno soundtrack ala Mortal Kombat, a movie which shares a producer with this one, to create a film enjoyable both on its own merits and as fodder for gentle riffing. Not to be missed by those who love B monster or action movies.",Beowulf
68,pheede,"Seen worse, seen better",7,30 December 1999,"The keyword to this movie is quite simply suspension of disbelief. If you can manage that, the movie isn't half bad - cute in it's own medieval/futuristic kind of way. Christopher Lambert once again plays the kind of role he plays best (Highlander (1986) is a great film in my opinion).The script is based on a 6th century German heroic poem so the story is well known with the interesting twist the post-apocalyptic setting gives. Sit down and relax for an hour and a half with some friends and enjoy a good laugh when it gets too absurd. Then when you're done, go rent Blade (1998) to see how it's really supposed to be done. Beowulf can manage a weak 7 of 10 in my book.",Beowulf

The plot and the script are simply embarrassing, while the background seems geared towards the most childish of D&D players. There is gratuitous sex, naturally; and also badly-designed monsters.

However, seeing Lambert doing summer saults (excuse me) multiple front and back double and triple flips is well beyond my suspension of disbelief. The special effects are dated, but it's worth it to see Rhona. Also, the monster's mother is a Playboy model and does the ""seduction"" part extremely well.

This movie was so bad I was laughing at its sheer silliness and bad acting. Its basically in a stupid techno blah blah future about a guy, who we have no freaking clue about AT ALL HE'S JUST THERE, who decides to randomly go into a cursed castle (which has people living in it?)and fight a demon named Grendel, Now the castle's population is slowly going down (I'm guessing this was a plot device used because even the extras got tired of being in it), strange if you're in a castle whose population is being mutilated by a monster WHY WOULD YOU STAY? oh yeah because if they go outside the armada there would rape you, but hey its a semi-post-apocalyptic future right? So yeah the Princess is a stripper who's only weapon is a prison shank (wtf?) and all the soldiers suck at fighting (wow) except the captain who is a macho stereotype (think of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast)who also get gutted by the demon (wait its a demon?). Lambert is a terrible actor in this and I swear I can see the cables that make his jumps and flips possible in EVERY scene. Maybe the Director and Producer were really Stoned one night on crack, pot, and meth and they happened to be reading Beowulf while listening to techno and decided to make this abomination of literature. I personally found this movie funny and consider it a torture device to get P.O.W. to talk because the sheer silliness of it is enough to make you die of laughter. oh yeah Grendel's mom is a porn star, maybe thats why he looks like a leper with like 2,000 STDs. the CG in this movie makes Final Fantasy VII and the first 3 Resident Evil games look next-gen",Beowulf

Set in England about 1400 years ago there is a castle being attacked by a horrible creature. A mysterious hero then arrives in an attempt to save the day. Normal story, right? Well throw in a handful of present day slang with American accents, some bizarre weapons beyond belief, let alone for the time (I'm surprised nobody pulled out a Baretta) and then Beowulf, a demon/god(Christopher Lambert). Lambert was perfectly typecast for this role, much like Raiden in Mortal Kombat.

Bad acting, no realism, ridiculous sfx, no characters and to sum it up not one element of those which make a good movie. I must say that the ""bad girl"" was very interesting though (lucky king :)). I really don't understand why some people liked it, but I'd like to say that if you appreciate your taste don't make the mistake I made. The real shame though about this movie is that they were permitted (if they were) to use the name of one of the most historical poems as the title of this abomination. Movies like this and tv-series like Hercules and Xena (I wish someone could save us from them) is the reason why nobody can learn and appreciate the mythology and folklore of the various countries. It's really sad.If I wanted to be fair with the movie i should add that there are some scenes that are so ridiculous and bad-conceived that really make you laugh very hard.

Some people try to make movies without any budget and succeed, the 'monsters' in this flick are not the actual monster itself but the extremly poor special effect they were created with... this was like playstation one graphics.... anyway it was amusing to see al the characters stumble trough this 'thing' so if its on tv and you've got absolutly nothing better to do... give it a try",Beowulf

Most dark age movies tend to be going for the ""Battlefield"" stage. That is why this movie is unique, plus, the special effects and stunts. There a few technical things that weren't from the dark age, but that's the only thing I didn't like about it. Everything else was good, that's why I give it an 8.

Okay, so this movie can fight, at last Mr. Lambert gets to do some action for a change, sarcasm fully intended.  But the very poor acting and story let this one down.  SFX wise, it's quite nice, but they do tend to stick out a little bit.  The fighting doesn't have any sort of fun element in it, which I found boring.  Films like .. Guyver 2, although a poor film, have a great sense of get up and kick arse about them.  This one just clumps along at the same old predictable pace, leading enivitably to the BIG show down at the end.  Yawn.  On a side note though, the music does help a lot to bring the fights to life, but only if you are a fan of aggressive techno.

About a great warrior who came from another land and slayed a hideous beast who was 100's of years old. Now I know I might be skeptical and all,but that old of a beast is highly unlikely. And also the thought of a movie nowadays haven't accurate music and not being an epic movie like BraveHeart. The music helps the storyline, and makes it a cool movie too watch.

It's so eighties I feel it perfectly epitomizes the beloved ""'80s action B-movie"" genre despite being made a full decade too late. And knowing the extremes B-movies actually from the eighties can go to, that's saying A LOT.It has Chris Lambert playing Billy Idol in a long black leather coat playing Beowulf; Rhona Mitra, ""The original model behind Lara Croft in Tomb Raider!""; the kind of ingenious/insane mix of pseudo-medieval, post-apocalyptic and modern fashion and technology I haven't seen since Knights (and that's another one for the B-movie history books); a rather nice, if forgettable, techno soundtrack; more somersaults than you can shake a lever-action clockwork sword at; and Grendel's HOT MOMMA!I think Beowulf would have approved. It gets the attitude right, and that's what counts - to quote the poem, Chapter IX, ""Me thus often the evil monsters/ Thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,/ The darling, I dealt them due return!""

The general photography can be summarized as conflicted, with its mixture of mediaeval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max).  With a rock and techno soundtrack to boot, one comes away feeling a bit off.  The fight scenes, though unbelievable, are entertaining, and Christopher Lambert possesses some of the most interesting weapon combinations I have ever seen on film, though often a tad unfathomably inefficient.  The special effects used for the monster Grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights.Christopher Lambert delivers an average performance as Beowulf.  It will be nowhere near as memorable as Highlander, but at least it wasn't as poor as Fortress.  The supporting cast is rather neutral.If you're looking for a good action-adventure story with a complex and engaging plot, I would not suggest this film.  However, if you want a flick that is of little substance, full of campy battle scenes, and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of this.",Beowulf

But the plot is silly, the ""Mortal Kombat""-like music has nothing to do here, the ending is really s****y...Really, the only good thing about it is that me and my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was.

97,Hawkmoon-3,Not much of a surprise there...,1,26 August 1999,"Once I heard that the greatest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it. The first glints of its appearance I caught never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert our favourite highlander and Mitra, tomb raider to be,in leading roles seamed appealing, though some doubts came to life (an important female character in Beowulf?)... Two hours ago I saw the film. After I had read the director's name my world fell apart. As I said - from that point on, there was not many surprises. First and foremost, the film has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and pointlessly stolen names. If they had not stolen the names and declared it to be a new story, it might have passed as an f-class action stupidity with nice costumes and scenography. This way it is simply a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. Ok let me be positive for a second... apart from the general electro-goth atmosphere which is nice it also has good music. That was it for both the positive part and this comment.",Beowulf

Very quickly I was disappointed, those of you who are expecting a decent movie filled with swordplay and perhaps plot will find this movie sorely lacking.  Why they thought this was an adaptation I have no idea.  Its characters share the same names, and there is a remote castle besieged by an evil monster Grendal, but that is where the similarity ends. To say this is a failed futuristic adaptation of a classic implies that the director/producer actually attempted to make it an adaptation.  My guess is they changed a few names and called it ""Beowulf"" to attract more watchers.",Beowulf

The idea of adapting the eighth century epic anglo-saxon poem into a futuristic action movie was pretty cool and inventive.  Some of the add-ons to the plot that were different from the poem were likewise very imaginative and interesting.  I don't know if there were time restraints during the filming of the movie or if the director just got bored or if nobody really cared though.  The movie is plagued with horrible, labored acting (with the exception of Christopher Lambert), lame fight scenes that try to feed off the popularity of Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies, and as usual with most films anymore, characters that nobody really can care about.  So much more could have been done with this film that wouldn't have necessarily called for a bigger budget. Chalk this one up as yet another predictable action B movie that if they couldn't make it right, they probably shouldn't have made it at all.  Cool soundtrack though.",Beowulf

Christopher Lambert does an outstanding job of portraying a tormented hero (as this actor does so well). Bigger than life, reminiscent of the original story.  Set in a strange future, that mix's modern tools (infra red telescope) with ancient weapons (swords etc.) Note: not necessarily post - apocalypse.  This really sets the tone for the movie.  The viewer really has no time reference, making the movie that much more intriguing  mystical? I loved the way the characters are played off on each other, each revealing secrets and fears.  There is much more to this movie that blood and guts, but make no mistake, violence there is O plenty.  I enjoyed this film as fantasy / horror.  No weak performances or bad dialog.

Another straight to video release probably best since the effect, story and acting is not worth paying $8.75 a head.  I must admit that the reason I picked this movie off the shelf is not for Christopher Lambert but for Patricia Velazquez who is building an acting career for herself.  A true beauty who most viewer will begin to remember from The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser.  She played the drop ""dead"" gorgeous beauty at the beginning of the film.  Her acting stands out as being too good for this bad flick.  You will see more of very soon in The Mummy II. She looks great in her outfits if nothing else.

106,derekmadams,Ugh... Gack.,1,8 June 2001,"What an awful movie.  I was forced to watch this as part of a World Masterpieces class, and I must say that it does no justice to the EPIC that inspired it.  While the scifi setting was an interesting way to update it, the execution of the aforementioned was horrible.  Christopher Lambert, (of Highlander fame, Endgame was something I couldn't force myself to finish watching) who speaks as if he has a mouthful of dirt, delivers lines that make no sense.  And while it's obvious that money was saved by having a trained chimp write the screenplay, that money didn't go into special effects.  What's with the gratuitous use distortion to cover up the horrible Grendel costume?  *Sigh*  I can't recommend this movie to anyone, let alone someone who is fond of the poem Beowulf.  Unless you liked Highlander Endgame or Mortal Kombat, but I'll leave it at that before I get all jaded and cynical.  Oh.  Wait.  *Shakes head*",Beowulf

110,clarktech,So bad that it's... really bad... But with heart and character?,5,10 September 2014,"First, I gave it 5/10 points arbitrarily... I don't honestly know how to rank this film.You know those movies that are so bad they're good, even great? Well, this isn't one of them... This movie is so bad that it's... bad.So why five points? Because it's just a really weird, bad movie that didn't actually leave a bad taste in my mouth afterwards. Yes, I watched it late at night when I couldn't fall asleep, which is the only sane reason to watch this movie. And I've seen some movies that just offended me such that I hated them afterwards, but this movie isn't one of them. This movie DID have some thought and purpose at some point, it's just up to the viewer to figure out when it was, what it was, and what it was supposed to be.The cast and acting is... interesting. Imagine my surprise when I see Mac from Night Court standing atop the 'castle' look out early in the film! What??? And Christopher Lambert apparently turned down Mortal Kombat 2 to do this movie (and had the same Raiden hair still) because the movie at the time had a real low budget of $25M... which was later whittled down to around $3.5M, about enough for the production company to cater the set with Ramen noodles during the shoot. It even has Gotz Otto, who is actually a decent actor, and Rhona Mitra who is an even more decent actress...And Grendel's Mother is a genuine Playboy Playmate! And it shows!!! The movie is filmed on location in Romania... why? Who knows, probably because it was cheap. The scenery is unremarkable at best. Apparently it was not a pleasant place to film at either. The sets aren't bad when you consider they were working with a budget more apt for a weekly TV series episode than an actual feature length film. I think a large portion of the film's budget went towards matches and lighter fluid, as there are an abundance of candles and torches in almost every scene.If only some of that candle money had been spent on the CGI stuffs... which is all horrible. I was in school during that era, and happened to be in a class where we were playing with various 3D art and rendering programs. I think based on that experience, it's safe to say whoever did the CGI in this movie had never actually done so before, and/or hadn't taken the same classes I had, or it may have turned out a little better.The props, specifically the weapons... What can I say? The king carries a non-op chainsaw blade on a stick... and that's par for the course. I get that somehow the viewer is supposed to know in advance that this is a 'post-apocalyptic future', and that the prop guy was shooting for a feeling of weapons constructed of anything that such a people could get their hands on... But why does the castle have electricity for things like the PA system and the Weapon's Master's honing wheel, all the doors make a hissing sound like they're being hermetically sealed (it's a big open drafty castle, mind you), dinner is served in pristine disposable foil serving dishes (probably robbed from the Ramen noodle catering truck), and every dead person gets their own personal, plastic body bag with a zipper on it?!?!? I think I like this film for these reasons, because you know this movie drove the director to drink, at least, and that after the first day of shooting the cast just sort of showed up everyday to shoot the movie, knowing that they were making a turd, but by Gods it was going to be a polished turd if they could help it! I mean seriously, I'm willing to bet that the dinner scenes were real! They shot them at actual meal times, brought the food from the catering truck onto set with them (served in those awesome disposable foil containers) and sat there and read their lines while having dinner with each other. Why not, right? 5/10 points, because it's not a horrible movie that leaves you wanting that hour and a half back from your life, but because it's a horrible movie that leaves you feeling so bad for the cast and crew that you can't help but want to give them something to console them... even if it's just five points in an internet review...",Beowulf
111,nautomatic,Don't Believe the Haters,8,22 August 2009,"This movie was great. Seriously, I know that it seems by the average rating that there must be something wrong with this flick, but I tell you, it was great. The production values were excellent considering the obvious budget constraints, the imagination of the production crew really out-shined their financial limitations. This movie has a sort of ""road warrior"" meets ""braveheart"" look to it, and where less passionate crews might have trouble being consistent with the open ended possibilities that such an aesthetic might afford, these guys really do a great job of creating a believable world that does not seem artificial in any way. The acting was seriously top notch, all the players took the material with deadly seriousness and while lesser actors and actresses may have felt the material beneath them and turned in a tongue in cheek performance, these guys all brought their ""A"" game, which is more than can be said of most action movies with three times the budget. The fight choreography was very well done and although it had a bit of the ""Hong Kong"", Wu-Shu inspired feel to it, it didn't go overboard and the work done to edit the actors together with the stunt actors was well above par. The CGI, although not quite at the level of a big budget Hollywood movie, considering that this was made ten years ago, was incredibly inventive, (especially Grendels mom,) and the creature design for Grendel was, again, very imaginative and well filmed. I've heard complaints about the soundtrack, but although everyone's taste in music is different, i felt it was consistent and, appropriately conducive to my level of emmersion in this world. There are only two things that stop me from giving this movie a higher score. The first is a lack of chemistry between Beowolf and Kyra. Perhaps they could have spent a little more time on this relationship, then again, it may have detracted from the overall pace of the film, but I must say, it felt a little forced between them. The second is really no fault of the film, it simply didn't have the budget, (given the subject matter,) nor the aspiration, to be a completely life changing experience, which is what it takes to get a ten out of me. Overall, if you like your action movies to take themselves seriously and you're looking for something a little different, I highly recommend you give this movie a view. On a side note, i don't understand how the CGI Beowolf from a couple of years back could possibly get a higher average score than this, except to say that a lot of people would rather conform to the perceived opinions of the masses instead of giving forth the little amount of effort that it takes to think for themselves. I've seen both, and I have to tell you, this movie was far and above the better film. (And if you ask me, Layla Roberts was way hotter than Angelena Jolie as Grendel's mom.)

I thought to myself, ""Self, this could be very cool.""

The way that Mr. Lambert and his fellow actors portrayed their parts were superb. Grendel and Beowulf. I think, would be terribly hard to portray. But it was well done. The setting that I was so worried about added to the story in a way that I never could have understood before seeing it. I was very pleased with directing, acting and stunts.

But in situations of that and this it just adds an interesting element to it.The soundtrack was great, the fights were good, especially first fight scene with Beowulf in it.

The only GOOD thing is Rhona Mitra. Everyone one in the movie has a muddy-grunge look, but of course she's clean as a whistle and complete with a bustier which she manages to trot in each scene.

120,busstogate,Mythologizing Beowulf,5,18 September 2005,"I am going to be kind and give this movie more of a rating than what I think it deserves. The reason I am doing so is not because of plot layout, acting skill, or the special effects. ""Beowulf"" the movie can be held up as a good reflection of the poet's highlighting of Beowulf's self-conflict between being the egotist and the epic hero who backs up any talk about his exploits. I do not think there is much overt bragging by Lambert's depiction, but it is easy enough to spot where he knows how skilled of a warrior he actually is.Some academic reviews of the poem have Grendel's mother performing acts of hospitality toward Beowulf upon his arrival in her lair, along with the possibility, in John Gardner's novel ""Grendel"" that there might be incestuous relations between Grendal and his mother. I don't think the movie tackles these interpretations fully, but in roundabout ways, they are addressed. Unferth's role is also addressed indirectly, but does become trivialized and corrupted in the overuse of erotic intrigue.Agan, because the film did allow me to make successful correlations to the poem, I give it a ""5"", but it was heavy on canned Velveeta, making no amount of literary integrity be enough to save this dud.",Beowulf

It was shown to me in my senior honors English Literature class (I know, scary to think about) and I nearly died. I don't know if it was the terrible bastardization of the poem, the horrific acting or the gratuitous twenty minutes of pornography they, for reasons unknown, chose to include.Beowulf is the story of a 6th century hero who slaughters a vicious mythological creature who has decided to entertain itself by terrorizing an outlying castle. NOWHERE in the original poem are there megaphones, plastic body bags or creepy sex scenes. Grendel is NOT the son of Hrothgar, that is pure dreck. Also, Beowulf does not take a wife, nor does he end up a nomad.That being said, the movie is hilarious. If you have two hours to kill and need a good laugh, rent it.

123,Alstegner,Overall a pretty crappy movie,2,5 December 2005,"Beowulf is a Science fiction horror, action/adventure film staring Christopher Lambert that is based on the 9th century Anglo-Saxon story of the same name. The time and setting of the movie is left a complete mystery. Lambert's character Beowulf is a human that possess great fighting skills and tools who travels to an outpost castle to save the people living inside from a supernatural creature named Grendel.All grandiloquent speech aside, Christopher Lambert's performance in Beowulf was a shining bastion of over acting. With nothing left to loose this past his prime actor put everything he had, and then some into this film. I was enthralled, I laughed, I cried, I laughed so hard I cried; the film was atrocious. The entire film was an attempt by the director to delve the viewer into a world of claustrophobia like that of Alien with a costume scheme of Mad Max beyond Thunder-Dome and the cheesy fight scene style of the Mortal Kombat movies. The claustrophobia and fear was inexistent but they definitely succeeded in creating cheesy action sequences like those of Mortal Kombat. The costumes, weapons and props that the characters were equipped with defied all convention. In one scene the king steps into view wearing a helmet that completely covered his face with no holes to see out of, and says ""I can't see anything"" and removes the ridiculous helmet. A reoccurring theme of the movie is weapons like that of the story. But the weapons in the movie are all asinine. Soldiers are armed with pole arm pizza cutters and giant bread knives. Beowulf, Lambert's character is a self proclaimed weapons expert who as well as his hedge clipper sword, he carries a knife that shoots disks and an automatic crossbow. One of the most astounding props in the movie is a guillotine style killing machine that resembles a giant shaving razor. I was at a loss of words when I saw this monstrous machine on the screen and that loss of words is still with me. The actors and actresses in Beowulf are truly something to behold. I am almost One Hundred Percent sure that the female casting call for the movie was held at the Playboy mansion. The females staring in Beowulf all had busting at the seams fake chests, and caked on make up, not to mention glitter lip gloss. The male actors must have been extras that were stolen from the set of the popular TV series Hercules: the legendary journey and Xenia: warrior princess. The Story Beowulf and Beowulf the movie are polar opposites. The writer and the Director went out of there way to create a science fiction horror movie with little relation to the story. Elements that stayed the same included the characters names, after that I found nothing in common other then that Beowulf was a hero fighting a creature named Grendel. All in all they took an idea, a budget and a production, and apparently their integrity and threw the whole kit out the window. I really can not understand how they decided to take such a classic and turn it into pure pulp, mock noir, trash. I am sure that there is a reason that the Director's only other success was Alien Nation, a si/fi buddy cop film that had poor reviews in 1988. Here is Mr. Baker ten years later in 1999 back with another campy, flagrantly terrible film. I can only hope that in 2009 Mr. Graham Baker dos not assault the public at large once again with a hopelessly useless film.",Beowulf
