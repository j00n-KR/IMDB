0,SnoopyStyle,Hilariously Stupid but Sometimes just Stupid,6,15 January 2014,"Shelley (Anna Faris) is a sweet clueless Bunny living in the Playboy Mansion. All she ever wants is to be a centerfold. However, she's kicked out of the mansion after turning 27. She takes a job as the house mom for a sorority of misfits. In order to stay open, the sorority needs more pledges.Anna Faris is hilariously stupid. Her exorcist low voice is crazy. Colin Hanks doesn't have enough to do other than look stunned. He's a stiff. As for the sorority, Emma Stone looks adorable as the geeky leader. They've uglied up Kat Dennings, and put Rumer Willis in a brace. Katharine McPhee is pregnant. Basically, they put a bunch of beautiful girls and given each one a weird thing to have. Then there's the questionable message that stumbles from time and time. In the 'Revenge of the Nerds', the nerds use their special skills to win. In this one, the girls need to pretty up to win. It's basically a makeover movie which isn't that funny. Luckily Shelley's unconventional makeover is much funnier and the girls learn a lesson about being themselves.",The House Bunny
1,jboothmillard,The House Bunny,5,28 February 2012,"I heard about this film because of the leading actress, and the title made it obvious that it was something to do with Playboy, but it is not something seedy or full of gross jokes, a typical fish out water style story, and one I looked forward to trying. Basically Shelley Darlingson (Scary Movie's Anna Faris) is a bunny girl working at the Plaboy mansion, and she celebrates her twenty seventh birthday, but is shocked to be told in a note from Hugh 'Hef' Hefner that she will have to leave, being too old (in bunny years). With nowhere to go she packs her things and looks around to start a new life, and following some pretty girls who remind her of herself, and she finds herself in a luxury sorority house. The girls living there being completely stuck up, and Shelley not being a student, she is rejected, but she finds the other sorority house, Zeta Alpha Zeta, which is less luxurious and full of girls that are all socially awkward. They at first reject her too, but bespectacled virgin Natalie (Zombieland's Emma Stone) makes the other girls change their minds, and soon enough they realise their new house mother's pulling power. As time passes Shelley helps the girls gain more self confidence, including with their image change, and they certainly get more attention from boys, and Shelley herself meets retirement home worker Oliver (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), and ironically, she needs flirting tips. There is a point when she is becoming more popular than the sorority house and other girls, and they blame her for this, and at the same time Hef is calling her from the Playboy mansion offering her a photo shoot, he never wanted her to leave, the note was faked by another bunny. Shelley realises she can't see herself going back to her old life, and she cares too much for the girls, who are in danger of losing the sorority house, due to lack of pledges, more are interested in the rival Phi Iota Mus. Dean Simmons (Christopher McDonald) is about to take away the house, but the house bunny comes back and gives a stirring speech about what she has learnt about love and acceptance, and girls start raising their hands to pledge. In the end, with the thirtieth pledge they needed coming from the friend of mean Ashley (Sarah Wright), they keep the house, and Shelley, who does find happiness with Oliver as well, stays with them, keeping in contact with Playboy. Also starring Kat Dennings as Mona, Beverly D'Angelo as Mrs. Hagstrom, Katharine McPhee as Harmony, Kiely Williams as Lilly, Rumer Willis as Joanne, Dana Goodman as Carrie Mae, Kimberly Makkouk as Tanya, Tyson Ritter as Colby and Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal. Faris, who rose to fame film by film, plays the dumb blonde to the hilt, but is not too annoying and is a lovable character, and the supporting cast of ugly ducklings turned prettier are alright too, as well as the other stars. It is a story you may think, with a Playboy storyline, it would contain softcore pornography and lots of nudity, or it would be trying to make you laugh with sick and stupid gags, but it is a bit more grown up than that, I will confess the script is a bit simple and predictable at times, but it is a nice and funny story all the same, a fun comedy. Worth watching!",The House Bunny
2,BA_Harrison,The House Bunny: not very funny.,3,25 February 2019,"Those who have the hots for Anna Faris will definitely want to see The House Bunny since the Scary Movie actress (now blonde) spends the whole film wearing a range of extremely skimpy outfits, including mini-skirts, bra tops, and really small hot pants.The film itself is clichéd hogwash in which Playboy Playmate Shelley (Faris) helps the misfits of a sorority house who are in danger of being kicked off campus. Turning them from ugly ducklings into swans, she increases their popularity ('cos, apparently, nobody likes a frumpy nerd), ensuring that they get the necessary number of pledges to avoid losing their charter. Meanwhile, the sorority girls help ditzy Shelley to become a little smarter so that she can impress sensitive guy Oliver (Colin Hanks).The whole thing is incredibly formulaic, delivering nothing we haven't seen many times before, and the majority of the comedy falls flat, but Faris is always on hand to distract the viewer by not wearing very much.",The House Bunny
3,tavm,The House Bunny is a pleasant enough movie for anyone not looking for anything that makes you think too much...,5,9 January 2009,"Well, I've now seen The House Bunny and all I've got to say is it's what I expected judging from the previews and reviews and that means that it was pleasant and uneven and shallow and perhaps a little smart but it was enjoyable so that's a mostly good thing. The girls are good eye candy but they can act and Anna Faris is especially a remarkable comic presence. I really like when she mentions everyone's names with that deep croaking voice. As her second banana, Emma Stone is also pretty good with what she's given here and Kat Dennings, who I loved in Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist, isn't bad here either. Colin Hanks, Tom's son, has a sweet presence too but the real surprise was seeing Beverly D'Angelo and Christopher McDonald in their roles especially McDonald since I usually think of his not-so-sympathetic role in Thelma and Louise when I think of him. Well, I think I've said too much so I'll just say The House Bunny is an okay comedy that should make the 90 or so minutes go down easy to anyone not looking for the next Oscar bait movie...",The House Bunny
4,edwagreen,House Bunny is Average to Mediocre Rabbit Test **1/2,6,4 August 2009,"This movie is another perfect example of the association of blonde's being stupid. Some may even say that this picture is a part of the legally blonde series.It's really a story of keeping one's individuality while trying to improve yourself.In Cinderella-like atmosphere, a Hugh Hefner bunny is booted out of his home by a scheming fellow bunny and her playmate. Our bunny goes on to become a sorority mother for a bunch of losers.Did anyone notice that when Ms. Faris tried to appear intellectual, she very much resembled Marilyn Monroe in scenes with Tony Curtis in the fabulous ""Some Like it Hot?"" While this film is certainly not that 'Hot,' there were some funny moments.Of course, Faris gets the girls to be more hip about themselves while learning something about herself.",The House Bunny
5,Scarecrow-88,The House Bunny,6,31 May 2010,"One of those usual Adam Sandler comedies(without him, but maintaining the dopey charm)featuring Anna Faris as a Playboy bunny (tricked by a cook who was being manipulated by a model with designs on taking her place)without a home and finding a position as housemother for a sorority with members considered losers on their way to an eviction thanks to neighboring rivals.The losers of the film get a makeover as Farris' Shelley dresses them into Playboy bunnies, matching her image, their own individualities slowly dissipating the longer they remain ""in character"". This comes out, particularly in one scene as the girls nit pit over who should join their sorority and who shouldn't. They quickly forgot how they were once treated, and must shed their disguises(well, maybe to a certain agree, I'm sure most wouldn't wish for Dana Goodman's Carrie Mae to revert back to that hideous creature she once was)in order to rescue themselves from becoming what they once hated, the sorority across the street who wishes to evict them. With the American Idol singer, Katharine McPhee, as a pregnant wallflower, Rumer Willis hiding underneath a chest/spine plate used to correct a handicap, and Kat Dennings as a ""metalhead"" who looks like a butch lesbian in goth attire. I think Dennings' transformation is a bit hard to swallow, her ideals seem so true to her character, but the others I can understand what a little(okay, a lot)of make-up, saucier clothes, and wigs could do to make them come out of their shells and feel better about themselves. I don't buy this, that getting prettied up leads to the end of your troubles, but THE HOUSE BUNNY is just fluff, a sophomoric comedy aimed at tickling our funnybone in regards to airheaded models, the awkwardness of boyfriends and dating, how a playmate might overcome her weaknesses outside of the pleasure palace of Hugh Hefner(he shows up in a minor part of course), and adapting to a new found fame you are not accustomed to(thanks to Shelley, the sorority becomes a party capital). The film, if a bit raunchier, would be an ideal coupling with REVENGE OF THE NERDS or BACHELOR PARTY, it has that kind of 'National Lampoons' 80's thing going on that grabbed my attention and kept me interested. Emma Stone, as the nerdy red-head Natalie, really holds her own with Farris who is adorable, if more than a bit birdbrained. Stone, like in times past regarding ""nerds in disguise"" is still quite a babe despite what the film tries to do with her character. The sub-plot involving Farris and Colin Hanks didn't particularly work for me, it was a bit hard to accept that these two could hit it off(but, it's possible I guess, even though expecting us to believe Hanks wouldn't know that she is ""playmate material""), but I understood that the filmmakers wanted her to have a love interest and integrate in society with a more ""normal"", mature male character instead of some horny college dude. The 'suspense' of the movie is whether or not our sorority will meet the requirement of pledges needed to stave off eviction and how Harris, as you would expect, will pull it off. And, it's only a matter of time before Hugh comes calling once he finds out why she was missing after his return from a trip. The film's major comedy bits contain playful jabs at the image of the sexy Playboy model and her effects on the males around her.",The House Bunny
6,george.schmidt,Faris is a latter day Goldie Hawn in this fun showcase of her true comic gifts!,8,3 September 2008,"THE HOUSE BUNNY (2008) *** Anna Faris, Colin Hanks, Emma Stone, Kat Dennings, Christopher McDonald, Beverly D'Angelo, Leslie Del Rosario, Katharine McPhee, Rumer Willis, Kiely Williams, Dana Goodman, Kimberly Makkouk, Monet Mazur, Tyson Ritter, Sarah Wright, Rachel Specter, Owen Benjamin, Hugh Hefner (as himself). Faris sparkles in this screwball fish-out-of-water comedy as a sweet but slightly vapid Playboy centerfold wannabe who finds herself suddenly homeless when she is unceremoniously thrown out of The Playboy Mansion on her 27th birthday but finds resilient good tidings by becoming the house mother to a sorority of misfits (think ""REVENGE OF THE NERDS"" with a sex change) that she takes under her well-meaning wing. Faris is her generation's Goldie Hawn and her timing and knack for mixing physical comedy with wide-eyed innocence is a charming, intoxicating concoction that rises above by the by-the-numbers screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith. Stone is also a treat as the bookish sorority sister who really comes into her own. Best bit : running gag of Faris' ""Exorcist"" voice whenever she meets someone new (trust me it's LOL funny!) (Dir: Fred Wolf)",The House Bunny
7,neil-476,Pleasing light rom-com,7,17 October 2008,"The set-up is simple: airhead bimbo Shelley is conned out of the Playboy mansion for being too old, and ends up as house mother at a sorority house which is due to close because its handful of misfit members are incapable of attracting new members. Fortunately the one thing Shelley is good at is attracting people, so she teaches the girls how to look attractive, and they teach her that there is more to life than appearances.The script tries to have its cake and eat it by making Shelley dumb as a fencepost while, at the same time, being sharp as a tack. This hardly matters, because Anna Faris makes Shelley a character whose attractiveness (as a person) far outweighs her shallowness (she is indeed vapid in the early stages of the film).Some of the early humour doesn't work too well, and there are the usual cultural mistranslations for a British audience which is completely unfamiliar with the whole sorority business, but this doesn't matter either: the generalities work just fine even if some of the specifics don't come across.The message is clear, but not overdone. A lot of the humour is very effective - Faris is a gifted physical comedienne - and this is, in my view, another comedy which succeeds because it has heart. You root for Shelley and the girls because they are inherently decent, nice people, and you hiss the rival sorority (who have designs on taking over the other sorority house) because they have lost sight of the virtues espoused by Shelley and her girls - this, incidentally, gives the movie an unexpected cheer-out-loud moment towards the end).The single use of the F-word is very funny.",The House Bunny
8,Uriah43,Seemed to Lose Steam About Halfway Through,4,21 December 2014,"When ""Shelley Darlingson"" (Anna Faris) is inexplicably kicked out of the Playboy mansion she is forced to find somewhere else to stay. As luck would have it she stumbles upon a college sorority on the verge of being closed and in desperate need of a house mother. However things aren't as simple as they seem because this particular sorority is the social leper of the college due to the fact that the few women inside are extreme nerds and the reason they are about to be closed is that nobody else wants to live there. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film started out pretty good. Unfortunately, it was quite predictable and seemed to lose steam about halfway through. Still, Anna Faris looked nice and performed adequately I suppose. Additionally, there were some funny parts here and there and for that reason I rate it as only slightly below average.",The House Bunny
9,anaconda-40658,The House Rat.,3,10 September 2015,"The House Bunny (2008): Dir: Fred Wolf / Cast: Anna Faris, Emma Stone, Colin Hanks, Kat Dennings, Katharine McPhee: Misfire comedy about upper class. Anna Faris plays a Playboy Bunny who is suddenly kicked out of the Playboy Mansion due to sabotage by a jealous playmate. She ends up at a misfit sorority house where she is to teach these girls how to be beautiful and fit in. Premise is rushed and structure is predictable with an embarrassing conclusion. Director Fred Wolf shoots some nice scenery but this whole premise has been done countless times and it is every bit as boring this time out. Anna Faris can be hilarious for anyone who has seen Scary Movie, but as the dimwit Playboy blonde the role is strictly a xerox of others who have traveled the same script. Emma Stone and Kat Dennings are presented as ugly when they're not. That is exactly what is wrong with this junk. They do up ponytails, piercings, heavy eye makeup, and overalls in claims of ugliness, then unveil these lovely ladies who were beautiful to begin with. Let's be frank here. Emma Stone, Kat Dennings and Katharine McPhee are hot as frig and sabotaging their appearance doesn't change that. Colin Hanks is flat as the boyfriend whose function is to attract Faris. All is well that ends well but this film doesn't end soon enough. It takes more paint than the sorority house to make this phony comedy look attractive. Score: 3 / 10",The House Bunny
10,FlashCallahan,A mysterious log......,7,14 August 2014,"Shelley Darlingson was raised in an orphanage, but when she blossomed into a hot girl and moved into the Playboy Mansion. But she's summarily evicted on her 27th birthday, because she's too old. In desperation she takes a job as house mother for a sorority of misfits losing their house for lack of members. They have a few months to find 30 pledges, or a sorority of popular girls will take over their place. Shelley figures that girls will pledge a house that boys find interesting, so she sets out to make the girls alluring, not act too smart, and host great parties........It's from Happy Madison pictures, so don't expect something too clever. If you like Adam Sandler side projects, like Grandmas Boy, and Deuce Bigalow, you will know what to expect.It's as subtle as a sledge hammer, the humour is mostly gross out and inane, but there is also a little bit of heart to it.Fairs is great as the playboy bunny, and she doesn't overdo the popular girl schtick too much, in fact, she's one of the most sympathetic characters in the whole film, showing that she probably could have been a success if she chose the right path.As usual, the not so pretty girls turn out to be really hot ala She's All That, and despite connotation toward Mean Girls, there's not much reference.Its a fun ninety minutes, nothing too serious, or too stupid.It won't do you any harm.",The House Bunny
11,Wuchakk,"Likable cast and story, but unengaging script",4,3 April 2015,"""The House Bunny"" (2008) stars Anna Faris as playboy bunny, Shelly, living at Hefner's infamous mansion. When she's unexpectedly ousted after her 27th birthday she gets a gig as a house mother at a USC sorority where Shelly encourages a group of geeky girls by giving them make-overs, etc. Beverly D'Angelo, Colin Hanks and Hugh Hefner have side roles. The plot is similar to 1984's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" in that a group of nerdy youths get revenge on their popular crowd persecutors. The difference here, of course, is that the nerds are girls at a sorority rather than guys at a fraternity, not to mention the presence of a playboy bunny as their leader. I wanted to see this movie the second I saw the trailer because it made it look like an entertaining movie and it is, to a point. Amiable Anna easily carries the movie with her winsome, naïve personality while Emma Stone is equally effective as the leader of the geeks. Kat Denning, Katharine McPhee and a couple of the other actresses who play the nerdy girls are also good. It's a well-made, likable dramedy with -- thankfully -- no raunch. The problem is the script and the corresponding flow of the story. It never really engaged me and, as such, the movie never rose above mildly amusing. Another problem is that the filmmakers failed to take advantage of the female resources at their disposal, except for Faris. Dennings is underutilized and McPhee is pregnant the entire movie, which was unnecessary because there's no appreciable payoff to that particular subplot.If you want to see a really good dramedy about sorority girls check out 2005's ""Man of the House."" The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, including Playboy Mansion and USC. GRADE: C",The House Bunny
12,zetes,"Not especially offensive, but quite lame",4,29 December 2008,"Playboy Bunny Anna Faris attaches herself to a sorority full of losers in this Adam Sandler production. That should tell you in itself that this isn't a very good movie, because Sandler's Happy Madison production company has produced some egregious crap over the past few years. The House Bunny is a masterpiece compared to some of those films (e.g. Grandma's Boy), but it's mostly lame with only a handful of laughs, none of them too big. Faris is actually a pretty talented comedic actress, even if she really only has the bimbo persona to work with. But her line readings are often very clever. Emma Stone, who co-starred last year in Superbad, proves herself a talent to watch here. But after those two, no one else is particularly funny. I did like the film's almost 1980s-like feel, almost like this was a Revenge of the Nerds for girls. I just wish it were funnier.",The House Bunny
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Cute and fun, but unfortunately doesn't stand out",6,26 August 2008,"Ever since I saw the trailer for The House Bunny back in May, I was looking forward to seeing it, this looked like a fun comedy and we all love Anna Faris, this girl is just adorable, and she makes comedies a lot of fun. So I saw The House Bunny yesterday and I did enjoy myself, but we've done this before, the dumb blonde story, not that we can't do it again, I'm just looking for something a little fresh. But Anna Faris holds herself so well with comedies, The House Bunny, she doesn't seem to enjoy herself as much in this role. A lot of the moments where she acts stupid, she looks a little uncomfortable at times, I think that's why this movie didn't stand out as well as other dumb blonde comedies. But it's mindless entertainment, the message, it worries me a little, I'll explain why in a little bit, but I'd say if you're a grown up and you know better, than this is a fun little movie.Shelley is a hot playboy bunny whose life is just grand, she's a sweetheart, a little on the slow side, but always has good intentions, and when it appears that Hugh Hefner wants her out of the house due to her age of 27, she must pack up her things and take off. She's homeless, but finds a local sorority that needs a house mother and a clue into a social life. She becomes their house mother and teaches them how to attract people, but she learns a little something too when she meets a sweet, smart, and sensitive guy, Oliver. Now things become a success with the sorority, but they become a little too shallow and Oliver wants more than a playboy bunny, he wants a girl to talk too, and to top that off the other sororities are upset to learn that the former losers are now hotties that everyone loves.My one problem with this movie, even though it is enjoyable, the message isn't appropriate for young girls. I know it's just a movie, I don't want to nit pick, believe me, I know when a movie is harmless, but it's teaching young girls that you have to play yourself down to get a guy and that looks will get you everywhere at any time, also we are rooting for a person who just always has good intentions, why? That's all Shelley is, just a nice person, but she doesn't have many likable qualities. I liked the movie over all, I just think the script needed more work, nothing about this movie stood out, it's a disappointment to me. I would recommend it for silly fun, but otherwise, just wait for the rental.6/10",The House Bunny
14,blanbrn,"Funny comedy. A fun yet light hearted film, that proves a change in place and lifestyle can bring out emotions and make a person love a new life direction!",7,23 August 2008,"""The House Bunny"" is clearly a feel good light hearted comedy that most viewers will have fun viewing even though it seems a little to fairy tale. You have the young and sexy sweetheart Anna Faris as Shelley a sexy and gorgeous blond even though slow and dim witted lives a life of party and luxury enjoyment as a playmate at the ""Playboy"" mansion. Shelley seems to have it all with no worries then one day she receives a letter(which was later found to be written by a jealous playmate)that she's being kicked out of the mansion by Mr. Big that's right Hugh Hefner who plays himself. Well now it's a journey of search and discovery as Shelley tries to gain acceptance into the college world of sororities, as she's first rejected by a studious and sassy group headed up by a witch like leader played by veteran Beverly D' Angelo. Shelley then wonders upon a broken down and ugly looking sorority house that houses a group of social misfits and some pretty ugly looking chicks! But she's determined to make her new nest and learn the girls the tricks of the trade and do a makeover of their looks and she starts by doing a fashion transformation! Gradually this once house of misfits becomes the hottest and coolest house on campus, and in return the girls return the favor by educating Shelley with books as she gets some brain to go with her beauty. In then end this proves to be a great lifestyle change that brought out the emotions of a beautiful young lady it proved she could learn the smarts to start a new direction for her life and others as it ends on a note of happiness just like a good fairy tale. Overall pretty good film that's funny with some good one liners and witty lines it just doesn't take things serious either and the appearances from Hef and D' Angelo are good yet the sweetheart star that makes us all tingle and blush is the cute and sexy Anna Faris who made it worth a watch.",The House Bunny
15,sddavis63,Mindless And Empty,2,15 March 2010,"Near the beginning of the movie, Shelley (played by Anna Faris) is called ""vapid."" Setting aside the fact that the definition of the word ""vapid"" has more to do with being dull or uninteresting than anything else, I believe the writers were intending to use it to mean ""dumb"" or ""stupid"" or ""mindless"" or ""empty"" - you get the point. The joke is that Shelley takes it as a compliment - the 100th time she's been called that she says proudly. Those who made this movie would undoubtedly be proud to be called that as well, because that's clearly what they were going for. Now, I have nothing particularly against dumb, mindless movies. They can be a lot of fun. This one didn't make it, though. It seemed to settle for being dumb and mindless, and it forgot the fun for the most part. The story is that Shelley is a Playboy bunny living with Hef and the girls in the Playboy mansion when she's suddenly kicked out - too old, apparently. She's just turned 27, and ""27 is 59 in bunny years!"" (OK, I admit it - I chuckled a bit at that line.) She ends up finding a home as house mother to a local sorority. It's the most unpopular sorority on campus, filled with misfit girls - and Shelley has to save it, because it's so unpopular that it's about to be closed. To do that she turns them into their own version of Playboy bunnies. Aside from that one line, I really didn't find too much amusing here, although I actually did appreciate Hugh Hefner's presence - at least it demonstrated that he's willing to poke fun at his and Playboy's image. I suppose one also has to give credit where credit is due - as I said, ""vapid"" was what the makers of the movie were going for, and they succeeded (using the word in its more proper sense of ""uninteresting"" or ""dull."") From my point of view, though, this represented 97 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. 2/10",The House Bunny
16,Robert_duder,"Cute and brainless, it just happens to be a pretty good time!!",8,4 September 2008,"As soon as the trailers started for this film I had to admit to myself that it looked cute and fun and I wanted to see it. Fortunately the movie happened to meet every one of my expectations although my expectations were probably pretty low because you have to know going into an Anna Faris movie let alone one called ""The House Bunny"" you're quite likely not going to be blown away and critics are not going to rave about it although many of them commented on Faris' performance for being a comedic actress. Expectations were also raised knowing that House Bunny was written and created by Karen McCullah Lutz who penned the amazing Legally Blonde, and the hilarious (one of my favorite films) She's The Man (see my review.) While I don't think The House Bunny had the same level of comedy or intelligence as the other two listed films I'm not sure it was meant to. Even still the movie is chock full of very funny performances, a cute story with the typical mushy ending that just happens to make it a lot of fun. It definitely aims for a certain demographic in teen girls and it likely will have them squealing with joy. Somewhere out there this is probably a lot of peoples favorite movie.Anna Faris has definitely come a long way since breaking onto the screen in Scary Movie. She has done a little of everything and is starting to prove herself as a very talented comedienne. As The House Bunny she leads the film flawlessly. She is very watchable...and as many reviewers have pointed out...she looks stone cold hot. This is really the first time she's shown off her body and it's impressive but her talent goes way beyond that. She can do physical comedy, and one liners flawlessly and although most of her performances, including this one, are rather brainless, she is sweet and cute and watchable. The girls that are subject to Faris' House Mother are really terrific. Kat Dennings is terrific as sarcastic loner Mona, Rumer Willis shines as movement challenged Joanne, Dana Goodman is disturbing and fun as over sized Carrie Mae, Katharine McPhee also fits in great as pregnant outcast Harmony, but the real star out of the group of them is Emma Stone who is just downright hilarious and almost outshines Faris. She clearly does comedy flawlessly and looks great doing it. She has some classic moments in the film and is the one you will remember. Colin Hanks doesn't exactly get a big role as Faris' love interest other than setting Faris up for her jokes but they are cute together and Hanks does a good job (and looks so much like his Dad!) There are plenty of cameos from Playboy including the man himself, Hugh Hefner. There is a sub story about Faris' character being ousted from the mansion because of a jealous fellow model and that aspect of it is rather weak. The story focuses more on the misfits and their gradual moving into ""normalcy"" with the help of the Playboy bunny who can make them outgoing and sexy. The story is a little shallow and they do try to make it less shallow with the last few scenes where they can be ""the best versions of themselves"" but it still comes across as shallow. Nonetheless there is plenty of laughs and outrageous moments and the movie is chock full of terrific, classic one liners that will leave you in stitches. Don't go to The House Bunny with outrageous expectations. Take it for what it is and you'll have a good time!! 8/10",The House Bunny
17,bowmanblue,"Low-brow, puerile, nonsensical... and actually quite fun",7,22 May 2014,"I probably should find some sort of way of taking my name off this review. I am ashamed to admit it, but The House Bunny is actually quite fun.Anna Faris plays Shelley, a Playboy Mansion 'Bunny' who has been thrown out of the mansion for being too old ('old' meaning 27 - probably about right in the eyes of Hugh Hefner). She then goes on to act as 'house mother' to a bunch of 'unattractive' girls in a nearby college. She then goes on to help them prove themselves in the eyes of their peers, who constantly put them down for being such losers.It's possibly the most predictable story ever. Everyone should hate this. And everyone probably would if it wasn't for Anna Faris. Not only is she an added attraction for male viewers (just check out the pictures to see what I mean), but she's actually quite lovable. Many a blonde actress has played a blonde bimbo, but she carries it off without being too over-the-top and stupid. Yes, she makes the odd gaffe here and there, but you can't help warming to her as she does mean well in all that she does. In fact, some of Anna Faris' lines and mannerisms are downright hilarious and she would almost carry this on her own, had it not been for Emma Stone who compliments Faris' glamour in her 'geekiness.' Yes, this film is as dumb as any that openly puts a Playboy Bunny in the lead role. But it knows that, right? And anyone who watches it should too.Basically, watch it, enjoy it, laugh at it, but don't necessarily tell your friends you did.I'm now off to watch some arty foreign film with subtitles - just to try and convince myself I really do have taste in films.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The House Bunny
18,MLDinTN,Anna Farris needs more leading roles,7,1 July 2009,"Anna Farris was good in this. The only other films I remember her having a large part in were the scary movie franchise. She's funny and likable on screen. Instead of giving good roles to people like Kate Hudson, Anna Farris should be getting her fair share.Shelly (Farris) is a playboy bunny whom is soon to realize her dream of being a November centerfold. Right after her 27th birthday party, she receives a letter from Hef asking her to leave. So, she takes up residence at the Zeta house and becomes their housemother. The Zetas are in danger of losing their house and must get 30 new pledges. The few members are weird and goofy looking. Shelly teaches them how to dress sexy and talk to boys and throw parties.As it turns out, Hef didn't really send the letter. Another bunny wanted Shelly's centerfold.

20,A_Different_Drummer,This review comes with instructions,6,9 June 2015,"This is a belated review, entered in 2015 after a second viewing.Here are your instructions: If you have seen the movie and are looking for validation, and you 'get' the rating (6) skip the review. You don't need it.Otherwise, if you are newbie or have a different view, you can proceed to these comments: 1. OMG. It's as if a couple of writers had taken a week off to ""map"" the arc of Faris' career (which was pretty solid UP TO THAT POINT!) and concluded, hey, she can do it, she can carry an entire wacky comedy on her own, she has the looks, she has the talent, and no has ever given her a chance. So let's do it.2. Above, I explained how this film came into being. What I neglected to add was what happened next. The script. It looks like it did not get beyond the first draft. It reads like it did not get beyond the crayon stage. It contains lines like ""the eyes are the nipples of the face."" Having spent all their energy deciding if Anna could do this film (and yes, she could have done it, she did do it, and it is a pity she did not have better material) there seems to have been no time or budget left for a proper script. Anna was sent into battle with no live ammo. The rest is history.3. There an Amanda Bynes film called Sydney White which is very similar. Here is the thing. Side by side, compared one to the other, the Bynes film becomes an amalgam of Citizen Kane and Mean Girls. Not that it is so great (it is actually pretty good, but making a point here!) but simply that House Bunny is so bad.4. Bottom line, for Faris' fans only, and I know there are a lot of you. She tried. But she was fighting impossible odds. But she tried.",The House Bunny
21,inkblot11,"This Bunny is funny and will please fans of light, silly comedy and romance",7,21 August 2008,"Shelley (Anna Faris) was abandoned as a baby on someone's doorstep long ago. As she relates, no one was interested in getting her back although they did request that the basket be returned! Shuttled from one orphanage to another, Shelley eventually found a ""family"" when her womanish figure came into fruition. That's right, Shelley resided in the Playboy mansion and found happiness with Hef and the other gal pal housemates. However, one day Shelley receives word that Hef has given her two hours to move out of the mansion. A fellow worker at the residence suggests that, perhaps, she is getting too old to be a bunny. After all, didn't she just turn 27? And, isn't that like 59 in ""bunny years""? So, off Shelley goes, hurt and scared. After a day on her own, she stumbles onto a nearby college campus and learns that she could possibly find a job, a home, and a salary by becoming a sorority ""mother"" to a group of misfit sisters. These gals, the Zetas, have seen their numbers shrink, mostly because they are all shy and a bit unconventional (among them, Katharine McPhee and Rumer Willis). The college has already told them that if they don't find new members, the Zeta house will be shut down. It is going to be Shelley's biggest challenge to turn the sorority into an attractive place for the new students. Can she do it? Perhaps, Shelly could ask for the help and advice of a nursing home director, Oliver (Colin Hanks), a nice man she met in a park? After a brief, blase beginning, this film packs a good punch of light comedy and romance. Part of the credit should go to the very nice cast. Faris is wonderful in her role as the dimwitted bunny who has more than enough smarts to learn a few new tricks and Hanks, in a smaller role, is quite nice as the love interest. The Zeta girls themselves, especially Rumer Willis and Emma Stone, are a delightful bunch of offbeat creatures that learn some lessons themselves. The rest of the cast, including Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo, is good, also. The costumes, naturally, are very fine, as this is a gal-dominated movie and clothes are especially important. But, the sunny sets, cinematography, screenplay, and direction are up to snuff as well. No, it's not Willie Shakespeare but the flick is definitely a good diversion from the everyday blues. It's a likely bet that you will find this ""Bunny"" to be quite funny indeed.",The House Bunny
22,Floated2,"not very good, something went wrong",2,31 July 2010,"The House Bunny is a movie about Ana Faris being a playboy bunny. So after being evicted from the Playboy Mansion for being too old at 27, Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) now homeless, has little choice but to move into the Zeta Sorority House, whose seven misfit members risk losing their house unless they receive thirty pledges from potential new Zetas. So in exchange for living there, Shelley dedicates herself to the task of making the Zetas popular to help them attract pledges. An orphan whose only real home has been the Playboy Mansion, Shelley is incredibly naive with no real world experience, and is therefore the ultimate archetypal dumb blonde character, trading one comfortable environment for another. From the same writers of Legally Blonde, The House Bunny attempts to imitate the success of the former. Unfortunately the film fails on all accounts.Legally Blonde was successful largely due to Reese Witherspoon's likability, subverting her dumb blonde image in the film. The House Bunny makes no attempt to dispel this stereotype: Shelley tells the sorority girls that popularity is increased through higher levels of attractiveness. The film is also hugely clichéd: there isn't anything that hasn't been seen before here. Complete with the typical cheesy montages in which the characters toil as inspiring music is played, the film is entirely formulaic. The film is completely predictable from the start, with no surprises whatsoever. Anna Faris is not particularly likable. However, now given a feature length film, the increase in screen time just serves to highlight her lack of talent as an actress. Shelley is irritating, stupid beyond belief and not remotely funny. The biggest laugh in the film comes unintentionally from Hugh Hefner in a cameo role, who actually manages the feat of failing at playing himself. Emma Stone (Jules in Superbad) does well enough with a terrible script; whereas Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce, is given little opportunity to show off any acting abilities she may possess.Overall 'The House Bunny' is a poor film that brings nothing new to a tired genre. It was boring and could have been much better",The House Bunny
23,insomniac_rod,The producers of the movie should thank Anna Faris!,6,24 January 2010,"I really expected more from this one. Truth, it made me laugh, I got all the black humor going on, the always working ""dumb blonde saves the day plot"", and more.In order to enjoy the movie you should keep in mind that you will have to take it for what it is. I mean, the plot is very, very silly and nothing is interesting about it. It's predictable, non-creative, but you should enjoy it when Anna Faris tries to save the day. Faris is sexy, funny, has a hot body, and delivers a decent comedic performance. The situations in the movie are extremely silly and you lose interest pretty soon with some of them but believe me, Anna saves the day.The resolution towards the main situation (saving the house) is beyond ridiculous.Maybe as a guy my point of view is kind of bitter but I tried to be objective. I enjoyed the movie because of Faris's performance, some funny scenes (I'm a goofhead) and because Kat Dennings, Emma Stone, and the American Idol chick were very, very hot wearing those mini skirts. Watch this movie if you have nothing better to do.",The House Bunny
24,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Faris' talents help to balance the stereotypes,5,10 July 2009,"One of the running jokes throughout ""The House Bunny"" is that several characters call Anna Faris' character Shelley vapid, and she takes it as a compliment. I would venture all the creative minds behind this film would react the same way. ""The House Bunny"" is shallow, inconceivable and so formulaic that even its bimbo protagonist could apply it correctly to a math problem -- but it knows it, has fun with it and manages to come off cute.Anna Faris plays maybe the most extreme dim-witted main character ever to grace the screen, but she does so with utter conviction. Her performance is unflinching and completely dedicated to the horrible stereotypes and dumb humor that despite not inducing many laughs (minus a few acceptably clever puns), she manages to win our favor because she actually looks as if she means it. Faris has created a full, complete and complex character out of one of the worst Hollywood stereotypes in existence. Major kudos to her.Produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison (yes, some of his usual cameos appear in the film), ""The House Bunny"" is another image obsessed teen/college girls' movie from the writers behind two of the best films of the genre: ""Legally Blonde"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You."" Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith clearly know how to write girl-driven comedies in a way that doesn't insult most movie-goers taste. ""House Bunny"" is about the closest they've dipped to that level however, at least compared to the other two films.The film is about a rejected playmate who, now homeless, gets a job as a house mother at a local sorority that is dying and full of rejected girls. As par for the course, she uses her shallow ways to give the girls and their house a complete makeover from rejects to hotties (despite our bewilderment as to who's footing the bill). Her services include how to flirt with boys in way that terribly degrade themselves and insult the men they're after, using water bras and exploiting their bodies for philanthropic (a word Shelley has trouble with) purposes. The turnaround, however, causes the girls to lose sight of who they were (we were wondering about that too ... ) and come to a conclusion at some point that they can in fact be beautiful and smart -- imagine that.It's like when Olivia Newton-John comes out at the end of ""Grease"" and embraces the bad girl sex symbol look and we all shake our heads because that's not how it's supposed to be. For much of ""The House Bunny,"" there are some serious messages that girls under 16 do not need to be mixed up with and though it tempers them with the ""middle ground"" attitude, it doesn't -- like most formula comedies -- do so convincingly in the end.Makes you wonder what an actor like Colin Hanks is doing in the middle of this trashy pop girls-night flick, but in honesty he's a relief with all the fake tanning, Juicy-wearing stench that overwhelms the film. But to be honest, the cast of girls here is rather talented: Kat Dennings (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), Bruce and Demi's daughter Rumer Willis, pop vocalist Katherine McPhee and Emma Stone of ""Superbad,"" who shows the most promise of all these young actresses with her convincing performance as Natalie, the house leader who wants the best of both worlds -- she's a lovable nerd and a risk-taker. As horribly processed and packaged as ""House Bunny"" is, it certainly has the guts and talent to stand by the risqué morals it's built on.",The House Bunny
25,Anonymous_Maxine,"Actual quote deemed appropriate for kids 13 and up - ""Eyes are the nipples of the face!""",2,28 August 2008,"There's a scene in The House Bunny where a key character inquires as to whether Shelley is, in fact, ""that dumb."" One of her fellow sorority sisters immediately stands up and says, indignantly, ""She's not dumb!"" This is an important scene, and my immediate assumption was that we, the audience, were meant to shake our fists at the screen and say, ""Yeah!"" But then I remembered that for well over an hour by then, the movie had been scrambling frantically to get us to laugh at how genuinely and spectacularly dumb she is.This is a contradiction that permeates the entire movie, with strange results. When I saw that scene, I was immediately relieved that I had found the movie up to that point so completely unamusing, otherwise I would have felt guilty for laughing at this girl, who, I understand, is ""not dumb.""So, in order to flaunt my superiority, I turned around in my chair and shook my fist at the drunk, cackling teenagers at the back of the theater and yelled, ""Yeah! She's not dumb! See? You little punks!"" Strangely, this only brought more laughter.The House Bunny, by the way, is PG-13, which should cause the majority of the male audience to lose interest entirely and confuse anyone over 17 as to why anyone would find such a movie interesting. The story is centered around the life of a Playboy bunny who is ousted from the Playboy mansion. Playboy's founder himself, Hugh Hefner, plays a sizable supporting role. Would one be out of line to expect a little gratuitous nudity? In this case, yes, because this is a soft porn movie for kids age 13 and up. Nice.The story is basically Legally Blonde in a sorority house, so it's obvious that the movie's message must have something to do with superficiality and obsessions over appearance and other such nonsense.Shelly, played by Anna Faris, is booted out of the Playboy mansion and finds herself homeless, so she decides to shack up with a sorority of uncool girls and teach them how to turn themselves into male fantasies.It's sad that the movie fails so completely because there is so much potential there, but, unfortunately, they just don't know where to stop with the cartoonishly overblown outcasts. These are not your typical college nerds, these are girls that don't know better than to walk up to some guys in a bar and say, ""Hey, where's the crapper? I gotta drop off some timber.""Timber!!!I feel like, in order for the comedy in a movie like this to be successful, we need to be able to point to a few characters and say, ""Hey I know someone like that!"" Not in this movie. You don't know anyone like anyone in this movie. But you have, however, seen people like the people in this movie.Remember that goofy teen comedy She's All That? One of the cool kids takes a bet that he can take the ugliest, most uncool girl in school and turn her into the prom queen. So we meet little Laney Boggs, the weird art student always covered in paint and unable to get a date to save her life. Zach, the cool guy choosing to accept the mission impossible, has his work cut out for him. But  surprise!  she takes off her glasses and combs her hair and she's hot! What a relief that the transformation was so easy!When we meet the girls of Zeta Alpha Zeta, they are genuinely frightening social outcasts. Bitter, confused by social interaction, and more clueless about fashion than your average homeless person, they are quite a spectacle to behold.But, surprise! Wouldn't you know it? With the addition of the right, ahem, outfits, a little hip hop bumping in the background, and just the right amount of slow motion, they're all crazy hot! Who would have guessed?Interestingly, it isn't until the very, very end of the film that you will truly realize how purely and incredibly meaningless it is. The movie is about Shelley's efforts to turn a group of social outcasts into frat party favors, but then it tries to feed us this message about not worrying about what other people think and just being yourself. What the hell?Beginning with the story about a Playboy bunny that just happens to be rated PG-13, everything in the movie cancels out everything else. There's a scene at the end that is meant to tie everything together and make it all make sense, but it is one of the biggest forehead slappers I've seen in recent memory.I've noticed lately, particularly with movies like Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder, that there are a lot of new things being done in the comedy world. The House Bunny is unsurprisingly unaware of these new ideas and experiments and is merely feeding us the same childish tripe we've seen countless times before. One can only hope that, since they are now resorting to a PG-13 Playboy theme, they must surely be running out of ideas.",The House Bunny
26,lisafordeay,An average silly yet OK movie,5,7 February 2014,"Anna Faris whom people may remember her from as Ryan Reynolds Britney Spears cloned girlfriend,plays Shelley in this cute teen comedy. Shelley is a former playboy bunny who's just celebrated her 27th birthday. But when Shelley receives a letter from the boss of the playboy mansion(yes folks Hugh Heffner is IN this MOVIE!!)it states that she is too old for playboy and must leave the premise. With nowhere else to go only her old car that's a banger she of course stumbles across a sorority campus. The first campus doesn't want to hear of her while the other place which has Emma Stone,Rumur Willis,Kat Jennings and former winner of American Idol Katherine McPhee in it she of course decides to be their sorority mother.Like in a lot of teen comedies nowadays the girls that Shelley stays with are pretty average geeky chicks and with the help of some make up and hair extensions they turn into real life Barbie dolls(actually one part reminded me of that 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls with Lindsay Lohan getting a makeover)and try and do a campaign to stop their sorority house from being taken from them by their other sorority campus ruled by some bitchy chick who wants to sabotage their house the Zeta.Overall this film whose producer is YUP you guessed it Adam Sandler along with his buddy from The Wedding Singer Allen Covert who also produced Hotel Transylvania,this flick is really all not that bad and I think this is Emma Stone's debut movie as I never heard her do any movies in 2004 or 05 or 06. I give this movie a 5.Also starring in this movie is Tom Hanks son Colin Hanks who plays Shelley's love interest.",The House Bunny
27,FiendishDramaturgy,Vapid? Yes! Fun? Yes!,7,14 March 2010,"Anna Farris really shines here. Superficially, this is a pretty decent little piece of fluff. If you can wade through the sophomoric mentality and bimbo philosophies, you will ultimately find a bit of substance with an appropriate lesson. The question becomes more a matter of determining the worth of the lesson versus the amount of fluff through which one must survive in order to reach it.Frankly, this is one of my guilty pleasures. Anna Farris is adorable here, and I love watching her attempt to get some form of control over her myriad personality flaws, unique perspectives, and a lifetime of misinformatinally directed shortcomings and misconceptions.All in all? This is a lot of slutty sexy fun, with a little kernel of goodness at the heart. NOT suitable for the kiddies, though, as the teaching vehicles are quite adult in nature. There are better things to do with your time, but this IS entertaining.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The House Bunny
28,Polaris_DiB,The Blonde Not in Her Best Form,3,11 August 2011,"The intelligent blonde comedy has some unrequited gems and shouldn't be entirely dismissed as a genre. Clueless works because you can tell Cher's mind is just a little too distracted by fashion, but once she gets the gears in her head rolling she's really a bright and compassionate kid. Legally Blonde, scripted by Karen McCullah Lutz same as this one, works because Elle's ditziness does not ultimately give her a get-out-of-jail free card with the other characters and she eventually has to focus up and do something about herself. Buffy the Vampire Slayer works because because she has to give up fashion to slay vampires....though I guess now I'm stretching it a little.This movie has all of the fish-out-of-water elements of the blonde comedy but is very much lacking in the charm. Most of it has to do with the clichéd script (the last ten minutes is line-for-line other movies), but its biggest problem is that it rests on those elements with a lot of assumptions about the characters (and the audience) that just gets on your nerves. For one thing, partially because of the Internet, geeky girls are no longer as readily considered losers; heck, even back in high school the most popular chicks in my grade level were the ones that joined speech and debate, student council, and MESA. The sort of cheerleader/jock POPULAR, everything else NOT dichotomy possibly still subsists as some endemic part of American culture, but it's harder to see now and not as believable as it once was. The character of Natalie and her gushing geekiness in some scenes seems exactly like what's popular right now, save the situations where they put her in front of boys and make her downright retarded. Then of course there's the guys, few of which are really attractive because they don't do much but be attractive. Ah well, cannot have everything.Anyway, the story focuses mostly on the character of Shelley, orphan turned Playboy bunny who gets ousted from the mansion due to backstabbing and has to make her way in the real world, stumbling upon a college campus (where nobody ever seems to do any homework or have any definable majors) and discovering the enchanting world of sororities, a more brutal and backstabbing place than the otherwise homey feel of the Mansion. She takes the freaks and geeks Greeks under her charge and teaches them the good values of fashion sense, self confidence, and only revealing 40% of their intelligence (actually she tells them to be downright nitwit dumb, but they decide to ""compromise""). This is the script Simpsons episodes are made to make fun of--remember the one where Homer has to return to college? The ""Oh it's funny 'cause she's a dumb blonde"" antics and general social awkwardness of the characters is just something you take in kind with this genre, but where this movie just completely collapses over its vacuousness is the part in all of these intelligent blonde movies where the outlier intelligent guy sees through the fashion to the real person underneath. Again, Clueless actually builds the biggest character beats of Cher's development around her step brother, Legally Blonde has the somewhat believable Emmett offering to help Elle out, Buffy the movie has Pike, but this movie has Oliver (Colin Hanks) who I could not believe for a second had any patience for Shelley's just absolute craziness. The antics go too far and Oliver is given no room to deal with them but just sit there with a strained expression on his face, looking just as miserable to get through these dates as we are. So the emotional core in which these stories reside, in the real human underneath the makeup, is gone. Making the movie pretty much a redundant exercise in all the obnoxious parts we merely sit through.Then there's the house girls, who were actually well cast and it was nice to see some different body types and how they showed alternative ways of making them fashionable, though the three leaders of the pack (girl with the brace, girl with the piercings, and head of the house) ended up looking more like hipsters than fashionistas. I'm not buying the, ""Well let's just be like 40% ourselves and 60% what Shelley thinks guys like."" There can be a real sense of style behind fashion that is oftentimes discredited but it requires personality and self-expression that not revealing your intelligence is a good indication you don't have. So even the messages of empowerment here are mucked up.The end is lazy lazy clichéd redundant boring done to death bad. Whoa. It gets worse when sycophant to villain girl switches her sides as some statement to the heinousness of villain girl, not that we ever realized that sycophant girl was THERE.Finally, the cinematography is surprisingly bad for a mainstream movie. Shelly Johnson seems to be trying to light the Mansion and the Zeta House ""naturalistically"" and instead is commonly blowing out the frame on the lower half of the characters (the half we're not supposed to be looking at since its their faces that matter). I think for the wide shots and setting the space such a Spring day look is fine, but how much does it take to block the characters a bit out of the way of the windows so as to avoid being blown out? On the other hand, this is the exact type of stuff you're not supposed to be spending time pondering while watching the movie because the story should be involving your attention, so there's that. --PolarisDiB",The House Bunny

30,meeza,"The Movie Rabbit Test of ""The House Bunny"" barely passed! Thanks to Ms. Faris!",7,15 February 2009,"""The House Bunny"" is about as girlie as they come in the film industry, but there were a few bunny features to hop into the film while others were in the atrocious skip-out category. Pleas be warned: I have been known to be called ""The House Punny"" so there will be an overwhelming amount of corny puns in this film review of ""The House Bunny"" as there are in all my film analysis reports. Anna Faris stars as Stacey Darlingson, an attractive and I.Q. challenged Playboy Bunny who suddenly gets the hefty Hefner boot from the Mansion. ""Stacey No I.Q."" (only 80's dance fans will get that one) then inadvertently enters a college sorority house and befriends, yes you got it: sorority sisters of Zeta Alpha Zeta. These sisters though are down on their luck and about to lose their sorority house until Stacey the House Bunny spreads her bubbly magic to help them not bring down the house. The attractive ""eary"" one even helps the sisters in transforming them from nerdy plain Janes to house hotties. Faris was far-out in numerous scenes but at times did overextend her ditzy acting welcome. However, Anna was the centerfold centerpiece on my marginal recommendation of the film. None of the supporting performances were cover thespian material except maybe for the up-and-coming Emma Stone portraying the Alpha Zeta ""alphadictorian"". But this is where I am going to disrobe ""The House Bunny"" with trashy underwear commentary. Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's screenplay had the same formulaic female verbose as other middle-of-the-pack chic flicks. Director Fred Wolf probably did cry wolf by not being handed a more ingenious screenplay; even though Wrong Said Fred probably thought he was too sexy to grab onto a female driven waistline, I mean plot line.

The movie starts with Anna Farris's character being falsely evicted from the Playboy mansion with a false letter from Hugh Heffner claiming that she is too old to be a centerfold;in reality, it is a conspiracy from jealous rivals. She winds up on a college campus interacting with college sororities, and she tries out as a den mother with a couple before ending up with a reject sorority in danger of losing their house. They both teach each other how to fit in and ""make over."" Faris's scenes with the sorority are hilarious, and she finally finds a place to fit in.

Everyone can see, from the get go, that Shelley would turn the girls into popular chicks-- it was more than predictable. One of the few aspects I liked about this film is Faris' enjoyable and innocent character, who made me hardly laugh in the dinner scene, specially when she tried to pretend to be smart.

34,lewiskendell,I liked it more than I should have.,6,27 March 2010,"I like The House Bunny, but I admit that it's not that great of a movie. The plot is about as basic and predictable as they come. There's an attempt at a positive message somewhere in here, but it gets muddled under a few conflicting ideas. It's not as funny as it could be, not very clever, and rarely original. And what was up with the soundtrack? Several times, a song would start playing in the background that had absolutely nothing to do with what was going on with the characters. Weird. But like I said, I still liked the movie.Anna Faris is the cause of that goodwill. I'm a huge fan of hers. She's my favorite comedic actress, and it doesn't hurt that she looks absolutely incredible in The House Bunny. I'm a male, and a pretty woman with a sense of humor and a body like that, is going to make an impression on me. I'll readily admit that I'd love to see her do more dramatic roles (Shelley falls squarely into the type of character that Anna has played in many movies), or maybe just a more subtle kind of comedy. But she is very good at this wide-eyed, dumb kind of humor, and The House Bunny would have been much more of a dud in my eyes, without her. As I said, this is by no means a great movie. For fans of Anna, I say check this out. Otherwise, it's not really worth recommending on its own merits. I'm just a sucker for Ms. Faris and her goof-ball antics.",The House Bunny

Faris is the heart of the movie. Without a doubt, without her, the movie would probably fall apart. The movie offers nothing new, but it's hard not to just like it for what it is. Sure, some jokes fall, but most are pretty funny.Anna Faris does a brilliant job in her role. Her comedic timing is perfect. What you may realize as Faris as an actress is that she's playing the same basic role, also playing a dumb character in the Scary Movie franchise. She plays the same roles, yes, but they never EVER get old. The ensemble cast also holds up the movie. Each of the sorority sisters are funny in their own unique way. The ones I like the most are Emma Stone, Katharine McPhee, and Rumer Willis, probably because they are the most known ones in the cast, I'll admit. Colin Hanks also does a good job in a comedy.As said before, the person who makes the movie well worth watching is Anna Faris.

37,hall895,"Too tame, too lame",4,7 February 2013,"The House Bunny is a possibly decent R-rated comedy trapped in PG-13 hell. Seriously, a Playboy bunny in a sorority house...PG-13? Not to say that this had to be an all-out raunch-fest stuffed with endless vulgarity and nudity. But this is a movie which desperately needs a little edge to it. Instead it constantly approaches the line of good taste and then scurries back to safety. For this movie to work it had to go over the line now and again. As it is things are played way too safe.Of course even if the movie did take a few more chances it was still never going to be any kind of great cinematic revelation. All you're hoping for is a few laughs and the movie fails to deliver them. The story follows Shelley who has been recently evicted from the Playboy mansion for the high crime of being, at 27, too old. She ends up as house mother to the Zeta sorority girls. The Zetas are, to put it bluntly, losers. Shelley has to whip them into shape lest they lose their charter and their house to the mean girls from Phi Iota Mu. Once that story sets itself up there's no drama, it's obvious where the movie's headed. You wouldn't mind the inevitability if the movie gave you solid laughs. But it doesn't. Anna Faris is game in the role of Shelley but she has so little to work with. The script is lousy, the jokes fall flat, the supporting characters offer very little help. Emma Stone is really the only other performer to come away with any credit at all. She plays Natalie, the most normal of the loser Zeta girls. The rest of them are just absurd, and not in a funny way but rather in a stupid way. The two male love interests, one for Shelley and one for Natalie, are total duds. Hugh Hefner proves to be such a terrible actor that he can't even convincingly portray Hugh Hefner. Faris has enough charm, charisma and comic chops to save the movie from being truly wretched. But the movie, afraid to take risks, never really had a chance to succeed. Loosen up, embrace the Playboy storyline, go for that R-rating. Instead all we get is an endless series of tame, lame dumb blonde jokes. This movie was never going to be great. But it surely could have been better than this.",The House Bunny
38,crossbow0106,See It For Anna Faris,7,30 August 2008,"Anna Faris has been carving out a pretty decent career since being the star of the first ""Scary Movie"". Even better, she has become prettier and more assured as an actress. This film is about Shelley (Anna), a Playboy bunny who is duped into believing Hugh Hefner, who is in this film, wants her out of the mansion. She stumbles around till she just happens to get a job as a house mother for Zeta House, the worst sorority at the local college, full of misfits. The story takes a familiar turn, with Shelley glamming them up and making them popular. They still need to pledge 30 co-eds to survive and the leader of another sorority doesn't want them to succeed because then they'd get the house for themselves. Again, familiar stuff. The Zeta girls, including Rumer Willis, Haylee Duff and a very pregnant Katherine McPhee, are not as appealing as Anna Faris, but thats okay, its Anna's film. Its not perfect, some of the dialogue is silly. But, the film has heart, and I enjoyed it. Perfect for fans of ""Legally Blonde"" type films. Thankfully not raunchy, its worth your time to see it.",The House Bunny
39,MrGKB,Unexpectedly appealing nonsense...,6,7 April 2009,"...mostly by virtue of the comedic charms of Anna ""Scary Movie"" Faris, who has turned into quite the comely wench these days. In a nutshell, the story involves Faris as a Playboy Bunny who's been underhandedly booted from Hef's mansion to fend for herself, and ends up as the unlikely housemother for a nearby sorority house that needs to rustle up 30 new pledges or face disbanding. This silly business is presented pretty much as a fairy tale, and plays like one straight through to the end. Nothing is terribly believable, the characters and events are all fairly one-dimensional, and few of the jokes and situations are outrageously funny, but somehow, for me, it all somehow jelled and I have to consider the two hours (counting cigarette breaks) reasonably well wasted. ""House Bunny"" sports a fair amount of sexist humor (in both directions), Ms. Faris' remarkably appealing body and sense of humor (""Oh-lih-ver!""), and just enough production value to belie its B-movie core. This ain't no ""Animal House"" (what is, beside ""Animal House?"") but it's good for some laughs. I have to give it a ""6"" just for not trying too hard. Geek factor: ""House Bunny"" features scenes shot inside the real Playboy mansion, including (presumably) Hef's master bedroom. Yee haw.",The House Bunny
40,DarthBill,"""But I'm 27...""",5,4 February 2009,"Shelley (Anna ""Scary Movie"" Faris) is a busty blonde bimbo with a heart of gold but doesn't have an IQ to match it. Orphaned at an early age and never receiving a proper education or a proper dose of healthy adult relationships due to her initial 'ugly duckling' appearance, her life only turned around for the better when she blossomed into a good looking woman with a great body, after which people became nice to her purely out of lust and, from there, she became a Playboy Bunny, and lived in a blissfully ignorant paradise ever since. That is, until she is tricked into leaving the mansion by a jealous rival after her 27th birthday, thus robbing her of her dream of being the Miss November centerfold. Venturing out into the real world for the first time in ages, she goes from spending a night in jail after a misunderstanding with a cop, then wanders onto a college campus after following some girls who vaguely remind her of herself and her fellow Playboy Bunnies. After making a very bad impression and being rejected for a house mother position by one of the elder stateswomen of the campus (Beverly D'Angelo), she is then recommended to trying the Zeta Alpha Zeta house, which is currently lacking a house mother. The Zeta House, a decaying wreck, is the home to a group of seven social misfits who don't understand boys or fashion. Initially the Zetas don't want her either, but when they see that Shelley can attract men, the girls, specifically their bespectacled red haired nerd leader Natalie (Emma Stone, you might remember her as the nice popular girl that Jonah Hill lusted after in ""Superbad"" in addition to her work in ""The Rocker""), decides to take her in as their house mother, hoping that they can learn from Shelley the art of beauty & winning the hearts of boys - even though Shelley appears to be even more socially inept than the Zeta girls and her ability to win men's hearts is based more on visual beauty than anything else - which they hope in turn will lead to getting the necessary pledges to save their house from being closed down. Anyhow, Shelley transforms the social outcasts into hard partying hot body babes that just about every guy on the campus can't help lusting after. During this time, Shelley and Natalie seem to become particularly close - even after Shelley humiliates Natalie by accidentally revealing to the campus community very loudly that Natalie is still a virgin. The Zeta girls in turn try to help Shelley get the education she's always lacked so she can win over nice guy Oliver (Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks). In time however the girls start to realize that they've changed themselves too much, which leads to a falling out with Shelley, who has been asked to come back to the Playboy Mansion so she can be Miss November while the other bunny who plotted against her is kicked out. Shelley goes back but finds that she no longer relishes her old Playboy life, meanwhile the Zeta girls, who are now trying to blend the best of their true selves with what Shelley taught them, have been sabotaged by their bitchy rivals, which provides the convenient set up for the girls reconcile with Shelley (whom they missed anyway) and together they unite to turn the tides that save Zeta house. Happy ending all around, Shelley even gets a 2nd chance with Oliver.Lightweight, sporadically funny film plays out like a female version of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", and may have actually worked better in the 1980s, though I admit the frat college comedy genre isn't really my thing. Some will undoubtedly be offended by the film's apparently mixed message to young girls/women about using their sexuality alone to get what they want and then chastising itself for it. Still, one has to admire how Anna Faris, who appears to be the Goldie Hawn of her generation, throws herself into the role of an almost too thick headed to live bimbo with reckless abandon. Of the actresses playing the Zeta girls, Emma Stone makes the biggest impression as Natalie, the red haired virgin with glasses. Stone, who looks like she's being groomed to fill the void of cute red head that Lindsay Lohan left vacant after her sad downfall, brings an honesty and sincerity to the role of a socially confused young woman still trying to understand herself, and brings some much needed heart & soul to this admittedly uneven romp ""haves"" fighting ""have nots"". In short, she gives the most natural performance, perhaps because her character is the most normal & sane one in the film. Her chemistry with Faris is undeniable and the friendship that develops between the two feels genuine. And the fact that Stone is easily the most attractive of the Zeta girls doesn't hurt either, not that the others are ugly by any means.",The House Bunny
41,tbills2,The House Bunny is a Fun and Sexy way to spend your time!,7,22 May 2013,"The House Bunny should pleasantly surprise you. It saves itself from being mediocrity with an invigorating sense of humor. Not relying on too many strict movie-picture components, it cares mostly about having a little fun. It's a cultural splash, widely agreed upon as being pleasing. The House Bunny has very vibrant visuals. What I am saying is that The House Bunny is good and funny, and Anna Faris is hot, hot in it. The scantily clad Faris is pretty good at playing a ditsy, flirty Playboy bunny. Anna is so hot and so funny. Emma Stone comes to age in 1 of her first, renowned roles. Emma is clearly cute and she's so legitimately funny. Sooo funny. They could not have cast 3 better girls for the friends than Kat Dennings, Katharine McPhee and Rumer Willis, seriously, and I hope to see more of Rumer in the years to come. Colin Hanks is fine for the viewing, but I would have liked a better choice for the part. He's no Tom Hanks, haha, just kidding. Beverly D'Angelo adds her authority to the mix. The House Bunny has a couple of strong moments I love. When the girls get their makeover and you first see them walking through campus, I think my jaw dropped to the floor, and at the end of the Aztec party when they're all dancing to ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"", whoa. The songs in those 2 scenes are critical to them being so good. Also, at the very beginning of the Aztec party when Anna Faris is up on the balcony shake, shaking it, she reminds me of Gandalf from LOTR:ROTK when the White Wizard stands high up upon the White City's terrace with Pippin as they survey the Dark Lord's massive army. No kidding! I really liked The House Bunny and it's easily rewatchable. It's appropriate for teenage girls as long as you can forgive some sexiness steered towards the boys.",The House Bunny
42,jpschapira,About Anna Faris...and a film,6,14 April 2009,"I've been unfair to Anna Faris. She's one of America's best contemporary movie comedians, I've seen a lot of her movies and haven't written about many of them. She has natural grace, she's gorgeous, the screen loves her and she always gives that love back. Even when she's not playing comedy (the case of ""May"", for example), she always adds a touch of sassiness to a role, as if she knew there's a clown inside all of us.""The House Bunny"", the first film she's ever produced, is accommodated for her display; every little things revolves around her and we can never get enough. Besides, it's a movie in which she creates her perfect clown. She's Shelley, and although the credits list Darlingson as her last name, we never hear it. But why would we care? She's one of Hef's bunnies, lives in the Playboy Mansion and one day gets kicked out. In the real world (that means, the opposite of how Shelley describes the mansion: paradise), she meets a group of girls who need to save their sorority home in college and offers them help (which constitutes the general plot of the film). She also goes on a date with a sweet guy named Oliver (the gifted Colin Hanks), who asks her who is she planning on voting. Shelley answers: ""I don't know, I won't listen to what Simon says, he's so meanI usually agree with Paula and Randy"".Faris doesn't turn in an excellent performance, but I'm quite sure there isn't another actress who can pull this one off nowadays. Her makeup helps and makes her look like a totally naive and clueless girl, and at times -and this happens to me with some of the 'real' Playboy Bunnies- she doesn't even look pretty. But as her character is the only one that's really developed, she gets all the juice out of it, making her lovable but also embarrassing; kind but helpless. However, what defines Shelley in the end (and this is to Farris' credit) is an irreparable will and hope that everything will turn out well.The movie itself though is kind of empty, like its main character (yes Faris develops it, but not for one second she tries to be smarter than the nature of the character). The script (written by the talented people behind ""10 Things I hate about you"" and ""Legally Blonde"") doesn't know if it wants to mock a known stereotype as the 'playboy girl' is or if it wants to tell one of the typical college stories, with love relationships and parties included. Anyway, the stereotype is there, and so is the love and the parties, with the downside of lack of character development.The main character is, as I said, the most developed, but some scenes that could have showed another side (especially one musical montage) more fully, don't take the risk. And there's also the sorority girls, a lot of different women with personality played by some of today's hottest and also most talented young actresses, like Kat Dennings (from ""Raise your voice"") or Emma Stone (from ""Superbad""). Even American Idol's Katharine McPhee has an important part; and sings an original song in the end Director Fred Wolf did a great job with the music supervision.

46,bopdog,Pleasant but uninspired clichés,6,23 August 2008,"Definitely a genre movie, ""House Bunny"" comes across as more flat than stale. That is, the humour is mild, the plot is kind of vague, and there are some pleasant moments. One or two chuckle out loud moments, even. But alas, no belly laughs. Nothing exciting or remarkable happens. It's like a cake that had the leavening fail--- it isn't bad, it just didn't rise to the occasion fully. One eats such a flat cake and recalls the taste and fullness of a proper cake. Typically in that situation one doesn't complain, but one is, nonetheless, not completely satisfied, either.I like Anna Farris. The other 7 girls in the Zeta house were meant to be quirkily drawn characters. They were, but I kept wondering how did this disparate bunch of young ladies ever come to move in together in the first place? Come to think of it, how did this group of ladies ever even MEET each other? This is the kind of ""silly"" movie that one attends just to see interesting, goofy characters doing silly things. ""The House Bunny"" was silly enough, with all the elements usually found in such university sex-drugs-drink comedies. The Zeta house ""ugly ducklings"" come alive under Farris' character's inspiration, the villainness in the rival sorority was gorgeous, and also had a misleading innocence and kindness in her face... etc., etc.Instead of the ""slow hand clap,"" this movie had a twist toward the end--- the ""slow pledge stand."" Misunderstandings abound, and get cleared up in due order. Blah, blah, blah. All the clichés. Again, not at all bad, but less than stellar.The clichés would be OK if the movie was just a tad bit funnier, or MORE somehow. The movie basically had a good heart.

47,innocuous,Not so good even if you don't care about role models.,3,30 January 2009,"Even when you move past the issue of a movie portraying poor role models for young women, THB is just not very interesting, funny, or clever. It has a lot of potential for satire, but doesn't step up to the plate and deliver.Overall, the cinematography, acting, and production values are quite good, though not of Oscar caliber (in spite of what some other reviewers have stated.) What brings this film down is the slow pace and the lack of direction in the script. It just doesn't go anywhere. That by itself is not fatal to a movie, but it does mean that you need to entertain people along the way. THB doesn't titillate and it doesn't dazzle you with cleverness. No profound points are made. It just meanders. By the point that Faris was discussing blueberry pancakes at the mansion (which is only a few minutes into the movie) I was already looking at my watch and calculating how much longer the movie would last.Of course, I feel this way about everything that Will Ferrell has done, and many more films, but I really like Faris and was hoping that THB would turn out better than this.

Sure I knew she could play dumb real good but who knew she could radiate warmth and generate so much sympathy in such a role. It would've been really easy to go over the top and play the Bunny as a sexy clown but instead Faris imbues her character with the naiveté of a puppy, and I just want to hug her when she trips over her feet or says something stupid.The humor in this movie is unfortunately uneven, as if they didn't know if they wanted to make a smart or a dumb comedy, or rather, a smart dumb or a dumb dumb comedy. There were a lot of great lines but almost as many cringe-worthy ones, though now that I think back on it, I realize I fondly remember the good scenes and can't even remember which the bad ones were.

I should have known by the Playboy theme from the start that this would be nothing more than exploitation and a cynical exercise in Hollywood marketing, but I refused to believe Anna would stoop so low.However, low she has stooped and it is not a pretty site.

To sum it up, THB is basically an Adam Sandler movie for girls, with Anna Faris breathing life into an otherwise flat movie with her uncanny comic ability and unbeatable charm. In short, she makes the movie watchable, and in some moments, likable and entertaining.I see this film as one that most will easily dismiss without a second look, and I really discourage you from doing that. Anna Faris alone deserves your attention in this movie, as she is brilliant. I even heard a few people in my theater say that she could get a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy. I honestly wouldn't be surprised. She's lovable, adorable, intelligently stupid, and of course, roll on the floor hilarious. She's the reason the Scary Movie series is so much 'better' than the other movies in that series (Date, Superhero, Epic Movies), and her charm and charisma carries over here.In addition to Faris, the strength of the film is the supporting cast (except Hugh Hefner, who gets a pass for simply being Hugh Hefner). The funny thing is, most of the performers aren't even actors. I'm not going to lie and say Rumer Willis is brilliant, because she's not, but she's funny and is good looking enough to surprise us. Katharine McPhee doesn't get enough screen time, but she does do a great job with what she's given. The last of the 'non-actors' is the frontman for The All American Rejects, Tyson Ritter, who is tolerable in a bit part.Now, unsurprisingly, the best supporters are Kat Dennings and the WONDERFUL Emma Stone (Jules from Superbad). Stone is so likable and adorable that she's the best character in the movie after Faris. Colin Hanks is...well, I for one was surprised that he did this movie, but he was an asset nonetheless.I'll go ahead and get my complaints out now. First and foremost, whoever edited this movie is absolutely terrible. Whether it be changing hairstyles, continuity errors, or bad cuts, the editing is noticeably bad, especially towards the end. I also didn't like the direction the script took in the end, as it turned the film into a parody of itself (which was weird considering the entire film was a parody of stupid girls and stupid men), and displayed several out of character moments. The jokes were a tad lame and predictable outside of Faris's character (there was NOTHING bad about her), but it was okay. There were some smart jokes that actually took some time to get.The final plus for this movie is that it is LOADED with cameos. Since you know who the production company is, you already know the group that will be appearing, plus a surprise appearance from 2 NFL quarterbacks (one retired QB, and one current) in the beginning. All in all, The House Bunny is surprisingly funny, all because of Anna Faris and Emma Stone, both of whom have very bright futures ahead of them. Faris is definitely one of the funniest ladies alive.",The House Bunny

It is stupid, hypocritical, appallingly acted, woefully scripted, and has one of the most intrusive soundtracks of popular tunes I have ever heard. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets all gooey at the end. Yes, this is The House Bunny, your one way ticket to hell. Please check your bags at the entrance.So, Anna Faris transforms six ugly college girls into sexy ladies so they can get thirty pledges to save their Zeta house. This involves the baring of as much flesh as possible, and acting like brain dead morons so guys won't think they're too smart. Of course, there is the usual assortment of nasty bitches who try and vandalise the scheme, and the cliffhanger where Faris must decide whether to stay with her sisters or be the centrefold and tour around Europe. If you think she's gonna do the latter, you need to watch more Hollywood movies. Just not ones like this.Nothing works, from the pathetic jokes about such topics as pregnant bellies to the dopey love interests. And when it tries to pull a switcheroo on its morals and gives us the old lecture about ""staying true to yourself"".. I almost barfed up my cornflakes. This is a film where the main character is showing off most of her tits in nearly every scene, where her young protégés only find self-worth by dressing like hookers, that depicts all men as being brain-dead sex-obsessed numpties, and they have the cheek to administer an Aesop over not giving into peer pressure?!

Ending up at the Zeta sorority house, a house in desperate need of pledges and money to stay open, she helps the girls, all outcasts at college to become sexier to get what they need, while they help her with a guy she has a crush on.....The House Bunny shouldn't work. It's got a mixed message, suggesting that girls need to use their sexiness to get what they need, while at the same time saying being yourself, with some confidence, and you can get the same. So in that sense I don't think it completely works.However, it is very funny in places. Anna Faris is showing herself to be a very funny actress, and keeps the humour coming through-out. Hers is the best performance here. The actress's who play the girls in the house are all different, but give good performances too, with the possible exception of Emma Stone as Natalie, the girl in charge of the house. It's not that she's a bad actress. I saw her recently in The Rocker and she was very good there. It's just that here, she seems to be trying too hard to portray the 'nerd' side of her character. It's not a bad performance, just a little uneven.The script has some good one-liners in it, and director Fred Wolf keeps things moving at a brisk pace. It's not the funniest teen comedy I've seen, but it has enough moments to keep you smiling, and for it's running time is an enjoyable movie.",The House Bunny

Now it's her show and she doesn't disappoint.The movie is dumb, cliched and rehashed from every other school/college movie you've seen before. But it has Anna Faris and she fits well to the concept. It has Emma Stone (which became a wonderful actress) as a sidekick but this is the Anna Faris show.Bottom line: it did what it meant to do - it made me laugh, a lot!!!",The House Bunny
59,robertallenandersonjr,A guys perspective on the sexy house bunny,10,22 August 2008,"The House Bunny was one of the funnest and freshest movies I have seen this year. It had many good laughs. That wasn't the best part of this movie though it was mostly the humor and Anna Faris. She did a terrific job playing the character of a playboy bunny. She gets kicked out of the playboy mansion because she was to old. Their were some fun unexpected turns this movie took. It was very cute and very fun to watch. Emma Stone was very good as well and she added a lot to this movie. She looked very good and was extremely funny. The whole movie was good. The cast was good as well. This movie didn't really have to many flaws at all that i can think of. I think in my opinion this was the best chick flick comedy I have seen. I would see this movie again just to see the cast and the funny comments they make. This movie had way more facial expressions and comments that will make you laugh. Anna Faris was definitely funnier than she ever has been in this movie. The visuals were very cool as well. This movie was fresh, original, funny, fun and very sexy. I would say go see this movie at all costs. Don't miss out on this one it was great. This was definitely a great chick flick for teen aged girls to see. Enjoy this one I know I sure did.",The House Bunny
60,C-Younkin,Faris is good but the movie doesn't make her a centerfold,6,23 August 2008,"""The House Bunny"" has a funny concept and what looks like a ""Legally Blonde"" form of execution. If Anna Faris, most commonly known as the one portraying/making fun of the Neve Campbell ""Scream"" role in the ""Scary Movies"" was ever going to become the next big female comedienne the time would be now. She showed she was willing to make fun of herself in those movies but I still wonder if she can play a sincere, actual human being rather than a character meant to be the punch line most of the time. ""Bunny"" was written by ""Blonde"" screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith so that could be good news but a lot of the weight of this movie is going to rest on the shoulders of it star. Reese Witherspoon made that movie what it was and the big question here is, can Faris do the same? She plays Shelley, a ditzy playboy bunny with big dreams of becoming the next centerfold who instead is tossed out on her ass by Hugh after her 27th birthday. Shelley went from the orphanage to the mansion so she never quite got the fill gist of the outside world. Now homeless and with very few survival skills, she has no idea what to do next. Just through happenstance, she encounters something that looks like a mini Playboy mansion but is in fact the best college sorority on campus. They decline her for house mother but she finds a home with the Zeta sorority, a group of misfit girls, led by Natalie (Emma Stone), who seriously need to improve their image and attract new members in order to stop the college from closing their house. Enter Shelley to give the girls make-overs.This movie made me laugh out loud twice. One involved the manhole cover joke in the trailer, and the other was a really good jab at Bob Saget. The rest of the movie is likable and has a nice message but really can't seem to wring that many laughs out of a good premise. It's a parody against the bimbo ideology, first having Shelley turn the girls into mindless, skimpy-looking prostitutes only to realize later that you also have to have substance too. Sometimes it gets a few chuckles and other times it comes off looking embarrassingly sitcom-ish, like when Shelley tries to look brainy to impress a guy by wearing very thick glasses that make her dizzy, but overall the script isn't as smart or funny as ""Legally Blonde"" and that hurts its chances. The movie also treats some of the secondary characters in really bad taste, like a girl whose such a misfit she actually talks like Frankenstein and walks like Igor, and I was confused by some others, like a girl who supposedly is bad with boys and yet is pregnant.I was also confused by the mental abilities of the main character. At times she seems dumber than dirt and at other times she seems almost profound. That she works regardless of this has less to do with the script and more to do with Anna Faris. I don't think this will be the star-making role I thought it would be for her but she gives Shelley a very sweet, genial nature and she is willing to throw herself into silly situations with an innocent and goofy charm. Emma Stone is also pretty funny in this movie, dialing up the dorky meter to about an 8. I feel bad for Colin Hanks though. This kid just doesn't seem to be getting many chances to shine, and here he's wasted as the romantic lead in a movie that's pretty low on the romance.""The House Bunny"" begins, middles, and ends like most college movies do, just unfortunately its not funny or clever enough to distract from the generic plotting. Most of the secondary characters are also wasted as well but maybe, it will put Anna Faris on some people's radars. She is a very funny comic actress and with the right script, its possible she could be the next big thing.",The House Bunny
61,winstonfg,Dear Anna...,9,3 April 2011,"Dear Anna,I just saw you in 'The House Bunny' and have to say: I thought you were great.This movie had disaster written all over it until you showed up, but somehow you managed to turn it into a ""Funny bits of Scary Movies meets Legally Blonde"", and you know what? It worked; and I thoroughly enjoyed myself for an hour an a half.No, it probably won't win you any Oscars; but it was sunny, cheesy and very infectious. And I think you're, like, a total babe, as well as being a damn fine comedienne.One word of advice: Being a graduate of UW, you're plainly no Shelley, so I hope you'll have the sense to be very afraid if anyone suggests a ""House Bunny 2"". This was a once off, and not to be repeated.Thanks again.Love Winston.PS: Please tell the other girls (especially Emma Stone), if you see them, that I thought they were great too.",The House Bunny
62,andell,"Cliché, but also Very Cute!!",7,27 August 2008,"I had mixed feelings about going to see ""The House Bunny."" On the one hand, the film played out in commercials and trailers in a very tweeny tradition like ""She's All That"" (or whatever that movie was called) by casting some obvious cool/hot girls in the roles of dorks! On the other, the film featured Anna Faris, who I'd argue has always done her best work in parodies. Here was the opportunity to see her stick it, so to speak, with one of the institutions most deserving of parody: the Playboy institution! Well, I saw the film and I have to say that as vapid and predictable as it is, it is also sweet, sincere and usually quite funny.The rundown on the film works like this: Shelley Darlingson (Faris) is a Playboy bunny who, the day after she turns 27, is told in a letter to leave the Playboy mansion. On a side note, the Playboy mansion comes off as a socialist paradise for the pretty girls who are fed and pampered, but apparently have no real income or will of their own to count on.Poor Shelley leaves and, following a night in jail in which she suggests that a man (unknowingly assuming he is a woman) in drag would look better if he used less make up, stumbles upon a grouping of sorority houses. Regarding them as a mini-Playboy mansion, she seeks to be taken care of again, and is pointed to the sorority ZEDA.Of course throw in the tiresome cliché that ZEDA is about to lose their sorority charter because they are short 30 sorority sisters...and that the current sisters are rebels, oblivious or social outcasts, and you have a perfect storm for Shelly to walk into.Yes, the story is obvious, but Faris is fantastic as Shelley, trying to teach the girls to be 'sexy,' although what she really begins to teach them is a little deeper than that. And of course as the girls begin to get more popular, and ZEDA (which is what I think it was, though it may have been ZETA) begins to get more pledges, the sorority standards begin to get more exclusive, causing the girls to question what they have become, and to ultimately blame Shelley.Throw into this a rival sorority of exclusive snobs who is trying to take over the ZEDA house and so tries to ensure they lose their sorority charter, and the film plays like any other.That being said however, the film is still quite funny in parts, and very fun to watch.",The House Bunny

Shelley, a playboy bunny was evicted from the playboy mansion due to her age. She becomes a house mother for an unpopular sorority Zetas, once the soros seen Shelley grasp attention from boys.

64,Red_Flag,Fish out of water (Or Bunny out of hutch) story.,6,11 October 2008,"Anna Faris, or the only thing that kept me from walking out of thoses god damn Scary Movie film, teams up with Adam Sadler to make this painfully flawed but soothingly watchable farce about a Playboy Mansion housemate. The plot is like candyfloss, insanely twee and so sweet it could cause tooth rot. And, sugar-coated as it might be, there a certain level of charm and substance that makes this so watchable. Her name is Anna Faris. A female comedian corn with the comedy gene, and while some of the dialogue the writers have given her is awful, she makes it work.When Playboy playmate Shelley (Anna Faris) is unceremoniously evicted from Hugh Hefner's lavish mansion in order to make room for some younger beauties, her quest for employment finds her serving as den mother to an unpopular L.A. sorority in this Happy Madison production directed by Fred Wolf. Colin Hanks, Rumer Willis, Katharine McPhee, Monet Mazur, and Beverly D'Angelo co-star.The House Bunny is far from perfect; in fact it's riddled with flaws. The jokes far and few between and the plot wafer thin. It does however spot a shimmering soundtrack that will have you toe tapping for the whole hour and thirty minutes.In that sense it really doesn't outstay its welcome, its short and oh so sweet. Just like Faris character it really doesn't have anything clever to say but for what its worth it's a fun ride. If I were to compare it to another film. Only one really comes to mind. Legally blonde. A perfect timewaster therefore, for anybody longing to see part three of the legally blonde saga.Directed by the stand-up comic-turned-moviemaker Fred Wolf, last seen bluffing his way through semi-improvised junkpile Strange Wilderness, and written by the pink-powered screen writing team that brought you Legally Blonde, 10 Things I Hate About You and Ella Enchanted, The House Bunny's central premise is as rickety and well-worn as Hef himself.But Faris' considerable comic talents and endless frilly outfits fluff this workaday cautionary tale into an easy-watch whirl of sweetness and light colours. Speckled with sugary sentiment and gormless gross--out gags, it's not the star vehicle our leading lady truly deserves, but she gamely rides it for all it's worth. Ken McIntyre Faris' comic talents make this an easy-watch whirl of sweetness.VERDICT: A short sweet ride that will have some angry because of its dumb blonde attributes but most will be satisfied with its moments of sheer hilarity and shimmering starlit. Fish-out-of-water formulaics are lifted by a starlet on the up. The story is pure bubblegum, but surrender to the silliness and you'll be endeared. A must for anyone who's been hanging on for Legally Blonde 3. No prise bunny by any stretch but far from the disaster most of us were expecting. Trust me, this isn't Scary Movie 5. Not by a long shot. If i were to complain it would be because Faris is not given enough good roles.",The House Bunny

66,jaywensley2004,High-concept wears bunny ears,9,30 December 2014,"""The House Bunny"" owes a lot to several movies of the ""naive wins out"" type. The best of these is ""Being There,"" the least is ""Dumb and Dumber."" The main character is guileless and often childlike, but not stupid. Anna Faris as ""The House Bunny"" portrays my favorite variation on this theme...the trusting romantic who lives simply but understands complicated. And she does so very, very well.Faris is a natural in this type of role, her particular form of charisma is of the wide-eyed woman/child. If you've ever seen a Marion Davies' movie, you've seen the origin of this character. Alyson Hannigan did a brilliant turn on this role as Michelle Flaherty in ""American Pie"". And Anna Faris' Shelly Darlingson is another great interpretation of the type. Shelly is all about rainbows and unicorns, but she understands thunderstorms and glue factories, and Faris makes the existence and success of Shelly believable. That said, the main plot of ""The House Bunny"" is outrageously unbelievable. But its ""that kind"" of comedy, hyperbolic and over-the-top. I would never recommend this movie for its depth of story, but Faris' performance, with the bonus of early Emma Stone, makes ""The House Bunny"" a movie that delivers smiles and cheers.",The House Bunny
67,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,The House Dummy,3,1 April 2020,"Basically this is a knock-off version of Legally Blonde, except here, our protagonist actually is a shallow bimbo, played by Anna Faris with a voice that sounds like a lobotomised Marilyn Monroe.Our 'heroine' Shirley Darlingson (Anna Faris) has been kicked out of her spiritual home, the Playboy Mansion, and finding herself homeless, she stumbles upon a college house and becomes housemother to a failing sorority, complete with the tired clichés of hot-girl who wears glasses and is a bit geeky (Emma Stone, probably the most likeable character in this and shows her talent for romcoms), a hardcore feminist with lots of piercings, girl in a full body brace, and a lumbering manly one who even after the obligatory hot makeover, is basically exactly the same.The problem with this film is that it can't decide whether it wants to be satirical or heart-warming, so it ends up being neither. Shelley is too stupid to function and Faris never shows any warmth for her character. The reason why Legally Blonde was so good is that Elle, despite looking like a 'bimbo' and having shallow interests, was actually intelligent. Here, the book is exactly as it is on the cover (both in Shelley's character and the film).As a compromise, the 'outcasts' of the sorority house, after having been turned into tarty bimbos, decide that they must dress up a little bit so as not to be so freakish outcasts. Gone are such 'geeky' things like glasses and body braces and hooray, they can get boyfriends, their only aim in life! Wouldn't want to scare them off by implying any intelligence.It's surprising to think this came out in 2008; it feels hopelessly dated in how it recycles its clichés, and purports to be supporting 'being yourself'- as long as you're a socially acceptable version of yourself.",The House Bunny
68,pressboard,Deer Caught in the Headlights - but a Funny Deer,7,22 August 2008,"As usual Anna Faris steals the show. As Shelley, a 27 year old Playboy bunny, she grows up starved for love and is adopted by (who else) Hugh Hefner - who is well known for his strong paternal history. She has a good supporting cast in her Zeta sorority sisters, but without her this movie would not have been half as good. The script has some high points but it is her face and delivery that raise this otherwise mediocre comedy into watchable/enjoyable status. It is good to see Anna getting roles that give her a chance to more fully showcase her comedic ability. I went solely based on Anna being in the lead role. One might compare this to Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde films, but House Bunny is uniquely Anna Faris and comparable only in that both women play ultra girly characters in their respective films. Although the other actors put in credible performances, when they are in the same shot with Faris, she outshines them all. I do, however, admit to having an Anna Faris bias. My wife and I both enjoyed this movie and recommend it if you are tired of comic book inspired action films and horror.",The House Bunny
69,Len9876,An empowering uplift with some funny and ironic moments.,8,22 November 2008,"I am gay, I keep God in the center of my life, and God loves me. God has taught me to love the beautiful and the handsome--but, more importantly, he has taught me to love myself and others for what they are inside. This film positively reinforces what God has taught me. ""The House Bunny"" (2008) is a light comedy, but it's not silly. This film demonstrates that someone can have beauty or brawn, and still have a brain. And, that someone can be proud, rather than carrying around heavy and burdensome guilt. That's right, a person can have intellect, intelligence and pride. As a gay person, I respect the beauty, the intellect, the intelligence and the pride of women, even though my sexual preference is for men. As a gay person, do I despise and hate women? Absolutely not! In fact, I absolutely adore Shelley (Anna Faris) and Hugh Hefner. I continually read everything that I can get my hands on, and am an avid subscriber of Playboy Magazine. Years ago, I was a volunteer for the Salvation Army, and the Playboy Club generously contributed to help others. Like Paul Newman, Hugh Hefner has quite a heart and quite a mind. Both Paul Newman and Hugh Hefner have an extensive history of charitable philanthropy. I'll never forget Paul Newman or Hugh Hefner for their generosity. I just happen to be physically disabled and, when I was a young boy, the Salvation Army left a gift package at my front door. My family was poor, and my mother had just died of ovarian cancer. I was only 12, and my mother was only 39 years young. My mother--the matriarch of my family--was my sun, my moon, and my stars. Her death was quite a loss, and the Playboy Club lessened that loss by contributing to the Salvation Army. And, Hugh Hefner even let June Allyson (my heroine, since I was a little boy of 5) stay at his home (Mayfair) in London. Years later, Paul Newman opened the Hole in the Wall Camp (near my home in Ashford, Connecticut) for the disabled and terminally ill children. Because of Paul Newman and Hugh Hefner, I found love at or close to my front doorstep. In ""House Bunny"" (2008), Shelley (Anna Faris) is abandoned as a baby on someone else's front doorstep. Like Steve McQueen (in real life), Shelley's only childhood home is an orphanage. But, as she physically develops, Shelley finds herself becoming more and more likable. And, as destiny or fate would have it, Shelley finds happiness and a family at the Playboy mansion with Hugh Hefner. Through a comedy of errors and ironies, Shelley becomes a sorority mother. And, through her guidance and wisdom, she guides the sorority girls in finding their rite of passage in the beauty of their inner and outer selves, in those around them, and in the wisdom of the world.The entire cast is marvelous--including Anna Faris, Katharine McPhee, Rumer Willis, Colin Hanks, Emma Stone, Christopher McDonald, Beverly D'Angelo and, last but not least, Hugh Hefner. The costumes are very delightful, and so are the sets. The script is funny, appropriately showing the joys, the disappointments, and the ironies of life. Both the cinematography and the direction are good. ""The House Bunny"" (2008) is definitely an empowering uplift--which, I think, those over PG12 will enjoy--and I rank the film an 8 out of 10.",The House Bunny

Shelley dresses in quite a provocative way but I don't think that it is a bad. The story-line is clever and funny. My favourite part of the film is where Shelley gives all the girls in the house a make-over. I think that Anna Faris' delivered a superb performance but saying that I thought all the actors were good. This is a great film for a sleepover with girlie friends.

72,longcooljolie,Mediocre comedy elevated by Ana Faris' unique talents,7,7 February 2010,"This movie was on HBO this morning and I thoroughly enjoyed it, felt really good after seeing it. Though it is populated by a large cast of young people and borrows elements from other movies about young, naive blondes and college hijinx, this is truly Ana Faris' movie.Ms. Faris seems to have found a niche for herself in movies like this. She has the right combination of intelligent wackiness and sexiness and comes across as lovable and adorable nonetheless. This is a very difficult combination to pull off, but she does it without really trying. Based on the types of movies she has been in, and what a cosmo article says about her, she is just as wacky-adorable in real life.The story is a little uneven, but this often happens in Hollywood movies where ten people fight over the script and you end up with a thrown-together consensus version. Nevertheless, ""House Bunny"" ends on a very satisfying note, with a few surprises.It was fun to watch the other girls in the house change after Ana Faris' character Shelley makes them over. Rumer Willis, especially has some funny moments, including one patterned after the famous ""Run Forrest Run"" scene from ""Forrest Gump."" Speaking of, Tom Hanks's son Colin plays a major role as Shelley's love interest. Another standout performance came from Beverly D'Angelo, who portrays a prim, starchy sorority leader.In all, though it lacks depth and a ""message,"" this is a good, fun movie and definitely worth a look.",The House Bunny
73,www-jats,it's good for girls to have a good night out,4,8 October 2010,"Having also seen the ultra-violent Death Race in the same week as The House Bunny I realized one big thing; clichéd violence doesn't offer any kind of real reaction whereas clichéd humor can still manage to make you laugh as long as the delivery is entertaining and fresh. Sure, the dumb blond jokes in The House Bunny are old and played out, but Anna Faris gives you continuing reason to laugh in a film that is far funnier than it really deserves to be. The House Bunny plays on the sexy-but-dumb stereotype to the fullest extent and Faris has proved in the past, as a regular in the otherwise awful Scary Movie films, she can pull this off. On top of looking amazing, Faris gives this film every reason to exist. Co-stars Emma Stone, Kat Dennings and the increasingly emaciated Rumer Willis offer up a couple of additional laughs, but it is Faris that leads the charge. She plays right up to the edge of the dumb blond stereotype and only occasionally tosses in one too many clichéd jokes. Nevertheless, you forgive her thanks to a consistent number of chuckles throughout the film.This isn't to say this is a classic comedy by any means, but anyone that goes to see House Bunny should walk away with a smile. This isn't a film to hate, it offers up exactly what the trailers promise and it delivers a little extra with an unexpected f-bomb dropped in the mix and a peek at Faris's little bum to keep the men paying attention.Perhaps the one major shock would be Colin Hanks; it seems those Tom Hanks genes aren't quite paying off just yet. After a decent sized role in Peter Jackson's King Kong, Hanks has only managed to worm his way into mediocre films at best. Then again, he hasn't shown anyone any reason to give him anything with more meat on it so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Katherine McPhee of ""American Idol"" fame plays a small role in the feature as does Beverly D'Angelo, but both are relatively inconsequential.The ladies in the audience are more likely to get a kick out of The House Bunny and the fellas dragged to the theater with them should be able to enjoy themselves as well despite the estrogen oozing of the screen. It isn't like this is a film you should rush out to the theater to see, but you could definitely do worse in your selection.",The House Bunny

76,ZekeRage911,Unless you ARE as dumb as the main character...,2,6 January 2010,"Where do I begin? Dear lord, WHERE do I begin? Okay, first off: Gross and embarrassing does NOT equal funny. If all you have for jokes are combining disgust and humiliation, you're not funny, you're Rob Schneider. And isn't HE just so successful these days? Second: Characters have to be, in some sense, believable. Wrangling stereotypes together and making them swallow this ridiculous premise isn't making a movie, much less a comedy. It's a bad SNL sketch. I mean a REALLY bad SNL sketch. Having characters that despise each other just work together for story convenience is bad directing on top of bad writing.Third: If you start your movie with hot chicks, and the story is about turning cows into hot chicks (sexist, I know, but that's the writer, NOT me) then the transition should make me want to laugh, not cringe. Though I'll admit, the metal detector-piercings gag was pretty funny, it was the ONLY joke in the movie that made me even chuckle.Fourth: Love interests have to have something called chemistry, even in THIS little turd of a movie. Aside from Anna Faris, was there even a casting director in sight of this thing? Were there even auditions, or did they just collect a bunch of people waiting for the bus. Which brings me to my next point: Fifth: Acting. Regular acting is hard enough. Comedic acting requires that you actually be funny, AND an actor! Just because Jerry Seinfeld got away with just being a comedian doesn't mean you can, too. For that matter, none of the characters in this movie seem to be comedians OR actors with the exception of the lead, and she's not exactly in top form. Even she seems to be wondering why she's in this dump of a movie.Sixth through one-hundred-seventy-five: Just to sum up, I'll do it this way: Talentless writing combined with talentless directing combined with talentless acting combined with mediocre sets, unconvincing motivations, bad pacing, bad dialogue... It's just bad. Maybe vapid valley girls think it's a cute movie, but honest to god, I haven't seen a fustercluck of a movie like this since Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. MAKE SENSE!

You know: Just a nice picture to adorn one of the calendar pages. But last night, the film played again on the Starz channel, and I swear that ""spanking"" shot has been edited out! I know I didn't imagine it. In fact, I downloaded that shot to my computer, two years ago, and I'm looking at it right now. So, WHY was it edited out of the current version of ""The House Bunny"" being shown on Starz? Other than that, I enjoyed the general tenor of ""The House Bunny"" while recognizing that it is no ""Gone With the Wind."" Anna Faris is adorable in the lead role of Shelley, an ex-Playboy bunny, who has found herself trying to be house mother to a sorority of losers in peril of losing their charter for lack of pledges.Shelley works patiently with her pack of misfits, turning them one by one into hot-looking babes, capable of attracting not only guys but also new pledges into their sorority. It's all very predictable and not a bit edgy; but the eye candy is nice, and it's a harmless way to spend a couple of hours.Colin Hanks, son of Tom, has a small role as the guy who's romantically attracted to Shelley and she to him. But he is given little to do, and does just that.Cheers, Dan N. (daneldorado93@yahoo.com)",The House Bunny
78,geoffgee,A touching and humorous film with plenty of colourful characters and an original story.,8,11 October 2008,"I really enjoyed this. The story is highly original and there are numerous interesting characters, each contributing to the film's humour.I found there also to be a surprising measure of emotional depth. Aspects of bonding to one's fellows, overcoming problems to do with low self esteem, and (conversely) the pitfalls associated with having an overblown opinion of oneself, are all included. I also found the occasional songs included were both appealing in themselves and punctuated the drama to good effect.Because of the situations she finds herself in after her expulsion from the bunny mansion, Shelly constantly has to 'make things up' as she goes along. I think Anna Faris acts this 'constantly groping for ideas' aspect brilliantly - making everything appear as if coming to her 'on the spur of the moment'.This is a super film which I hope to see again on the big screen at least one more time before the end of the month. Highly recommended for its humour, its characters, and its heart.",The House Bunny
79,criti-cally,"Funny, Cute and Girly {criti-cally reviews}",8,14 March 2020,"The movie was well above my expectation! I watched it through the end, and actually enjoyed watching it! The movie is funny, goofy, pretty and makes you ponder at some point too. Really!
The story is about Shelly, a girly, who's only mission in life is to be pretty and be featured on the centrefold of the November Playboy issue. As she explains her background story, Shelly wasn't really nerdy and an orphan with no one wanting to adopt her up until the age of 14, until she got puberty and became hot and ""Magically"" transformed into the dumbo she is. She was adopted by Hugh Hefner and got to live this new wonderful house, the Playboy mansion! But one day she receives a note that she's too old (27 years, which is like 59 in bunny years, duh) and she'll have to leave the house now. So, out of the house, and with nothing to know except be pretty and be a dumbo she finds herself on a university campus and taking over the most nerdy sorority as their house mother. Then comes the phase of how she helps the nerdy girls become a dumbo and teaches them to be pretty and be beautiful.
The story then becomes a little more complex and you see that Shelly herself is having a hard time just being pretty in the real world and has to be smart too, buttt that isn't her!
The movie kind of says that looks and beauty is important on one side and on the other also shows not too important, and especially not to dumb yourself down. It plays on the both sides of the fence and you can actually see the grey area, the balance that is required in the real world.
The sorority ZETA is worst one the campus before Shelly comes up. So bad that they have no pledges, no one wanting to join this year, and thus, their house is at stake and the future of their Sorority. Its pretty clear that they might not have any other chapters, and the death of this house would mean the end of their sorority.The girls, who are members of this sorority are nerdy, pregnant, short, shy, braced, tomboyish, etc. None of them are good looking, not even Emma Stone, initially.
Then comes in Shelly! The lost and confused dumbo who takes over their house and teaches the girls to be pretty. Anna Faris is a fine woman, with a hot body and she flaunts in the movie abundantly. She teaches the girls how to be pretty! She teaches them all the ""so called"" wrong things, but true things which the society teaches girls, to put on make up, does pretty, dumb yourself down to boys, act weak in front of them etc and it works! The girls and the sorority is hottest thing on the campus!
But this is where the movie takes a turn into the other side of the fence. Shelly starts liking a local boy who works at the local old age home. She takes the girls over who entertain those guys. Shelly uses her sexiness to win people. But she isn't able to win love. She fails miserably on her first date with Oliver. She tries everything in the book! From being dumb, to talking pretty, to flirting, but nothing seems to work! Shelly realises that being pretty is not the only thing out there, and there are boys who do like girls who are smart. Thus, the movie shows that pretty and dumbo isn't the only right thing, and for real world you need to be smart, thus reclaiming over the opposite territory.
So now the girls help Shelly learn new things, talk about smart issues and arrange a second for her with Oliver. Only now, Shelly plays the role of smart, nerdy girl too much. She divulges too much on the other side, which is completely new to her, and at the last minute. Of course it was going to go haywire (keeping it realistic!) The movie touches very real tones here, showing Shelly, trying to be something she's not, and thus failing at it. That's when the ZETA girls are also at home, going through their pledge applicants and rejecting them all based on their looks, when they realise what they've become! They've become just what they hated! Shelly comes back, devoted and humiliated and sad from her bad date, and the girls suddenly start shaming her that it's because of Shelly that they've become like this and thus, the already broken Shelly leaves the house as she gets a call from Hugh that it was all a mistake and she was the next Miss November! The movie here touches the grey area, the actual fence, between beauty and brains.
Shelly goes back to the house, but now, being a little experienced about the real world, about being smart, she didn't enjoy her dumbo playboy life anymore! The girls on the other hand, not having Shelly with them, were unable tackle and were losing anyway. They did realise however, that beauty and brains both work. Emma stone clearly loves being beautiful but also loves being smart in front of her guy.
So it does end up teaching the girls that it is actually this grey area, this balance required for proper sustenance in life. One step more to the other side and it is bad bad bad!
Overall, in the end, Shelly gives a big speech and is able to save the house and it's a nice big ol' happy ending!
A good watch nonetheless, and definitely not something you'd expect out of such a movie! I mean from no expectations to writing so much about the movie!
Definitely a good uplifting and feel good movie with good funny humour and goofy dialogues and scenes!",The House Bunny
80,dwremy,"Lighthearted, Silly Fun",6,25 August 2019,"This is a fun film-it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's the ""fish out of water"" concept but sweetly done. Anna Faris as a playboy bunny helping a sorority full of awkward girls gain confidence and popularity while being themselves with loads of wacky moments occurring. It's fine...Faris, Emma Stone, Bruce Willis' daughter, Kat Dennings, Katherine McPhee and more- a fun cast putting in the work to keep the silliness entertaining.
So don't take this seriously and have some silly laughs.",The House Bunny
81,anacpcruz,"In The Same Line, But Was Able To Be Inventive",9,25 October 2015,"In the same line of many young adult/ university movies, The House Bunny was able to be inventive and innovative introducing a little bit of the Playboy universe into the plot. However, we have a typical fight cliché between beauty and brains, and all the prejudice around that compel the characters to discover that the two characteristics are relevant and indissociable. I was glad to see Anna Faris growing out of the scary movie series, and also pleased to see Emma Stone established as an even more excellent comedy actress. I think she captivate the lights for herself throughout the film. Beyond that Faris did a great job portraying the confused beautiful blond stereotype that we see in comedies. But as a cinema lover I hope to see her in major demanding roles. Above all, the story and the scenes are fluid, light and fun for a relaxing afternoon with friends.",The House Bunny

83,goldwriting,Awkward Humor Wrapped in Pink Spandex,6,23 August 2008,"Searching for the right words to start this review made me feel as dumb as the main character in this movie acts. The House Bunny is a low-ball comedy pegged deep in a summer filled with high concept humor, but does it succeed as a welcome break? Yes, but just barely. Anna Faris stars in the movie as Shelley, a Playboy Playmate seemingly past her prime,who is unceremoniously booted from Hef's paradise. In her search for work in a world which is wildly beyond her understanding, she stumbles into a sorority house on the verge of losing its charter because no one, and I mean absolutely no one, wants to hang out with the girls who live there. Shelley sees an opportunity to bedazzle and befriend these girls, turning them into the popular chicks on campus, while the girls see Shelley as the last ditch effort to save their house. Sweatshirts turn to hot pants, frizzy turns to fabulous and piercings turn to pedicures. But, in an effort to keep some sort of moral along the way, both sides learn what it really means to be a family and how much value should be placed on what other people think of you. So there you have the basic idea, which is nothing terribly new. Beat for beat The House Bunny could be superimposed over other recent college romps as Accepted and Sydney White (the latter being a modern day re-telling of the fairy tale, Snow White). Not to say it doesn't bring anything new to the table. The supremely odd characters created inside the sorority are worth a look, if not a shudder. Anna Faris does what she does best, play people so mentally vacant, so completely oblivious that the sheer fact they can remember to breathe on their own is a gold medal worthy accomplishment (like the Olympics reference? they're everywhere!!!). In reality Anna is extremely intelligent and knows exactly what she is doing to keep her career moving along, in fact, she was an executive producer on this movie and I wouldn't be surprised to see her taking the reins even more in the future. From her first big pop on screen in the original Scary Movie, it was easy to see there was more to her than a beaming smile and big, pretty eyes. She plays her roles with a fearlessness most actors can only strive for. The biggest benefit to The House Bunny is her co-stars seem equally trained and willing to look as blatantly stupid as needed. Emma Stone, whom I just reviewed in The Rocker, brings on one of the most uncontrollably awkward characters in the film and alongside Anna delivers the hands down funniest scene in the picture. As hardcore as she looked in her last film, she's totally replaced it with social ineptitude on a magical level. Also helping to form out the rowdy bunch of misfits is Kat Dennings as their resident pierced, hoodie shielded, man-hater. Kat makes the shift through the film to uber-hottie a little too easily, but I think it was more due to not enough time to devote to her character, not the fault of the actress (who can also be seen co-starring in the upcoming Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist alongside comedy wunderkid Michael Cera). Finally, slipping in between the cracks in the credits, is Rumer Willis, daughter of action icon Bruce Willis. She also succeeds in being socially unfit due to her wearing a upper body metallic brace, possibly fashioned from some Victorian suit of armor. The main downside for Rumer is once the brace disappears, so does her character. Deserving a special mention is Dana Goodman, who plays Carrie Mae, a painfully funny mix of a lumberjack, a greco-roman wrestler, with a topping of Jim Carrey . They made no attempt to explain how someone so odd could exist, but we really didn't need one. Although the movie does level out and take on a level of charm, the opening thirty minutes are filled with some of the most painful and uncomfortable awkwardness I've been exposed to in a long time. It was there to serve the story and prove how socially oblivious these girls were, but the movie took it to such a level where I almost felt bad for laughing. Most of the opening gags were met with uneasy groans from the audience instead of chuckles and laughs of understanding. Once the girls make the switch from freak shows to femme fatales, the movie finds a much more familiar rhythm and plays that tune until the final credits. Another fault is the misuse in the cast of Kiely Williams and Kimberly Makkouk. Kiely plays Lilly, a mute girl who sends most of dialogue through text messages to the other girls. Her first appearance in the movie comes out of nowhere, or I suppose more literally she dives out of locked room off screen, but her initial outfit is terribly reminiscent of something the maid would wear in Gone With the Wind. The only reason this is worth mentioning is Kiely is the only African American actor in the movie. I'm not saying it was intentionally racist, just saying the wardrobe person took a nap through 400 years of her American History class. As for Kimberly, she plays Tanya, who has a whopping handful of lines in the whole movie and is only part of the outcast crew because she's tiny, somewhere near dwarf status. While some people might find the few height jokes in the flick worthwhile, it just wasn't enough to make her character necessary in the least. Recommendation: It's a silly comedy that does earn some stripes in the latter half, but be prepared to ache with awkwardness throughout the opening scenes. Uncomfortability is the name of the game here. If you're down for that, feel free to check it out, but you can honestly wait until video.",The House Bunny

85,puffball97,Agreeable Time Filer for Late August,6,22 August 2008,"I went with my mother and my nine-year-old niece to see ""The House Bunny"" in the early morning in a relatively empty theater where there were only women. Of course it won't be the most memorable movie I've seen, but for late August, it's not all that bad.Comedienne Anna Faris is perfectly cast as a carefree, big-haired and hare-brained Playboy bunny who after celebrating her 27th birthday (that's 59 in bunny years) at the Playboy Mansion, where she has lived much of her life, gets kicked out of there by yours truly, Hugh Hefner. With nowhere to turn, she looks at a sorority house that seems to resemble her previous house, only not as big. There, she accepts the job of a house mother to seven social misfits who make up the sorority Zeta Alpha Zeta. They need 23 more pledges before they are totally ousted as a campus sorority by the beautiful but snooty Pi Alphu Mu sorority.Do the clichés sound familiar? Yes, they do. It seems like the creators of this movie grew up on ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" one of my all-time favorite movies and the granddaddy of all jocks vs. nerds and losers who become winner comedies. So they decided to make a ""Nerds"" comedy a generation later with a feminist perspective. Faris's character, appropriately named Shelly Darlingson, first takes on all the wallflowers and makes them like her with flashy clothes, heavy makeup, costume jewelry, and platform shoes. At first, it is successful and boys fall for them. Soon enough, they see Shelly as frivolous and teach her to have brains as well as beauty. This leads Shelly to a forced, clumsy conversation with the man of her dreams (Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks). At the end of the movie, everyone wins except for the Pi Alpha Mu sorority.There is a fine cast. Anna Faris perks everything up in what could have been a total lamebrainer. Her appearance and high voice get laughs, but when she does a dead-on ""Exorcist"" voice by saying everyone's names in order to remember them, that is the real deal. Colin Hanks and fellow Hollywood Offspring Rumer Willis, daughter of Demi Moore (and looks a lot like her) and Bruce Willis, provide able support. Katharine McPhee, the American Idol Runner Up of 2006, is made first ugly, then beautiful, as one of the sorority members. Listen for an ""Idol"" reference in which Faris tells Hanks she listens to Paula and Randy and that Simon is mean. The rest of the cast is amiable as well. We tend to know more about Shelly and the misfit sorority than the snobby girls or the hunky boys. Small parts by Beverly D'Angelo as a snide veteran house mother and Christoper McDonald as the prissy dean are provided nicely as well.Now I would not put this on a must see list, but it is okay for a lazy day. As they dump out leftover movies for the summer, I would rather see this than a truly terrible one I was made to see with a friend - ""Stepbrothers,"" where Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly did nothing but scream their heads off and I was so exhausted the night before that I fell asleep and could barely stay awake. For ""The House Bunny,"" I was awake the whole time through.",The House Bunny

(2) Don't ask for more from this movie than you would the average, well, intentionally not that smart comedy.Anna Faris is basically adorable in this movie. Hilarious, too. And the cast of young actors features a lot of young women on their way up. Can't say much for the men in this movie, as Hugh Hefner as himself is the only male that isn't awkward and out of place. I hate to say this, but again I finished a movie and felt badly for Colin Hanks. Poor guy just doesn't belong on screen.The story is your generic Animal House/Revenge of the Nerds remake. A few plot holes, a few inconsistencies, but as I pointed these out I was reminded by the people I was watching with that the point of this film was not to be brilliant.

89,thundrmi,Delivers what it promises; escapist entertainment,7,21 December 2008,"I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot more of Anna Faris in the next few years. Also, we'll be seeing a lot more films like 'The House Bunny.' Why? sheer escapism- a cinematic attribute seen so commonly in Depression era Hollywood. Looks like we're headed for similar gloomy years in America, and audiences want to forget -if even for just 90 minutes- their all-too-real lives and finances. Also expect a lot of films about mansions, rich people, fast lane lifestyles and (pardon the seeming sexism)bubble-headed blonds with hearts of gold. 'The House Bunny' delivers delicious escape from plunging stocks and rising unemployment with a story that could have suited Carole Lombard to a Tee. The cast is adorable, the plot simplistic, and the screenplay is breezy and fast-paced. Central to 'Bunny's' success is Anna Faris who renews the dumb blonde character study with real warmth and underlying smarts. Cast otherwise, the aging bunny, Shelley, could have been annoying. A light touch in nearly every aspect resulted in an entertaining experience that won't disappoint anyone who actually reads the DVD case or other plot synopsis. A final word of career advice to a cast member: Rumer Willis should reconsider accepting roles that cast her as geeky, clumsy and less than attractive, like Joanne in 'The House Bunny.'",The House Bunny

Anna Faris is a hoot, and you can't help but love her. (She's the Goldie Hawn of the early 2000's)Everyone else in the movie ends up loving her because she's the epitome of goodness and loving. Even tho the movie is basic in it's good people vs their antagonists it works, and it's not meant to do anything but entertain, amuse, and make you laugh. I was expecting a rehashed Animal House, but it's not that at all. It's a feel-good movie all the way.

Fascination with gross bodily functions? Check. One dimensional characters? Check. Women portrayed as either sexpots, bitches, or sexless? Check. Incessant intrusion of songs to help make ""hit"" soundtrack? Check. Sappy sentimental moments as everyone ""learns what is really important""? Check. Laugh-free from first moment to last?

93,ss97-1,OK I admit it was funny,7,26 October 2009,"I really did not expect much going in. I really only wanted to watch it because Anna Farris is usually quite funny all by herself. She was great in ""The Hot Chick"" and usually funny in the ""Scary Movie"" flicks.In ""House Bunny"" Farris is her typically funny self, but she shows a lot more sex appeal then I ever thought she might have. And that gives her the ability to pull off ""Shelly"" a totally typical ""Playboy Bunny"" without any problem. I never doubted for a second that she was a ""Shelly"" so-to-speak...The rest of the cast is funny as well. Some of the girls in the sorority were so bizarre they were ""cartoon-ish""....but in a good way. All the actors played their parts well. No one really steals the show from Farris at any point as she is without a doubt the star but the entire cast was a pleasure to watch.If I have to have one casting complaint, it would be Colin Hanks. He got a bit of a short stick IMO. He was totally wasted in this movie. His character was woefully underdeveloped, and his scenes were mostly about looking oddly at Shelly. Hanks is too good of a comic asset to waste on such a small role. They should have expanded it more, or just used someone else because I kept wanting more......The entire Shelly/Oliver relationship was underdeveloped and lacking.All in all the script was pretty silly, and provided all the typical ups/downs of the usually fish out of water scenario. In this case it attacks both sides of the coin well enough. It points out the basic morality of judging a book by the cover and etc...etc...It never takes itself too seriously but it does provide a few overall messages.If you are looking for a fun movie with a few hearty laughs this is not a bad choice. Because lets face it, movies like this are designed to make you laugh for a while. There are a lot of small funny things going on the entire time, some original, some old school....but it tries the entire time. There are some moments that are very funny....Farris will force a few laughs out of you that you didn't see coming. But you have to like silly jokes. There is nothing here that might not end up in your usual ""Lampoon"" movie. It is what it is. But few things like the way Shelly remembers people's names are just out-of-left field funny.

But you might want to take a big scarf to the movies with you, so you can cover your face as you sneak in to this flick! A daft premise, this film has blonde Playboy bunny Shelley (played impeccably by the extremely funny Farris who will probably continue to do these dumb-dumb films - which is no bad thing as she's so fine at it) kicked out of her 'fairy tale' mansion by a bitchy saboteur who wants to take Shelley's place as Ms November. Farris stumbles upon a sorority house on her travels - Zeta Alpha Zeta - a veritable convent of geeks consisting of a bespectacled nerd, a pregnant pagan, a chick in a neck brace, a midget, a painfully shy wallflower, a multiply-pierced sociopath and a socially inept trailer-park she-man. On hearing that their sorority is due to be shut down due to an obvious lack of pledges, Shelley steps in to make the 7 dorks glamorous and cool. And of course she succeeds. The pagan suddenly becomes stunning, 8 months gone; the nerd becomes a cuter, poor man's version of La-Lohan; and neck brace gal (played by Bruce Willis' daughter Rumer)suddenly runs down the street in a skimpy top with her bosoms bouncing about like 2 drunk puppies in a sack. Though the jokes are geriatric the film doesn't skimp on stupid laughs - Carrie May (from Idahoooooo) is disgustingly funny and there is a very funny car-wash scene (wet pants competition, anyone?). Of course it is crass, silly and corny all the way through - were you expecting anything else? The only problem I had with this film was the boring sub plot involving sappy love-interest Oliver. This was an obvious plot device used to push the ""smart and pretty is the best combination!"" line which gets old pretty fast. In this respect the movie is a bit confused. It's OK to be pretty and slutty, but to a degree. It's OK to be smart and individual - but hey, let's not let standards slip, girls! It's a bizarre mix of vapid and soul-searching, pushing the same 'be yourself, but still look cute to get boys' maxim the Bratz movie of last year flew from the flag pole. That film was considerably more suitable for children though - we have an f-bomb, skimpy clothes, sly S and M and oral sex innuendos in House Bunny, so despite its cutesy-pie childishness at times, I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 14. If you want to watch something fluffy, plastic, glittery and covered in multi-coloured lip gloss that goes down great with a few gal pals, bottles of chilled rose wine and a few chocolates, this is definitely worth a look.

OK, so the story line is a bit silly, but Faris' Shelly makes it work. Not only does she play one of the dumbest characters to ever hit the big screen, but some of the one liners are classics i.e:""The eyes are the nipples of the face."" Faris proves here that she is a comic gem and a lot of fun to hang around with. Many people say that she has played to many dumb bimbos (The Scary Movie Series, Just Friends) and this is included, but if you can do it well and make it work then why stop?

98,beflin,Excellent comedy,9,20 August 2009,"I give ""The House Bunny"" a 9. It is very well written, with interactions among many different characters. I actually would have preferred a little more character development (or de-development) from the ""villain"" characters, one of whom is played by Beverly D'Angelo.Normally I would rank slightly lower a movie that resorts to so many popular musical numbers, such as three from The Ting Tings. However, ""The House Bunny"" makes efficient (appropriate, is perhaps a better word to use) use of all the background music.I watched ""The House Bunny"" on DVD, and all deleted scenes and featurettes. I was glad to see that it broke the 90-minute mark, but only just barely. I did come away from the movie feeling that it was a female-empowerment movie, for, even when women are cast as the main villains, the movie promotes a certain level of feminism.Quite surprising that most of this movie's ideas sprang from one mind - the mind of Anna Faris - since most movies these day employ a team of writers, but perhaps less so for these broad universally-appealing comedies.I did feel there was an inconsistent absence and re-appearance of the character Lilly. I noticed in the featurettes and many of the posing shots that she was mysteriously missing. So, I was a bit confused at times whether she was a member of Zeta Alpha Zeta sorority or not.Anyway, point is: I did laugh at a lot of the lines and even the sight gags.

Shelley works to revitalize a bevy of female misfits and transforms them into a viable force against a snobby rich-kid sorority and their egocentric house mother. In the process, she stumbles over herself seeking romance failing to realize that her inner self is the real prize. As she teaches the girls, they teach her how to be her in a symbiotic manifestation of balance.Among this, additional beauty of the film is Shelley's decision to place true friendship and virtuous values above superficial rewards. Her speech at the climax is the deliverance from being a mere ""meteor"" to the wisdom associated with what is truly important in life and in coming of age. This film was eloquent testimony of Shelley's affinity with her new friends and her new life, and Anna's interactions with a highly professional film making organization.",The House Bunny

The House Bunny is probably bordering on sexist but in this world, the dumb good hearted blonde and her misfit cohorts comes out on top over evil Stepford Wives wannabes.And the boys comes out quite dumb here as well. In fact, everyone comes out stupid which means this is a fine day for equality of all sexes.While those who have thought that this movie is too high for their acutely honed sense of humor, they are also the ones who wrote that they ""drug"" (sic) her husband to watching this.

I didn't think the plot or jokes would be too good. I was wrong. While the plot is simple; the jokes are actually pretty damn good. The pacing is fast and every actress had a good line. I had consulted to my friend that this movie can't be hated because A) Girls would love it because it's directed to them and B) Guys will love it because it's filled with hot women. How can you go wrong? I saw this movie a week after Tropic Thunder disappointed me. I couldn't believe just how much better this ""passable"" movie was than that over-hyped piece of crap. Even my friend admitted this was better and he defended T.T. with his life! Emma Stone was great as the nerdy girl. I love Kat Dennings no matter what she does.

You'll laugh out loud at much of the humor, and you'll fall in love with Anna Faris. It's just silly fun. Anna Farris plays a ditsy blond who gets kicked out of the Playboy Mansion (Hugh Hefner is a good sport in this movie!), ends up homeless, and ends up as a house mother for a sorority of ""loser"" girls (smart girls who don't know how to attract boys). The sorority is about to lose its charter because they can't get enough pledges, and of course Faris saves the day for the sorority by teaching the girls how to be popular, and, along the way, she learns a few lessons herself. You'll enjoy knowing that her love interest is played by Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks, and that some of the people in the Playboy mansion and at the party at the mansion are played by themselves. Also, Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore and Katherine McPhee from American Idol are girls in the sorority. I thoroughly enjoyed this light movie.",The House Bunny
107,c_mar2012,Funny movie,8,18 February 2014,I liked this movie because it's not raunchy. Yes there are sexual innuendo jokes but this is obviously not a movie for children. Anna Faris's acting is ideal. I did not know that she could do this style of acting and carry a film. The plot is not hard to follow and I like it how the film doesn't demean the audience by making jokes or plot lines that make no sense. The House Bunny is good for teens who aren't impressionable and for adults. The music at the end was great. Here's a list of the best scenes 1) The House Bunny is stuck out in the rain. 2) The House Bunny goes on a date and messes things up. 3) The ending scene where Katherine McPhee sings and there's dancing. 4) The sorority girls act snooty.,The House Bunny

I would give this an 8 out of 10 but Lindsey Lohan's careening through scenes as the ""straight man"" to Faris' comedy diluted the laughs and generally skewed the comedic timing. I barely even recognize her from Mean Girls, both in looks and acting. She reminds me of a summer-stock extra suddenly finding themselves with a speaking role. And while the sorority house motley crew was a bit too motley to be believable, I did enjoy their role in being clay ready to be molded by the happy-go-lucky House Bunny.",The House Bunny

It's just another teen movie that you can definitely judge by its cover. It's basically a silly story of a playboy bunny that is kicked off the Playboy Mansion and has really nothing to hold on to - and has to start over. The plot line is very simple and the movie is very predictable with loads of clichés.Anna Faris' performance is the only thing that can save this movie. She's funny and can really get into a character, even though this role seemed like her roles on the Scary Movie series, playing a dumb and shallow girl. Only hotter and blond this time.Watch this if you want a very light movie with nothing special about it. Almost good for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Thankfully it's not a long movie.",The House Bunny
110,siobhandenton,pretty awful,4,31 October 2008,"After being evicted from the Playboy Mansion for being too old at 27, Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) now homeless, has little choice but to move into the Zeta Sorority House, whose seven misfit members risk losing their house unless they receive thirty pledges from potential new Zetas. So in exchange for living there, Shelley dedicates herself to the task of making the Zetas popular to help them attract pledges. An orphan whose only real home has been the Playboy Mansion, Shelley is incredibly naive with no real world experience, and is therefore the ultimate archetypal dumb blonde character, trading one comfortable environment for another. From the same writers of Legally Blonde, The House Bunny attempts to imitate the success of the former. Unfortunately the film fails on all accounts. Legally Blonde was successful largely due to Reese Witherspoon's likability, subverting her dumb blonde image in the film. The House Bunny makes no attempt to dispel this stereotype: Shelley tells the sorority girls that popularity is increased through higher levels of attractiveness. The film is also hugely clichéd: there isn't anything that hasn't been seen before here. Complete with the typical cheesy montages in which the characters toil as inspiring music is played, the film is entirely formulaic. The film is completely predictable from the start, with no surprises whatsoever. Anna Faris is not particularly likable; during her appearance on Friends (playing Erica in the final series) she was just about bearable. However, now given a feature length film, the increase in screen time just serves to highlight her lack of talent as an actress. Shelley is irritating, stupid beyond belief and not remotely funny. The biggest laugh in the film comes unintentionally from Hugh Hefner in a cameo role, who actually manages the feat of failing at playing himself. Emma Stone (Jules in Superbad) does well enough with a terrible script; whereas Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce, is given little opportunity to show off any acting abilities she may possess. Overall 'The House Bunny' is a poor film that brings nothing new to a tired genre.",The House Bunny

But it does produce a few wonderful - and hilarious - surprises that make it a very enjoyable 90 minutes.One is Anna Farris, who does a great twist on the archetypal dizzy blonde beloved of Hollywood since time immemorial.But the real kickers are the jarring one-liners that pepper an otherwise sweet and predictable film. Several reduced this viewer to paroxysms of laughter, tears rolling down cheeks, beverage spurting across the room.These moments, when they arrive, are so unexpected that the effect is one of firmly-flicked kipper on unprotected jowl.

The editing is also bad, and the soundtrack is poor, especially for an Adam Sandler production.While calling itself a comedy, I didn't laugh out loud once during this movie. There were some brief amusing moments (but few and far between) and certainly not enough of them to pick up this dog of a movie.Anna Faris did well within her limited role, although I was distracted by her overwrought collagen lips.

114,MiamiHEATfan777,The House Bunny Fails,5,3 September 2008,"Having also seen the ultra-violent Death Race in the same week as The House Bunny I realized one big thing; clichéd violence doesn't offer any kind of real reaction whereas clichéd humor can still manage to make you laugh as long as the delivery is entertaining and fresh. Sure, the dumb blond jokes in The House Bunny are old and played out, but Anna Faris gives you continuing reason to laugh in a film that is far funnier than it really deserves to be. The House Bunny plays on the sexy-but-dumb stereotype to the fullest extent and Faris has proved in the past, as a regular in the otherwise awful Scary Movie films, she can pull this off. On top of looking amazing, Faris gives this film every reason to exist. Co-stars Emma Stone, Kat Dennings and the increasingly emaciated Rumer Willis offer up a couple of additional laughs, but it is Faris that leads the charge. She plays right up to the edge of the dumb blond stereotype and only occasionally tosses in one too many clichéd jokes. Nevertheless, you forgive her thanks to a consistent number of chuckles throughout the film. This isn't to say this is a classic comedy by any means, but anyone that goes to see House Bunny should walk away with a smile. This isn't a film to hate, it offers up exactly what the trailers promise and it delivers a little extra with an unexpected f-bomb dropped in the mix and a peek at Faris's little bum to keep the men paying attention. Perhaps the one major shock would be Colin Hanks; it seems those Tom Hanks genes aren't quite paying off just yet. After a decent sized role in Peter Jackson's King Kong, Hanks has only managed to worm his way into mediocre films at best. Then again, he hasn't shown anyone any reason to give him anything with more meat on it so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Katherine McPhee of ""American Idol"" fame plays a small role in the feature as does Beverly D'Angelo, but both are relatively inconsequential. The ladies in the audience are more likely to get a kick out of The House Bunny and the fellas dragged to the theater with them should be able to enjoy themselves as well despite the estrogen oozing of the screen. It isn't like this is a film you should rush out to the theater to see, but you could definitely do worse in your selection.",The House Bunny

My biggest gripe with this movie is that they try to send this message that girls need to be look hot and lack intelligence to get other girls to be their friends and get boys to like them. They take this message back and change it to a ""just be yourself"" stance, but they continue to plaster images of Playboy Bunnies and various other hot girls throughout the movie.It's basically just a half-assed comedy with a bunch of montages set to Avril Lavigne and Rihanna songs.

I wish the producers and responsible for this movie getting made had gone all the way and provided this extraordinary comic talent with a more substantial script and direction giving her the opportunity to shine even more than she shines here and here shine she does, big time.

What a mistake.I mean the entire movie.The absolutely only thing in it that made me laugh was that Shelley was featured in ""Girls with GEDs"".I remember the first time I ever actually read a Playboy, in the early 1980s and how different it was from the popular cultural impression - articles about how to give your woman orgasms, design a successful date, have a nice place to live, and the ""I just read the articles"" features were often quite good. This all between pictures of women whose academic, musical or whatever achievements were listed in the captions, that emphasized the women were accomplished, not just pneumatic. It wasn't the sort of men rule/women serve mentality I'd been led to believe. The idea seemed to be that a man who wants to do well with women should have a little culture, a clean place to live, some education & familiarity with current events, and be rewarded with some appealing visuals. I couldn't see what was wrong with that.The House Bunny, on the other hand, seems like it was written by people whose only impressions of Playboy were passed along secondhand from disapproving parochial school teachers who see it as nothing but an excuse for men to think of women as merely brainless collections of pleasing body parts.I mean, Shelley is so Forrest Gump dumb she isn't believable as sexually savvy. Even the art of seduction requires some - well, Art - some understanding of things like how to engage in entertaining conversation, how to not insult someone with a ridiculous & obviously untrue claim like ""You have great biceps"" to someone who is in no way buff, not making blatant sexual suggestions too early or forcefully for the person one wants to seduce. Even absent specific training, there's a certain sensitivity to the moment, the mood and the other person of which Shelley is blindingly unaware. ""Like I'm hot you're hot, we have compatible parts, let's use 'em"" is only a potentially successful gambit in certain narrow circumstances, and a real seduction professional would know that, at least.Maybe they were trying too hard to not just rewrite Legally Blond, but wouldn't a better movie have been the Bunny everybody assumes is dumb, who does lack education, but actually has some instincts about making people feel comfortable/interesting/attractive, some understanding of style (not just lingerie) and maybe some aspirations.

Just as long as you're not yourself. I don't think there's much of a point in releasing a movie with that kind of message. The girls were basically told to change everything about themselves if they want to get attention, so they all changed their styles and wore revealing clothing.

The difference is that the characters in all these comedies were actually likable and we rooted for them.

Everything in this movie is undeveloped, except the bra size of the ""house bunny.""In ""House Bunny,"" the repeated comic attempts (which never succeed as comic reality) include having the heroine lower her voice when she repeats the name of somebody's she's just met, having a woman attempt to pick up guys by repeatedly taking about her bowel movements, plus unfunny and constant references to S&M and oral sex. The basic premise of the movie is that in order to be successful, to have a boy friend, you should mask your intelligence and make sure you are attractive (AKA, slutty).

I see that she Exec Produced this, and I'm all for women developing projects and making them happen, but I think this was a poor choice. It's possible that in the hands of another director, some of the slapstick would have been dialled down, and a little more time spent in making the House Bunny a believable, loveable character.I almost gave up four or five times during this movie, but persisted in the hope that it would get better, but I think I was disappointed.",The House Bunny

My guess is that the movie was marketed towards girls like myself, but instead of being a completely brainless movie involving girls that go on and on about how looks are important, it was a decent movie with a few laughs and a nice moral to it, along with a not-so-bad storyline.So if you're reading this, I'd say give it a chance.

Unfortunately this was not the case. I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life, initially it did look as though the film was going to prove to be what I had hoped when Shelley is evicted from the playboy mansion. However, I soon realised the movie was about to take an almighty nose dive and proved to be far worse than my worst nightmares. I almost could not believe what I was seeing when Shelly managed to become 'house mother' to the group of unoriginal 'misfits', another example of Hollywood throwing a pair of geeky glasses on a beautiful young woman, some piercings and oversized clothes on another joined by and allegedly unattractive and overweight girl and you have got your cringe worthy mix of All - American mis-fits, soon to be made over by their very own fairy god mother, Shelly. In an attempt to try and gain more female pledges the idiotic, nauseating character shelly decides the girls need to make themselves 'The Hottest girls on campus' in order to win pledges and boys attention, cue five minutes of makeover movie time and they are quickly transformed into what Hollywood deems beautiful and yet in reality look like a group of cheap street walkers. The irony of Shelly being dubbed Vapid, is ironic given how completely vapid the story and script of this film is. Add in the fact that Shelly is somehow full of amazing ideas to save these girls whilst running round in a thong and wonderbra, later to start attending college to become more intelligent whilst writing with a fluffy pen and piling up books in the library whilst wearing a pink mini skirt and you have the makings of one of the most mortifying 'comedies' I have ever seen. It is not only embarrassing, it's offensive, I mean, come on! What I found more shocking is that this movie is written by two women, this misogynistic, vapid, and altogether flawed 'comedy' is merely another example of how utterly insipid Hollywood movie making actually is, this unoriginal, offensive pathetic excuse for a movie is not only a waste of time, but it is actually quite worrying that things with such blatant sexism, gender stereotyping and irresponsible portrayals of how women should act to get male attention exist in today's society. When Shelly get's made under to look more intelligent, it only makes things worse, the idea that you are either hot and stupid or clever and ugly is the oldest, more unoriginal stereotype in the book - ARGHHHH! Do people actually still think like this? URGH there are not enough words to describe my hatred for this film, what's more is how these women allowed themselves to be involved in it and willingly exploit themselves, whether they thought they were 'sending themselves up' i don't know, it was all I could do not to reach for the fork from my dinner plate and gouge my eyes out.

Anyway, definitely worth a watch for silly, cheesy and sometimes very obvious laughs, just don't concentrate too much on Beverly D'Angelo's face, something strange has happened to it, and it it looks a little like melted plastic...such a shame. I gave it 8 stars because Emma Stone, as always is fantastic. She's believable in any role that she plays. Anna Faris is her usual funny goofy self, a part that she convincingly plays to a tee, and Kendra is in it. Everyone loves a bit of Kendra!",The House Bunny
135,joy_helbin,Designed to whitewash Hugh Hefner and groom girls for p*rn,1,13 October 2008,"Shelley's college sorority house is just like her former home, the Playboy Mansion. Indeed, Hugh Hefner (""Hef"") seems just like a house mother to all the girls who live with him. I found his portrayal most believable - when Shelley leaves, he pines for days alone in his bedroom - he almost had me in tears. Almost. Until the cognitive dissonance set in: Playboy Enterprises (who run 6 p*rn channels in the UK alone, each one showing over 50 films (eg, one recent title was, ""Fresh and Juicy Lolitas"")) may deny that their Playboy pencil case (de rigeur for 10-year-old schoolgirls nowadays) and Playboy single-size bed linen are designed to groom girls for a future in the porn industry but, with a mainstream film showing in London's West End rated 12A, which begins and ends with pages turning on a fairy tale, in which Shelley's student housemates contrast unfavourably next to her (their fellow students break in and paint ""LOSERS"" on the livingroom wall, whereas she is a delightful, pleasing, uninhibited, popular, attractive, Playboy bunny (resembling the most-purchased model out of all the Barbie-doll products) whose preferred home is the Playboy Mansion and whose proudest moment is being chosen by Hef for the Miss November centrefold in Playboy magazine) says otherwise. Come off it, Playboy! Who are you trying to kid?",The House Bunny

Smart & ugly girls need to do a make-over to maken them pretty & act dumb, so they can save the house.The pretty & dumb Shelly needs to become smarter for the boy she likes. Again another smart & ugly has to be turned into a ""pretty girl"" movie, which I normally like. This one however really sets the standard for girls to be something other then themselves just for the approval of guys. I like more Elle Woods and Cher Horowitz type of girls TBH.",The House Bunny

140,krestavilis,The House Bunny,10,30 August 2008,"Hey Guys, I just came back from The House Bunny, it was great! And I can tell you Anna Faris was amazing, she was very funny and of course drop-dead gorgeous. All that time she spent at the gym sure paid off. The movie was hilarious, I laughed my head off each time I see Dana Goodman's character. And did you know that Colin Hanks who plays Oliver is Tom Hanks' son, and Rumer Willis who plays Joanne (The girl in the scoliosis braces) is Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter.I'm so proud of what Anna has accomplished throughout the years. She started out as an unknown drama-oriented actress who starred in the first Scary Movie, not too sure of herself and not too confident about her comedic acting abilities. Then she slowly gains popularity with The Hot Chick, Friends, Lost in Translation and Brokeback Mountain coining herself as a comedic female actress, a relatively rare ""breed"" if I might say.The House bunny started out as an idea Anna had about 2 years ago, I remember seeing ""The untitled Anna Faris project"" for a long period of time on the IMDb and always wondered to myself what it would be about. And then, she searched around and found the screenwriters, directors and producers which turned out to be Happy Madison (Adam Sandler's company), and here we are! The first Anna Faris project with her as the lead role and executive producer. I hope that this is a milestone for Anna and would propel her towards bigger roles in Hollywood. She unquestionably deserves it I reckon.I adore, respect and support Happy Madison movies for underneath all the hilarious jokes that amuse and entertain you, there is always a humane and compassionate message that is being conveyed. I was really happy when I found out that Anna would be working with them on this movie. It is one of my naive dreams to work for Happy Madison one day.Throughout the years, Anna always kept her self-deprecating tendencies, which I believe is part of her sweet and charming personality and one of the main ingredients that makes us love her so much. If you are an Anna fan, you should definitely go see this movie. It has lots of cleavage for the male spectators and it's very cute and sweet for the female audience.",The House Bunny
141,sean-skaar,"A reasonably entertaining, if predictable, comedy",6,22 August 2008,"This isn't a movie that set its ambitions particularly high, but as far as stupid comedies go, it was reasonably entertaining. There are a few running gags that are used effectively throughout the movie, usually without becoming overdone, most of the characters, with a few notable exceptions, are quirky enough to amuse without becoming grating, and the humor rarely devolves too far into goofiness. Unfortunately, nothing about the movie is really that interesting either. The comedic territory is well covered by other films, many of them superior, and none of the jokes are the quotable kind of universally funny lines that your friends will be repeating later. There isn't anything really bad about the movie, but there isn't anything good about it either. So, all in all, it is a decent, predictable, mediocre film.",The House Bunny
142,purplepirate-1,A movie without a brain,1,26 December 2008,"When my friend rented this film for a sleepover, I wasn't particularly looking forward to it, but being a gracious guest I watched it without complaint.I was sort of expecting a slutty version of Legally Blonde, an adorable movie which I was sure they were going to ruin. Instead, what I got was way, way worse. Legally Blonde was amazing- yes it stereotyped blonde girls as expected through the title, but it also showed how they can do anything when they put their mind to it. The heroine was very girl-y and pink, but in her core she had true brains which helped her solve an important murder case. Truly, a good lesson for girls everywhere. On top of that, it was funny and had catchy little lines like ""Bend and Snap!"".The bimbo in this film has no brains whatsoever. Instead of teaching girls to be strong and smart, she teaches them to be slutty and to throw themselves at boys. In fact, all she wears for most of the movie is lingerie which she tries to pass off as clothes. Naturally I realize they were trying to go with the ""dumb blonde"" theme, but the fact that she doesn't even know what nursing homes are is simply ridiculous.Every single character in this film was extremely stereotyped. All of the Zeta girls were quite unrealistic. The pregnant girl had no other personality from the fact that she's pregnant- and even then, the fact she was expecting made it clear to me as a viewer that she must have been liked at some point by some guy. The nerdy red-headed girl was an insult to all smart girls everywhere. And the girl from the trailer park in Idaho was as redneck-y as the movie makers could make her. This was increasingly irritating to me as I watched. These characters were supposed to make me laugh, and I was simply cringing at the poor acting skills and script.But to redeem itself at the end, the movie tries to slap on a moral about being yourself. Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't really support it. The rest of the movie's message is that if you're an outcast, be a slut to get the guys falling all over you. It's not funny in any way, and I would suggest you skip it.",The House Bunny
143,akakirk87,Hilarious!!,10,25 June 2009,"Whe I first put in the DVD, I was expecting a crass, carnal, stereotypical film, emphasizing big boobs and tight butts, with the classic binary decomposition of inner beauty/outer beauty. What I found was much more significant.The writers explored several other themes beside the binary, such as the concept of what ""home"" is. Shelli never knew what home was, being an abandoned child. She also never had a true mother, and then was put into a position she had no knowledge to draw from. This concept is doubled with the ""Wizard of Oz"" motif (she is wearing a Dorothy costume leaving the mansion, the casual mention in the photo shoot, ""Are you a good witch or a bad witch?""). This all leads to the viewers' understanding of the fact there is no place like home, and that home is where one feels most in place and has a sense of belonging.On top of the brilliant literary components, the film is hilarious. ""The eyes are the nipples of the face."" HAHA! All in all, a great film.",The House Bunny
144,rachboo,Quite enjoyable,7,25 August 2008,"The House Bunny was not on the top of my list of movies to see but it was not a total loss. This movie was not necessarily a constant laugh out loud comedy but it was still funny. The story line was interesting, not what I expected, actually a little better. Anna Faris as Cindy in the Scary Movies, she was funny and she is funny in this movie. She kind of acts like Cindy, in The House Bunny, but a lot more brainy. There is a lot of hilarious memorable quotes from Shelley (Faris), Natalie (Emma Stone) and the rest of the characters. Being that Adam Sandler was one the producers of this movie, I did not think I would be totally disappointed. And I was not! This is a good movie for those who would like a laugh or two... or more!! Enjoy!!",The House Bunny
145,thbyrd,Save your money,1,29 August 2008,"Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And I don't' say that often! I kept waiting for the funny parts. And to think I drug my husband to it! Stupid premise, very predictable, quite awkward, embarrassing movie. One positive note.... Catherine McPhee was charming and great in her role. She definitely has a future in acting. Her role was small but credible and showed promise. Rumer Willis should keep her day job, whatever that might be. I felt sorry for Anna Faris. She looked good in the movie but the content was an embarrassment. Drippy, sappy, stupid. And what was Beverly D'Angelo thinking associating herself with this mess? And Hugh Hefner and the girls next door? Don't waste your time or money on this drivel.",The House Bunny
146,brunettelicious16,another mediocre comedy about a ditzy blonde...but not all bad,5,2 September 2008,"for this review, all i could think was to describe the movie as merely 'average'. as soon as my best friend and i saw the commercial, we made sure to go see it together, and on august 30 that day finally came. the trailers had been downright hilarious, and i was expecting the movie to be what old folks would call a ""kneeslapper"". unfortunately, the only funny parts in the whole movie turned out to be the ones in the trailer. i would know every time a funny part was coming up, so the whole 'funny' part kind've vanished. now lets talk about the characters. i thought all the actors/actresses did great jobs transforming into their characters. anna faris did wonderfully as Shelley, and i thought Rumer Willis did a great job. As for the British accent, Kiely Williams did incredible!! i do wish that the 'girs next door' aka holly,kendra,and bridgette weren't included in the film, since their acting skills are less than stellar, but overall i thought this movie was a mix of good and average. i expected more out of the trailers, but I've learned not to get my hopes up for chick flick comedies these days :=( latest great chick flicks to come out=p.s. i love you (almost a full year ago!!) and 27 dresses (way back in may!!) come on Hollywood! i know you can do it!",The House Bunny

I thought i would hate this movie because I'm not into those like perky blonde girls but this movie kinda caught my attention because I love the Playboy girls Kendra,Holly,and Bridget so i wanted to watch it. I went with my friend and this movie had me laugh so hard. My friend and I were laughing so hard we got hyper and we were really loud.I loved this movie.I give it two thumbs up. The actress was really funny. I knew her from the movies Scary movie and i liked them so i figured that in this movie she would be funny too and she was. I like how she turned nerdy girls into like glamor girls and they all looked pretty. Especially that one girl from Super Bad.",The House Bunny
148,debretts,Is this what we want our children to aspire to?,1,15 October 2008,"This film is a scary reflection on the way things are going at the moment, with young girls being encouraged to aspire to be porn stars. For example, Playboy pencil cases and bedding being marketed to children. Playboy is a vile producer of hardcore porn which degrades women. This film is not just a bit of fun, it has serious consequences for girls' psyches and for society as a whole. Whatever happened to aspiring to being intelligent and informed and self-fulfilled? Today's girls are brought up to think that their sexuality is all they have to offer. Do not see this film, it is poison.

150,dorkablemeag,Funny but sad,10,1 March 2012,"Who says a chick flick can't make you believe in aliens. Was this funny. Yes Was it touching yes. A real life bunny heads to NY to find the duck she fell in love with. If scared of bats beware, there is 20 minutes of animal porn,surprised me. Anna Faris makes me believe in love and that anyone looks good in pink. Emma stones breakout performance. Believe in love everyone. Don't watch if pregnant. Great movie to watch for a car ride. Is on two discs since its extra long. Was shot with one camera, no lighting. Need 3-d glasses to see whole film. YAY!

151,17aacos-w,"Cute Movie, Overall only good for a rental though",5,22 August 2008,"OK, Lets get the bad out of the way now 1st off, the comedy was awkward for me. Like some...no scratch that...most moments had me thinking ""Why did I waste my money on this?"" Like for Example, the scene where the Zeta's went up and did the ""Nerdy"" version of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" O...M....G, I Literally walked out of the movie theater, only to come back in because I remembered I spent money on this, instead of watching a bootleg like everyone and their mother is doing nowadays. Plus the acting was good, but really I only liked the main bunny, and loathed everyone else (Except Shaq, lol) Now for the Good/Awesome parts The comedy, though at moments awkward, provided good laughs for me (I was the only one that laughed at Anna Farris' one liner about Oliver being Gay, and Of course the one liner near the end ""Where is this bird?"") The soundtrack is BRILLIANT, I loved every song they played (From ""When I grow up"" to ""Girlfriend"", even the last song, ""I know what boys like"" had me singing) Overall, I'll give it a C+, There were moments where I hated every moment of the movie, But in the end, i liked it's overall performance. And honestly, Was I the only one hoping that SOMEONE would snap at the opposing sorority house with their line (I believe it was something like ""It's been nice talking to you"" ""But..."" ""Its Been Nice"")",The House Bunny
