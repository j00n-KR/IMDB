0,bkoganbing,A Pretty Woman Takes Down A Big Utility,10,30 August 2007,"In all the years that Frank Capra gave his populist films, none of his heroes were women. Back then it was the traditional roles with the men doing the heavy lifting and the women in support as wives and mothers so the men could slay the dragons.Frank Capra might never have given us a populist heroine, but I think he would have loved Erin Brockovich as much as I did. Although Albert Finney is the lawyer who took on the power Pacific Gas&Electric for the residents of Hinkley, California, the legwork (and what a pair of legs) was done by Julia Roberts.The true story of former beauty queen Erin Brockovich is one of the best roles for a female player in the past ten years and Julia Roberts was so right for the part. Beauty is a start for this part, but Ms. Roberts is also a single mother raising three kids who literally browbeats her way into a job with a law firm headed by Albert Finney that lost a case where she was a plaintiff. People all her life, and probably the men she was involved with never took her seriously because of her beauty. As Roberts got deeper and deeper into the case involving toxic chromium poisoning from a plant in Hinkley, she felt a lot more self worth and very much empowered due to the good work she was involved in. As she explains to current boyfriend Aaron Eckhardt in my favorite scene in the film, when she goes to Hinkley on any her firm's business, it's not a beauty queen that the people there are seeing, but a savior of sorts.Roberts puts her heart and soul in both her work and as mother. Some of her best scenes are her domestic ones with her three kids. She's not without weaknesses, she does have a tendency to snap judgments and she's not the most diplomatic of people at times. But a good heart and a good work ethic cover a multitude of sins.Unlike so many Oscar winning films, Erin Brockovich got a March release in 2000 not a release late in the year to keep the film fresh in Academy voters minds. Obviously no one thought of this film as Oscar caliber. Yet word of mouth spread about the film and it got several nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Albert Finney and others. And it was a winner for Julia Roberts for Best Actress of 2000. Erin Brockovich was one of my favorite films for the new century and I think it will please every one who sees it.",Erin Brockovich
1,Leofwine_draca,Holds up very well,7,18 September 2021,"I'm a believer that even the worst and most hated actor has at least one decent performance in them. Julia Roberts is one of my least favourite stars, but I nonetheless really liked her and warmed to her in this film, prosthetic chest aside. The legal story is well told and engaging - although eclipsed by the likes of Mark Ruffalo's DARK WATERS - and it holds up very well.",Erin Brockovich
2,SnoopyStyle,well made under-dog story,7,19 September 2013,"Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a struggling unemployed single mother of three. She can't even win a petty lawsuit against a doctor for a car accident. So she browbeats her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to give her a job. When she starts poking into a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It turns into much more of a case of toxic waste dumping and one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history.Julia Roberts delivers a big performance in a traditional under-dog movie. This is definitely well-made by master director Steven Soderbergh. Nothing is left on the table, and it helps to have great actors all around like the great Albert Finney.The only small problem I had. There is a holier than thou attitude that Erin Brockovich hasn't earned yet in the movie. After all she brings frivolous lawsuits, she needs to show more of her struggles. I think there was a story where she had to steal medicine for her kids. That would be a great insight into her struggles to start the movie with. That would buy credit for all the stuff that follows.",Erin Brockovich
3,Hitchcoc,"A Complex Character, To Say the Least",8,11 January 2017,"Julia Roberts is not my favorite actress. She has hung on to a star that was sort of thrust on her from a movie that is not all that great, ""Pretty Woman."" This, supposedly, established an edginess for her, though her character had literally no connection to a true prostitute. With all that said, I think she did fine in this film. I know that some have said that this has all been done before. So crusading for people victimized by humorless industrial entities has been done before. The strength, however, is in the specifics. Brokavich, a real person, found herself in the midst of a nasty situation. She makes a discovery that sets in motion a huge lawsuit where she is put to the test.",Erin Brockovich
4,lee_eisenberg,"I don't like Julia Roberts, and even I liked this movie.",7,18 October 2005,"First, I should explain that I have one of the lowest opinions of Julia Roberts imaginable. I regard her as little more than a Barbie doll who pretends to be the world's biggest genius, and whose movies appear to have been written by ten monkeys working with ten typewriters for ten days/years.So how then, you may ask, could I like ""Erin Brockovich""? Well, for starters, Julia Roberts does more than focus on beauty in this movie. As a twice-divorced single mother who helps prosecute a corporation that had polluted a town's water supply, Roberts is a lot bitchier in this role than in most of her other roles. Occasionally blurting out lines that sound like they came from George Carlin, Erin is one bad-ass mother. The movie is also helped by good support from Albert Finney as Erin's boss Ed Masry.So, in conclusion, even though I generally consider Julia Roberts pretty worthless, I do agree that her Oscar win for this movie was well deserved.",Erin Brockovich
5,jboothmillard,Erin Brockovich,8,13 July 2005,"I can't believe the first time I saw it I thought it was crap, maybe it was because I thought there was too much chat (which is key), now seeing it again I really like it, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Ocean's Eleven). Anway, basically Erin Brockovich (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Julia Roberts, earning her $20m salary) has a car accident, and after failing to sue a doctor, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Albert Finney), to give her a job in compensation. No-one takes her seriously for a while, mainly because of her trashy clothes and language use, but that changes when she investigates a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. She discovers they are quietly trying to buy land contaminated by Hexavalent Chromium, a deadly toxic waste that is illegally being dumped and going into the town's water mains. This is a true story about one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-million dollar corporation, pretty much taken down by one woman. Eventually they are found guilty for their crime, and have to pay over $300m for damages, almost $5m of that going to all families who have been affected by this cover-up. Also starring The Core's Aaron Eckhart as George, CSI's Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, Cherry Jones as Pamela Duncan, Peter Coyote as Kurt Potter and the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as Julia, the Waitress. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture (with the help of Danny DeVito) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Julia Roberts was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Erin Brockovich was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 73 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 24 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die. Very good!",Erin Brockovich
6,rmax304823,Slick heart warmer.,6,6 October 2006,"These kinds of films are beginning to form a genre unto themselves. ""Marie,"" ""Silkwood,"" ""Afterburn,"" ""Guerin,"" ""Norma Rae"", and ""Brokovich."" Elements, too, in other successful heart warmers like ""Mask"" and ""Class Action"".The basic idea is to pit a lower-class David against a multi billion-dollar Goliath and have the underdog win. (Maybe I should have included ""Rocky"" in that list.) Well, Erin Brokovich is the real thing, a trailer-park floozy with messy hair, a quick vulgar mouth, and boobs that look like two helium balloons about to pop up out of her push-up bra. No wonder her female coworkers hate her. Not just her looks though. She's a human dynamo at work. She collects something like 640 signed affidavits over a week and the stuffy partners at her law firm gawk and ask how she did it. ""I went out and distributed sexual favors,"" she says. ""Six hundred and forty BJs in five days. I'm tired."" (The camera lingers on her triumphant expression so we can share her joy in humiliating her superiors.) It's very slickly done. Her life is filled with travails. I mean, out of work, three fatherless children, rear ended by some rich dope in a Mercedes. Fortunately there's a guy.Therein is an illustration of a slight problem. These folks look real enough on the surface but they're actually ringers. Erin, despite her cutting sarcasm, doesn't really speak much like a redneck and neither do the other people of her class. Nobody smokes. (Might drive away the intended audience.) The guy she falls in with is introduced as some kind of biker/doper wearing ragged jeans, a faded bandanna wrapped around his head, a beard, and a pony tale -- revving up his chopper after he moves in next door. But it's all a front. The bandanna is soon dropped and we get to know him for the quiet, quietly reassuring, supportive, child-loving Mensch that he truly is. When the trappings of bikerhood are gone -- and we never see the bike again -- he sits there in silence while Erin pours out her woes and, what with his neat beard, his reading glasses and his serenity and his slight, tolerant smile, he is more a Jewish psychotherapist than a biker.Of course he has to pack up and leave her at some point otherwise the movie would be absent one cliché. They're both sad about the split, and it doesn't last that long, but, as he explains it, he never sees her anymore because she's always working late. He does everything but say, ""You're already married -- to your job."" There's never a moment's doubt about who is good and who is bad in a movie like this. Erin is authentic and good, like the earth before it was poisoned by PG&E. The fraudulent biker is also good. We know it right away, although she doesn't. Erin's boss, Finney, is good too, although a little gruff at times, kind of like Lou Grant. The victims of the lethal chromium isotope are all good too. None of them is in it for the money. The new partners that Finney acquires to help him cover his expenses are on the right side but they're pretentious. They dress in expensive tailored clothing and are aghast when Erin swears. The poor woman who represents the new partners looks as if she took baths in a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. There is no life either in her or on her. Her hair is pulled back severely, she wears a suit and tie, and her makeup gives her a cadaverous glow.It's not a thoughtful film by any measure, but it does get the job done. Goliath is vanquished by David and we applaud as the end credits roll. The performances are adequate -- no better than that, but no worse either. Sometimes the film borrows entire modules from other successful movies. The resentment of the antagonistic informant who answers the door when the investigator knocks. (""Verdict,"" ""All the President's Men"".) The heroine caught up in the cause that threatens her love life. (""Silkwood,"" ""Norma Rae."") The script makes fun of a jealous fat woman. (""Kiss my ***, Krispy Kreme."") It's that kind of movie.",Erin Brockovich
7,moonspinner55,No-frills David & Goliath story told in straightforward fashion...,7,30 November 2002,"There's nothing dynamic or exciting about ""Erin Brockovich"" save for Julia Roberts' fiery, Oscar-winning lead performance. She plays the real-life single mother of three who gets a job in a law firm and proceeds to take on a huge corporation responsible for contaminating water in a Southern California city. The residents of that town aren't given any real shadings--we meet most of them on the fly--and Erin's co-workers and boss are a typical office bunch. Director Steven Soderbergh is offered no opportunities here to get flashy, but he does solid work up to the tag (which is silly). Roberts, on the other hand, gets to act all over the place, and it's nice to see her doing well in a role that requires more than just her movie star smile and figure. An interesting case which makes for an entertaining and emotional film. Five Oscar nominations in all, including Best Picture. *** from ****",Erin Brockovich
8,Quinoa1984,One of the most over-rated films of the year,6,13 February 2001,"Like Dancer in the Dark (and unlike good over-rated films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Almost Famous which had over-rating it's biggest flaw), this film has over-rating not at it's biggest flaw, but in a midst of them.  Steven Soderbergh made gold with Traffic, but Erin Brockovich is the lowest of his fodder, and while it is OK, it might've been better (or possibly not).Julia Roberts plays a mid western hick with 3 kids and no husband or job, and gets a job working with lawyers all the while distracting guys with a boost in her shirt that would make Tyra Banks feel intimidatied (for only one reason).  She then begins to get smart and start to help her firm in a case.  Often quite unbelievable, even if there are actually a few convincing moments, however the story seems like Rosewood or Civil Action (the second one was much better) and probably most over-rated of all is Roberts.  Oh well, I guess you can't argue the 4 Oscar Nom's, and I guess I do pull for Soderbergh to win best director (but only by default for him to win Traffic).  B-",Erin Brockovich
9,edwagreen,Erin Brockovich-Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover ****,10,13 August 2009,"Other than ""Pretty Woman,"" this was certainly the best Julia Roberts role ever and her Oscar was well-deserved.Roberts immediately comes on screen as a bimbo with a brain who has had 2 failed marriages and is really down on her luck as she struggles to raise 3 children.Fate has it that she meets up with an automobile accident and a lawyer, superbly played by Albert Finney, who she gets to hire her.Loud, common and ready to use her beauty as another Stella Dallas, Erin (Julia) soon shows her mettle by uncovering a major scandal involving the use of chromium as toxic waste with the result that plenty of people were ill from using the contaminated water nearby.Hardworking and caring, this undertaking changes Erin drastically. While she was a caring person with a foul mouth, she becomes much more mature as she works to have the gas and electric company found responsible for what has been occurring.The picture brings out that hard work with a purpose and the ability to persevere will always pay off.Besides a terrific supporting performance by Finney, Aaron Eckhardt is wonderful as her motor-cycle boyfriend who loves her and her children, but finds it increasing difficult to play second fiddle to a job that's rapidly consuming her.",Erin Brockovich
10,michaelRokeefe,Brazen attitude and determination goes a long way.,3,3 March 2001,"This film seems so far fetched to be based on fact. In my opinion this is another in the line of Julia Roberts vehicles. I think the viewers will pay more attention to the star than the character's accomplishments. With less than desired education and a lack of social graces; a brash, crude, obnoxious, but savvy young woman takes on a large utility company. Citizens of the small town of Hinkley are struggling with various maladies including cancer. The cause seems to be large amounts of chromium. Ms. Brockovich(Roberts) working as an assistant to a reluctant attorney(Albert Finney), not only becomes savior of the community, but martyr as well.I found myself bored with this over hyped film. Roberts was nice to watch, but a score of other actresses could have played the part. Conchata Ferrell and David Brisbin also appear. And the real life Erin Brockovich plays the part of a waitress.",Erin Brockovich
11,sunwarrior13,Julia Roberts Shines As Erin Brockovich,10,24 September 2012,"Erin Brockovich is a biographical film directed by Steven Soderbergh. It is a dramatization of the true story of Erin Brockovich, played by Julia Roberts, who fought against the US West Coast energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric Company.It also stars Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart.Erin Brockovich is a single mother of three who, after losing a personal injury lawsuit, asks her lawyer, Ed Masry, if he can help her find a job. Ed gives her work as a file clerk in his office, and she runs across some information on a little-known case filed against Pacific Gas and Electric. She begins digging into the particulars of the case, convinced that the facts simply don't add up, and persuades him to allow her to do further research; in time, she discovers a systematic cover-up of the industrial poisoning of a city's water supply, which threatens the health of the entire community.In this movie,Julia Roberts is at her most winning and sexiest as the lone-fighter against the system. Also,taking full advantage of her talent and appeal, it overcomes a few character and plot issues to deliver a smart, thoughtful, and funny legal drama.It is hard to imagine another actress pulling this off except her.",Erin Brockovich
12,hitchcockthelegend,"For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Please, don't ask me to give it up.",8,4 March 2008,"The film is based on a real case and is about real people so to that ends it is obviously simple in structure, and nagging away as you watch it is the fact that the ending is never in doubt, it ""is"" all too predictable. However, what made Erin Brockovich the success it was is that the title character is not only interesting but also, importantly, intriguing. A foul mouthed hard bitten, twice divorced mother of three has to fight her corner just to get an honest days pay. It's a fabulous story backed up by a simply incredible performance from Julia Roberts. Here Roberts has let her hair down, puts on a push up bra and a short skirt, she is clearly enjoying the freedom of the role, and the results are real effective.I have no doubt that working alongside Albert Finney helped Roberts no ends, but it is her show all the way, and she alone masks over what really is an ordinary film, there is nothing we haven't seen before here, it's just a more modern take on the good versus evil corporate company scenario. It's steadily directed by Steven Soderbergh, emotional scenes are not overstretched to treacle point, and all in all it's good solid story telling. Repeat viewings prove to dilute the uplift factor of the finale, but Roberts' performance certainly holds firm for evermore.8/10 for the film, 10/10 for Roberts' ballsy show. If only we could have had more of these performances from her.",Erin Brockovich
13,preppy-3,Nothing new plot-wise but compelling,8,11 April 2000,"Even though this is based on a true story, it goes through the same hoops other movies of this kind have gone through.  One person finds big corporation being evil...battles against seemingly unsurmontable odds to beat them.  Every cliche is hit head on.  Still it's well worth seeing.  All the acting is great (especially Finney and Roberts), the script is razor sharp, the film moves briskly and the direction is very good and assured. Basically a familar story, but told very well.  Well worth seeing.  Also, Roberts fake breasts are something else!",Erin Brockovich
14,LeonLouisRicci,Claptrap With CleavageOverrated Movie From An Overrated Director,7,27 May 2014,"Once Again the Overrated Director gets Showers of Accolades for a Film that has Absolutely No Directorial Flourishes. it is a Straightforward Look at a Real Life Crusader that is Superficial Hollywoodness at its Most Glaring.It is All Julia Roberts and Her Body Parts here with a Backdrop of a Story about Big Corp, once again, Polluting People into the Grave with Little Regard and Thanks to Lawsuits, Paying the Price.The Subject Matter has been Handled Many Times because David and Goliath Stories are Guaranteed Claptrap Moneymakers, or at the Very Least Viewer Friendly. Throw in a Hollywood Beauty, Dress Her is Slutty Clothes with Plenty of Cleavage and Turn on the Camera. What's Not to Like. And Everybody Did. Well, Most Everybody.The Academy Fell All Over Itself with Nominations and for a Somewhat Routine Flick, it is Laughable. The Movie is OK and Entertaining to a Point, but is Slightly Above Average at Best. Julia Looks Snappy but Overwhelms the Entire Picture with Her Wardrobe and Neckline. Everything Else takes a Back Seat. Overall an Overrated Movie that has got some Appeal but Great Filmmaking this is Not. Its the Standard Story with Standard Professional Hollywood Craftsman Resulting in a Standard Film with a Stunning Looking Leading Lady. That's All this is there is No More. With those Expectations it can be an Enjoyable Entertainment where the Good Guys Win.",Erin Brockovich
15,lastliberal,Do they teach beauty queens to apologize? Because you suck at it!,8,9 May 2007,"Sure everyone talks about this film as probably the best of Julia Robert's stellar career (We'll forget Hook and Mary Reilly ). She won an Oscar and an armload of other awards in her role as a mom struggling to overcome her trailer park background and put food in the mouths of her babes. It was a superior strong woman role and she was a real pleasure to watch, as she always is.Traffic and Sex, Lies and Videope director Steven Soderbergh put together another beauty of a show for our enjoyment. He also has an armload of awards.But, the real star of this film is Ed Masry played brilliantly by Albert Finney (Amazing Grace, Murder on the Orient Express, The Dresser, Tom Jones, Under the Volcano). Ed Masry provided the comic element in this film and kept things moving along. Finney was absolutely brilliant in the role.",Erin Brockovich
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good authentic law drama,8,2 May 2004,"OK, so Julia Roberts is not the best actress, and, admittedly, this probably doesn't contain the best acting she has pulled off in her career, but I think she does good enough in this movie. She plays a nearly totally independent woman who fights for a cause, that she feels is right, which costs her a lot of time away from her three kids. The plot is pretty good, and it develops at a good pace, keeping you interested in it for the duration of the film. The actors do okay jobs in portraying their respective characters, though I found a few of the minor characters to be played by fairly inexperienced actors, who didn't perform terribly well. The child-actors performed pretty good, though. The characters are well-written, but since it's based on a true story, I don't know how much of it had to be made up. The humor in the movie is quite well-placed and often very funny. The character that Julia plays is a symbol of independent women everywhere; she's intelligent, she has female intuition and she knows how to use her attractiveness to get what she wants. Granted, a part of the movie concentrates a lot on Julia's curves, or, more specifically, her breasts. Personally I think that as long as it's in context, which it pretty much always is here, it doesn't really matter; also, if the real Erin acted like that, shouldn't the movie have the fake one acting like that too? Overall, a pretty good authentic drama. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys dramas, independent women and authentic movies.",Erin Brockovich

Erin Brockavich could've invented the cure to cancer. I wouldn't know. I do know that big boobs give you a lot of latitude. And I do know that when your main character is as abrasive, foul, and off putting as Erin Brockavich, then it's good to have Julia Roberts play her. She alone can get a viewer to stay tuned in even with such a repulsive character. I wasn't one of those viewers.It wasn't just one thing about Erin that made her hard to watch, it was everything. It was her loud mouth. It was her clothing choices. It was her treatment of her coworkers. It was her over all unprofessionalism and uncouthness. I just couldn't watch anymore.

18,evanston_dad,"One Big Heap of Fake, But an Awfully Entertaining One",7,2 June 2006,"What's up with Steven Soderbergh? How can the same director make an intelligent and complex, and decidedly non-mainstream film, like ""Traffic"" and this high-gloss, populist version of ""Norma Rae"" in the same year? He makes ""Sex, Lies & Videotape,"" then he makes ""Ocean's Twelve,"" and then he turns around and makes ""Bubble."" I don't get it. Is he attempting to stretch his versatility as a director, or is he just wildly inconsistent? ""Erin Brockovich"" is outrageously ridiculous, and doesn't maintain even the barest grip on reality. It exists solely as an opportunity for Julia Roberts' devoted fans to see her tear up the screen and give anyone standing within 20 feet of her on screen a what-for, but it doesn't really ask her to act. Roberts is further indication that someone's star power is in inverse proportion to his/her talent (see Halle Berry, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston). Roberts would be nothing as an actress (as evidenced by her recent panned Broadway debut) without the fakery of cinema. She needs good lighting, clever editing, expert hair dressers to tame that lion's mane of her's. She's at her best when a director clears everyone else out of her way and lets the camera linger on her in close-up, which is what Soderbergh does here. Compare her's to the feisty performance delivered by Sally Field in ""Norma Rae"" to see just how unconvincing Roberts is.But, and this is a big ""but,"" all of that aside, ""Erin Brockovich"" is enormously entertaining, as these liberal fight-against-the-system movies always are. The film is helped tremendously by Albert Finney, who matches Roberts every step of the way and has a boatload of chemistry with the leading lady. If it weren't for his presence, the Julia Roberts love-fest would become overbearing.Grade: B+",Erin Brockovich
19,anaconda-40658,Julia Roberts Doing Lame Standup Act.,1,22 May 2015,"Erin Brockovich (2000): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger, Peter Coyote: Overrated pathetic showcase based on a true story of a single mother who has been through several jobs. Albert Finney plays her lawyer who loses an opening case regarding her car accident. One day she practically hires herself on a case regarding a firm's lack of warning regarding toxic water. The firm is trying to force people out of their homes with little money to cover expenses. Her relationship with her biker neighbour is an unnecessary romantic subplot. Director Steven Soderbergh doesn't include a single interesting shot unlike his much more interesting Out of Sight. It is as if he just sat the camera down and let it run. There is too much showcasing of Julia Roberts in whorish clothes, and her verbal bouts are done more for show than character. Albert Finney as her lawyer is a prop. Aaron Eckhart as her neighbour is unnecessary. Marg Helgenberger is featured as one of the interviewees. Peter Coyote is also featured to remind us that once upon a time he was in a great film called E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. The role is fairly standard where she tells us what we already know and awaits Roberts to make everything better. Message is thwarted thanks to focus on skimpy clothing, hokey dialogue and romantic drivel. Score: 1 / 10",Erin Brockovich
20,zetes,Hard to recommend...,6,8 January 2001,"I think Steven Soderbergh has grown to be a very great director, one of the best living Americans in the business. I loved Out of Sight, and The Limey was really great, too. Traffic was also quite good. Now, only a couple of nights after seeing Traffic in the theater, I got to watch Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, it was not great. I didn't really expect all that much while watching. I had heard from numerous people that Soderbergh did it just so he could make movies that he preferred to make. I don't think that that attitude is bad. If a good director has to sell out a little in order to make a great film, I say go ahead.Now Erin Brockovich isn't anywhere near a complete failure. There's a lot to like about the film. Its main problem is its extremely formulaic story (I thought Traffic had a formulaic story, too, but not on this level). Also, the fact that the action becomes repetitive is no help. At first, Brockovich's shtick (i.e., someone p***es her off (when it shouldn't, usually), so she becomes so angry at them that they eventually back off; this happens again and again and again in the film) is entertaining, albeit, not very believable (I did not feel too sorry when she is fired), but after the fifth time, the act becomes frustrating. This is especially true with the final scene, where Brockovich gets paid for a job well done. Tell me that you didn't see the joke coming from the second Albert Finney enters the room.So let us talk about acting. First, Aaron Eckhart's gentle Harley dude: I like Eckhart in Neal LaBute's films, In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, but I don't know if he works here. Maybe it's not him in particular, but the script. His character is kind of boring. He's not well developed, and he is never interesting. In fact, I think Brockovich's whole domestic situation gets kind of boring as the narrative moves more towards the lawsuit (it begins quite compellingly). The scenes with Eckhart and the Brockovich children are almost all very cliche. None ring true, at least for me. The meet-cute between Brockovich and George (Eckhart) is quite irritating.Albert Finney: he is quite good in a pretty poorly written role. His character is not complex, but Finney manages to bring energy into the role. I liked him, and if this film is considered for some Oscars, which I doubt it will receive (except for maybe Roberts' role), Finney probably deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Now for Julia Roberts. To speak the truth, I think Pretty Woman is the only other movie I've ever seen her in. I try to avoid her movies. She is so unbelievably beautiful that it is difficult to take her acting seriously at times. And herein lies the difficulty of my rating her performance. I could never take my eyes off of her (and it was not her breasts at all, as others have claimed that they were a great distraction, but rather her face, her lips, her eyes especially). I think Roberts did a pretty good job in the quieter moments of the film. The best scene of the film is when George tells Erin about her youngest child's first words, spoken while she was working. There, I can see that Roberts can act. Also, when she is lying to her children about having eaten near the beginning of the film. She's quite good there, too. And there are plenty of very good scenes where Brockovich forms relationships with her clients, and this becomes quite touching. The problem elsewhere is that Brockovich is written over the top. First off, she is written as if she were a Saint, or at least a Pope, since she seems to be infallible. We as the audience are lead to identify with her at every point, even when she is obviously being rude or cruel for no reason, or just when she behaves stupidly. This is being too kind to Erin Brockovich as a real person, and thus it becomes difficult to take her character or the film seriously. When she would flip out, I would begin to hate her. Her attitude ceases being funny very quickly and just becomes tiring. But I say, although my own heart is with Bjork (Dancer in the Dark), just give Roberts the Best Actress Oscar. Then she will have won one, and she won't have to do serious movies anymore. This film was, after all, produced basically to get Julia Roberts and Oscar.Soderbergh does three things worth note in this Hollywood: he uses plenty of jump cuts, by which an American audience would normally be disturbed. They are mild, and perhaps they serve to teach the regular moviegoing population about their purpose. Also, it is filmed entirely with a handheld camera. This is good for the same reason that jump cuts are good. And, most thankfully, the musical score is very underplayed, which is rare in dramas nowadays. There is a very good scene near the end when Brockovich tells a sick woman how much money she has won in the lawsuit. Usually, this scene would have been overwhelmed with musical score. But here, there is no music. That is wonderful. It is not missed at all.

It was enjoyable to watch how mistakes happen, intentionally, or people just not caring, and lawyers (for a change not being the bad guy) give people the opportunity for amends.  Regrettably money will never be a true payment for justice, but the people at least were able to move.  I wonder how many of these man made disasters happen?  In Canada, we seem too have cover ups where I read the paper, and nothing ever get resolved with many issues.  I wonder if they get settled out of court.  A movie is like a few pictures of a very complex event.  I found this movie, it may have been dramatized, gave me a better understanding of the events.8 out of 10",Erin Brockovich

24,sddavis63,The Best Performance I've Seen From Julia Roberts,7,31 March 2012,"I have to right off confess that I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts. As an actress I think she's OK but not much more than that, and I personally don't think she's the raving beauty that a lot of people think she is. That, of course, is merely a matter of personal taste on my part, but perhaps it makes my assessment of her work in ""Erin Brockovich"" even more interesting. I really liked her in this! I have no argument at all with her Oscar for this role! I thought that she really got into the part of Erin and seemed to nail it - and I'm impressed by the fact that the real Erin Brockovich was involved with this film and even played a small role in it as a waitress - thus suggesting that she, too, felt that the portrayal of her was fair. In fact, on her website, the real Erin says that the movie is 98% true, with some dramatic licence taken in the other 2%. That was important for me to know, because, while Erin is the hero in this, it's not an altogether flattering portrayal of her, especially in the movie's early stages. Somewhat trashy I would say. Uneducated (which is actually not accurate), unemployed, foul-mouthed and living as a single mom to her three kids in a bug-infested home, her prospects don't appear very promising. But after being involved in a car accident, she hired lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who was also quite good in his role) to sue the other driver. Masry loses the case but apparently out of guilt hires her on at his law firm. Erin becomes involved in a case against a large corporation accused of causing serious health problems to residents around its plant by polluting the water with chemicals, and the movie follows the development of that case.Yes. I liked Roberts, and I liked Erin Brockovich - both the movie and the person as portrayed. This is a classic ""underdog overcomes"" story. Erin obviously grows in confidence and ability as the movie progresses, and as she has to fight for recognition and respect from the families involved in the lawsuit, her fellow employees at the law firm and the various lawyers she has to deal with. At the same time, we see her struggle with the cost involved with all this - an increasingly distant relationship with her children because she's away a lot due to the case, and her inability to maintain a relationship with her neighbour George (Aaron Eckhardt) - who loves her but is increasingly resentful that she seems to view him as little more than easy child care. Good character development, well portrayed by Julia Roberts.The legal drama (although very much front and centre) is not the engine that pushes this movie forward. That's very much the portrayal of Erin the person. But the portrayal of the drama does point out the challenges involved in taking on a large corporation that has both lots of money and lots of lawyers. As you learn the stories of the affected families, you develop a sympathy for them. And yet, in some ways, the legal aspects of the film slow this down a bit. I mean, it's a true story. We pretty much know how it turns out. That takes some of the drama away from it. It does have a nice, heartwarming ending though as Erin reveals the terms of the settlement to one of the more pitiable of the plaintiffs.This is a good movie, and definitely one of Julia Roberts' best - and this from someone, as I said, who's not generally overly smitten with Julia Roberts.

25,ElMaruecan82,"A ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood"", it ain't ...",7,27 September 2013,"In 1974, in ""A Woman Under the Influence"", Gena Rowlands gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn, a struggling mother in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".In 2000, in ""Requiem For a Dream"", Ellen Burstyn gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts, a struggling mother in ""Erin Brokovich"".Hollywood must have a thing for struggling mothers, I guess. But Julia Roberts' acting didn't convince me on that particular area, call it the anger from knowing that her performance beat up Ellen Busrtyn's heart-breaking performance, I call it the 'boobs' effect. Once we got that Erin Brokovich was a free-spirited single mother who loved to dress with tight skirts and deep décolleté highlighting her beautiful assets, could that be made a little bit less distracting, for plot's sake? The film had the premise: an uneducated woman crusading against a California power lawsuit accused of poisoning water's supply and ultimately triumphing, far from the tragic heroine figure sacrificing herself, she gets the largest settlement ever paid in a direct action and her life financially improves (I hope her wardrobe tastes did too, from what I saw, it did, sexy outfits, but expensive ones).Anyway, that kind of 'David vs. Goliath' story is pure gold for Hollywood, and Steven Soderbergh was right to believe in it, even 'Erin Brokovich' sounded more cinematic than any fictional name. But since the story is already phenomenal, why make Erin such a 'remarkable' woman from the very start? Why not allow Julia Roberts' undeniable charisma to disappear within her character?I supposes Soderbergh tried to show some three-dimensionality and even succeeded by questioning whether Erin was motivated by justice or by the selfish desire to be the one (and only one) who pulled the giant on his knees, to prove herself capable. But damn, I couldn't get my eyes of Roberts' breasts all through the film, using Peter Griffin's vocabulary, as far as breasts (and legs, too) were concerned, ""the film insisted upon itself"", so much it even diminished the merit of Julia Roberts who's precisely supposed to play that kind of woman, at one point, I wondered whether it was Erin or 'Pretty Woman' I was watching.Burstyn diluted herself in Sara Goldfarb's personality; Roberts relied too much on that superficial facade, as if she (or writers) thought we would only 'love' that she could outsmart smarter people unless we get the total opposite feeling from the beginning. I know this film is supposed to make you feel good for the victims of one of the most disgraceful injustices ever, well, I felt good for them, but that was the predictable emotional pay-off, everything that happened before was handled like 'obligatory plot devices', each time, in an over-the-top way.Starting with the heroine: the struggling mother, the ultimate female 'underdog' figure, she lives alone with three children and doesn't trust men, because they all treated her like crap, and women in her office aren't any kinder. Maybe we're supposed to empathize with Erin, while we know every single woman who appears with these outskirts would not be watched with trustful eyes. But that's okay, she has the right to be the way she is, no matter how hypocritical it is to flash her (beautiful) body so eagerly and then wanting to be judged for smarts.The irony here is that her clothes do make a point sometimes. For instance, when she goes to the water company and tries to flirt with the guy behind the counter to get some incriminating files, it makes sense, but she's always dressed like that, so, the point is lost. Let's get back to the clichés' department, at one point, Erin falls in love with George, a tough biker, but the guy doesn't provide anything to the film apart from being a plot-filler. Just compare Aaron Eckhart's role with Sam Elliot in ""Mask"" and you get the idea, the screenplay turned realistic stuff into pure fictionalized drama.That's not even the worst, George pushes her to abandon the case when she's threatened. Maybe that's what happened in real life, but the way it was handled in the film was painfully unrealistic. Couldn't Erin tell George what her fight was about? I would have believed such a considerate man would respect Erin's efforts and even try to help her but no! He was selfishly complaining about the time she spent outside, and naturally, when he left, I don't know who couldn't see that coming.The same unrealistic stuff happens again with Ed Masri, her employer played by Albert Finney. He fires Erin after three unjustified days off. He could have asked for explanations, or she could at least tell him, it would have cleared the misunderstanding. No, that was too convenient and we had to wait for five or ten minutes again. And I can go on and on, when the case is given to a bigger lawyer's office, one of the new assignees try to get in touch the plaintiffs, we know, it's a matter of time before Erin gets back on the road again.The material wasn't revolutionary, and the film is relatively honest in the way it handles the case, no surprise witness, no spectacular revelation, no physical threats apart from the phone call. But the writing, directing and acting should have learned one thing or two from the 'New Hollywood' era. Something like ""Norma Rae"" or ""Silkwood"" for instance, but there's a quality in Sally Field and Meryl Streep that lacks in the 2000's Julia Roberts, and this is not a critic, Roberts is superb, but for once, she's victim of her superbness.",Erin Brockovich
26,paul2001sw-1,Caring too much,6,19 February 2010,"My favourite film about a corporate lawsuit is Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter', which features a shifty, self-hating lawyer and a tragedy where it's very unclear whether anyone is to blame, and even if they are, whether anything is to gain by holding them to account. Stephen Soderbergh's 'Erin Brockovich' is a rather different story, in which Erin (played by Julia Roberts) brings a multi-million dollar corporation to its knees through a simple combination of loving her kids, wearing short skirts, swearing a lot and above all else, by caring too much. The latter is really her trump card - whenever there's a dispute about any point in the case, the corporate lawyers are always wrong and Erin is right because she cares. The film is based on a true story, and maybe this is actually how it happened, but it certainly doesn't provide any moral ambiguity to interest the viewer. In true American style, the happy ending is that all the good characters make several million dollars.",Erin Brockovich
27,ThomasDrufke,"""I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it. """,8,18 November 2014,"Erin Brockovich is one of those films that without it's star, it wouldn't nearly be as good. In fact I would go as far as saying without Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich this film just doesn't work. Sure the character and Robert's portrayal can be a bit over dramatic at times, but Roberts presence is felt every time she graces the screen.Julia Roberts is widely known as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and probably the most popular female of the last 30 years. But she's no slum acting wise. She garnered her Oscar win for this role, and rightfully so. She has some all-time great scenes, and I mean all-time great scenes. She is great at giving us dramatic moments with a bit of comedy mixed in. Her numbers moment with Aaron Eckhart was hilarious and her 'presents' speech to the lawyers was just as entertaining. Albert Finney had great chemistry with Roberts and gave just as great of a performance, but that's typical for Finney.With as much as the film focuses on Brockovich's devotion to giving her children the best possible life, I didn't particularly find the relationship fulfilling. I don't blame Eckhart for leaving for awhile either, sure she helped hundreds of people but her family was in need of a mother and she wasn't there for them. Whether or not that was put in the movie for dramatic purposes or not, who knows. There are quite a few really emotional moments that may or may not evoke tears.

29,Dr_Coulardeau,Julia Roberts as the Archangel Gabriel,9,16 November 2010,"Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Erin Brockovich
30,johnnyboyz,"Rather an enthralling film covering a woman on the brink, effectively covering her aiding the victimised and then coping with her own life.",8,30 September 2010,"Erin Brokovich is the remarkable true story of a beauty pageant contestant turned legal expert whom very gradually uncovered levels of corruption within a California based power company. One of the many joys of the film lies in how director Steven Soderbergh takes what should be the ultimate tale of a character or person well out of their depth and integrates them into their new surroundings so much so, that it turns out they are both infinitely more qualified and more able in dealing with the situation than some of their contemporaries. The film has all the charge and dramatic punch of a scuzzy, hard boiled revenge film as it covers an enraged lead on a mission in which no one will get in their way; its Conservitive core isn't heavy handed and the film's documentation of a tale dominated by themes of female empowerment is, pleasingly, never for a second interested in the objectification of its lead, despite the field from whence they herald and despite their more usual attire. One of the key exchanges highlighting the lead's newfound sense of identity within the world of law and investigation sees her speak to some of the victims of a power company's leak of some toxins into the local water supply, an event which happened some years ago. The child of the family can speak to our lead, they can speak to her in a way that they couldn't when a suit-clad, official, law degree wielding individual would come round to visit. The fish is most certainly out of the water but finding life easier and more digestible up on dry land, it seems.It is Julia Roberts playing American jobber turned beauty pageant competitor Erin Brockovich, the divorced single mother of three children striving to get by after a car accident and the loss of a consequential lawsuit leaves her with seventy-five dollars left. One of the very first instances we have of Brockovich engaging in official office-talk in a strictly business-like fashion is when dialogue with a doctor plays out, his background out of a nearby window occupied by tall, domineering buildings with a lone empty alcohol bottle occupying the space immediately behind Erin as suggestions of dishevelment draw in. While Brockovich herself was never an alcoholic, subtle props placed to reflect a respective situation work well; this early defeat aiding in getting across a sense of magnitude later on when we realise how far she's gone in taking on the nature of situations such as these and the officials at the core of these predicaments.Erin is supported by her lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), a man whom grants her a job at his small law firm when an outburst in court following the aforementioned car accident and consequent injury sees that particular claim fall through. From the bottom working upwards, the film is a joyous and deeply captivating tale of a woman on a road she had no real idea existed, ploughing onwards towards a hopeful victory. The sense that Brockovich is out of her depth or isn't immediately of the law firm ilk is effectively dealt with early on. Whilst working at the offices, Erin doesn't go to lunch with the other girls because ""she's not like the other girls""; her attire and informal mannerisms as she scoots around the office, verbally badgering Masry on occasion puts her in stark contrast to the other woman of the office whom spend most of their time passively occupying a space behind a desk and possessing a thoroughly different overall stature.Oral and visual confirmations of her respective situation as a person there are behind us by the time the tale has taken centre stage, an uncovering of some menial files which launches Erin into her quest the catalyst. The film is a superb documentation of this case involving injustices to a number of people in a small Californian town named Hinkley, as an electrical company and a water supply occupy the forefront of the case. The film very cleverly has a child take centre stage when Erin visits one of the victimised families, and that sense of the corporation being of an even nastier ilk than to how we may have previously felt, is slyly hit home by the film when it transpires an infant has been severely wronged by these people. On another strand, Erin's private life creeps into proceedings as neighbouring Hell's Angel biker George (Eckhart) becomes somewhat of a love interest, while her children become disenchanted by their mother's full time work; George being another character whom, like the loose, extroverted and former beauty pageant contest entering Erin, is granted a deconstruction of sorts and documented as anything but what prior conceptions we may have of them. It turns out he's good with her children, a kind man and is apologetic during their first encounter when he revs a motorcycle on his driveway too loudly, too late on.Indeed, the film pokes fun at how it could've used both Brockovich's demeanour and appearance. Allowing the fact this highly attractive woman, whom in usually on show in a vast range of cheap outfits, is at the centre of this really fascinating and humbling story, but only once uses her sexuality or 'to-be-looked-at-ness' as an example of principal involvement. The amusing sequence briefly hands Erin a seductive characteristic when she manages to con her way past a young male desk clerk and into an archival room doubling up as a mine of gold for the prosecution. As the clerk watches The Wheel of Fortune on a television, Erin spins the proverbial whilst somewhat illegally accessing the files she'll need. The film is refreshing and immense fun; Roberts, through her character, capturing a real sense desperation mixed with dedication blended with eccentricity as she soars on integrating with all around her, in what is an unremittingly engaging text based on true tale.",Erin Brockovich
31,filipemanuelneto,One of the best films of Julia Roberts,6,21 November 2016,"This film is very slightly based on a real case of environmental pollution, where a small community processed a factory because of the pollution and the diseases that it caused. Erin Brockovich (whom Julia Roberts brought to life) is a single, unemployed mother who comes across this process by chance, while working (almost by favor) in a law firm. Julia Roberts has had, in this film, one of the most remarkable works of her career to date, along with ""Notting Hill"". She is a talented actress, who filled with spirit and personality a character who needed a point of irreverence and temper. At her side was Albert Finney in the role of Ed Masry, the law firm's chief partner, who accepts (reluctantly and suspiciously) Erin's help in resolving what promises to be the most important legal case of his career. The film does not hesitate to portray the polluting firm in the worst possible way, in a not inconsiderate and certainly premeditated criticism of the large US corporations, that rarely put environmental and health concerns at the top of their priorities. In this sense, the film, which never abandons the comic and entertainment side, takes a strongly interventionist stance, seeking to alert consciences and draw the attention to the situation portrayed, and some analogous situations that still continue to persist. The film also gives some importance to the so-called ""anonymous heroes"", which Erin symbolizes in a way, and that often make the difference when all other people choose to ignore the problem or let the authorities figure it all out. The cinematography emphasizes the warm and vibrant tones, which reinforces the sensation of heat passed by the filming locations and the garish prints of Erin's clothes, clothes that help the character to clearly assumes her popular and very humble condition.This movie is far from a thriller or a police movie. It's an entertainment film that has been made for the families, but with a huge desire to alert consciences to environmental and health concerns, which it always approaches in a light but determined way.",Erin Brockovich

While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine.""Erin Brockovich"" stars Julia Roberts in the title role in a film based on the true story of a twice-married mother of three who is desperate to find a way to make a living and provide for her family. After a failed attempt at suing for damages after a car accident, Brockovich turns to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), for a job doing anything she can at his law firm. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case.Roberts had to have been a no-questions-asked best actress winner after this performance. As Brockovich she is incredible playing multiple roles as the loving mother, the driven working-woman, the troubled lover, everything. The mood swings are effortless for her. Perhaps the best element of her performance is that she comes across as glaringly flawed, even if she is quite likable. Her lines are killer and delivered with command. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless.Finney's character is much the same way. He is really enjoyable to watch and gives a great performance even though his character never gets truly dramatic.This is just a great screenplay by Susannah Grant. It's almost completely devoid of melodrama and yet it tackles so many real life issues. Brockovich's struggle to balance her work with her family brings up an issue that can connect with anyone, although the feminist tones of the film obviously won't connect as strongly with men. Director Steven Soderbergh feels very distant from the film. Every so often a shot or sequence will be artistic, but he allows the story to tell itself for the most part.""Erin Brockovich"" is better than the average feel-good story. When there's little melodrama and great acting, a feel-good story becomes a great movie. Sports films based on true stories are feel-good stories, but they don't get nominated for best picture.

35,Anonymous_Maxine,This is one of those films that makes up for its total lack of originality with some fairly respectable acting and a few good cleavage shots.,7,28 August 2000,"What was up with the low cut shirts, anyway? Was there some specific reason why Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) had her push-up bra showing above the top of her low cut shirt in every single scene she was in? In my opinion, if they are going to do something like that in a film, they better have a real good reason for it, and in this particular film, they didn't.
Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich in the true story about a woman who took interest in a particular case she came across at the law office where she worked and ended up as the initiating force behind a tremendous lawsuit. She delivered a fairly good performance, but her personality was badly manipulated for the film. Do you really think that she was able to memorize some 650 different phone numbers, names, afflictions, relatives, etc? I don't think so. Fred freakin' Tate wouldn't even be able to do that. Besides that, her excessively loud streams of profanity grew tiring very quickly.This is an entertaining film to watch about the corruptions of a huge corporation being thrown back in its face, but the story doesn't have much strength. Despite its good intentions, it gives the illusion that financial gain is the answer if you and your entire family have become gravely ill. In the movie, the settlement to the lawsuit is seen as victory, and no more attention is paid to the sicknesses of the families. Besides that, I find it hard to believe that so many people in the same small town could have gotten that sick for so many years and no one would have even noticed. You'd think there would be some sort of pattern showing up at the local hospitals at least. Overall, Erin Brockovich is an entertaining enough movie. It doesn't break any new ground or tell anything original, but this is a type of film that is always entertaining to watch. If you're into legal thrillers, watch The Rainmaker. If you like The Rainmaker, watch The Firm. If you like The Firm, watch A Civil Action. And if you like A Civil Action and you just need more more more, watch Erin Brockovich, and watch for the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress early in the film.",Erin Brockovich

Her hard-edged portrayal of the character, though, left me feeling that something was missing. In most of her other films, she exudes a certain charm that was missing here. I presume this was deliberate, so it is hard to criticize, but in the future, please, give me back the other Julia!",Erin Brockovich
43,r96sk,Julia Roberts is terrific,8,22 October 2020,"Very good film. Julia Roberts is terrific.It may go on for 10-15 minutes too long, but even so 'Erin Brockovich' is a fascinating biographical film. The dialogue is pretty sharp, there are a few good lines in there for Roberts. She herself is terrific here, I enjoyed her whole performance.Away from Roberts, you have Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart involved, as well as a few minor roles for recognisable faces from television - namely Michael Harney and Wade Williams. Finney and Eckhart are more than decent, but Roberts is most definitely the one that keeps the film moving forward.Well worth a watch.",Erin Brockovich

Of course its Julie Roberts who steals every scene and really makes this film shine. I'm not generally a fan of hers but she owns this role; outspoken, spirited, trashy doesn't have a filter, but you cheer her on because she's also hard working, loves her family is genuinely concerned about the clients and is relatable.I liked everything about this fact based drama. Albert Finney is awesome, sparring with Erin and how many of us fell for Aaron Eckhart here? Sigh. Almost unrecognizable as the nice guy biker boyfriend/babysitter.Roberts plays an outspoken, somewhat trashy single mother in her Oscar winning role, who after browbeating her lawyer into giving her a job almost singlehandedly brings down a California power company accused of contaminating a towns water supply -to the tune of 333 million dollar settlement.This is just a brilliant movie, funny, frustrating (scary regarding the big cooperation) filled with great characters and I just love seeing the little guy win for a change. 2/3/15",Erin Brockovich

We know from the beginning that there will be a happy ending which lessons the realistic quality that it could have had.  This is definetly a Hollywood picture and good causes are usually received well these days both by the public and the Oscars.  I recommend this as a good Hollywood movie, and Roberts does a good job with what she has but I've seen her better. She probably won the Oscar for her career, but oh well why not.  Back to the film--- a well-made cleanly drawn picture of a real person who probably was not quite as impressive in real life as the character was, but that's the way this type of movie is usually made otherwise we wouldn't want to watch it would we, but this one we do.",Erin Brockovich

The first third or so of the movie is Julia movie star bright and snappy and captures us. (All of the other women in the movie are really bland so as not to challenge Julia's flash.) In, the second third she doesn't smile and the movie fades.The last third is a legal drama that's a little guy triumph over nasty corporation. One can't even tell that the director is the same Steven Soderbergh whose two most recent movies ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"" had brilliant directorial control that stylistically added to the basic story.

He didn't like it very much, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful! In my opinion, Erin (Julia Roberts) acted a little obscene, offensive, and vulgar at times, but I thought she was a very sweet and caring woman at heart. The only things I couldn't understand about Erin were why she dressed so revealingly and used so much foul language. George (Aaron Eckhart) was a funny guy at times, too. I especially liked Ed (Albert Finney). The reason I liked him was because of his business attitude. The one person I couldn't stand was Theresa Dallavale (Veanne Cox). This was because I thought she was such a snob! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Julia Roberts totally deserved her Oscar for her performance in this.

50,slokes,Raising Her Game,7,24 September 2015,"There are a lot of money lines in this smart drama about a woman directing a lawsuit against a big corporation that poisoned a community. One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.""Law school!"" moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). ""At this point, I'd settle for charm school.""Never mind Masry: ""Erin Brockovich,"" at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in ""Patton,"" albeit with a much different wardrobe.The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note: Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.Coates, who edited ""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And ""Erin Brockovich"" contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.""Brockovich"" doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that.",Erin Brockovich
51,aidanratesmovies,Julia Roberts is Fantastic,9,19 April 2020,"Entertaining, compelling, and fantastically acted, Erin Brockovich provides a rich sense of truth and justice- while also making it highly enjoyable. Julia Roberts stars as the titular character, and provides one hell of a performance. Not only is it groundbreaking, emotional, and rich with character and emotion, but it also feels genuine and real and Roberts, within every scene, never makes her role seem too small and/or too big. Albert Finney also provides a rather good performance, as well as some decent performances from the rest of the cast. Soderbergh's directing style may feel like a bit much at times, but for the most part, his harsh view on the truth surprisingly works in the film, and provides great clarity for both the viewer and the characters involved on screen. The film is written wonderfully, and it may not be the prettiest film to look at, but it does a good job at telling its stories without relying too harshly on camera work. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, but mostly, it's an entertaining journey of perseverance that demands to be seen. In the end, Erin Brockovich is a very good film that seeks the truth without shoving it too much down our throats. It's message is clear, and not weary, like many other films of its kind- not to mention it's well written and provides a fabulous performance from Roberts, that is much deserving of her Oscar win.
My Rating: 9.5/10",Erin Brockovich
52,Boyo-2,"Good, solid drama",1,20 February 2001,"As I watching this movie, I was not bored, insulted and since I didn't know much about the real events, it was interesting also.  By the time it was over I was glad I saw the movie.  Today I couldn't tell you a thing about it, if my life depended on it.  I am not saying a good movie HAS to stick with you for the rest of your life, but I should have been able to tell you something about what happened, I just saw it three days ago.   I guess this is my way of saying its rather unmemorable. I am glad it got made, mostly on Julia's name, I'd imagine.
And speaking of memorable - there is not a chance in hell I think anyone deserves Oscars for their work in this.  An Oscar winning movie should make an lasting impression, and as good as this movie was, it does not belong with other heavy-duty past Oscar winners. Ellen Burstyn deserves the Oscar Julia will win.  Sorry about that but if you saw Burstyn in ""Requiem for a Dream"", there is no way you'd disagree.  I can think fifteen actresses that could have done ""Erin"" just as well as Julia, if not better. Janet McTeer, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett, etc etc etc. are all capable but not BIG BOX OFFICE.I enjoyed Eckhardt very much and Julia owes him a thanks.  Their emotional scene on the telephone (involving her baby girl) is provided by the hard work of Aaron but Julia reaps all the benefits.",Erin Brockovich
53,adamjohns-42575,Not what I was expecting.,4,3 August 2020,"While I appreciate that the story is interesting and an example of the little guy winning for a change and in the real world too, I personally didn't think that much of this film. I'm not sure why it was raved about so much apart from Julia's brilliant performance.I don't think we saw enough of the woman Erin used to be, before she became so successful and I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the legal process and court scenes to make it more understandable and provide some light and shade. It was obvious that there was going to be issues with the boyfriend and kids, but I'd like to have seen it brewing a bit more, again to create some balance, although with that said, it is a really long story and more than a little bit drawn out.I think the real Erin must be an amazing woman and I'm glad that her story has been told, but I don't think we got to see enough of her in this one and I don't just mean her cameo in the diner.The supporting actors were very good, I've always had a soft spot for Albert for some reason and he played his part well and Aaron looked particularly tasty.I'm not sure what was missing from this film that would have made it better for me, but I wouldn't tell others not to bother with it, because I can see some of its appeal.",Erin Brockovich
54,masonsaul,Incredible drama,10,9 August 2019,"Erin Brockovich is an incredible drama based on a true story that's uplifting, emotional and funny whilst also being timely and relevant. Julia Roberts is perfect in the lead role and Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart give great supporting performances. Steven Soderbergh's direction is excellent and its well filmed. The pacing is also great.",Erin Brockovich
55,pachara87,"It's a fun movie with a heart, and definitely worth the big screen treatment.",9,14 January 2019,"Steven Soderbergh, after over a decade of experimenting in various forms of independent film (sex, lies and videotape; The Underneath; Schizopolis; The Limey), has begun to dabble in the mainstream; his current marriage, to a major studio film with an A-list star, could have been enough to send him scurrying back to the art house.The result here is not stillborn but a frisky, friendly child full of surprises. Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh's comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts, is in outline a lot like several other films, particularly A Civil Action, as well as the sort of true-life empowerment story you see on Lifetime every six months or so. But this film moves with a light step, and it takes time not just to establish characters but to appreciate them. You're in the hands of a director who genuinely likes people. In tone, the movie is actually closer to gentle mid-period Jonathan Demme films (like Melvin and Howard or Citizens Band) than to a routine legal drama.If Erin Brockovich didn't actually exist (she does, and has a cameo in the movie as a waitress named Julia), some screenwriter would've had to invent her for Julia Roberts. As written by Susannah Grant (Ever After and 28 Days), Erin is brassy, determined, full of love for her three kids and wary of everyone else; the character is perfectly suited to Roberts' strengths, and she plays Erin as a frazzled, ordinary woman with a knack for cutting to the point. No cutie-pie, Erin is a sharp, angular person -- an irresistible force that doesn't believe in immovable objects.After managing to find work at a California law firm, Erin starts to discover odd things in routine real-estate files: medical records that don't seem to belong there. She soon learns that a local plant, Pacific Gas & Electric, has been contaminating the water with chromium and has been trying to buy off the locals. With the initially grudging help of her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), Erin digs deeper and tries to rally the townspeople in a lawsuit against the corporation.In a way, Erin Brockovich is the distaff companion to Wonder Boys -- a disorganized wreck finds meaning in an endeavor larger than him/herself. The filmmakers here, as in Wonder Boys, pay more attention to subtleties of character than to plot mechanics. The actors are given space to bloom. Aaron Eckhart, so reptilian in his other roles (In the Company of Men, etc.), turns in a relaxed, friendly performance as George, the scruffy biker who gets involved with Erin and looks after her kids because he genuinely likes them. Albert Finney, too, seems energized in his many scenes with Roberts. They make a great team, providing two laughs for the price of one: Erin says something outlandish, and then Ed stands there silently, unsure whether to scream or laugh, or both. Watching Albert Finney struggling to keep his composure is one of the quieter pleasures of the movie season.Don't mistake Erin Brockovich for a classic or a masterpiece. Like Soderbergh's previous mainstream film Out of Sight, it's simply an example of Hollywood entertainment done with finesse and compassion, the way it always should be but so often isn't. Perhaps such a movie triumphs more because of what it doesn't do than because of what it does (Erin Brockovich, for instance, contains not a single tedious courtroom scene).The movie isn't really even about the lawsuit or about going after a corporation. It's about a woman finding out what she was meant to do, and finding the community that needs her.",Erin Brockovich
56,triple8,this is a GOOD movie.,9,10 May 2004,"I saw this in the theater and loved it. I really enjoyed Erin Brokovich and it Maybe my favorite Julia Roberts movie. It is empowering, well acted, touching and given the real Erin was in it, one gets the feeling it was accurate as well. I found this movie to be both wholly absorbing from the start, and incredibly disturbing.I walked away as well, with a deep sense of admiration and respect for Erin Brokavich and was happy Julia Roberts ultimately won an academy award for her portrayal of Erin-and that's a big thing because I'm not even a major Julia Roberts fan! But she was wonderful, sassy and strong minded and very good in the role. I expected to like this movie but am not sure I expected to like it this much.This reminded me a bit of the much earlier ""Silkwood"". I would completely recommend this movie to one who hasn't seen it yet, it gets a 9 out of 10 from me and was well done on many different levels. This is a movie that deserved the hype it got.",Erin Brockovich
57,nycritic,Soderbergh's Visuals in the Service of Roberts.,9,30 October 2005,"Despite being somewhat manipulative, despite being based on true events, despite essentially being a Julia Roberts' vehicle to the extreme, Steven Sodebergh hits a home run with his David and Goliath story. ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.Where most legal thrillers, in order to succeed, litter their stories with a slew of shady figures and double-crosses and plot twists, ERIN BROCKOVICH succeeds in sticking (like its heroine) to its ""little train that could"" story from start to finish. While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the ""big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism: it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether: TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own.",Erin Brockovich
58,raulfaust,Sorry seems to be the hardest word,6,20 January 2015,"Erin Brockovich is a strong and likable woman not because she is calm, polite or rich; it's due to the authenticity of her character that makes her so adorable. She feels like a REAL woman, who albeit having some bad qualities, never gives up on her desires. Julia Roberts does, in here, one of the best performances of her career, which is the main reason why this film works. The plot, on the other hand, is sometimes a little too long, which made me think there is no need for two hours of length. Also, I expected a little more intensity in the outcome, since I expected it to be the movie's climax. However, in fact, there is no climax at all. ""Erin Brockovich"" is a good storytelling and has a great acting, but never tries to provoke strong emotions, so don't expect it to be a tearjerker and you'll probably have a good time.",Erin Brockovich
59,eric262003,The Ultimate Julia Roberts Movie,8,3 July 2019,"""Erin Brockovich"" is truly the film that truly made Julia roberts a star being that she transitioned herself from a star in romantic comedies, here she makes the move to starring in a movie that won her over with the fans and with the Academy Awards in 2001.Starring in titular biopic of a paralegal confronting corrupt businesses and exposing their fraudulent ways without a care for her reputation in the process. The sides of Brockovich are handled in three integral parts. Her crass ways are never vulgar, just high-spirited. She may dress with questionable taste, but she has a heart of gold. If she berates and verbally mocks other people it's not that she's inconsiderate or mean, but because a lot of the corporations she's taking on hire some of the most underhanded and corrupt people on this planet. And for a bonus, she may act like she's naive, but we realize that she even hoodwinks the viewers revealing she's anything but.""Erin Brockovich"" epitomizes every character that Roberts has starred in since she made her debut in the mid 1980's. The character of Brockovich herself is the atypical figure that the film industry idolizes. Roberts was rightfully cast as she can talk tough and smart and still be attractive at the same time.The movie centres around this young paralegal who is a divorced, single mother of three children who's journey itself deserves to be written on paper. Though her job is not all that exciting or heavily paid, but was stunned when she found out that a major corporation like Pacific Gas and Electric were offering to underhandedly pay medical bills in the California town where their offices run. She goes undercover to further investigate with all the essential documents needed for a class action lawsuit and exploiting this corporation that are responsible for contaminating the water which has contributed to many civilians who have contacted several health problems.In her grinding research, she has met a hairless little girl who had to have chemotherapy, a lady battling breast cancer and her husband who's dying of lymphoma. In one of the more pivotal cases she tells a woman named Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) that what's ailing her is not from bad luck, but bad water which led to her getting her kids out of the water.Under the direction of Steven Soderbergh and based on actual events, this movie stands out as a true underdog story of how a small time paralegal goes through great lengths to take down a big corporation that has investments raging in $28 billion. Albert Finney plays lawyer Ed Masry who will have to go though great lengths to exploit this company for who they really are. Nobody ever said this case was going to be easy. Granted that Roberts usually handles performances on her own merits, but here it's Soderbergh that calls the shots plus he has to in order for this film to work and being this is not a fictionalized character she's portraying.If Roberts took control of the character, this movie would end up falling victim to satire. Though she carries the heavy cargo throughout the movie, her emotions have to be spot-on and the camera's attention is based off of her. The other cast members have to remain frozen until Roberts has the final camera-shot of her. Whether she's happy, angry or in crocodile tears, we the audience are cued how to react. Roberts has a reputation of being quite self-indulgent and though Soderbergh gives her that freedom to some extent, to the point where it really becomes Julia's world and everyone else is just secondary.Soderbergh does assure that the supporting characters are not underused here. Finney's character Masry is strong here though his reactions are mostly to stay disgruntled by his head-strong clerk, but underneath that hidden exterior is a man with a heart of gold who's contemplating retirement, but her presence does give him some strength. Veanne Cox is outstanding in some low-key comic relief as an uppity lawyer who's big fault was to usurp the determined Brockovich.The only weak scenes is when Erin's personal life is added to the story. And though Aaron Eckhart was very good as the George, the kindly biker who looks after Erin's kids all day. Sure it adds character development to some extent, but other times it can be a bit of overkill. The personal scenes were at the most quite mundane. Fortunately the lawsuit is still the primary focus and this is what people came in to see even going far as to say they would rather watch the lawsuit scenes than Roberts gracing us with her emotions.",Erin Brockovich
60,philip_vanderveken,I still wonder why it won so many awards,7,23 May 2005,"The story behind this movie is one that just had to be filmed. This is the kind of true story that appeals to so many people that there is absolutely no-one who would dare NOT to make movie out of it. So there were two options, either it would be filmed with a rather big budget, getting a chance in the cinema's, either it would end up as a cheap TV-drama. The makers chose the first option and that's a good thing...Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother. She's desperate to find a new job, but every interview ends up in disappointment because she doesn't have the right qualifications. And to make things worse for her, she also loses a lawsuit against a rich doctor who hit her in a car accident. She has no alternative left but to go to her lawyer and to 'ask' him for a job (threatening is a better word for it). She gets a job and while no-one takes her seriously, because of her trashy clothes and her lack of manners, she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Soon she discovers that the company is trying quietly to buy contaminated and polluted land in a residential area. But as she digs deeper, she finds enough evidence so the law company can sue the million-dollar corporation.Normally I would say that the underdog is a likable figure and most of the time that is true, but not in this case. A woman that swears as much as the Erin Brockovich in this movie and who doesn't mind to be so aggressive to so many people, really isn't very lovable. At least not in my opinion. OK, she may have had a hard time, but that still isn't a good reason to act the way she does. (I really hope the real one isn't like that, because you can't buy style and class and this is really about as low as you can get).About the acting I can be rather brief. Julia Robert's performance was decent, but certainly wasn't good enough to win an Oscar with it. Sure, it's the perfect role to seduce the Academy with, but all she really did was showing a lot of cleavage and talking dirty (which sometimes was really funny, but not always). All the other actors and especially Albert Finney, as the lawyer and head of the company, were OK. I don't really have any remarks on their performances. They weren't spectacular, but did what they had to do.All in all this isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't worth all the awards that it received. This rather thin and, if I didn't know better, unbelievable story is pure TV-material. A bigger budget wasn't enough to make me forget about that. In the end this movie is worth a watch, but it certainly isn't as great as some people want you to believe. I give it a 7/10.",Erin Brockovich
61,bandw,"Showcase for Roberts, but not much else.",7,12 March 2001,"This movie struck me as primarily a vehicle to put Julia Roberts on display - and that is not without its positive aspects. But did I ever once believe that I was not seeing Julia Roberts play Erin Brockovich? No. This was too much a showpiece for Roberts, rather than a movie that could seriously involve us in a drama with tremendous potential. I think it might have been more affecting to have the real Erin Brockovich play the part.I like Albert Finney, but he seemed less than convincing in this. In a scene where he is standing on a stage before a large audience trying to convince them to sign on to a deal that was probably in their best interests, but that many did not take to, he was not convincing to me. After his speech, Roberts told him, ""You were good."" But he wasn't.Many scenes were clearly enhanced for dramatic and humorous effect and I never felt that we were seeing a true story unfold. Compare this with ""Silkwood,"" a movie with a similar theme. There the focus was on the story and not on the star power of its protagonist. Or compare it to the recent ""Pollock,"" where you felt you were seeing the real thing played very straight.Having said all this, I have to admit that this movie did go down pretty smoothly while I was watching it. It was only thinking about it afterward that I realized that it could have been much more.",Erin Brockovich
62,Sergeant_Tibbs,Bland.,6,6 September 2013,"This is the type of movie that puts me off Steven Soderbergh. I started to find interest in the guy earlier this year when Side Effects surprised me but it's half-assed efforts like this that just make me feel like his hearts not in it. Which is a real travesty on my part because the guy does his cinematography and editing as well as directing. Erin Brockovich is a bland slow film. It works on a simple and boring juxtaposition of a sexy young Mom doing legal work she's not trained to do. It's satisfying as she's driven by a need for justice but it's not as interesting as it thinks it is. Roberts is okay, good for her but not awards worthy. It feels like Oscar bait really, hitting all the checklist, but in mild quantities. There's just not enough meat on this film. Soderbergh keeps giving a little and thinks its enough. Perhaps I should rewatch Traffic, I know that's a complex film.6/10",Erin Brockovich
63,mjw2305,Not the Norm,9,11 March 2004,"I have to say that this is one of my favourite films, it's not the norm for Julia Roberts to play a role like this and i was very surprised how convincing she was. She was simply fantastic and my opinion of her has elevated dramatically.The film itself is very well directed and extremely well cast, all the main characters are portrayed brilliantly.The film is based on a true story and i feel that the producers dramatised the events in a powerful and touching way.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, it is great.9/10",Erin Brockovich
64,DeeNine-2,Everything she does is real,10,6 February 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore. We love her. She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised. She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder. She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder). We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)... How about...no, no, NO. Give her someone near her equal. How about a real actor twice her age? How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))? Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance. Not only does it work, it's a triumph. Finney really is brilliant. His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character. Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses? For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion). For the first time in her life she is doing something important. For the first time in her life people respect her. There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth. She neglects him and her kids for her obsession. Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife. Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her. It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts! She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real. That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (""and all his relatives,"" as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the ""little guy"" versus the corporate behemoth. I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending. But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim. I haven't seen any of his latest movies, (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, & Videotape from 1989. I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",Erin Brockovich
65,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Silkwood meets Pay It Forward,7,23 October 2014,"This movie was highly predictable at best. I've seen The Insider, A Civil Action, Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal, Silkwood, and after that, you know what to expect from this movie.Basically Julia Roberts does a very convincing and talented performance as a harried mother of three, looking for work to support her family, and is unable to find any (she often has outbursts of swearing and such) until she meets a crabby lawyer and he reluctantly hires her. Soon she finds herself in the middle of a dangerous and disturbing case involving a gas company ditching chromium into the water supply of a neighborhood where the residents are suffering from cancer, chronic nosebleeds, all that toxic waste stuff. She also meets George, a biker who at first seems sleazy but turns out to be a nice guy.Despite amazing acting jobs and good soundtrack, this is a tiring plot done time and time again, environmental paranoia as usual. Although it's based on true events it it highly dramatized and there are various dragged out parts of the movie that could do with some editing. It also really puts corporations in a bad light; how quickly people forget that if they want products and fuel, industry has to come before the planet sometimes, whether they like it or not.Erin Brockovich isn't bad, but it could do with some rethinking.",Erin Brockovich
66,Screen_Blitz,Julia Roberts steals the spotlight and earns it,7,10 August 2016,"The story of Erin Brockovich is significantly intriguing as much as it is thought-provoking, even if it doesn't make a landmark in America's history. Director Steven Soderbergh gives a lively treatment to the inspirational story with a confident direction and an intelligent screenplay, even when the film begins to feel like a two-hour episode of a television series. Soderbergh's brilliant taste of filmmaking comes to life in a 1993 story of a Californian woman taking on one of the biggest class action lawsuits to ever take place in America, and the result is a true cinematic work of art with just small pinch of shortcoming in the mix. The movie pits Julia Roberts in the role of Erin Brockovich, an unlikable and unemployed single mother of three kids who is involved in a car collision while passing through an intersection. She receives aid from lawyer Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney) to assist her in court, but her profane and disrespectful behavior result in her losing the case. Still stuck on the unemployment lines, Erin successfully convinces Masry to hire her as a file clerk at the law firm. There, she comes across a case involving contamination on the water supply of Hinkley, California done by the Pacific Gas & Electricity Company. With a growing number of Hinkley residents getting ill from the contaminated water, Erin enlists the help of the reluctant Masry to assist her in a case against the multi-billion dollar company. This biographical drama doesn't rise into the rank of the most memorable biopics Hollywood has to offer, nor is it particularly groundbreaking at the least. But what matters most is that it's smart, it's clever, and it features Julia Roberts in a role that definitely defines her career compared to some of the romantic comedies she's endured in the past. Though the rude and surly attitude render of her character make her hard to care for at first, she eventually overcomes her cruel demeanor when she sets out to make a difference for those who are in need of help. Roberts embraces the role with sheer competency and grace (and profanity), it is significantly difficult to point out another role by her that impresses me more. Albert Finney also brings some acting gold in the mix, and his chemistry with co-star Julia Roberts comes on-screen and works quite effectively. Then there is Aaron Eckhart who has plays a motorcycle junkie who moves in next door and after his help with the children, eventually comes her boyfriend but faces a strain in their relationship when her constant work on the case dissolves her time at home. For the charismatic actor he is, he does pretty decent in his role, and does nothing to disappoint the slightest. The cast make admirable appearances on screen in this true story-based film written by Steven Soderbergh that captures true emotion without the temptation of manipulating it with overly sentimental tone, and makes an honest sense of the events that took place leading the title character into a major court case Erin had a very high chance of losing in trial. It was an important case where justice that meant not money, but the lives of the people affected by the wrongdoing of a filthy rich utility company. With people getting ill and some dying, Erin knew something had to be done. Erin Brockovich is an endearing biographical drama that leaves a landmark on both Julia Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh's career. It is a fascinating movie with a just a few flaws that are overshadowed with greatness and therefore difficult to point out. When taking about Julia Roberts, this film is the role she is likely remembered for.",Erin Brockovich

I would not have PAID to see it in the movie house frankly, it was on the level of many nice films I saw on the Lifetime Cable Networks Made for TV movies. That about sums it up for me. I liked the idea of a low income working single female almost living in a trailer park sticking it to the big corporation, but I've seen it before, over and over, on movies of the week...**yawn**. Julia Roberts' performance was...fine. Nothing to write home to mom about, and even more, why in the things of all that is Holy did she win an Oscar for this?

Despite Soderbergh being one of my favourite directors and some positive reviews, I missed the cinematic release because of Roberts. I eventually caught it on television recently, and I have to say it wasn't bad. Roberts was obviously annoying, but it does entertain for it's 2 hours.

71,hall895,"Unique heroine, uplifting tale",7,19 October 2012,"Erin Brockovich. Starring Julia Roberts. Co-starring Julia Roberts's cleavage. OK that's a bit of a stretch. But not by much. And it begins to tell you something about the woman Roberts plays. Erin Brockovich is not the bashful type. Loud, profane and quick to flaunt her, uh, assets. Erin's quite a package. And Roberts brings that package to the screen wonderfully. The excellent performance of the film's star helps gloss over some of the film's failings. There's a great story to work with here but you get the sense that story could have been told a little better. But Roberts keeps the film moving along best she can, whenever it threatens to veer well off course she's there to pull it together. The end result is a film which is perhaps not outstanding but certainly enjoyable and well worth seeing.So who is Erin Brockovich anyway? She's an unemployed single mother facing a desperate struggle to make ends meet. She talks her way into a job as a file clerk in a law office. Her boisterous personality and skimpy attire do not make her very popular amongst her female co-workers. And she continues to exasperate her boss, lawyer Ed Masry, who has no idea what to do with her. What he'd probably like to do is get rid of her. But when Erin starts digging into a real estate case which oddly has a slew of medical records tied to it things change. It becomes pretty clear that a massive cover-up has taken place, a huge utility company hiding the fact they have contaminated a town's water supply. Ed realizes Erin has hit on something. And now the two of them are going to form a very unlikely team. Erin hurtling forward at the speed of light and Ed trying to rein her in. Together they can hope to accomplish something quite remarkable, winning justice for a town full of innocent people whose lives have been destroyed.This film belongs to Julia Roberts all the way. She's on the screen for virtually every second of the film's running time. But in Albert Finney, who plays Ed Masry, Roberts has a very worthy foil. Erin Brockovich is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, full of determination to do what is right and win justice. Ed Masry is older, wearier, worn-down and inclined to do what is easiest. The actors playing the roles, Roberts and Finney, bring the contrast between the characters to life beautifully. It is in their interplay that the film has most of its best moments.There are times the movie struggles to move its story along. It sometimes gets bogged down in legal procedure. It brings in characters it doesn't make the best use of, most notably George, a biker played by Aaron Eckhart. Erin and George have a romantic relationship of sorts but the movie never spends enough time with the couple for us to really care how that part of the story plays itself out. The movie also glosses over some key parts of the real-life story, including Erin's own illnesses she suffered with during her investigation into the maladies of the townspeople. That was a chance for some dramatic tension which went begging. And there are some aspects of the case which are never made sufficiently clear. For instance there's one woman in the town who Erin works on tirelessly to get her to sign on to the lawsuit against the utility company. This woman is apparently the key to the whole thing. Why is she so important? The movie never begins to tell us. This is by no means the most dramatic of legal thrillers. There are no great twists and turns, no shadowy villains lurking in the corners. But what the movie might lack in dramatic zest it makes up for in heart. Roberts and Finney give tremendous performances and they carry the film along to a satisfying end. Maybe Erin Brockovich, the movie, falls somewhat short of greatness. But Erin Brockovich, the woman, did great things and she makes for a great movie character. And in this case that's enough to make this movie a success.",Erin Brockovich
72,Beta_Gallinger,"While the beginning is a little unsteady, this is mostly an unforgettably captivating drama",8,10 April 2010,"This was a very successful film based on a true story, and the lead actress, Julia Roberts, even won an Oscar for her performance here. I remember being shown over half of this biopic in my high school career studies class, since it was relevant to the subject, but do not recall seeing it all the way to the end. That was seven years ago, and three years after this ""Erin Brockovich"" film was released, so it has been out for ten years in total and I finally sat down to watch it from start to finish this month. Even though it took years for this to happen, and I don't think I was expecting to be able to give it a rating higher than 7/10, this 2000 drama certainly didn't fail to grab me. I guess my expectations were slightly surpassed, since I'm giving it an 8.Erin Brockovich is a single mother who has been married and divorced twice and is now desperately searching for employment, but is having no luck, lacking the experience required for the jobs she applies for. After a failed lawsuit against a doctor who crashed into her car on the road and left her injured, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry, to give her a job at his law firm to make up for the loss of the case. She gets to work for Masry as a clerk in his office, but her revealing attire and aggressive demeanor lead to conflict in the workplace. After getting this job, it isn't long before she begins to investigate a real estate case involving the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in Hinkley, California. She soon discovers that the company is responsible for the contamination of the water in this town! The hexavalent chromium that they dump is going into the town's water system, leading to serious health problems for the townspeople, and PG&E has been lying about it! This leads Brockovich and her law firm into a challenging fight against a multi-billion dollar corporation to try and bring them to justice!I'm can't remember exactly what my thoughts were as I watched this film seven years ago, but when I started watching it this month, it didn't look so great at the beginning with the job interview, but it quickly improves, perhaps starting with the part where the lawsuit fails. For the rest of the film, it's very intriguing for the most part as we watch the protagonist attempting to put an end to PG&E's crime against the people of Hinkley, and the problems she faces with her kids, her boyfriend George, her boss, and others. The film can be somewhat moving at times with scenes involving seriously ill Hinkley residents. Julia Roberts does a decent job playing the protagonist, even if her performance is not amazing, and I don't know exactly what the real Erin Brockovich is like, but the movie version of her is a short-tempered and often rude individual who also proves that she is caring and clever. Albert Finney also stands out as Ed Masry. He's an English actor and does a great American accent here. Not everything about this film is perfect, there is some fairly weak dialogue and maybe some unconvincing parts, but apart from that, I can't complain much when it comes to the film's quality.Since this is a movie based on a true story (there's even a cameo appearance from the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as a waitress named Julia), it doesn't surprise me that there has been controversy over how accurate it is, and some people have trashed the film for its inaccuracies, some of which I have read about. I really don't have much to say about this, but at the beginning, it does say it's BASED ON a true story, it doesn't say it IS a true story. Even if this biopic is very inaccurate, it's still a very effective and memorable film. With all the language, it's not family-friendly, and all the swearing, a lot of it coming from Julia Roberts in the lead role, is apparently the reason for the film's R rating. There are also adults who can't stand constant profanity in movies, and if you're one of them, ""Erin Brockovich"" is not for you, either. However, if you're old enough to watch this film AND you can take the language, you could find it to be a very satisfying drama.",Erin Brockovich
73,jhclues,"Prepare The Oscars For Roberts, Finney",10,10 September 2000,"A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of people in `Erin Brockovich,' a movie based on actual events, directed by Steven Soderbergh. When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley, California, she uncovers information that PG&E may have been responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake, but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a mailman's trousers. 	Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it like it is and won't take `no' for an answer.  She captures ever grain of realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked the odds against her. She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor that he succeeds so well in doing so. 	The solid supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best movies of the year, `Erin Brockovich' is a well made, absorbing and entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",Erin Brockovich
74,Stampsfightclub,Strong Roberts in dramatic true story,7,17 January 2010,"After losing a court trial Erin Brockovich (Roberts) forcefully secures a post at a law firm in the hope of raising money for her child and doing something substantial in her life.When the credits rolled and text appeared declared what happened next I had up to this point forgotten this in fact is a true story, which when looking back is a remarkable story.Opening with the Pretty Woman actress conversing with a stereotypical boss type at an interview her presence is felt strongly and we know we are in for a strong drama.As if to compact the genre into full flow we have a shocking car crash which ultimately leads to an unhappy Erin and the introduction of the law firm is set in motion with a staggering no holds barred meeting.The plot continues to move forward with its main star, coasting through some powerful real life motions such as being a single parent, struggling with finance and having difficulty getting work. The realism it portrays is strong and can be associated with any viewer and the fact that this is based on a woman's personal experience may have people shedding a tear or two, which is helped along by a bravado Julia Roberts.The actress at present in 2000 was in a run of a conventional romantic roles. My best friend's wedding, Notting Hill and Runaway bride had all appeared on the star's CV in recent years and here she branches out into a harder dramatic role that enables us viewers to truly see her full potential, which in turn was noticed by Hollywood who won her an Academy Award for her portrayal. I confess to never being high on her fan list but here we do see charisma and a no holds barred approach to truth telling and appetite for enthusiasm. One scene near the end where she is sitting with her boss and two lawyers is brilliant when she challenges her rival to name people and numbers, moment of the film.The supporting collection of actors lend subtle support to the main star. Aaron Eckhart is brilliant if underused as George the biker whilst Albert Finney is a revelation as a man who knows too much.Steven Soderbergh, beaten at the Oscars by his other work in Traffic, supplies the necessary dramatic styling of a plot not too high up on action and containing enough dramatic controversy and suspense to see us through. The scenes in the record offices are a bit stretched whilst seeing George with the kid is a bit of an overstep. However he more than makes up with it in the slightly humorous town's meeting and office sessions.This film, though smart in its casting and directing has a certain lackadaisical approach to story telling. Though based obviously on a true story there is a lack of pacing a stretching of scenes, a feeling of repetitiveness that you can never shake off. Whilst the ending intends to be a feel good motive you don't ultimately feel rewarded at the arrival and to the point in which it got their.And yet this is a good picture.

76,gbheron,Good Movie but Overhyped ***Spoilers***,8,21 January 2003,"""Erin Brokovich"" is a slick, big budget, A-List movie starring Julia Roberts. But it's not your typical Julia Roberts vehicle, in other words, it's not a romantic comedy. ""Erin Brokovich"" is a docu-drama, the material seemingly more attuned to an HBO made-for-TV movie than a weekend opener. But in the hands of Steven Soderberg, a very watchable movie is the result. Very watchable, but in my opinion, not deserving all the Oscar attention it got in 2001.My gripe is two-fold. First, there is no real drama, no tension. Everything the heroine attempts works out great. Finds a job, finds an understanding boyfriend, gets the bad guys, gets rich. Maybe that's how it went down in real life, but it's not very dramatic (or comedic).Secondly, even though this is not a romantic comedy it is still very much a Julia Roberts flick. Her smile and body (especially her breasts) are on constant display. This flick is her show through and through and everyone else is just a prop. So, does this make it a bad movie? No, it's a very good movie, just over-hyped and over rewarded.",Erin Brockovich
77,Bob-45,Norma Rae's a Pretty Woman Playing Quincy,6,19 March 2000,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADERIN BROCKOVICH is an overlong, routine star-turn for Julia Roberts. As Brockovich, Roberts shows the fashion sense of Cher, the vocabulary of Madonna (or Whoopi Goldberg), the sanctimony of Alan Alda, and the belligerence of Robert DeNiro (or Jack Klugman as QUINCY). A single mother with no education and trying to raise three children, Roberts/Brockovich struts around with a perpetual chip on her shoulder. To Roberts credit, she makes Brockovich understandable, though not overly likable (WAY too beligerant).  We also learn two heretofore undiscovered things about Roberts. She has a beauty mark (lovely spot, by the way), and she should NEVER again wear platform shoes.Brockovich intimidates herself into a job as a legal aide, and quickly uncovers a coverrup involving Pacific Gas & Electric, horribly polluted water, and people dieing of cancer; all the while, PG&E is consciously covering all this up.  During the course of her crusade, Brokovich succeeds in neglecting her children and driving away the only worthwhile man in her life. And what about the people made sick by PG&E.  They are portrayed and whiny and passive.  Hasn't anyone ever heard of a picket line?  NOTHING would get in and out of the gates of PG&E if it were MY family dying from their criminal activity.The movie reveals Brockovich received a $2,000,000 bonus for her work on this case.  Roberts received 20,000,000 to play her on screen.

79,stamper,"Julia Roberts' best performance ever? Sorry, NO!",8,14 December 2000,"Many people have said this film contains Julia Roberts' best screen performance ever and I must say I do not agree with that. I do not agree, because it kind of insinuates Julia has been doing crap out there on the big screen for years and that definitely is not true. What is true though is that Julia Roberts is an actress that brings really every character to the screen and the viewer as realistic possible and therefore she is always believable. The only difference with this film however is, that this is not a lighthearted comedy like Notting Hill, but a real life drama that calls for artistic acting instead of just an easy' romantic / comedy performance. That is also the reason I feel that this movie might actually get Roberts an Oscar nomination for best actress, because characters like this fall better with the critics than the characters she played in Notting Hill, My best Friend's Wedding or The Runaway Bride, for the critics seem to think that being able to be believable is not as much of an achievement, but rather having depth and strength and character is. That Oscar nomination I mentioned, could it be endangered though by the amounts of profanity in this picture? I hope not and I do not believe so, for if the critics would also react on profanity, where would Pulp Fiction have gotten? That profanity is one thing I liked too, I mean never have I seen such an adorable b..ch' on the screen. I mean you just have to love Brokovich (Roberts), for she is so true and right out and says whatever she wants, whenever she wants to whoever is in the room in her, it wouldn't matter if it were the Pope or the President of the USA. Oscar nomination, that's all I'm talking about, well will she win it? NO! And why not? Because she is too big a star, look at Carrey and Willis. Well what about Hanks you say. Well Hanks is a different story, he is known to star in films that require acting and he got famous with those acting roles, like in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and so on. Plus his comedy's never were as kitschy' as Roberts'. But as long as Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet are not out there, to get the Oscar Roberts' has a good chance. On and on I go about Roberts' great performance (again), but what about the other great performance I saw, coming from Albert Finney, who plays Roberts' boss. He was great too, but you know it was not all his achievement, just as Roberts' greatness was not all her achievement. The two just were unbeatable as a screen couple' and if there were prices for best on screen duo's they'd win them all, but since there is no such award I know (almost) for sure that Finney will win the Oscar. A few other Oscars the film will get or be nominated for are Best screenplay, Best Director and Best film (first one is a winner, the others are losers). But you know that's only how I think it will be and my opinion is not a good one to believe, since I thought Shakespeare in Love sucked big time and it got so many awards. But I am pretty optimistic, for I have not seen such a good artistic' movie this whole year. I mean it may not be fast paced or so, but it holds your attention and it is not too dramatic despite the fact that it is based on a true event which took place not even so many years ago and that is what I really liked also about this film. You really have to see this if you like these kinds of movies, whether you like Roberts or not, for her part is unlike anything she has ever played before cause I have never seen Pretty Woman' (sorry Mrs. Roberts) yell and curse like this before. No more nice girl, now it is tough, single, 3 children raising woman who knows what she wants and also how to get it so I suggest we stop calling Mrs. Roberts Pretty Woman', for there is so much more to her to all of you who didn't notice that after seeing The Pelican Brief, Sleeping with the Enemy, Flatliners, Conspiracy Theory, Mary Reilly or Stepmom. If this one can't convince you of Julia Roberts' acting quality a gun to your head couldn't do it!8 out of 10",Erin Brockovich
80,tbills2,Erin Brockovich is 1 of the best movies ever - Julia Roberts is THE best woman ever.,8,10 May 2018,"I love Julia Roberts. She's more than beautiful, Julia is godlike. Erin Brockovich is more than just a great movie. Roberts' perfectly ideal as Erin. Julia's performance rivals any performance or whatever you wanna call it by any actor or actress or whatever you wanna call them or anybody or anyone or anything done onscreen ever in the history of the infinity of humankind or womankind or mankind of all-time. I love Julia. Julia as Erin is absolutely awesome and extremely sexy. I'm arriving at the very cusp of realization that I love Julia more than any other woman, any other man, or any other person in the history of our time or anyone else's time. She looks nice. I appreciate this movie and the real Erin Brockovich so much. Julia's fun! I want to be with her way more than Aaron Eckhart's character. Older-aged Finney is the best and most memorable Finney. Julia's got a great smile man, or woman, with the most deeply beautiful bright brown eyes and fiery orange red hair and beautiful so big pink lips and a great body. I feel like this film's subject matter is entirely relevant and significant in today's times, or yesterday's times, or tomorrow's times or anyone's time for that matter. Julia, I've neglected you in my life for awhile now just a bit but I ain't doing it any further and I promise you as a young buck I used to love you more than anyone else and for some reason I lost that but it doesn't matter because I've rediscovered it now, my passionate true love for you, in my life.

81,harry-76,Of Boobs and Barbs,7,17 November 2000,"""What makes you think you can just walk in there [public utility records office] and find anything we need?"" inquires attorney Ed Masry.  Replies Erin Brockovich: ""They're called boobs, Ed.""  So it goes in this dramatic enactment of an allegedly true-life-based story. Just where facts leave off, however, and creative writing begins, may be another matter.Is it possible that an entire community near a large utility company can be duped by that company into believing that the widespread health challenges being faced by that community are in no way related to the company's toxic waste?  Even when that company is paying the medical expenses of certain community residents?  Is there something we don't know about civic awareness in this informed era that such a situation could exist with nary a citizen even remotely beginning to suspect there's something amiss?  No matter: in steps Eric Brockovitch armed, not only with persuasive physical endowments and sharp tongue, but also a quick mind and wit, to help bring this shocking situation to light and down this insidious company. Since Julia Roberts portrays Erin, the role is written to utilize Robert's uniquely hip, no-nonsense persona.  She makes a striking presence and commands attention and empathy with her skillful portrayal.After spending half the film recovering from the astonishment of the paunchy, aged appearance of once-handsome Albert Finney, we found his attorney Ed Masry to be an effective partner of research assistant Erin. Aaron Eckhart--as romantic interest, blue collar hippie, George--is almost unrecognizable from his starched white-collar, ""Chad,"" of ""In the Company of Men"" (which skyrocketed this enormously versatile actor to fame).The DVD-formatted version offers mini-interviews with both the film's director and Erin Brockovitch herself, lending credibility to the story's legal assertions. However, it's clear this film is not a documentary, and only through committed personal research can one uncover the true facts regarding this fascinating and significant class-action litigation of a multi-billion dollar utility company.It's a story which affects us all.",Erin Brockovich

The fact I've got it on DVD shows it was released when i was building my DVD collection. Having said that it's not a bad film and is certainly Julia Roberts finest moment to date. When we first meet Erin she's struggling to make ends meet and hoping to make some money from a compensation claim. Once that goes astray she gets a job from her solicitor Ed Masry (Albert Finney) because he screwed up. People like Erin because she is normal and she becomes embroiled in a case against a multinational company.,Erin Brockovich

Julia Roberts is a great actress, she has a bad personality, but that does not mean she can't act. In fact, she can act. Beautifully. With Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart, she acts out the story of ERIN BROCKOVICH.This was one of the better movies on the year 2000, as it sure made the Academy happy. Keep that in mind next time you want to win an award. Have Julia Roberts run around through-out the movie wearing an inflate-a-bra and twelve inch heeled shoes.Albert Finney plays Ed Masry, her boss who together uncover a covered-up misdeed made by a 28 billion dollar water corporation. And just like the box says: ""She brought a town to it's feet and a huge company to its knees"". She this movie if you are a fan of comedies or dramas.

85,esteban1747,Polluting water,7,1 August 2004,"The film is really interesting and touching a situation created by a company without considering the problems it may bring about with its wrong productive process. When a company does what this one did, it is causing a high social cost sometimes with irreversible effects on man health and the environment. Water was contaminated by hexavalent chromium and already affected several people living closely to the factory, my question here is: how long would it take to decontaminate that water? what are the expenses necessary to solve these problems? We live today but the world of tomorrow belongs to our grandsons and granddaughters, are we to leave egoistically a polluted environment to them? The film obviously focused more on the work carried out by an intelligent woman, probably nice one because Julia Roberts was very beautiful playing this role in the film, whose name is Erin Brockovich. The insurance company where Erin works or worked should be feeling happy to have a worker like her. She was able to seriously open this case and demand the company for its deeds. My congratulations to the director Steven Soderbergh for including an important issue for today and tomorrow, i.e. pollution, in this film, and also to Julia Roberts and Albert Finney for their excellent acting.",Erin Brockovich
86,raymond-15,An entertaining film about a remarkable woman,8,7 January 2002,"""This film is based on a true story"". So goes the prologue to the film version of the life of Erin Brokovich.  The word ""based"" gives the writer a great degree of latitude and it is probably the imaginative embellishments that add so much to the entertainment value of these remarkable events.The theme of the little guys up against the billion dollar companies is not new, but following the story gives one a feeling of tremendous satisfaction when honesty and perseverance wins through.  Such is the case with Erin Brokovich.  What a woman!  As portrayed in this film Erin Brokovich ( Julia Roberts) has a great figure amply displayed to the other employees and clients and commonly referred to as her secret weapon.  Julia Roberts gives a whirlwind performance as a single mother punctuating every outburst with repeated expletives.I do doubt the probability of a mother with three very young children allowing a biker with a Harley Davidson to watch over her children during her working day.  And what private  or government authority would allow a stranger to spend hours looking through confidential documents  held in their filing system.  But it makes a great story and the odd characters that pop up in various parts of the film give little gem performances.Serious aspects of the film involve a court case about compensation for the horrible deaths of people exposed to contaminated water in their daily lives.  We get a chemistry lesson too about the various forms of chromium and their relative biological toxicities.But when the film is over and the credits roll it's Julia Roberts as the central character we remember. A truly great performance.",Erin Brockovich

The direction is perfect, great story telling with the camera, both the visuals and sequence of events is perfect. I had some problems with the acting, especially Aaron Eckhart whom i didn't like much playing the boyfriend. However i was very pleased with Albert Finney's performance, my favorite of the flick, he stole his scenes. Only other performan ce I had other than Eckhart's performance was the poor score by Thomas Newman, whose scores I usually love (Three Kings, American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Mad City, etc...) Also Julia Roberts is at her very best here. The screenplay is written well, although a bit long at times, its pretty great, probably one of the best film of this sort (dealing with an important court case), although i still prefer The Insider. The film was indeed great though, a must-see for any film fan. 9/10 #134 on my list of all time favorite films",Erin Brockovich

89,skepticskeptical,Underdog with ample cleavage,6,10 December 2019,"Erin Brockovich offers a classic tale of the little guy (in this case, gal) going up against the system. What makes this story somewhat more appealing than the usual fairytale is that it is based loosely on a true story about a real woman. The script is linear, with much slapstick-type humor and nearly non-stop footage of Julia Roberts´ barely clothed body.Everyone likes the underdog to win. It gives us hope that the human spirit can prevail even against overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable forces. There is some attempt at romantic comedy here and there, but mostly the failure of Erin´s relationship reveals why she is twice divorced despite being gorgeous and sassy.This movie is okay. Nothing to rave about, and nothing I will ever watch again, but it had its moments. And the little guy (gal) won. The End.",Erin Brockovich
90,alice liddell,That mighty Soderbergh feeling.,7,26 April 2000,"A sensible female detective film that is solidly based on plausibility (well, slightly, I'm sure most abandoned mothers would agree).  Plot perfunctory but fun, acting, especially Julia Roberts, a surprising joy. Main reason the film is a must, of course, is Steven Soderbergh, catching up on Tim Burton as America's greatest director, here enjoying flexing his considerable creative muscles in a populist woman's picture - his 'cubist' editing; his sense of the wide American outdoors and minutae of domestic life (in a hilariously Hollywood version of the working class); his sardonic visual jokery (those skyscraper shots); his continued interest in parents and children (see THE LIMEY, THE GREEN ROOM); his refusal to patronise his heroine.",Erin Brockovich
91,FlickJunkie-2,Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance,8,16 August 2000,"Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that utility giant PG&E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in `The Limey'.  His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says ""DIRTY"") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.Albert Finney also gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific chemistry.Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his rebellious culture. However, I put more of the responsibility for this on the director than the actor. This is an excellent story that is well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity, I recommend it highly",Erin Brockovich

93,sashank_kini-1,Erin Rock-ovich!,8,22 November 2008,"It was my father who recommended me to see this film when it premiered on the television. I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn't disappointed at all!Julia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a 'maid/lover' of Erin .What I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character's traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that's why probably it wasn't possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.The story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The ""It's called b00bs"" line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn't make it completely unenlightening.Overall, I'm going to give this an eight. Don't forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone.",Erin Brockovich
94,moviesleuth2,John Grisham with an attitude,8,21 July 2009,"In general, legal films are either grand courtroom dramas or films about how the system has failed someone, or how it has been construed to bypass justice (which, I guess, is the same thing). ""Erin Brockovich"" is neither. Instead, it's about a woman who uses her personality to accomplish what many people with legal degrees cannot, and in the process, dealing a record-breaking blow to a company who cut corners and left many people very sick.Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is in a deep rut. A former beauty queen, she is nearly penniless after two failed marriages that left her with three kids, and she's unemployed. After she demands a job from an attorney named Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she uncovers a huge corporate crime almost by accident, and it turns out to be a lot bigger than she or Ed ever expected.Julia Roberts is the perfect choice to play the title character. Roberts has made a career out of playing sunny and extroverted characters, and that quality suits her well. Erin doesn't know anything about the legal system, but she has amazing people skills, and ultimately that's what really makes the case work. The people of Hinckley don't trust the lawyers, but they trust Erin. For lack of a better analogy, she's the Moses guiding the people to the promised land.However, Roberts has more range than she is often allowed to show. Working on the case takes a heavy toll on Erin's family life, and we see her pain from being away from her family. Some of these scenes are heartbreaking.The supporting cast members are great as well. Albert Finney is great as Ed Masry. He's got the brains, and knows he's in over his head, but he knows that attempting to fight with Erin about taking the case is utterly pointless. They may not like each other at times, but the two make a good team. Aaron Eckhart is also good as George, Erin's boyfriend. He's the voice of reason for Erin. However, while he loves Erin, he's not going to be a doormat. There's one performance that has been overlooked, but is nonetheless effective: Scotty Leavenworth is great as Matthew, Erin's son. It is through him that we see the effect that the case has on her family, and Leavenworth perfectly illustrates that. There's no sense of artifice in his performance.""Erin Brockovich"" is filled with bit performances, and all are excellent. Hinckley's inhabitants are extremely sympathetic, and we only want the best for them. PG&E, the evil corporation, is represented by some of the nastiest people ever. They wouldn't bat an eye to the plight of Hinckly's population if they hadn't sued. They thing that the plaintiffs are worthless, and that because they are poor, they don't matter. The viewer's hatred for the greedy corporation is instantaneous. However, the film is all Roberts.2000 was a great year for Steven Sodebergh. He came out with two hit movies (""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"") that took the Oscars by storm. Both earned Best Picture and Best Director nominations (he won for the latter film). His skill as a director is clearly evident (he hasn't done work this good before or since). The cinematography is desert-like: bright and grainy. Hinckley is not a happy place, but the people are nice.Although ""Erin Brockovich"" deals with some heavy material and contains some powerful moments, that should lead one to think that this is a depressing movie. On the contrary, there are many amusing moments, and two scenes that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Sodebergh finds the right balance between drama and comedy (although calling the film a comedy is not necessarily truthful).There are a few flaws, but overall, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a wonderful film.",Erin Brockovich

96,oOoBarracuda,Erin Brockovich,5,17 May 2016,"As much as I try, and as much as I appreciate the movies she's in and the roles she takes on, I am simply not a fan of Julia Roberts'. Steven Soderbergh's 2002 feature Erin Brockovich was another good role for the star Roberts, but just one I couldn't sink my teeth into. Along with Roberts, Albert Finney also stars as the unlikely duo that brings down a multi-million dollar water corporation. The story of a single mother of three who will stop at nothing to provide for her kids and the vulnerable people she encounters is one that has settled into the hearts of audiences years after its release.Single mother, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is unemployed and desperate for a job. When she unsuccessfully pursues an insurance claim in which she was hit, she stumbles upon the notion that she could start working at the legal office that was chosen to represent her. Thankfully for Erin, she encounters Ed Masry, an overworked kind-hearted lawyer that gives Erin a chance to work for his law office. Ostracized from the office for her revealing wardrobe, Erin must learn the ropes of the law office herself, having no legal background or experience. Throughout her research, Erin stumbles upon many inconsistencies in retail deeds and health records. Once she is granted permission from Ed to further investigate the inconsistencies, Erin uncovers that powerful California water company, PG&E have been dumping toxic chemicals into the ground water sources in Hinkley California. When more and more residents are diagnosed with illnesses corresponding with the effects of the chemical being dumped into the water source, Erin brings the issues to Ed's attention and the two voraciously go after the water company, resulting in the largest class-action lawsuits in American history, at the time. Nothing too innovative happens throughout the film, Erin Brockovich, and it doesn't have to, the story is compelling enough to drive the issue for the audience. I wish I could have seen this movie before the water crisis in Flint, Michigan; I think I have been desensitized to the thought that financial gain could encourage a corporation to poison a water supply. Regardless, this film portrays a nice David v. Goliath where we get to see an endearing couple of Davids beat the monster.",Erin Brockovich

100,jhaggardjr,Excellent true-life story,9,22 December 2000,"""Erin Brockovich"" was a surprise to me. It surprised me of how much this movie pulled me into the story right from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the end. But most importantly, it features a powerful, knockout performance by Julia Roberts in the title role. Oscar voters if you are reading this take note immediately: Roberts deserves to be nominated for Best Actress and deserves to win. This is probably the best work she's ever done. Roberts dominates this film by appearing in almost every scene. Erin Brockovich is a tough-as-nails mother of three who goes to work for a law firm run by an attorney (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) who represented her in a case at the beginning of the movie. She eventually stumbles upon a monumental law case against a giant corporation (PG&E). Erin decides to take on this company at any cost. She also gets plenty of help from her boss, and the two begin a memorable fight that ends up bringing a small town to its feet and a huge corporation to its knees. ""Erin Brockovich"" not only has a great performance by Roberts, but an excellent supporting performance by Finney as her boss, who early on hilariously tells his new employee about rethinking her wardrobe (love those outfits she wears). He should get an Oscar nomination too. Oscar nominations should also go to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant for bringing this movie to life and telling a compelling story (Soderbergh will definitely get a Best Director nomination but he'll probably be nominated for his current movie ""Traffic"", which is also generating Oscar talk). There are a couple of moments in ""Erin Brockovich"" that I could have done without, and if the movie had been about 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been a great movie. Nevertheless, it comes close, and Roberts splendid acting here is the driving force behind the success of this movie. If she doesn't take home the Best Actress Oscar come this March and the award ends up going to someone else, I'm going to be very upset. SHE DESERVES IT!!!!! As for the rest of ""Erin Brockovich"", right from its smashing opening to its hilarious conclusion, it's a pretty darn good movie.***1/2 (out of four)",Erin Brockovich
101,AKS-6,Albert Finney is brilliant,6,1 May 2000,"Okay, this film is Julia Roberts. There's no way of getting away from that. It might be a little different from her earlier films, and the role is perhaps a little more serious (a *lot* more serious than e.g. ""Pretty Woman"") than what she usually does, but it is still very much a Julia Roberts vehicle. She has got time to shine in this one. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing, because in this film it is not. Roberts is very charming and actually convincing as Erin Brockovich. The story lacks any depth, but it is still told in a satisfactory way by Steven Soderbergh. It's not his best film, but it's certainly very entertaining if about twenty minutes too long. I have to say, though, as much as I like Julia Roberts in this film, that Albert Finney was truly magnificent as her boss -- truly a great performance. (6/10)",Erin Brockovich

Every single second she is on screen she is electric, with so much energy, power, confidence and magnetism. It really was such a joy to watch and an absolute tour de force. Even if the story were dull it would be worth watching this film for Roberts alone.However the story is far from dull. In a way this is one of those films that doesn't need anything flashy, because the story speaks for itself. It's got such a great mix of feel good moments, drama, comedy, and emotional beats, which combine to make this a very engaging and gripping story. Everything about it fits together perfectly. The dialogue is so well thought out, the direction, the pacing, all of it top notch.Aside from Roberts, there's a great supporting cast, with a brilliant performance from Albert Finney and a solid on screen partnership between Roberts and Aaron Eckhart.I can't really sing this film's praises enough.

She is a struggling single mom of three kids. The story starts out with her getting into an accident and hiring a lawyer. Ultimately she loses her case because of her surly attitude and foul mouth. Unable to find work and flat broke from her accident, Erin begins to pester her lawyer Ed Massery until he agrees to hire her in a minimalistic role in his small firm. When Erin is given a seemingly simple task on a real estate case she stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of industrial poisoning and the ensuing cover-up. As they dig further and further the depth of PG&E's negligence becomes massive.This is a great movie on so many levels. Ms. Roberts shines in this role as never before and the supporting cast is equally as amazing.

Alongside a ""water expert"" who spouted indecipherable gobbledygook for the better part of an hour and a half, Brockovich said, in essence, that it's all up to US to get things Right (the Mayor of wilmington, who owns a construction company, didn't bother to show up at this Public Meeting- perhaps because he'd gotten wind of something that Brockovich revealed to us that night: that there's a pipeline like the infamous North Dakota Access Pipeline about to begin construction HERE, before long). Like we ain't got enough problems, already... Crack Town- wilmington- has been referred to as ""Ground Zero"" for the opioid epidemic in this company (the so-called ""united"" $tate$ of ameriKa), with a reported 13% of wilmingtonians hooked on opioids (my guesstimate is much higher- 40-50%-, based on personal interactions I've had with many of the locals over the past two decades). When I arrived here, the then-governor was in the process of accepting a bribe of half a million dollars from the local Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow them to dump Nuclear Waste into the Cape Fear River. (There was no follow-up investigation, as far as I know.) I've personally seen men openly armed with handguns in grocery stores, gyms, pawn shops and shopping mall parking lots hereabouts and the sight never fails to give me pause. The ""housing"" DE-Construction going on to accommodate the projected 65,000 newcomers to Crack Town over the next 10-15 years is causing even worse flooding than ever (my own used bookstore was flooded nearly 20 years ago). The bottom line: the denizens of Crack Town are up S--t Creek, without a paddle... News of some small comfort: Brockovich also told us that all of the water fountains in Washington have DON'T DRINK THE WATER! THE WATER IS POISON! signs on them. At least we're not alone...",Erin Brockovich
107,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Soderbergh makes something ordinary quite human.,6,28 October 2011,"On paper, there was no reason for me to love this. A film with Julia Roberts in the title role, playing a loud and brass woman who takes on a court case, filled to the brim with standard moments of the underdog being beaten but refusing to give up and ultimately attaining victory. Somehow with everything going against it, the curveball of Steven Soderbergh in the director's chair got me to really appreciate something I was destined to loathe. Soderbergh is constantly challenging himself as a director and someone with his independent upbringing and sleak, digital style taking on such a plain-Jane underdog Oscar-fare story is probably the most diverse move in his career at this point. He brings a genuine humanity to it that doesn't exist in films like this, treating even the smallest throw-away characters the same way that the title character herself treated them, as if they mattered.I've never seen a Julia Roberts performance that I've liked, but in this one she was charming, witty and an all-around joy to watch. I don't think she sold the emotional moments as well as she should have, but any moment with her standing up to the fat cats that she takes on is a real crowd-pleaser. The film shines brightest anytime she shares the screen with Albert Finney, the two of them having a love/hate working chemistry that does nothing but delight. Whether they're butting heads or reveling in each other's company, these two are a real treat to see together. Finney takes a stock character and turns him into someone flawed and genuinely human. Which is what Soderbergh does with this film as a whole, taking something relatively standard and somehow adding an authenticity to it that makes it work.",Erin Brockovich
108,smakawhat,Ok I guess,6,22 April 2000,"Based on a true story, Erin Brokovich is a single young mother who is trying to find a job and raise her 3 kids.  After getting in a car accident and loosing in court, she litteraly FORCES her lawyer (Albert Finney) to hire her at her firm to do some clerical work.  Erin discovers some old case about some former client wanting to get more money for her house that the nearby watertreatment wants to buy.  In probing deeper she discovers, more than meets the eye and that it appears the company was responsible for contaminating groundwater thus poisioning everyone in the community.  So it turns out Erin with no legal experience and working in a VERY small firm, sets out for a courtroom battle david VS goliath story.
Hollywood loves these movies.  It seems this role was perfectly tailored for Roberts.  Finney is good a her boss too.  The movie is somewhat interesting but I didn't feel the need to route for the good guy, or get seriously pumped or motivated by the film.  I didn't find it that humourous either considering that Erin is portrayed as someone with a very short fuse and acid-tongue.  The only scene I got a good laugh out of was when the legal team from the chemical corporation was coming in to the small private firm.  In some quick thinking to show that the small firm wasn't going to be bullyed, they get half of the clerical staff to dress up like lawyers and walk in the meeting room as a combined show of force.  The movie was at least entertaining and OKRating 6 out of 10.",Erin Brockovich

Great to see how a true story character like Erin Brockovich can be made famous by the beautiful Julia Roberts.,10,9 June 2001,"Julia Roberts can I say Julia Roberts again now talk about a performance to remember and Julia I'm sure glad you won a best actress Oscar for this work. Roberts is tremendous and sexy as ever as Erin Brockovich a research assistant who sees how a large company has kept hidden toxic secrets that caused a community increase of cancer and sickness. Julia Roberts is as sexy as ever with this role now the real Erin Brockovich is missing something any guess? Try Julia Roberts with the bust. I always wondered did Julia Roberts wear colored bras, and yes she does in nearly every scene of Brockovich you see many of the bra straps are exposed from the sleazy and short clothing she wears. I remember red, blue, black, black mixed with other colors, now how sexy.

110,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Great, just great. Mrs. Roberts is outstanding.",7,22 June 2008,"Much will be made of Julia Roberts's wardrobe in Erin Brockovich--a brash parade of daring hemlines and Wonderbra confidence. Roberts is unabashedly sexy in the title role of this fact-based comedy-drama, but she and director Steven Soderbergh are far too intelligent to rely solely on high heels and cleavage. Susannah Grant's brassy screenplay fuels this winning combination of star, director, and material, firing on all pistons with maximum efficiency. With Ed Lachman, his noted cinematographer from The Limey, Soderbergh tackles this A-list project with the fervor of an independent, combining a no-frills look with kinetic panache and the same brisk editorial style he used in the justly celebrated Out of Sight. Broke and desperate, the twice-divorced single mom Erin bosses her way into a clerical job with attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who's indebted to Erin after failing to win her traffic-injury case. Erin is soon focused on suspicious connections between a mighty power company, its abuse of toxic chromium, and the poisoned water supply of Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a legacy of death and disease. Matching the dramatic potency of Norma Rae and Silkwood, Erin Brockovich filters cold facts through warm humanity, especially in Erin's rapport with dying victims and her relationship with George (superbly played by Aaron Eckhart), a Harley-riding neighbor who offers more devotion than Erin's ever known. Surely some of these details have been embellished for dramatic effect, but the factual basis of Erin Brockovich adds a boost of satisfaction, proving that greed, neglect, and corporate arrogance are no match against a passionate crusader.

111,macpherr,Julia Roberts is very good about picking her projects.,6,18 September 2000,"This is a very captivating story about a woman who finds her mission in life. ""Erin Brockovich,"" Julia Roberts (Sleeping with the Enemy)  begins to unveil a coverup of high water pollution levels that are affecting the lives of almost an entire community. The people she contacted all had several severe illnesses from cesium in ground water. PG&E had been discharging chromium 6 into water in holding ponds that they knew were leaking. The story has mystery and everybody loves movies where the little guy wins. This is one of those stories like Norma Rae and Silkwood. Julia Roberts is great as she goes around in those crazy ""trampy"" outfits that only a few people like. Attorney  ""Ed Masry""  Albert Finney (The Entertainer, Loophole) has to put up with a lot of curse words (which I really dislike) and a few punches on the verbal abuse side by Erin. But it all ends well, and they since this is based in a true story it makes the movie all more special.

114,Old Joe,A Real woman. A real story. A real triumph!,10,18 November 2000,"What more can I say about Erin Brockovich, it was superb. In real life she is a truly remarkable woman and on-screen, Roberts really made me believe that she was Brockovich in a way.In my opinion, this is Julia Roberts' best role. Roles in such movies as Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride don't match this one. Erin Brockovich brought out the true talent which movie lovers know Roberts has. She acted it perfectly. Being stubborn, hard-working, aggressive emotional and caring, traits I'm sure the real Brockovich has.
The story of this movie concentrates on  Erin Brockovich, who has 3 kids, divorced twice and a $17,000 debt after she loses her court case after a car accident. So Erin  looks and applies for a heaps of jobs, until she goes back to the lawyer who was representing her in court and begs for a job. After she is finally given a go, Erin searches into a small towns health crisis and brings a billion dollar company to its knees. The case that made Brockovich so famous was about  a processing plant called PG+E  which contaminated the water of a small town called Hinkley. The water supply was contaminated with Hexavalent Chromium, which can cause many terrible health problems, including Headaches, Nose Bleeds, cancers (of numerous kinds),  liver, heart and reproductive failure, organ deterioration and in bad cases death. So Brockovich, with no legal experience took on the case for the people of Hinkley and helped them win. In a way it was David taking on Goliath. I also loved the relationship between Erin and her boss Ed Masry. They treated each other with low regard, but in the end respected each other for who they were. Ed was played by Albert Finney and was well done.One part of the film I can understand people not liking is the relationship between Erin and bikie boyfriend George. It was destined  never to work as Erin was focusing more on her work for the case and not him. Maybe he was an unwanted character, but then again I saw George to be a kind man who helped Erin in her greatest time of need. Then we also see that Erin puts her kids needs behind to help others. Erin loved her kids, but her sense of justice meant her family life had to suffer. There are some memorable quotes in Erin Brockovich, here are a few of my favorites:`How bout this for a number. 6, is the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of son, 2 is the number of times I have been divorced and 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.' `That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In f.....g ugly shoes.'`They're called boobs, Ed.'`Seeing as how I have no brains or legal expertise, I just went out there and performed sexual favors. Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs in five days... I'm really quite tired.'`Not personal? That's my work in there. My Sweat, my time away from my kids..... if that's not personal, I don't know what is.'For those who have the facilities to watch DVDs, Erin Brockovich should be at the top of your list, with an impressive amount of special features including a report with Erin Brockovich herself (by the way look out for the real Brockovich in the movie) and half an hour of deleted scenes, which were interesting to see. All in all,  I hated the case and the pain those people had to endure, but I loved the way this true story was bought to the bigscreen. The courage of a single mother who felt so passionately about people who she had no ties with and wanted to see them have a new chance in life is truly inspirational.
Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10.",Erin Brockovich
115,Brogan,Erin the savior.,8,21 March 2000,"Director Steve Soderbergh is now three for three on directing both excellent and critical acclaim films, three years in a row!  First was his very witty and super hip 1998 hit, OUT OF SIGHT with George Clooney, and Jennifer Lopez (before she wanted to sing full-time).  Then last year was the stylish and dark THE LIMEY with Terrance Stamp in a role that was at least Oscar worthy of a nomination.  Now there is his newest film, a film that isn't as stylish or as hip as the previous two, but it's still a darn great movie. Soderbergh's newest film is ERIN BROCKOVICH, which is based on a true story.  The real life story has the title character (Julia Roberts) who is a single mother of three, who is looking for a job.  Erin will lie during her interview or anything, just so she can take care of her children.  Erin then goes to her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who eariler represented her in a car accident case, and begs for a job. Ed decides to give Erin a job and wants her to investigate a pro-bono case on a small California town called Hinkley who filed a lawsuit against the Pacific Gas & Electric company for contaminating the town's water supply and are aware of it.  It's so sad that the town's people are getting tumors, degenerative organs, and other freak symptoms; and the company tells the town citizens that everything is all right and the chemicals that they put in the water are suppose to ""help"" the town. Well, Erin decides to investigate this problem, and becomes friends with many of the residents of Hinkley, including Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) who is suffering from breast cancer, due to the posioning of the water. Meanwhile, Erin stirkes up a romantic relationship with a biker who just moved in next door named George, (Aaron Eckhart).  While Erin is looking for the truth with what is going on in Hinkley, George becomes the caretaker of the children, and isn't quite happy about it.  And also, Erin has problems of her own when Ed Masry hires a couple of high priced attorneys, Kurt Potter (Peter Coyote) and Theresa Dallevale (Veanne Cox) to take over the case of the lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric. Before you begin to shout, ""this sounds like A CIVIL ACTION or SILKWOOK,"" well it isn't.  This is more of a movie that focuses in depth of one woman's crusade to reveal the truth, and go up against powerful attorneys, and a powerful company.  ERIN shows what a hard working mother has to go through to raise a family single handed and try to do well in her job.  In one touching scene, Erin is in tears as her boyfriend tells her over her cell phone that her youngest child started to say her first words. But Erin missed it, since she's devoting her time with her work on Hinkley. I was very impressed with Julia Roberts performance in ERIN BROCKOVICH. She isn't much of that ""cute girl next door"" role that she is known for like in RUNAWAY BRIDE or PRETTY WOMAN.  Instead, she's vulgar, loud, and pushy, but also caring, committed, and heartfelt.  This film proves that Juila Roberts is a actress who is willing to take any role that she is given, and I think she should do more great serious acting roles like this one. People and critcs who also see Roberts wearing short and skin-tight clothes, only see this film skin deep. I was also enjoying the performance of Albert Finney, who I was very glad to see in a major film role.  Finney plays Ed very well, at times a boorish old man, at other times, a man who like Erin can be caring and have a heart.  Finney is also funny at times with his facial reactions to Erin's smart aleck remarks on his legal decisions and his own comments to Erin's comments.  It's hard to believe that this is the same man who played TOM JONES thirty-seven years ago. ERIN is a very well done film, in it's own way.  While SILKWOOD focused on revealing the truth, A CIVIL ACTION focused on the legal sense, ERIN focuses on what it takes to get the truth out in the open.  The pacing of the film is fast paced and entertaining (even for a film that is 131 mins.), the acting is great, and the story is very inspiring.  With such films as this one, and THE INSIDER, one wonders on how these big and powerful companies can get away with this illegal activity without being revealed.  Until then, the truth is out there, and it's on the local cinema.  ****1/2 (out of five)",Erin Brockovich

117,sandnair87,Julia Roberts is Fiercely Dynamic in the Smart and Savvy Erin Brockovich!,9,27 April 2015,"Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich opens with a car accident. The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.It is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.Steven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. Soderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant.",Erin Brockovich

119,Benjamin_Cox,Roberts & Finney superbly lead this true-life drama - 84%,8,7 October 2008,"If you were to ask my Better Half what her favourite type of movie is, she'd probably say ""true-life movies"" but personally, I have a very real problem with movies of this type. Most are made for TV and decidedly crummy, for starters, but seeing as they are also as predictable as your average Nativity play, there is no attraction in watching it in the first place unless endless stories of how odds are overcome are your thing. You'd think, therefore, that ""Erin Brockovich"" is not what I would consider a good movie and you'd be right. But like that other great ""true-life"" movie, ""Alive"", this is one film which has rock-solid performances from the leads and an almost documentary feel to it. But after being paid $20 million for her appearance, I'd expect nothing less from Julia Roberts.Roberts plays our erstwhile heroine who has reached the bottom of the barrel. Struggling with her three kids and no man to help her, she even fails to win suitable compensation after being involved in a car crash. Desperate but determined, she forces herself into the employ of her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but with her foul language and slutty clothes, she can't help but make the wrong impression. But after stumbling across what appears to be an administrative mistake, Erin's curiosity gets the better of her and she soon uncovers a huge hushed-up industrial accident by Pacific Gas & Electric which polluted the water supply of a nearby town to such a degree that it causes a variety of life-threatening conditions in the townsfolk. Enraged, Erin and Ed decide to take on the corporate giants with the help of the townspeople but sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always the easiest thing.There can be few who'd argue that Roberts didn't deserve her Oscar - watching the extras on the DVD, you can see what a great job she did of portraying Ms Brockovich. But the actor who impressed me the most is Finney, giving the sort of performance that has me scratching my head wondering why Hollywood isn't using him more often. He is faultless and together with Roberts, they dominate the picture with the ease of two professionals at the top of their game. By contrast, Aaron Eckhart (who's no amateur either) looks flat and almost uninterested in proceedings as Erin's biker boyfriend George. And however well publicised the story has been, you still can't quite believe that it all actually happened. It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing ""Erin Brockovich"" an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or ""Training Day"" are pretty much as good as you're going to get.",Erin Brockovich
120,llihilloh,(yawn),3,18 April 2001,"What was this?  Nominated for best picture, best screenplay, Julia Roberts won the academy for her portrayal of Brockovich?  I don't think so.  See, this is where the wonderful world of entertainment and myself have a little differ of opinion when it comes to good movies.  THIS was not one of them.I will never understand why celebrities are paid these big bucks just because they can memorize some lines.  You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before. 
I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays. Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.  I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any! Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.  Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?  I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.  Just some last comments:  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack? And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on? The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?  Final words: This movie was given too much credit all because it had the overrated Julia Roberts in the lead/only role.  Critics never know what they're talking about and I should never listen to the academy again.  Don't watch this!",Erin Brockovich

It made me feel a little inadequate that I as an aerospace engineer don't have as much resolve as this women who never even went to college.

I think I liked the Limey better because it was more interesting looking and had Terence Stamp - sorry but Julia is no Terence. 
You really can't go wrong with a script based on a true story - at least not if the story is interesting.  Erin Brockovich is everything A Civil Action wanted to be.The absolutely terrifying thing about this film is at some point I thought just how many times do we have to hear these stories about big companies killing off the little people in the world.  It makes a person scared to trust anyone or anything.Anyway - great story.  Thank God for film makers like Soderbergh who know that story and character is what it is all about.",Erin Brockovich

Everything looks so real, and so it should seeing that it is a true(ish) story, but all the minor roles have great actors too. There are lots of instances where little mannerisms make it real. My guess is that Erin wrote most of the dialogue?Besides the real Brockavich, the real Ed Masry comes on the DVD bonus, and shows how good the casting of Albert Finney, and his acting, are and how much he contributed to the successful outcome of EB's efforts. Ed is so tolerant of Erin's apparent disregard for the norms of a legal practice, it is a bit hard to accept that he is for real! But he must have been. Also on the DVD is Erin (the real one) saying how surreal is the 30-second scene where she is the waitress, and then Julia saying that it is about ""inhabiting the concept, not imitating"". So true, and that is what makes really great actors, ie, JR.The story of corporate carelessness and a small-town lady who found out that the water was contaminated and decided to do something about it in spite of heavy lawyers who do whatever the client says, might give others the incentive to do their own action? 'hope so.Although this is a huge legal battle, there is very little of that shown - good idea, courtroom stuff can be so boring and irrelevant.

I like Julia as an actress and it's not the first time Julia Roberts has marched through like a force of nature in her films. I can't take her for granted as to let you know the movie ""Erin Brokovitch"" has given her some of the best dialog. Julia Roberts really has fire in her eyes as she grabs this eponymous role, injecting the character with great energy and drive she can muster. Her acting performance makes her a true star.

135,Deckard-16,What will next 4 films to get Best Picture nominations next year?,10,17 March 2000,"The first nominees for next year's Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original or Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design categories have already been secured with the arrival of ""Erin Brockovich"". Julia Roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in U.S. history. She would've stole every scene if it wasn't for her co-star Albert Finney who matches her for every point/counterpoint. He plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight. Although her box office says otherwise I've always thought Roberts was way overrated as a movie star. Now I'm a believer. She is smart, sassy, foul-mouthed, fiery, sensitive, funny and, of course, very sexy. It is one of best performances I've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy from ""Bull Durham"" in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal. (Of course Annie Savoy is purely fictional whereas Erin Brockovich is not.) I sense that her character may appeal more to men than women (her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film). The reviews I've read have been excellent, but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well. Finney's work is more nuanced than Roberts' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions. Aaron Eckhardt deserves mention too as Roberts' good guy biker boyfriend. These performances are made possible by a superb script from Susannah Grant. Her fact-based tale of a small (hick) town poisoned by a giant utility has ""Rocky""-like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned. The fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings. Director Steven Soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated ""Out Of Sight"". This is an ""adult"" movie in the very best sense of that term. ""Erin Brockovich"" is definitely a big Hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it. It also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly. It is the first Best Picture nominee for next year.",Erin Brockovich

Playing the part of Erin Brockovich upstages ""Pretty Woman""'s Vivian and ""Steel Magnolias""'s Shelby to the third degree.

Julia's strengths is her ability to play street-wise, honest, and passionate characters.  Erin Brockovich is all those things.The writing is dead on, making Roberts job easier, I am sure. And Roberts delivery of the lines was flawless. SHE WAS ERIN BROCKOVICH. Not that I have ever met the woman...Only in some places did the movie feel a little slow, I think perhaps, because of what the movie was about.

145,paul-nemecek,Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich,10,1 July 2018,"Erin Brockovich is a modern-day David vs. Goliath story with a few notable exceptions. The villainous behemoth in this version is a faceless corporate conglomerate. The hero is a sassy, brassy, less-than-classy female with a prominently featured chassis. In the basic elements of the story line, this is a story we have heard before. The crusader vs. the corporation is a dominant theme in The China Syndrome, A Civil Action, and this year's Oscar nominee The Insider. The version where the ""good guy"" is a female working-class hero is the basic theme of Norma Rae and Silkwood. Like these latter films, Erin Brockovich is based on a real character and a real-life incident.Erin Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother with kids who finagles her way into a job working for the lawyer who lost her case in a civil trial. Erin is feisty, determined, independent, and mouthy. These very traits that get her into trouble with co-workers, friends, and family members are the traits that prove to be her greatest assets as a secretary turned paralegal. What makes the character sympathetic is her caring. She does not always show it well, but beneath the tough exterior is a woman with a heart of gold who cares deeply about her kids and is passionately committed to the families affected by corporate neglect.Julia Roberts is well-suited for the ""brassy broad with a heart-of-gold"" role. Consider her past performances in Pretty Woman (hooker with a heart of gold), Notting Hill (superstar with a heart of gold), and My Best Friend's Wedding (scheming, conniving, two-faced backstabber with a heart of gold). How could she miss?What distinguishes this film from films like Norma Rae or Silkwood however, is the witty script by screenwriter Susannah Grant. Grant was the screenwriter for Pocahantas, Ever After, and 28 Days. What these films have in common is strong-willed independent female characters. Here the synthesis of Brockovich's character, Grant's writing, and Julia Roberts' persona all work together like a charm. The best way to turn an old formula into a good film is through distinctive characters. The characters and their relationships are the real heart of this film.As a result, the film is much lighter in tone than Norma Rae or Silkwood. There are moments of high drama, but the film really shines in its humor and wit. Albert Finney is delightful as Ed Masry, Erin's boss. Julia Roberts turns in what may prove to be the best performance of her career as a working-class mom who refuses to stay down for the count. Director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, The Limey) handles the material well and the pacing of the film is nearly perfect.Corporate neglect will become an increasingly important topic as evidenced by events in Seattle last year. By some estimates, there may be as many as 100,000 deaths per year (four times the homicide rate) as a result of ""corporate crime."" Erin Brockovich manages to raise the issue in a context that is neither preachy nor smug. But in the end this is not an issue film, but a character study, and what a character she is! Both thumbs up for Erin Brockovich.",Erin Brockovich
146,Ysman,Entertaining if not substantial . . .,8,20 March 2000,"It took the talent of Steven Soderbergh to pull off a successful legal drama in Hollywood.  Coppola failed with The Rainmaker and Steven Zaillian failed miserably with A Civil Action.  Erin Brockovich takes a similar plot outline and wins because it doesn't bore the audience with anti-climatic court room scenes.  Erin Brockovich pulls on all the right strings, manipulating the audience at will.  The audience is more than willing to go along for the ride as the cliches are hidden under great direction and inspired acting and the somewhat made for TV plot is given expert treatment from Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich will give Soderbergh the box office respect he deserved from Out of Sight and may land Julia her second Oscar nod.",Erin Brockovich

148,maitreg,Julia Roberts' best movie,7,19 February 2001,"This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good. One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up? Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude.",Erin Brockovich
149,mercury-26,Care until it hurts,9,26 March 2000,"Think about the person in your life who's a thorn in your side, that annoying person who knows exactly where your buttons are and when to push them; that person who, no matter how hard you try to refute their words, you have to admit `you're right' on a regular basis.  This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job: `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!  Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to. She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world. ""Erin Brockovich"" is about the power of giving a damn.  Erin cares so much it hurts.  She knows each face, age, disease, phone number, and address of the people she's fighting for.  The film tells you that this kind of compassion is something that no law school can ever teach.  She's smart, she cares, and she's willing to fight.  That's all she needs.It's good to see that life under the guidance of a big studio hasn't cramped Mr. Soderbergh's style, at least not too much.  Handheld camera is used almost exclusively, which makes you feel like it's really happening, like you're right there watching it.  This is a simple story and he tells it straight, rarely dipping into his usual bag of tricks.  For my money, Mr. Soderbergh is the best, most vital director working in Hollywood right now. I'm glad he was hired to make ""Brockovich,"" but have to admit I'd like to see him return to the less conventional style of his other recent work, ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" two of the best films of the nineties.Grade: B",Erin Brockovich

I know why Julia did this movie -- to shed her ""goody-two-shoes"" image, but the result is less than appealing. I wonder how true-to-life this movie even was, but I'm sure any semblance of truth was ""hollywoodized"" out of existence.First of all, Erin's character has a vulgar, lewd mouth. She is so worried about spewing expletives at everyone, including her employer, I was surprised one of the women she works with did not punch her right in the mouth. Also, she says so many 4-letter words in front of her children -- what kind of mother raises her children with that kind of white-trash potty mouth? It was not impressive and did NOTHING to add to the story. The writers ought to be shot for making every other word she utters obscene and indecent.Because of her bad attitude and her vile mouth, is it any WONDER why nobody takes her seriously?? She thinks she ought to be praised for being arrogant, rude, brash, selfish and self-righteous? Give me a break. No employer is going to put up with that. Further, how is dressing like a scumbag whore going to earn her any respect from people? Where is the sense of reality here? How unrealistic can you get? It is wisdom to learn how to get along with people, but this movie seems to say that if you are vile, bitchy, rude, and obnoxious you will eventually come out on top. How phony and shallow is that? If Julia won an Oscar for this, I have to admit that the Film Academy has stooped to the lowest level they could. I accord the Academy no respect whatsoever.

Inhabitants start to get the most terrible infections, parts of their organs rotting away, cancer, etc....and eventually a painful death.Based on a true story this is simply a perfect movie : it's Hollywood at its best. Everything is 'right on the money' : story, acting, direction, photography,... : there isn't a false note in the whole movie.  They even do not botch up the ending, a rarity in recent Hollywood flicks.Roberts has her best part ever: she is just brilliant as the supersexy loudmouthed and abrasive but with a heart of gold single mother.  Greatly balanced by that old UK pro Albert Finney as the somehow tired looking smalltime lawyer they make up a great team against the bigtime corporate lawyers.Soderbergh direction doesn't miss a beat, as he could go for the full 'get out your handkerchieves' style; EB is directed  in a solid, no-nonsense almost docu-style way, without falling into the trap of constant high melodrama.Even the music was great.What can I say : this is one of those rare pictures that is just 100 % sheer perfection.A straight 10/10 of course.PS : if you would have to put with constant foul-mouthed language by someone who looks like Julia Roberts, would you really mind ?",Erin Brockovich

She is almost desperate ... Persevering in adhering to ideals, daring to challenge powers, and defending the weak, not only defended justice, helped others, but also re-recognized their value.

155,abum190,"Good, but not great",7,1 October 2006,"There's really nothing wrong with this movie. It's well-scripted, well-captured, well-acted (especially by Julia Roberts, but I'm sure I'm not the first to say so), well-staged, and well-decorated. There's a level of realism here not seen in a lot of movies, and I suppose that's something that gives the movie credit. But the truth is there's not much here.Julia Roberts is marvelously natural, and Albert Finney complements her well, though, truth be told, he only has one scene where his acting can really show off. There are touching moments between Brockovich and her kids and between Brockovich and George, her main squeeze during the movie. Marg Helgenberger gives a nice turn as a depressingly disparate victim of the company that Brockovich is attacking. But it all adds up do a genuinely moving but formulaic film that seems to add nothing new to the genre but one more movie.A lot of people seem to lift the movie up because of how brave its main character is and what she stands for. It's a worthy cause, to be sure, but is it cause to label Erin Brockovich as a great movie? I don't think so. It's good, I enjoyed it, but it's nothing special.",Erin Brockovich

Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her performance as Erin Brockovich. The first time I saw Julia Roberts was Flatliners, then I saw her in Hook and I finally saw her in Pretty Woman. Her first film she did was Mystic Pizza. I have never seen it. I think Albert Finney did a good job. I like the cinematography. This is one of Steven Soderberge's best films. I hope Julia Roberts keeps getting better roles. She is one of the best actresses. This movie grew on me. The screenplay uses a lot of numbers. I think Julia Roberts is hot in this movie.",Erin Brockovich
157,dave fitz,Roberts and Finney shine in inspiring true story,8,26 August 2000,"Erin Brockovich, directed by Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape) is an inspiring true story. Julia Roberts stars as Erin Brockovich, a twice divorced mother of 3. She takes a job at a law office and is intrigued by a certain case. Her further investigation finds evidence of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company letting hexavalent chromium, a poisonous substance, into the local water supply in Hinkley, CA. Many residents of the town are getting sick and Julia convinces her boss (Albert Finney) to take on the case. All of their time and money is devoted to helping the people. It is reminiscent of A Civil Action,  starring John Travolta, another true story about big companies poisoning the water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts.
Roberts is wonderful in this role. Her chemistry with Finney, who adores her even though they drive each other crazy, is terrific. Aaron Eckhart is good as George, the biker who lives next door and takes care of Erin's kids while she's out of town working the case. Roberts, not a large-breasted woman, provides a great advertisement for the Wonderbra in her low-cut outfits. Overall, a very entertaining and inspiring film with nothing objectionable, aside from Roberts' frequent use of the F-word.",Erin Brockovich
158,cncgjqbm,Exceptional Film,10,4 August 2021,"This film was exceptional as Julia Roberts carried the film as Erin Brockovich. The storyline shows if you want something bad enough good things happen to those that have the drive and work ethic. Despite, Erin being broke she never gave up and truly made something for herself and kids. She was rude to her boyfriend, George and took advantage of him. Erin did care about the people of Hinckley and those that were sick. Julia was amazing in her role.I actually could see Sandra Bullock playing Erin B instead of Julia Roberts. Sandra is so talented and could have nailed this part.Anyone that is down on their luck needs to see this film. Julia's character never gave up and was truly driven by her work ethic for her kids. It all worked out in the end.Remarkable film!",Erin Brockovich
159,nehpetstephen,Surprisingly Good,7,18 August 2000,"I've never really been a fan of Julia Roberts before, but this movie shined a new light on her for me. Her role as Erin Brockovich, an abrasive, determined researcher for a legal firm, is wonderfully portrayed and it would be a shame if she is not nominated for an Oscar. Everything about her, as a middle-aged, twice-divorced mother of three who fears her life may be slowly going down the drain, is beautifully performed for the screen.An excellent cast and wonderful--if obscenity-laced--screenplay make up for a storyline which is not too entirely original (small lawyer firm vs. big business). A must-see for anyone looking for an entertaining, solid drama. 9/10",Erin Brockovich

161,style-2,Norma Rae in a WonderBra,3,31 January 2005,"Julia Roberts is winsome and not at all cloying in this *Silkwood* meets *Love Canal* meets *Marie* meets *Pretty Woman* extravaganza. In fact, I'd almost admit I'm beginning to like her, now that I've gotten past all the years of oppressive hype. But it's not her fault. She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in  beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial  playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that  for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel. Finney is excellent as her boss, and the handsome Latham is wasted as the boyfriend when the love story just kind of fizzles out. Many say it's the best work Roberts has done. I wouldn't know. But, I'm always a sucker for seeing the little guy win against the behemoth powers-that-be, and even though it's been done over and over again (*A Civil Action* ring any bells? *Norma Rae*?)",Erin Brockovich
162,Sam_Gray,I would never have expected this to be a good movie,9,3 May 2000,"I remember thinking, from the first time I saw the trailer for this movie in theaters, that there would be no way that it could ever be a movie worth watching.  For one thing, I've never been that impressed by Julia Roberts. In addition, the trailer made her look like she'd be playing a stereotype - a one-dimensional talk-to-my-hand-while-you-look-at-my-breasts type of character.  But, most importantly, I was certain that there was no way, under the constant and unalterable laws that hold our universe together, that I would ever be able to sit through a film that associates itself with that accursed ""Everyday is a winding road"" song.I guess I can't always be right.I went to see Erin Brockovich because several people whose opinions I value promised me that it was actually good.  Even then, I was skeptical, but I found this to be an extraordinary film.  Far from being one-dimensional, Erin is an interesting, funny, and intelligent character and one of the best written female characters to appear in a movie in a long time.  And, I must admit, Julia Roberts really sells the performance well.  Depending on what else Hollywood has to offer this year, both Roberts and her movie may be looking at an Oscar nomination.  9/10",Erin Brockovich
163,Rick-34,"Same old triumph over the big, evil corporations",6,29 March 2000,"This movie was ok, but certainly didn't break any new ground. Except, perhaps, in the whole relationship between Erin and her boyfriend, in which he's the one taking care of the kids all the time.I imagine that very quickly this movie will become known only for Julia Roberts' cleavage.  It could be close to being a good movie, but the Erin character is a little too perfect, too cliched in her ""I'm the poor, uneducated woman trying to take care of three kids and fight the evil power company."" A little more subtlety would be in order.",Erin Brockovich

The story is nice = 1 star.  The three leads are strong, if not great (especially Mr. Finney) >another 3 stars.  So what is wrong?  The film ultimately leaves a bad, bad aftertaste.  Even though this is a 'true' story, the way that Erin behaves in the movie is reprehensible ... she treats all of those around her like utter crap and puts words in their mouths (notice that NO ONE in the film says that they think she is stupid, yet notice how she accuses all of them of doing just that).  I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?  Because WE have three kids, couldn't keep a spouse around, and therefore we DESERVE to be able to do all this?  No friggin' way.  Julia, go back to NOTTING HILL.",Erin Brockovich

Not only that, but Julia Roberts was excellent.  I don't think I've ever seen a Roberts movie where she had this commanding a screen presence.  Her physical presence may have helped in that regard but so did her acting. But man, she really looked good in this movie. Oh, and Albert Finney displayed some pretty solid acting skills as well even though he didn't look good. Overall, I'd say that most people who watch this movie will probably find themselves cheering for Erin and will be very satisfied with the film. I was.",Erin Brockovich

This is her story...The people in the small town of Hinkley in California suffered more than their share of serious illnesses, including cancer. Near the town was a plant owned by a Californian utility company. This film traces the link between the running of the plant and the local people who became sick, and is based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts in an award-winning performance) worked as a filing clerk in a small legal firm and she was the one who initially suspected something was wrong. She made many visits to Hinkley and interviewed the people there. And she found out about the toxic chemical Chromium 6, used at the plant as a rust inhibitor, which had leached into the groundwater. The story which unfolds has a mix of investigation, cover-up, and intrigue. And in the end crucial company documents, thought shredded, appear. The company eventually paid a $333 million settlement to the affected people in Hinkley.Part of what made all of this so extraordinary was that Erin was not a lawyer and had very limited legal experience. She was also a single mother with three young children.Another film which is about industrial pollution causing water supply contamination is A Civil Action (1998).",Erin Brockovich
169,mikel weisser,"a definite winner, uplift, social conscience, and knockout acting",10,5 May 2002,"Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich is exactly the uplift picture you've always hoped for. strong acting, moving script, important issues, legitimate procedurals and best of all it is scrupulously faithful to its true story. Struggling outspoken single mom, Erin (the Oscar winning performance by Julie Roberts proving irrevocably that she is more than just tits and teeth), gets on with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney in a justifiably nominated supporting role)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history. it is not a simple magic act either. Erin's got her character flaws (many of which are visited on supportive biker boyfriend George, played by Aaron Eckhart) and the lawsuit is immensely complicated, though Screenwriter Susannah Grant's nominated script keeps it all in focus and understandable. It's the kind of story we can all learn a lot from. Erin works her tail off,  polishes her own too harsh rough edges and ultimately wins a richly deserved reward (just the film itself was so amply rewarded.)It's a story that inspires americans to believe in the system and fight against corporate injustice on their own personal level. It's the kind of thing that shows each and every person can make a big difference. everybody should be proud of soderbergh for realizing what a huge hero Erin Brockovich is and for bringing her struggles and triumphs to the screen.",Erin Brockovich

True story it may be, but it still feels like standard Hollywood formula. Although the formula still seems to work. Roberts and Finney are great, as is the story. It provides a good but not preachy moral: Work hard for what you believe in and you'll get rewarded. Well, in the movies anyway! Bottom line, it's a good movie.

171,fofml,Julia Roberts was incredibly good !!!,10,8 April 2000,"I saw this movie on its' opening weekend and I LOVED it!! This is such a great movie. First of all: JULIA ROBERTS I always thought she is a very talented woman but in this movie she was her best. She topped all of her previous performances. And why is that? Because she FINALLY had the chance to play in a movie that has such a wonderful script that she can show how good she really is.And, oh my God, she is *GOOD* Some people might have been worried if such a big Hollywood star could actually play a single Mom who is divorced twice and has 3 kids and just 16 $ on the bank. Those people were so wrong! She succeeded in this role so much that you not once had the feeling there is a Hollywood star playing the part. The whole time, Julia WAS Erin Brockovich. If this performance won't get her at least an Oscar nomination, there must be something seriously wrong in Hollywood. The rest of the cast was just as great, especially Aaron Eckhart as the biker neighbor and Albert Finney as the boss of the law form. As this movie has a very serious topic, I was expecting a 2.5 hours drama. And yes,this movie was in part very dramatic. But also so funny, I laughed my butt off!! The time seemed so short to me and I consider seeing this movie in the theater again. Another thing I appreciated about this movie very much was that there were no endless courtscenes. This is an intelligent, funny,well-done movie. Julia Roberts was just so amazing. Because of all these facts, I give it 10/10.",Erin Brockovich

The fact that someone without a degree or higher education can pull off a stunt like this, only looks a little incredible, but aren't many films like that?Steven Soderbergh (King of the Hill,Traffic) did a fine job, Albert Finney (Miller's Crossing,Traffic) was excellent, and so was Julia Roberts.

She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement.

181,BuddyBoy1961,Three cheers for Julia!,8,12 July 2000,"After countless fluffy roles in a number of alternately respectable or forgettable pictures, Julia Roberts has finally been given another substantive character to play, and a true-life one to boot; like the woman she portrays, once she sinks her teeth into something she never lets go. Roberts is a natural to play Brockovich, an effervescent though uncouth woman prone to low-cut tops and high-cut skirts in equal proportion. Struggling to raise three children after her second divorce, Erin's relentless job search is interrupted by a debilitating fender bender. Feeling slighted by her not entirely fruitful attorney (Albert Finney), she transforms his guilt into a full-time clerical position at his law firm. Forming the crux of the storyline is her discovery in a series of real estate case files some hundreds of illnesses plaguing the citizens of Hinkley, a small desert community north of Los Angeles. During her subsequent investigation, Erin's innate empathy and kinship for fellow blue-collar families inspires her to uncover a conspiracy by a multi-billion dollar public utility to dispel its liability for the community's failing health. What could have played as yet another weepy disease-of-the-week telefilm is invigorated by Roberts, Susannah Grant's snappy script and the on-target direction by Steven Soderbergh. Rarely bogged down by lulls of requisite exposition, ""Erin Brockovich"" is briskly carried aloft on the shoulders of no-holds-barred Roberts, who gleefully understands her character's motivation and relentlessly pursues her course, even at the risk of increasingly neglecting her children and current beau. Too-long missing from American cinema, this entry in the ""triumph of the little guy"" oeuvre is too irresistible to dislike and too satisfying to dismiss.",Erin Brockovich

Just when I was losing all faith in Hollywood, Julia Roberts pulls out the best performance of her career and brings me back into the mix. I loved this movie.  Go see it. Sit back and enjoy true to life dialog and a great true story. Albert Finney is top notch in his supporting role as well. He fit the role perfectly and his facial expressions make the whole story work.

184,SilkTork,True Stories Are Dull,4,26 September 2004,"""Based on a true story"" is a phrase that almost always guarantees a bad movie. Straight from the off there is going to be a problem. If the scriptwriter strays from the truth people will say ""That's not what happened"" - and also, let's face it, if the script ain't gonna stay with the truth then it ain't a ""True Story"". But if the scriptwriter does stay with the truth then the story is likely to be dull because life is mostly dull. That's why we have fiction. Fiction takes the essence of something vital and important and tells it in a gripping manner that reveals all the issues in a provocative and memorable way.Erin Brockovich is a brash woman - offensive, unpleasant, thoughtless and aggressive. Some people like her. Having the very likable Julia Roberts play her goes some way to softening her. Watching a movie about this unpleasant woman who made herself and her firm a lot of money by suing a power company is not my idea of high art nor pleasant entertainment. She won a big court case - big deal. That doesn't make her interesting. Not does it make her a hero.I didn't like this film.",Erin Brockovich

I liked most of them, some more than others. ""Side effects"", ""Traffic"", ""Oceans's eleven"" and ""Out of sight"" may be the ones I liked the most from them. ""Solaris"", ""Contagion"" and ""Magic Mike"", for example, are normal while ""Lies, sex and videotapes"" is bad in my opinion. Finally, ""Erin Brockovich"" surprised me and I really enjoyed it. It is based on real events. It is biographic. The story is about a young mother who begins to work as a legal assistant. I did not know anything about the real character, but Julia Roberts portrays the best performance in her career, or at least, one of the best ones. Aaron Eckhart plays the part of his new boyfriend (very correct, as well). The other secondary actors did a more than decent job. Performances are clearly a strong point in this movie. The pace is adequate, as well, taking into account it is a realistic biographic courtroom drama. The lentgh is the proper one, so we can say the director has done a very good job. There are also some good dialogues and funny situations because, although the movie is a drama, it contains some humour. The movie is not excellent, but it is very correct in every aspect. The story is moving and contains some social criticism which is so visible and great (I like movies to have messages like this).

This movie is better the second time you watch it because it does'nt drag and is fun from start to finish. Didn't care too much for George. Kind of hard to believe a biker would be such a great family man and would want to be a baby sitter. Don't think he would have volunteered if the lady would have not been a beauty queen. It's always fun to watch an intelligent women lead a man around by the the nose. Seen it many times and enjoy it every time. Fun to see David beat Goliath. It was also fun at the end to see Ed finally shut Erin's mouth. It was really neat to see the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry in the diner scene. As for Julia Roberts being a great actress, in the scene where Pete Jensen is throwing rocks at P G&E in the middle of the night we then focus on Erin in the house with Donna. Donna sobbing asks Erin to go get them. Erin is looking at Donna and couldn't say a word lest she would start weeping.

In it she plays the title character, a single mother who goes to work at a law firm and ends up finding evidence that a big gas company polluted a small town's drinking water.  To tell you the truth I was expecting a bit more from this movie, considering it's large box office intake and the popularity of it's star.  This is by no means to say that Erin Brockovich is a bad movie, in fact it's a pretty good one, but I'm still not sure it was worthy of all the acclaim it got.  My main problem  was there were no moments that were really defining or dramatic and although at the end the evil corporation has to fork out almost $400 million (the largest ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit), that would mean nothing to a $28 billion company.  There's not much courtroom drama, in fact there's hardly any, director Steven Sodenberg chose to focus on Robert's character and the people she affected.  The one thing that really impressed me about this movie was Julia Robert's performance.  We are so used to seeing her play the same innocent characters in all of her films, that it started to seem like that was all she could do. With this role she proves she actually can act, and does it quite well. She is thourally convincing as Brockovich and is the main reason this movie works (she's also the reason why it made so much).

Erin Brockovich was out of the five movies nominated, the best picture period!  It had all of the intangibles needed for a quality picture; Good lead acting, good story, good supporting actors, and finally a quality Director.  This movie was about the ""Little guy"" or ""girl"" in this case taking down the big fish.

There hasn't been this much cleavage since ""Show Girls"" and there's anti-freeze running through your veins if she doesn't completely win you over.Erin Brockovich is in the same category as ""Silkwood""  though not as heavy. Julia Roberts is no Meryl Streep, but hey, she's very good, quite funny, and smartass one-liners are her forte.This is a Danny DeVito, Jersey Films production, Steven Soderburg director = GREAT JOB!!, Albert Finney = Fantastically subtle, perfect, Aaron Eckhart = SUPER as the hunky, biker boyfriend, Cherry Jones = intense, Peter Coyote = great, Erin Brockovich = look for her in a cameo as the blonde waitress in the first 5 mins of the movie",Erin Brockovich
191,billy-7,Total entertainment,10,22 March 2000,"Julia Roberts's best film to date also features her finest performance, as well as great supporting work by Albert Finney, Marg Helgenberger, and Aaron Eckhardt, and a stalwart cast from top to bottom.  Steven Soderbergh does a fantastic job of providing an audience-delighting comedy-drama that makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you whoop and holler. It's closer in spirit to ""All the President's Men"" than to the movie it's bound to be compared with, ""Silkwood.""  This one isn't in ""President""'s rarefied league, but it puts ""Silkwood"" in the shade, and Julia trumps Meryl handily by being not only fully up to the emotional demands of the part, but by being hilariously funny as well--and physically a dream.  Finney hasn't been this good in years, and Eckhardt displays the kind of charismatic charm one couldn't have guessed he had from ""In the Company of Men.""  This is a genuine winner and an instant super-classic!",Erin Brockovich
192,Karok-2,Julia shows the world that she is an actress besides just a movie star,8,21 April 2000,"Today I've seen this movie. Is sure going to be one of the bests ones in the 2000. Maybe is not going to be worth to get the title of the best! But sure nobody will be able to say that this movie is not funny and very interesting in some kind a way.Well, maybe the plot is kind a easy, but that helps to understand the movie. Well, maybe is not so exciting, but is just the way life it is. Is an extraordinary history about a real strong woman. Julia Roberts should really get nominated for this role! I know is soon to say something like that, and of course the movies that show up to the world that soon are just forgotten for the Oscars! But I give my vote for Julia Roberts to be the first star of the 2000 movies to get that award! She just has shown the world that she is not just a movie star! SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS!!!Albert Finney and all the actors do a real good job in it. And even that I think is a little too long. IS A MOVIE THAT SURE SHOULD BE SEEN!",Erin Brockovich
193,nashvillephotosoul,Julia Roberts best performance to date,10,16 August 2000,"""Erin Brockovich""is one of the smartest movies I have seen in a long time.In the tradition of ""A Civil Action,""Erin Brockovich"" delves into the case of a town inflicted with various diseases due to toxons coming from a PG & E plant.Julia Roberts plays the title role who snares the case after getting hired as a file clerk to an attorney, Ed, played by Albert Finney. Rounding out the cast is Aaron Eckhart, who portrays George, Erin's supportive boyfriend.""Erin Brockovich"" embodies what directors should look for in making a good movie because this is one smart movie. ""Erin Brockovich"" has solidified Julia Roberts as a true star because her performance as Erin is one that only Julia could pull off. Julia brings her feisty attitude to a role that brought spunk to the character.""Erin Brockovich"" matched the feistiness and fiery attitude of Julia Roberts with the brilliant dialogue, direction of Steven Soderbergh, plot and casting to make a superb film.""Erin Brockovich"" is plain and simple a feel good movie that just touched me in ways that I cant even describe.

194,groatski,An inspirational story for foul-mouthed white trash everywhere.,3,27 October 2005,"The message: Curse like a sailor, dress like a slut, verbally abuse your co-workers, demand respect and show none, viciously attack anyone who dares criticize, and expect special treatment because, somehow, you can claim victimhood for having 3 kids and not much else. In general, act like everyone owes you and you will live wealthily ever after (oh, being a former beauty queen helps also).What utter nonsense. Erin Brockovich belongs on Jerry Springer, not the silver screen. And as far as Julia Robert's acting goes, if her goal was to make me want to reach thru the screen and give her a hefty smack, she succeeded brilliantly.I want to say that the story of this movie is unrealistic, but maybe it isn't? If a person can really succeed with her tactics and credentials then our culture has serious problems.",Erin Brockovich
195,PizzicatoFishCrouch,A Triumphant Story of Redemption.,9,13 March 2006,"Based on the true story of a woman who overcame all adversity and single-handedly dragged down a power company, Erin Brockovich tells the story a single mother (played by Julia Roberts), rejected from yet another job, but after an unfortunate car crash, she manages to argue her way into a job at Albert Finney's law firm. She soon discovers murky goings-on regarding a small town's water supply, causing disease and death. Most people would sit back and leave it, but Erin doesn't, instead, she dedicates the next few years of her life to righting the wrongs.Many have found Roberts' performance grating, but I personally thought she was excellent in the lead, embodying all the key qualities of the character, both good and bad; she is caring and determined, yet impatient and foul-mouthed. Unlike many of the female leads presented in films today, what is so appealing to me about her performance is just how human it is. Her role is one very far removed for her usually romcomy turns, and all for the better. In the support, Albert Finney is amusing in a bumbling yet togethered role, and the two make a fitting pair. Donna Jensen, Aaron Eckhart and Cherry Jones also give notable performances.Their work is made much easier with Steven Soderburgh's capable yet efficient direction, and some nimble dialogue, supplied by Susannah Grant. Even if we do have a good idea about which direction the movie will head, the cast and crew work deftly to make us experience the movie as well as enjoy it, so that the redemption, when it comes, means even more. The modern-day atmosphere is also captured well, in background design, as well as a catchy electro-funk soundtrack from Thomas Newman.Fuelled mainly by its excellent performances, Erin Brockovich is a strange combination of genres. It is a biography of a woman that nobody had heard of. It is a drama as far as the seriousness of topic. And it is also a comedy, in how it so effortlessly captures the essence of a determined, brave, and kind-hearted woman. But essentially, Erin Brockovich is a feel-good David and Goliath story, of how the weak defeated the strong. It has its flaws (a slow middle act, some sketchy characters, as well as the question of how true to the facts it plays), but generally, it handles its subject matter with appropriate integrity, yet making it accessible to cinema-goers. Uplifting, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable, Erin Brockovich is not to be missed.",Erin Brockovich
196,Bede,"Unoriginal, uninteresting",2,21 November 2001,"For some reason, we are asked to be impressed by the fact that 'Erin' was based on a true story.  I wasn't.  Nothing about the Roberts character was the slightest bit engaging, the great Albert Finney was wasted, the story was totally predictable, and Travolta's 'Class Action' did the same story better.  Basically, I didn't care one way or the other whether the goodies won or lost the case, or whether Erin would or wouldn't find true love with the bikie.  Everybody in the film, including the principals, was a caricature.  I saw it through to the end only because I thought my wife was interested. She wasn't.",Erin Brockovich
197,jacob.rosen,Soderberg's American Pastoral,10,23 October 2000,"Steven Soderberg's extremely satisfying film about an unlikely crusader pitted against a mammoth corporation that has lied to its neighbors about their well-being may seem like a Julia Roberts showcase but Soderberg manages to use Roberts as one of many colors in his pastoral of an America where justice can be served. Not that Roberts is ignored or wasted: unlike 1999's manipulative ""Notting Hill"" she is forced to shed her star quotient in order to let her beauty serve the film's main character. As a put-upon former beauty queen desperate to find meaning in her life while trying to impart social values on her children, Roberts' feisty, no-nonsense determination becomes such an admirable quality that it actually makes her more beautiful than she's ever seemed; the film's last shot frames her in such a devastating way that you can't help but be swept away by such a complete characterization. Susannah Grant's sarcastic but perceptive screenplay gives Roberts the lines needed to make her be absolutely inspiring. Ace cinematographer Ed Lachman beautifully evokes an arid California that comes alive with color as events begin to happen. Soderberg's companion piece ""The Limey"" may be more succinct and filled with more depth but this masterpiece is just as thrilling and even more moving.",Erin Brockovich

199,mjanky,"Plenty of eye candy, but not enough meat.",6,13 June 2000,"I went to see this movie because of all the buzz about Julia Robert's Oscar worthy performance. After it was over, I believe Albert Finney was better. Not that Julia's bad, but we've seen this character before, Sally Field in Norma Rae and Meryl Streep in Silkwood, come to mind. The only difference is the southern accent that Julia Roberts smartly declined to use. Even the plots are similar; White trash woman, ignores her kids and her man because of her cause against the big mean Corporation. I do think that Julia is by far the most attractive of the bunch however. Out of the 50+ costume changes she makes in this movie (with only $74 in the bank I might add) all but two of them have her breasts popping out at all angles. I think the makers of the film made a conscious decision to have Julia parade around in sexy outfits to keep our mind off of the boring plot-line. There was never a doubt in my mind how the movie would turn out, and the fact that it was based on a true story didn't make any difference from the re-treads coming out of Hollywood for a while now (look for the real Erin Brokovich doing a cameo as a waitress in a restaurant. She's no Julia!). Erin Brokovich's cause was to bring suit against a power company for contaminating a community with chemicals it uses in its plant. The problem is the movie attempts to show you almost every victim of the contamination until the audience gets jaded and numb and it loses its impact. The movie would have been better if it had focused on one family or victim, like the child who is suffering from cancer. I wanted to feel for the victims, but it's hard to give emotion to 600+ people in a two hour movie. The sub-plots were weak as well, although the character of George, the Harley riding, lover/baby-sitter/maid was refreshing. I gave this movie a rating of 6 because of the performances and in spite of the story. I think by year's end there will be performances by actresses more deserving of the Oscar than Julia, but she should get a special award for most frequent use of the ""F-Word"" by an actress.",Erin Brockovich

And that's what counts for awards.  As a rule.  This bit of work holds its own with brother Eric in ""Star 80.""  Albert Finney has been better (best guilty pleasure performance? ""Wolfen."").  And I must give credit to Aaron Eckhart (unrecognizable from ""In the Company of Men"") as the house-biker who takes care of Erin's kids while she saves Hinkley, CA (standing in for The World).  Oh, and, of course, nod to ""C.S.I."" to Marg Helgenberger who was quite good.  Soderbergh has just been nominated for two DGA best directing noms for this film and ""Traffic.""  Overkill.  Nominate him for ""Traffic"" and take another look at Hanson's ""Wonder Boys"" or Kaufman's ""Quills"".

Not many actors could do as well as Julia. This film is shot with perfection and passion from STEVEN SODERBERG who is one of the best directors ever. eg: TRAFFIC, OCEANS ELEVEN and many more. The story is about a woman who is going through a real tough time in her life, and she just happens to get a job as a Lawyers assistant.

202,willow-46,Very Pretty!,10,5 May 2000,"With that cleavage, Erin Brockovich is still more of a a girls' movie. Julia Roberts is the sassy, foul-mouthed mother of three, who can tell that her her daughter havn't gone to bed without even looking. This is one role that really proves she can be more than a ""film star"" and makes people think she IS an actress-a very good one, indeed..The story itself is really great and it's real, so that just makes it even more convincing!Congratulations also to the co-stars, who did such a wonderful work and really supports Julia's role. It has lots of humour, but isn't shallow at all-this maybe what I call a 'serious comedy'.Erin Brockovich is moving, funny, smart and sassy.I'd give it 9.5/10 (the half taken off for excess bad language). If you feel you are in need of some Girl Power, buy a ticket and see this movie.Just don't be too excited to swear all the way home~~",Erin Brockovich

Simpley because many claim that this movie is not a brilliant tag line nor interesting, thats because it's true life Drama and i think the contrast of this is very wise. Julia Roberts SKYROCKETS her performance and EMBRACES the attitude, force, power, cleavage and a kiss ass hard gal who cares about other people so much, she presents a SHINING WOMAN.Julia plays a broke, mother of three, jobless woman who changes her life in the most unlikely circumstances. It starts out as Erin Brockovich (Roberts), having a car accident and hires a lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), she loses the case, Brockovich turns up at his office and demands a job he has no choice but to hire her.She now is working for Masry and is pending against PG&E, a gas and electric corporation who is polluting a small town. These illnesses which are threatening this town are very serious they include, Breat cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma and nosebleeds and in some cases, even LIFE Threatening. She spends a lot of time reading and taking careful time going through this, Brockovich knows every illness and every clients number life illness and information, Erin does not mess around neither bides time she gets to the immediate point, says it out load, blunt, bold and clear, this is one reason why i love this movie so much it's so CLEVER.There are so many reasons why i love this movie, but the second reason is because any movie which has 'Thomas Newman' music performed in any movie is brilliant his music is so OBSCURE and DIFFERENT Thomas Newman has performed music for many other famous movie's which include 'Pay It Forward, The Green Mile and the modern master film 'American Beauty' with Kevin Spacey, his music was completely suitable for this work of art per say. Thomas's music is also and is most suited for Drama's because i think the contrast of the music is dramatic for dramatic movie's, maybe through Thomas's music it may make these films more outstanding think about it, all of these films are well known and they all have Thomas's music in them.When i first seen Erin Brockovich it starts out as, i was watching a documentary of Julia Roberts and it had shown clips of Erin Brockovich and it appealed to me my mum called me up and i said 'I think i will rent Erin Brockovich' and said to me 'I don't think it will be your scene' i rented it out anyway and i watched it and WOW! It was BRILLIANT i watched it over and over again every weekend i rented it out for about five weekends until i bought it and still today it is a favourite movie, and i still watch to this day. I watch Erin Brockovich in 2005, 5 years after it was made and i was surprised i hadn't seen it.I think if you want to consider watching this film, which i think you should read this and see what you think, but in my opinion you may or may not get hooked on it. You either LOVE IT OR HATE IT. Just rent it and see what you think, but i would give this movie a 10/10 rating a true life drama which is hard, touching and inspiring.",Erin Brockovich

Last year I saw Runaway Bride and Notting Hill and they were BAD, mostly because of her and after seeing Erin Brockovich I still mean that she is Hollywood's most overrated actresses around. But, it's not all wrong with this picture. At the end it gave me a good feeling, but it still looked a lot like A Civil Action. Albert Finney plays his best role so far (while he never does anything bad). A simple twist of his mouth and the whole cinema start laughing, with Julia, that never happens. Now who is the best actor of them two?Besides Julia the movie has a lot to make it worth watching. It has drama, comedy, thriller, enough to make everybody pleased.

215,rstarzecmoviecritic,Julia Roberts At Her Best,9,28 July 2019,"AFI 100 Cheers. AFI 100 Heroes/Villains.""Erin Brockovich"" is a pleasant movie and one of the best projects from director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh is a talented filmmaker who is able to direct movies from a wide range of genres. There are the ""Ocean's"" movies of course, which have a glamorous style of their own in terms of editing and prove to be fun and easy to watch. There are also strange, morbid and overly dark films such as ""Unsane"" which has a strange gimmick of being shot entirely on iPhone cameras. But somewhere in the middle, there is ""Brockovich,"" a movie from the start of the millennium starring a talented cast including Aaron Eckhart, Albert Finney, and, who can forget in her Oscar-winning role, Julia Roberts.This is such a solid character-driven movie, and almost every scene is fun to watch thanks to Julia Roberts. Act one is really interesting because you would not think to connect a traffic collision to the idea of a character getting a job, but that is exactly what happens. The titular character, Erin, is shown in a job interview at the start of the movie, and she has the right personality for the interview but lacks the experience. We feel for her as we learn she has three kids, she has been divorced twice, and she is basically broke. Once she gets in a traffic collision, she has trouble contacting the lawyer assigned to her case, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), so she figures if the people at the law firm cannot do their job, she will show up and do it for them. And we see that bold persistence in Erin throughout the duration of the film.Erin is the type of human we should all aspire to be because her persistence and loyalty allows her to have a better work ethic even than her superiors. She does investigating on her own when she is given permission (barely) by Ed Masry, but this involves her doing her work away from the firm for a period of time, and she gets fired since everybody assumes she just left the job to ""have fun."" After all, most of the women working at that law firm have expressed their disliking of her due to the way that Erin dresses. But that is the thing about Erin - she could care less that she dresses in a revealing manner. It even helps her get information on the case she is working on. Masry asks Erin how she was able to obtain so much information that would help their case. Her response? ""They're called boobs, Ed.""In terms of filmmaking, ""Erin Brockovich"" is nothing that is going to be remembered for its visuals or editing. It plays out like a typical movie - there are no iconic shots, there is no spectacular editing style, and the strongest aspects of the film are clearly its story and the performance by Julia Roberts. It is such a joy to watch Roberts in this performance and it definitely makes the movie feel more like a comedy than a serious drama. Audiences can probably look at it either way though since it is, above all, an inspiring flick.Julia Roberts has never been better and she completely sells the movie.9/10",Erin Brockovich
216,dredyoung,Erin the Heroine,10,9 August 2005,"Erin Brockovich [2000] with Julia Roberts in one of her most stellar roles.Erin the HeroineErin shows two main things: a. the persistence of a way of being in the world; b. how surface characteristics quickly change as the structure of the person's external world changes. Erin grew up as a small town beauty queen feeling like she was 'somebody', confident, spontaneous, in command, and had a birthright to win in games of one-up-man-ship. After two failed marriages, she realizes the cultural stereotype of marriage is stacked against women. She won't have any more of it. Now, after repeatedly being devastated by the ravages of a male dominant society, alone and penniless with children to support, she is up against that wall of bias against women again. In the middle of her current gloomy circumstances, she decides that this time she is going to go at it like a she-bear with cubs. Like competitive men who take a no holds barred approach to life, her inner resolve is saying, ""Everybody better look out, here comes the old, bold, Erin"". She finally scraps her way into a penny ante, food on the table, job. In her new, menial job in a small law firm, her implicit, strong, trust in her fortitude, intelligence, and judgment causes her mind to pause during the perusal of some legal gibberish. She notes an odd and incongruous conjunction in the information. With her revived naturally spontaneous and assertive self, she seeks validation of her suspicions of a cover-up conspiracy by visiting the actual defendants sited in the report. However, she finds the victims hostile to outsiders and oddly beholden and loyal to their corporate patrons. Rallying another side to her earlier resourcefulness and maturity she confronts the diffident victims with compassion, empathy, and humble eye-to-eye persuasiveness. This opens all the doors to the hearts of these fearful employees in this closed, ravaged, and emotionally depleted corporately sustained community. Her approach turns out to be a knockout combination of punches and she gains their confidence in her.Soon, her own life circumstances begin changing. As a male admirer enters her life, she holds him at bay while she thoroughly tests him. She hesitates because she does not want a repeat performance of her former relationships with men. When he proves to be genuinely supportive and kind, she finally, but gingerly, allows him into her life. He is truly helpful and patient, especially with her children. She feels the gods must be promoting a happy serendipity since this is just what she needs to give her the backup necessary for her to unleash her enormous but dormant combination of talents. As she succeeds with what has become a huge lawsuit over lethal damage caused by the pollution the corporation had been successfully covering up, the head of the small law firm calls in big legal guns to take over the case. In a conflict of her two most dominant traits, not to be bested by anyone and a level-headed maturity, the latter wins out. In a verbal contest with one of the legal experts brought to help insure their victory, she clearly demonstrates that she is not a woman to be discounted, regardless of the fact that the experts' credentials outclass her. She concedes that the experts should be allowed their role in the case, but she is remains the incumbent. Like a bull dog with its teeth sunk in a bone she will not relinquish her hold on 'her' case to the 'interlopers'. She proves to be as formidable as a gladiator when it comes to being a mental and verbal combatant, whether she is an expert in legalese or not. Erin's force-of-nature demeanor crashes through the legal establishment's protocol and causes enough dislodging of their composure to interrupt the judicial monotony. Her unconventional, countervailing mode-of-procedure forces the court to weigh the case on its inherent merit and overrides usual imbalance of powers favoring top-dollar law firms and rich corporations that typically holds-court! The injection of Erin the she-bear into the intransigent legal culture became the catalyst that cracked the defense and won the day for all of the exploited underdogs she so heartily and gallantly championed and for Erin, herself, as well. The citizens she victoriously fought for feel their esteem rise along with their 'Erin the hero'. Women of the world, take heart. When a fortuitous crack opens in the masculine wall within structure of the world, be ready with your marching boots to charge through it!",Erin Brockovich
217,kejava,"I enjoyed it, but didn't love it.",7,29 April 2000,"Julia Roberts' odd turn in a serious (rather than a romantic or comedic) role usually turns out pretty well.  Her character is mostly believable in this drama about a down-and-out woman who bullies her way into a job with a small personal-injury law firm and then tackles a major case against Pacific Gas & Electric.  PG&E have been polluting a small town in the California desert for years, and it's time to pay.  More enjoyable even than Roberts' performance is that of Albert Finney as the head of the law firm.

When in fact, only about the first half hour of it is worth seeing.  Julia Roberts delivers a fine performance at the beginning and then proceeds to become more insufferable and self-righteous as the movie progresses. How many times can the camera cut to a close up of her listening raptly and reacting almost tearfully every time someone else shows up with cancer? It's repetitive, boring and needless and it makes you hate her guts instead of liking her. Aaron Eckhart, the darling, is stuck once more in a thankless role but we should be grateful to Mr. Soderbergh for casting him. A good actor and adorable to the bone.  Everything else is totally fake in this film.  And the critics who must be tired of seeing so much s**t, think this is better than average Hollywood crap. It isn't.  The Limey was much better than average Hollywood crap.  Erin Brockovich is Hollywood dreck.",Erin Brockovich

To me, Julia's portrayal of Erin was basically the same character she used in Pretty Woman and another rags to riches story that I am really tired of from MS Roberts. I have a friend who knows Erin Brockovich and Julia did not do her much justice and over played her character in some ways. She did  not do everything herself as the movie would have you believe. What is the major difference from this movie and the John Travolta movie A Civil Action? Frankly, his character was a whole lot more enjoyable.",Erin Brockovich

I found myself laughing along with this extremely funny comedy. This was one of the fews movies that had that affect on me to the point where at the end of the two hours I glanced at my watched and was like ""wow! two hours already??""

224,bahai62,Julia Roberts is so bright as Erin Brockovich,10,15 April 2000,"To tell the truth, I'm a number one fan of Julia Roberts, and I went to see this movie just because it was one of Julia Roberts' best movies. But when I came out of the theater, I thought this movie was one of the best in the past of Julia Roberts. She's excellent, attractive(especially with her show of legs and breasts) and very charming. I liked the movie so much that I would give 12 or 13 out of ten if I could. There is not much romance in the movie like Notting Hill or Pretty Woman, but the plot, the mother role which Julia played to a perfection makes this movie impressive for me though I'm a fan of romance movies. In any case, I strongly advise this movie to those who have not watched yet. I think the people who are not fans of Julia will be her fans after this movie.",Erin Brockovich
225,waynepenner,Utter maudlin tripe,1,22 April 2001,"This is an absolutely dreadful film that will appeal only to those who think on the surface, or possibly think not at all, which of course includes the majority of the American population.   Horribly miscast, the script is infantile, the character interactions are puerile.  The love scenes will make you want to look away, something I never thought I'd say about Julia Roberts in underwear.  If you have any poetry in your soul at all you will understand what I mean. Finney's fake yankee accent doesn't help either, either.   
  As for the substance of the film ... If you are an idiot or have a double-digit IQ no doubt you will believe the sensitive biker love-interest character who likes children. If you are an idiot you will believe the sensitive lawyer who is just looking for a way out of his guilt ... If you are an idiot you will probably like this film.

Erin Brockovich is one of those few movies that has something for everybody. It has humor, drama, suspense, politics, it has it all.  That what makes this a great film. This one will be a classic in about fifteen years, deservedly so.",Erin Brockovich
227,so_original,Entertaining Vehicle for Julia Roberts.,8,19 May 2008,"Julia Roberts is the star in this based-on-a-true story film, ""Erin Brockovich"". It's a classic ""David and Goliath"" tale, that pits one woman against a huge corporation. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three, with little money and plenty of attitude. As she takes a job as a secretary in a law firm, headed by former lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she discovers the horrors taking place in the small town of Hinkley. The water has been contaminated, and has altered the lives of these working class people. Brockovich makes it her mission to take down PG&E (the corporation responsible for the contamination) and she and Masry, with the 637 Hinkley residents, go toe to toe with the corporate giant in court.Clearly, this is a vehicle for Julia Roberts, first and foremost. The character of Brockovich, the journey she goes on and the growth she experiences from helping people and making a difference is the main focus of the film. However, Roberts truly proves her acting skills and that she's more than a box office draw and a megawatt smile. Julia is known for taking on the ""girl next door""-esquire roles. Even her breakthrough role as a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman"" was written as the nicest prostitute you'll ever meet. But, Erin Brockovich is a grittier character. She swears and struts her way through the scenery, chewing out those who challenge her and shocking more conservative types with her revealing wardrobe. Although she often comes off tough and provocative, it is also made clear that Erin has a warm heart. Her determination and defiance comes from an honest desire to help make her life and her kids' lives better. She also makes an emotional connection with the plaintiffs, seeing them less as clients and more as an extended family. The way Julia creates a nice balance between Erin's strong and soft side and makes her a complex character truly proves her talent. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved, in my opinion.Of course, there are other well played characters in this film as well. Albert Finney makes the contrast between his Ed Masry character and Erin Brockovich clear. He's conservative, she's over the top. He plays it safe, she makes her own rules. He thinks in a more business-like lawyer fashion, while she distrusts lawyers and tends to think with her heart (which helps her relate to the plaintiffs). As Erin's foil, it is clear that these two can learn from each other and as the film progresses they do. Aaron Eckhart is Erin's boyfriend George, who begins to feel inadequate when constantly playing Mr. Mom to Erin's kids, and Marg Helgenberger as one of the standout Hinkley plaintiffs. It is Erin's show, but the supporting characters help her to figure out more about herself and the world around her.All in all, the film is a pretty standard genre. Even the director, Steven Soderbergh, shoots in a straightforward (but visually rich) fashion. Nothing too suspenseful, as we all know what's going to happen in the end (or else the movie wouldn't be made). But, the story is entertaining and the acting is excellent. And when you get down to it, that's all most movies need.",Erin Brockovich
228,Mufasa-3,Funny and entertaining,10,15 April 2000,"This one is worth a watch, it is a very funny movie with a very serious side as well. Environmental cover-ups occur far too much and this story helps to bring an important issue into the light. Acting was top notch! 10/10",Erin Brockovich
229,moviefan-50,Decent acting and story but hardly deserving of the Oscar,10,13 April 2001,"I thought the acting was fairly decent by Julia Roberts and her costar Albert Finney, but I do feel that the Oscar was undeserved. It seemed like this year's Oscars were more of a popularity contest than accolades for true accomplishment. Ellen Burstyn was no doubt robbed of her Best Leading Actress Oscar for Requiem for a Dream. The other 2 actresses who I felt won premature, undeserved Oscars were Gwyneth Paltrow in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love and Helen Hunt in 1997 for As Good as It Gets. Don't get me wrong: all decent performances but all in all pretty ordinary. Who was most deserving of the Best Actress Academy Award in the past decade? Without a doubt, Jessica Lange for 1994's Blue Sky, followed closely by Susan Sarandon in 1995 for Dead Man Walking and Kathy Bates in 1990 for Misery. Don't want to get off the subject, but might as well point out how I felt about Best Actor. Russell Crowe---Best Actor? I thought I'd puke. Kevin Spacey, Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, and Anthony Hopkins---all undeserving. Most deserving??? That would be the brilliant Nicolas Cage for 1995's Leaving Las Vegas, followed closely by Al Pacino for 1992's Scent of a Woman, Roberto Benigni for 1998's Life is Beautiful [which I feel sour that it didn't win Best Picture], and Geoffrey Rush for 1996's Shine.",Erin Brockovich
230,draftyrafters,goes down easy,5,9 April 2000,"Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies.  Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.And I don't mean that literally.Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments.  But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way.  If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots.  But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore.  Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.Don't get me wrong.  It's entertaining.  But it's formulaic.  A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot.  The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm.  Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car.  This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man.  Hip hip hooray!I didn't ruin the movie for you.  It's not a surprise.  This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on.  Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality.  Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre. 
With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib.

231,DandE,The truth will set you free!,9,13 March 2000,"The 4 of us loved this movie and give it ""8 thumbs up!!""  We were still talking about it the following day.  It's a very uplifting movie, despite the tragedies (there are triumphs as well!) in the film.  There was a lot of humorous moments and the whole theater was laughing throughout the film.I personally like Julia Roberts and I would probably go see her in anything. This movie is probably going to be one of my favorites.  My husband and I are very justice issues-oriented people.  We like to see the little man win. I grew up in the Sacramento Valley where PG&E serviced us as our electric company, and I was horrified to learn that they would do such a thing to a small community.  We could have been one of the families hurt by this company's negligence!  I had taped the Oprah Winfrey segment that featured Julia Roberts, the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry.  My husband and I watched it when we got home from the movie.  Erin and Ed Masry both said the movie was pretty true to the real story.  I like how quirky life is, and how destiny works -- Erin, a single mom with 3 small children to raise, finds herself victim of a car accident that changes her life completely.  She goes to Ed Masry to represent her in a lawsuit, they lose the case and she is without anything -- no job, no money, wrecked car and desperate.  Indignant that Ed told her she would win no problem, she goes back and demands a job from him.  As you will find in the movie, Erin Brockovich is a hard woman to say ""no"" to.  I don't think anyone would have a chance if they tried.  Julia Roberts portrayed her character extremely well -- with heart, intense passion and conviction. 
It's a wonderful story about someone who doesn't let fear get in the way of ""doing the right thing."" As far as the clothing -- you have to remember that Erin Brockovich was Miss Wichita (? I think she said) and her whole sense of who she was prior to going to work for Ed Masry revolved around her appearance.  Those clothes were very much the 80s, and she was comfortable enough with her body and sexuality to wear them.  The real Erin is a beautiful woman.  According to the real Erin, her skirts were even shorter than the ones Julia Roberts wore in the movie!Go see it.  It might make you think twice about doing nothing next time you see someone being victimized.  Besides, like one of the other comments about this movie said -- you want to just see what is going to come out of her mouth next!  This movie made me want to meet the real Erin.  I love people who have no fear, and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe is right.  This is a gutsy movie about a gutsy woman!",Erin Brockovich

As a whole I just felt that there was nothing special about the story, the acting, or the dialogue.If anything this was a little above mediocre, solely because of its social messages about the plights of single mothers and the tiny law firm taking on a giant corporation.So to summarize, there's simply nothing special about this movie.

I just love it when the little guy gets a chance to take on the giant - and wins...because it's just the right thing to do!!!

242,han solo-4,Excellent feelgood movie,9,12 April 2000,"Erin Brockovich essentially combines two movies. The first being about a single mother of three struggling to support her kids in a materialistic country.  The second being about said single mother transcending stereotypes by discovering and investigating a cover up by a large utility about the damage that their plant has caused local residents. The great achievement that director Steven Soderbergh makes is to combine these two elements seemlessly. Julia Roberts is in superb form in the titular role and her co-star, veteran Albert Finney, turns in an excellent performance. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's main squeeze, George and Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, the woman whose Real Estate claim starts the whole thing off. The screenplay by Susannah Grant provides Roberts with lots of snappy one-liners, which I'm not quite sure the real Erin Brockovich said. But hey! It makes for more fun in the movie.

What is this film really about?  On the surface, it's about a courageous woman who stands up to a large corporation in defense of some three hundred clients who she cares for very much.  How touching.  But what is it really about?  This conventional film was trying to show that justice can and should be brought about in unconventional ways.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  Of course not.  That's what heroism is about - doing that which is extraordinary to achieve good ends.  But what exactly was the extraordinary thing that she did?  Was it the fact that she used her body as an object?  Or was it that she sacrificed precious time with her already-neglected children?  Or was it her rude and often dehumanizing way of interacting with other people?  What kind of hero is this?

It is by far her best work as an actress, mixing a trucker's mouth, ""pushed-up"" sex appeal, and that winning smile.

I'll always think of The Limey as his last film before selling his soul to Hollywood. It's hard to believe that the director of sex, lies, and videotape made this. Soderbergh used to be one of the godfathers of independent filmmaking (before there was Tarantino, there was Soderbergh). The name Soderbergh meant quality cinema. I thought Out Of Sight was a little too mainstream, but I saw what he was doing: trying to take an action film, and give it the kind of gritty feel that The French Connection or Serpico used to have. Most directors don't make them like that anymore (pardon the cliche). Following that, he perfected the gritty action drama with The Limey. These movies prove that he is above directing a knockoff of A Civil Action built around Julia Roberts. What's next? Jim Jarmusch directing the third Mission: Impossible?

And of course this is going to wind up being a hokey, humdrum, merely average movie just like Runaway Bride, right?  Nope, not even close.  Actually, it's probably the best mainstream movie to come down the pipe this year.  In fact, it plays off of Julia Roberts' image as this particular type of character, as the movie is all about appearances and the fallacy of catering to those images.  Julia prances around in EXTREMELY tight-fitting clothing while shouting sporadic obscenities, but despite this characterization, she is a wonderful and caring human being that you have to root for deep within your soul, even if you haven't liked a single one of her other films and practically despised her previous acting attempts(like myself).  This is an apparently ordinary person acting in an extraordinary fashion, bettering the lives of hundreds of people without having the audience question her integrity - Roberts is completely believable and lovable.

Then she comes across papers that catch her attention about the behavior of PG&E.  Erin sets out to investigate the tale which then brings Ed in the Case too. Together, Ed and Erin battle Pg&E in the courts for their illegal and heartless use of chromium in the public water systems (which has given residents of Hinkley, CA diseases of the worst kind.  My personal favorite movie which should have beat Gladiator for best picture is a must see and agreat film.  See it as soon as possible.",Erin Brockovich
250,mediasi,"Great Acting, Directing to Convey a Tragic Story",9,6 May 2000,"Even with such high ratings, I was skeptical to spend a Saturday evening with this film. I don't regret it one bit.Julia Roberts is at her best, with a dramatic story with slight comedic interludes. The story, regardless of its content, is as true to life as they come. And Julia, as Erin, represents a trait every woman wishes she could have - the gall to stand up for what she believes, the compromise between love and goals, and the strength to carry herself through anything.Two very promising thumbs up to the story, the actors and the director.",Erin Brockovich
251,bubs,A different role,8,14 April 2000,Julia Roberts has certainly changed her acting prowess in this thoroughly well directed and acted drama. The story is well paced and has Roberts on top form and looks certain to hit another $100m hit.Soderbergh has also come through delivering and expanding on his last hit Out Of Sight. Overall a throughly enjoyable film released at the right time and aimed at the right kind of people...film goers!!,Erin Brockovich
252,Nancy B.,Hugely pleasant surprise,9,26 March 2000,"Based on both the previews and what I've seen of Julia Roberts in the past, I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  Guess what--it's GREAT!  Very funny, moving, engaging (I only looked at my watch once, which is a record for me), and just suspenseful enough.  Albert Finney is phenomenal; I think he deserves a best actor nomination.  Go to this movie and have a great time!",Erin Brockovich
253,localman-2,Great Storytelling,10,19 March 2000,"This film reminded me that, despite the attention usually given the stars, the real draw of a film is the director.  Steven Soderbergh knows how to tell a story.  This film worked well for everyone in the theater, which broke out it cheers and applause at several points in the film.  For such a down-to-earth story, the audience reaction was truly amazing.Although this film is remarkably similar in theme to ""A Civil Action"" and very easily could have fallen victim to the fact that similar stories have been told dozens of times, Erin Brockovich shines.The entire cast was superb, and Susannah Grant's script was sharp and tight. Soderbergh always seems to bring the very best out of those he's working with.  Although I don't hear a lot about him, I think he is one of the most talented directors around today.  Every time I let him tell me a story, I'm very glad that I did.",Erin Brockovich
254,at_man,"Awesome, hilarious movie",10,1 April 2001,Julia Roberts nailed this one. I have to admit all other Juila Roberts movies I've seen I really didn't like then I saw this one. The things that came out of her mouth were hilarious. She was definately worthy of that best actress award. I think it should have won best picture too but anyway. I would rank this movie in my top 10 favourtie movies of all time. I plan to buy this movie because I could watch it over and over again!!,Erin Brockovich
255,Mr. Dubayu,The Julia Roberts I like most returns,8,26 August 2000,"Julia Roberts needs to pick more movies like this one.  It is so much more fun to watch her in a role where (to use a cliche) she lights up the screen. Her better movies are ones where she has this brightness.  She helps this movie because of this.  With her in it, I completely forgot I was watching a true story of people doomed in life because of the carelessness of a large corporation.  The movie doesn't weigh itself down in this tragedy and therefore becomes much easier to watch.",Erin Brockovich
256,cregox,"smart, simple, touching and motivational",10,23 January 2006,"It's always good a little introduction about the writer to put things in perspective. I've watched about 20 movies in the last 2 years. Before that, 1 movie per week. I've missed big movies and I'm from somewhere between Generation X and Y.Every actor plays a great role in it. I don't know much of each one past works, but even Julia Roberts seems like she is playing the first role in her career this time. Except she is now 30 and not 20 anymore.It starts showing, quickly, how bad she was in life in that moment. Not one second she gives up, but specially in the beginning, not one second she stops smiling at life even while life throw her away to the dump. That's until she gets of a job interview, broke, with 3 kids, divorced twice and suffer a car accident. Now she can't smile that easily anymore... But, that's one thing in the movie... She doesn't know what's going to happen, but definitely never give up. And that's just the first 7 minutes.The movie has 2 sides. At one side, there is a big case of corruption in PSE&G, the American supplier of gas and electricity. At the other side there is a bright woman, fighting to stay alive and getting life to push her in the hard way into solving that case. And she proves to be able to do the job and still keeping herself as a pretty woman, as she likes that.Along with that, there is, in each part of the movie, smart words being used. It starts pretty fast, then it slows down a little to normal to show details about the story itself. But while it slows down, it still keeps with some details about how's a good way to live life, specially added by Charlie, who seems like an angel, plus the smart way how Erin moves her life, almost unconsciously.--- spoiler --- While watching the movie I've cried, without knowing the reason, for the first time in my short 24 year old life. Other than that, I've only did it in funerals. It was when her child asked what was going on, why she was out of home for 18 months, and they could understand each other by using just a few words. Amazing kid.Despite of how real the story evolving PSE&G really is the movie gives one feeling of evil company. But I rather see it the other image the movie also shows which is PSE&G just acting as a big company who has human making mistakes, blinded by money and by keeping distance from reality. There's no specific scene showing that, but the movie as a whole does.",Erin Brockovich
257,mjm10000,What a waste,4,28 July 2003,"What a waste of Miss Roberts excellent acting talents, the story is great but I found that all Julia had to do was show cleavage and swear, and for this she received an Oscar. Maybe more actresses should swear and show cleavage and they will receive Oscars. I love Julia as an actress is one of the very best but in this movie I think she really bombs. Lets look at the inconsistencies 1) Is her character a smoker or not,(not that I am a fan of smoking in movies) she smokes once at the beginning of the movie then never again.(Why) 2) Also the Character claims the reason she wears sexy clothing is because she finds it most comfortable but when she gets home after work she changes into sweats. Is this to maker herself less comfortable. 3) Anybody that would talk to and swear at her boss the way she did would usually be fired on the spot.",Erin Brockovich
258,Kyle007,"Commitment, hard work and passion against all odds",10,27 March 2005,"Yeah yeah, my review's title is a nice summary about this movie. I wasn't completely sure before i watched it but, then it surprised me a lot, it was a great surprise and i am happy that i watched it.First of all i have to remark the fabulous performance that Julia Roberts gave us in this movie....This Erin Brockovich had a stubborn personality and was really hot-blooded, she was committed to her job and she didn't quit even in the most difficult situations, and Julia had to be to the height of the character, a really complex one, and she really could handle the character and made it hers, i actually believed Julia could have been Erin. She wasn't a lawyer, luckily, she wasn't in that business of deceitment and betrayal, she was pure and always spoke with the truth, and she cared about her customers, not as people who gave you their many but as people that have a story behind them, she cared about the emotional context, in other words, she treated them as they deserved for the only fact that they are people, not for the money they can or can't give you, and that's great of Erin, that's the most important.Of course this is an actual case, and i have to say that finally justice rules, this movie should encourage everybody else to see that it isn't impossible to fight against something that is believed to be more powerful than us.Here it is really good portrayed the situation of justice in the world, the most powerful people gets the better part just because they have good lawyers , and in some cases good legions of lawyers. That can disencourage people, because what is a single person to do against a huge organization?? And besides, judges aren't correct with their decisions, this case was a happy exception to that luckily. Let's pray for all the cases to have an ending like this................I am forgetting about the guy who played Erin's employer, he did a remarkable job too, and helped a lot to the character of Roberts...he was, the typical lawyer but Erin's goodwill helped to change him.........Resuming, i love this movie as a nearly perfect portrayal of our decadent legal system, and the message of hope it gives us when you see it isn't impossible to win saying the truth.",Erin Brockovich
259,auntydle,"liked the movie, didn't like the person",8,25 April 2006,"I thought the movie was very good. I also admired the work and dedication of the real-life Erin Brockovich. What I didn't like was the scene where the other attorneys are asking about information that should be in the files. The female attorney says to Erin, ""That's okay, you probably just didn't know what questions to ask."" Erin proceeds to shred her by revealing that Erin has all of the correct information...in her head. Instead of writing the information in the files, which is what 999,999,999 people out of 1,000,000,000 would do, Ms Erin Brockovich MEMORIZES the information. I guess this is supposed to show how dedicated Erin is to her clients and how much smarter she is than snooty people who went to college. I guess we, the little people, were supposed to be cheering during this scene. When the lady attorney tries to apologize, ""Look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot..."", Erin cuts her off with ""That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet and f***ing ugly shoes."" At that point, I stopped liking Erin Brockovich, the person. That attorney didn't deserve that. Her boss called her out for her behavior but I never got the sense that she learned to care about anyone else's feelings. She seemed to simply shrug it off when her boyfriend moved out later in the movie.",Erin Brockovich
260,shuvo_rai-67806,Food for thought- what's in your water?,8,23 March 2018,"I don't know how accurate this film is to the real lawsuit, but it was played out very well, that you could understand the reason behind the lawsuit with the need of any prior knowledge. Julia Roberts did a fantastic job in portraying Erin Brockovich, which was quite different from her usual comedy romance style of acting. However, I felt there were two much emphasis on her sexual attractiveness and being a single mother with 3 kids and without a job, she seemed to have quite an unrealistic amount of wardrobe. Julia Roberts, although having a talent in talking the neighbors into signing for the lawsuit, she seemed ungrateful and rude to other people like George (Aaron Eckhart), who selflessly took care of her kids day and night. I don't know if Erin's ungratefulness was based on true story, but it seemed unnecessary and out of place. Also Erin Brockovich is dyslexic in real life which allowed her to remember phone numbers by memory, but in the movie it wasn't quite rooted except the occasional ""slow-reader"" reference, which adds to the confusion. Albert Finney (Ed Masry) did a great job as well all throughout the movie.Overall, I find this movie very well-done and the acting stellar. And if you were looking for another Julia Roberts comedy romance, you're in for a surprise!",Erin Brockovich
261,yngvee,A good story.,8,13 April 2000,"I saw this movie in Canada, together with my girlfriend who is a law student. She was quite irritated about how easy it seemed to perform legal work without any formal education. Well, I think that this story wouldn`t have happened in any of the Scandinavian countries. Anyway, I found it quite entertaining, Julia Roberts was great, and just her style of clothing alone made the movie worth the ticket price.",Erin Brockovich

Of course, during the movies that actually mean something to me, there are always phone calls, people asking ""Hey, what happened?"" upon return from their twelfth snack run to the kitchen, dogs barking at passers by...  Somehow, I managed to watch the movie through all these interruptions, and come out of it with that rare feeling that this was a GREAT movie.  It was warm, gritty, real and beautiful.  Julia Roberts played the low income single mother to the point where you forget she's Julia Roberts.  Erin is mouthy, ballsy, brash and fun.  It's a story of dedication and a person standing against great odds... it's inspiring, yet not mushy about it, and the many people in the movie are all to be commended for their real-ness.  It's a SUPER movie, and from someone who really dislikes ""tear-jerker-ish"" kind of movies, that means something. It ranks up there with The Green Mile, and the Shawshank Redemption - fresh ideas, reminding us that we have not run out of stories - just the ability to put quality over $quantity$.  A++ to this movie.  Rent/Buy it.",Erin Brockovich
265,Stoicorum88,"Not personal? That is my work! My sweat! My time away from my kids! If that's not personal, I don't know what is.",9,13 April 2020,"If you had told me that, years after I last watched Erin Brockovich (directed by Steven Soderbergh) with my mother on VHS, that I would like it more than Soderbergh's Traffic I probably wouldn't have believed you. It's quite impressive that he released both films in 2000 which I didn't know until now.Directly after the release of 2017's Wonder Woman (directed by Patty Jenkins) there was a general sentiment that women finally had a true female superhero movie, summed up for me by a friend of a friend's post on social media talking about what she saw as the key difference between male and female superheroes; that the former often ""saves the world"" because it's the right thing to do whereas the latter tends to ""save the world"" as a byproduct of maternalistic instincts. For her it implied an ethical inferiority that female superheroes needed an endangered child to fuel their heroism.At the time I thought it was an over-exaggerated reading of the roles, since it's not exactly uncommon that male superheroes do what they do because of romantic forces driving their heroism. In hindsight I admit that this friend of a friend had a point.Erin Brockovich isn't the story of a superhero but it's perhaps the best example of a female hero doing what's right for its own sake and it goes even further than that because Erin Brockovich does the right thing at the direct expense of her maternalistic instincts. She doesn't fight for an entire community's justice because one of her kids also got sick or anything like that and due to her workload and efforts she risks alienating her children and even destroys a relationship with a man in the process of this story. I don't know of any other film like it, in that respect.By contrast, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman had no husband or children and so the fact that she ""saves the world"" for its own sake is made redundant because she has no maternal instinct to ignore and act in spite of.While Erin Brockovich on its surface is a quintessential 'feminist film' it also turns the 'workaholic husband and alienated wife' trope in on itself, by placing a woman in the role of workaholic and a man in the role of unloved and alienated, which makes for some very interesting material. The film has us so engaged with Erin Brockovich's mission that we're not prepared for when her love interest doesn't understand the importance of her long work hours and why he feels hurt and alienated to the point of wanting to leave her.This is something very few films try to convey, possibly because most films with this trope are geared towards a male audience and so we're just expected to side with the overworked husband. However, in this film Erin takes George (her love interest) with her to inform one of the sick townspeople that all their work has paid off and they will be receiving a payout of $5 million and before she does so, she tells him that this is what he helped her achieve by staying home and taking care of the kids all those lonely nights.I wonder how many destroyed relationships would have remained intact if only the workoholic husband had shown his wife what she had helped to achieve by doing what needed to be done to allow him to work so much? People are much more content with sacrifice when they know it was for something, but why would anybody stick around if they think they suffered through alienation just so their husband could help their employers make more money?As an aside, I really love the tone of this film. It captures a kind of blue-collar desperation and while the feminist overtones are very obvious, what truly resides at Erin Brockovich's core is a tale about classism and overcoming the forces of polite society, summed up perfectly for me when Erin Brockovich is told to wear longer skirts by the women in the office.",Erin Brockovich
266,rolose,fabulously entertaining,10,18 April 2000,"I hope this film was not released too early in the year to be forgotten come Oscar time! Nicely written, well directed and beautifully photographed. The score is quite subtle in that it is used only when completely necessary and then is never overbearing.

The dialog is witty and the story line is stable. While the movie does go into pointless tangents, remember this is based on a real person.  Don't we all have pointless tangents in our lives?Not the best movie, but certainly worthy of a few Academy Awards for next year.  I especially liked the way Albert Finney played his part as the reluctantly acceptant lawyer.  His facial expressions and entire performance highlight this movie.This movie isn't something for the kids.  It has a lot of vulgar language and concepts difficult for kids to grasp.

Working for her new employer a law firm she stumbles across a pro bono case that will rock her world and change not just her life forever...To sum it up in one sentence ... if you don't mind some profanities and you like Julia Roberts you have to watch the movie (if you already haven't).",Erin Brockovich

Two members rated the film below a 2.0, and two others gave it a perfect 4.0.Much of the discussion concerned the accuracy of the film when compared to the real-life events that spawned it. Also, one member circulated articles from the Wall Street Journal that debunk the claims by the real Erin Brockovich that Chromium 6 caused great harm to the people of the town of Hinkley, Calif.Most of the group enjoyed the chemistry between the two lead performers (Julia Roberts and Albert Finney), appreciated the David and Goliath plot line, and found interesting the enigmatic nature of a woman who dresses like a slut but demonstrates competency as a legal investigator.

I have to say, out of all the films that Miss Roberts has made, this one is the one that really gives her a chance to flex her ""acting muscle"".A strong supporting cast helped this movie along, and Steven Soderburgh's direction made this film a cut above the average.

It received Oscars, much praise, hype and story after story on the real life Erin Brockovich. And indeed, the story is a worthy one - single mother makes good and finds her true calling, helping out a whole town in the process! Occasionally, the film is heart-rending and often very funny. It's also nice that it doesn't go overboard on the schmaltz - being realistic about the problems Erin and George have in balancing out work and a personal relationship. However, everything just floats by all too nicely.. with no real struggle. The meeting with PG & E seems far too easy and the case is won without us even seeing the final hearing with the judge. It's all cut and dried with no real drama or suspense. We know that she's going to win before the story even ends.Great performances all round and still a very entertaining film but I don't think it deserved the OTT praise that it received.

Julia Roberts managed to do some acting for the first time in a few years and it paid off.  She made Erin into a believable character who you wanted to see succeed.  She was not perfect and when the movie was over, she had still not sorted out all the facets of her life - something no-one else has ever done, so why should she?The secondary characters were well defined, being more than just cardboard cut-outs.

But this film manages to make it interesting again. The human drama, which is of course the centerpiece for any such story, and seemed so forced in films such as A Civil Action, came across as achingly real. And the performances. Ah, Steven, no one call pull a performance out of an actor like you. Having never been a Julia Roberts fan, I was blown away by her in this film. She was... REAL. I was able to forget that it was the ""Pretty Woman"" on the screen. In fact, the whole film was real. The broke single mom lives in a dump of a trailer which is not nicer than my apartment, as I see so often in movies.

If people were dissapointed by the eventual predictability of Julia's character I hasten to point out that the whole point of the film, actually a true story, is that she is very much just a down to earth, normal, no frills, single mom. Except for the fact that she was Miss Wichita years back.  As such it is a really effective and moving story about the underdogs fight against corporate America, about normality, common sense and caring winning through. A lovely change from the regular fare of hyped up splashy movies. Definitely recommended for the family, and a must see for my Mum!",Erin Brockovich
286,Khashayar Bavarsad,Every Day is a Winding Road,7,17 October 2002,"Erin Brockovich ,undoubtedly ,is one of the most amusing movies of Steven Soderbergh which I have ever seen.  Although it is still a Soderbergh movie with his familiar qualities.  And for those viewers who are not used to his slow-beating style of narration, it can be a little boring.  But if you put trust in his fame and glory as a new director who really has something to say, you may begin to feel more comfortable with his style. Although I'm not one of the Soderbergh's fanatics, I admit that he has done a well job specially when considering the genre of the movie which is potentially a boring one.  Success of the movie in keeping the audience entertained is not only the result of directing but also that of screenplay which is a well-developed one. Julia Roberts is astonishing. This time she comes out of the foolish girl personality of her romantic movies. Although The scene where she's discussing about her salary with Finney is full of nostalgia and takes us back to 'Pretty Woman' and her dealing with Richard Gere, here, we can see a mature woman in her. Lines of a mother's pain are quite visible in her face. In spite of some critics' anger, I believe she was well deserved of the Oscar that she received as the Best Leading Role actress. The interesting thing is that the movie is not totally dependent on Roberts, since one man named Albert Finney makes one of the best supporting role performances ever.  He is very experienced and it's obviously visible that Soderbergh should have been quite satisfied. Finney has the role completely under his control.  Even if you are not much into Julia Roberts, Albert Finney's performance in Erin Brockovich is a must-see.  Aaron Eckhart is also fitted in his role and adds to the flavor. Thomas Newman's rythmic theme is quite suitable for the atmosphere of the movie and remains in your ear at least for a couple of days and who knows maybe more!! Erin Brockovich has 3 believable performances from the actors I've mentioned above. It has 1 learned director, 1 fine screenplay and 1 wise original score. And from the numbers I'm gonna give to this movie....  The number is 7 out of 10",Erin Brockovich
287,buffalo94,Horrible waste of money,1,31 January 2004,"I consider this film dreadful. I watched it just because of Steven Soderbergh, but he has betrayed his other funny films. If you like movies and you are more than fourteen, regardless  the `based on actual events', you will have the feeling of having watched this film two hundred times before, it is the same old story, absolutely predictable, a bad drag of `trial, lawsuit, lawyer, investigacion,', very very already seen and boring. Furtthermore the fact of choosing Julia Roberts for the role is a huge mistake, I don´t believe her at all and I hate the `science fiction' way she acts in a very `realistic?' movie.

And by all means, this movie can be cremated(I'm a Hindu and so is she) for Roberts' performance but the question arises of why 8 then? Well, you might have heard that some books are to be chewed and some to be digested... Likewise, this one has to be digested! Why? The Story! A single handed mom with a weakness for troublesome romantic relations (to speak of the neighbor biker) who has the best of convictions and a passion to fight for justice. But, this movie is akin to what is reading between the lines in a book.Yes, the movie contains a deeper meaning and our understanding of progress, which is not always right for the best of both worlds. For what maybe progress for the developed may turn out to be a warrant to death for the developing. The so portrayed neighbourhood is a victim to the company's chemicals for decades while little knowing about it. And when they come to terms with the chemicals, the situation is grim and the result: every thinkable cancer. Apply the analogy to countries and you will identify what I was referring to earlier. Erin is hence no short of a messiah to represent as many as 634 plaintiffs and grant them justice. Someone for being what many would called on the lines of a beauty queen, man she has brains. So, this one was an inspirational story to me. And can only be justified with an 8!",Erin Brockovich

I understand why the A.M.P.A.S offered her an Academy Award for Best Actress. The directing of Steven Soderbergh and the score composed by Thomas Newman create a real universe which accompanies J.

292,SteveNY,Not an exceptional film,4,18 March 2001,"The idea that this film is exceptional or that Julia Roberts' performance is exceptional is just another Hollywood snow job. A very surfacey look at the story of the woman in the movie's title. To separate his work from appearing like that of, say, Penny Marshall, Soderbergh seems to insert long, boring parts into his movie so that people will see him as an auteur. ""Ain't he deep?!"" You can load a movie up with all the film school smoke you want, but I've watched enough Nick at Nite to spot bad '70's TV when I see it and let me tell you, kiddies, in Erin Brockovich I see it! Also, a very lousy job of balancing the love part of the story with the big bad corporate part. If Julia Roberts wins the Oscar for this I hope she forgoes thanking her agent, her eighth grade drama teacher and God and actually thanks the one thing that got her nominated for this role to begin with...her push-up bra. And if for some reason she's unable to attend, maybe her bra can accept the award on her behalf.",Erin Brockovich

I came out with a whole new appreciation for her as an actress.  She brings a depth and conviction to her portrayal of Erin that made me think that maybe there was still a serious actress there after all.  It's been so long since we've seen Roberts in a role that was more than just fluff.  This role signals a return to more serious fare.  And not only did Roberts bring the role to life, she did it clad in the most hideous of 80's fashions.  This movie isn't just about cleavage -- the clothing is representative of the time period.  If you ignore it and concentrate on the story and the acting, you'll be pleasantly surprised, and find yourself watching a well-written, well-directed, well-acted movie that will draw you in and make you want to jump right in and help Erin in her fight against Big Business.",Erin Brockovich

Julia Roberts has given proof of being a very good actress (bettering more & more...). A strange thing happened a few days after this film was theatrically released in Italy: I heard of a news on TV saying that the same thing could happen in Asti (in Piedmont); hopefully it didn't, thanks to the film!

296,Shawn Stingel,"Julia Robert's over-the-top portrayal of the real Erin Brockovich, which could land the actress her 3rd Oscar nomination",10,3 May 2000,"The pretty woman's portrayal in this true story about a woman who discovers that an industrial plant is secretly polluting the residences' groundwater in Hinkley is nothing short of spectacular. Boasting with sex appeal, a million dollar smile, and an enhancing bra, Roberts delivers a performance that shows off her ubiquitous talent, which could earn the runaway bride her third Oscar nomination. ""Brockovich,"" helmed by acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh (""Out of Sight""), benefits as well from being based on a true story that doesn't wander off into an oblivious fog, a very difficult and controversial subject to handle (see ""The Hurricane"" and ""The Insider""). Although Roberts' role may be the film's selling point, the fact that she is portraying a real woman with a profound livelihood deserves a little more attention than her wide grin. Erin is a torn woman, one who has been stretched to the brink of exhaustion as evidenced by her struggling attempt to keep food on the table for her three kids while fumbling through job ads. We can relate to people like Erin, and it's because of her willingness and ability to project a rather intimidating image that she is able to get what she wants and not take 'no' for an answer. She's a true inspirational hero, a woman who crosses the boundaries for a people suffering from the suit-driven executives of a billion-dollar corporation.

Apparently done without any camera cuts. I do not expect that they put a multi-million dollar actress in the middle of a car crash and have been searching for film cuts in the sequence.

And Albert Finney is terrific in his Oscar worthy performance as the owner of the small, slightly sleazy Southern California law firm that Erin works for.Director Soderbergh knows his audience and works the film in a way that plays out as pure entertainment, not unlike Out of Sight.Plenty of cinematic fun which is sure to place another diamond in Julia's screen queen crown.8 of 10",Erin Brockovich

Now that I've seen the movie, however, I know that I was wrong.  Julia Roberts portrays Erin excellently, and her performance makes this movie shine. Sure, it's not much more than a ""feel good"" movie, but hey...what's wrong with that?  It has a good plot, good characters, and an all-around good feeling to it.

304,IronParrot,Erin Crock-o-spit,2,1 August 2001,"There are truly bad movies. Some of them are at least enjoyable, in a Mystery Science Theatre sort of way. But then there are bad movies that try to pass themselves off as good, in which even the flaws turn out to be flat-out annoying more than entertaining.""Erin Brockovich"" is of the second type. In fact, it's the worst of the second type of bad films to be released in 2000. Here's a brief summary of some of the reasons why:Six hundred innocent lives are at stake. The audience is supposed to care. It doesn't. That's the first sign a movie like this is in trouble.Julia Roberts is a good actress, but she comes off as over-acting because of the banal dialogue. No, sorry, ""dialogue"" implies interaction. All we have here is Julia Roberts dishing out lines that basically say, ""look Ma, I'm acting!"" and show off her talent to memorize tedium.PG&E is portrayed as an evil, evil corporation. That's not the part I have a problem with. I have a problem with the fact that its representatives are portrayed as drones that serve as nothing more than voices for the evil, evil corporation. Faithful representatives, to be sure, but this was done better with stormtroopers and Star Wars.Long and boring. This is a dramatized by-the-textbook retelling. ""Gettysburg"" and ""Anna and the King"" also suffered from this, but at least they were visually interesting. Visually (and musically), ""Brockovich"" plays like a Seinfeld episode without the humor. Or the character design.It's just so COLD. And the characters are all flat. (That's right, I called Erin Brockovich flat.) ""Tough biker who likes kids and is a sensitive guy on the inside"" is NOT character development - and everyone else was worse.I gave this an IMDB rating of 2/10. I'm a nice guy.",Erin Brockovich

It's a lighter version of Silkwood and Class Action rolled into one with a heavily padded wonder bra thrown in for good measure for Ms. Roberts.If you like cheering for the underdog, like to see corporate giants slayed or if you just like to stare at Julia Roberts boobs, then this movie is for you.",Erin Brockovich

The viewer gets a clear grasp of Erin's personality and a clear understanding of her whole life. If characters could be expressed as well as Roberts's character, we would have a better group of movies, and television series to watch and enjoy.

But wait, let's add a new twist, let's use somebody's t.v. movie of the week true story, alter some facts therein, and make it the next Julia Roberts movie vehicle.  I don't understand movie reviews that say ""Julia has done it again.  She has played against type and succeeded."" Wait one hot minute here.  If I'm not mistaken, she really has only played Julia Roberts in every movie.  Sure she squints her face, makes a goofy chuckle, walks as if she's prettier than she actually is, and sheds a tear for good measure.  I've seen this in every movie she's been in.  Possibly she could have won a lifetime achievement award, but at such a young age?  The Oscar should stand for an individual performance, not for slack in the rope that needed to be tightened for past efforts.  I think roles like Sigourney Weaver's in Aliens, for which she was nominated and lost far exceed the range of drama than in this picture.  Erin seemed beaten down by her own life.  But that alone is not deserving of a reward.  The character seemed like a bitch to be honest.  Let's see, no manners, an awful attire, a foul mouth, an ignorant mother-who leaves their kids with a biker she just met-no matter how desperate?, and money driven.  There are many people in tough situations who don't have the best of resources.  Maybe if the movie centered on why SHE merits such an opportunity to rise above the mess instead of manipulating those around her by promising things she cannot/will not produce, it might have been compelling.  If it wasn't for the money won at the end, the movie would not have been made.  And that is the saddest truth we learn from it.  It is not compelling to watch someone who gets $20 million a movie console someone trying to get money because they got cancer from a corporate giant.  The paradox is too evident.  The film has a moment where they argue about the necessity for a trial, because it will make the bad guys admit what they did was wrong in court.  But we never actually see this.  Only a settlement was actually reached.  This kills any moral drive the movie has.  So what is the movie trying to focus on?  The trial, her life, the outcome, the money.  Who knows?  Julia is a fine actress, I have enjoyed her since Mystic Pizza, thru Flatliners, and Pretty Woman.  It's great that she does entertaining funny ""date movies.""

318,cjkintz,Hardly a True-Life Story,1,3 April 2001,"One should head the warning that the movie is *based* on true-life events. ""Erin Brockovich"" is simply a ""lawsuits are really your friend"" feel-good Hollywood fluff movie that has little basis in fact. In real-life, an attorney that was retained by Hinkley residents to sue Brockovich and Masry after they took the money and ran, was quoted as saying ""I read the script; the only true part was Erin Brockovich's name.""Julia Robert's performance was decent, but hardly Oscar material. I've seen her in far better performances, and it seems that the basis of her presence here is to simply use foul language and show off her cleavage. If it's foul language you want, rent ""South Park: The Movie"", which is funny and much more entertaining then ""Erin Brockovich"". Albert Finney was good as the in-over-his-head Lawyer trying to do what is right for the residents of Hinkley, but he was much much better in ""Traffic"".I highly recommend that anybody who watches ""Erin Brockovich"" (and especially if you get up and cheer at the end) takes the time to do cursory research on the real-life Hinkley case. In real-life, the motivation of the three law firms was neither truth nor compassion, but rather 40 percent of the winnings. Their ""take"" from the settlement was $133 million plus an amazing $10 million more in expenses. Brockovich's bonus alone was $2 million.""Give me a break!"" moaned one resident after seeing the film. ""They depicted the lawyers as so concerned about the residents,"" she said. ""But does she [Brockovich] really care?""To understand why the Masry-Brockovich team won, it's important to know that the case was a settlement not subject to appeal, that PG&E (the movie ""Bad Guys"") was suffering terrible publicity, and that as a utility it could simply pass losses on to utility customers. But when these same three firms, including the Masry-Brockovich team, tried the same ploy in the court system against a company with no guaranteed income, the case collapsed like a rotten pumpkin.Far from being ""environmental crusaders"" as the media now routinely calls them, the real-life Masry and Brockovich have never crusaded for anything but money.",Erin Brockovich

The actors play off of each other well and are very believable. You will not regret the 2hrs you spend at the movies. It also has a great message that one person can make a difference. It has the right combination of drama and comedy. The language is strong but humorous and Roberts outfits make for additional humor and another character in the movie.,Erin Brockovich
322,Amy14,JULIA IS EXTRAORDINARY,10,15 April 2000,"Erin Brockovich is Julia Roberts most amazing role/character. She absolutely shines as if she were born for this part. The plot may drag in places but it is touching and julias role makes up for any remotely bad parts. Shes brilliant, and my favorite actress.  Erin will be admired by all, her strength, attitude, and witty comebacks. :) Her smart allecky comments will be forever remember and enjoyed for years to come.",Erin Brockovich
323,cavafy62,Great,9,26 April 2000,Can't rave about this film enough. Julia Roberts was born to play this role. The movie was a bit slow in places however I agree that the subject matter isn't the most captivating from a story telling perspective. Well Done.,Erin Brockovich
324,ngt,Great Entertainment,8,20 March 2000,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The combination of drama, humour, and suspense based on a true story was well done.  I have to admit, I could have done without some of the foul language...I am not saying it all had to be eliminated (I can clearly see Erin using it), but it didn't need to be as frequent.  And for those who don't know...Krispy Kreme is the correct spelling of very famous donuts that originate in Winston-Salem, NC.",Erin Brockovich
325,jadzia-9,Director Steven Soderbergh triumphs again!,9,13 March 2000,"When I first heard that Steven Soderbergh (my new favorite director after ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"") was directing a Julia Roberts movie, I was worried. Would this be a big sell-out Hollywood picture? I was worried for no reason. Soderbergh comes through once again, and in a very big way. Like he did for George Clooney in ""Out of Sight"", Soderbergh also does for Julia Roberts: making a famed actor step out of their famous persona and instead become a very detailed character. Julia Roberts pulls in a great performance in this movie, for any reason but the fact that you don't get a constant reminder that you are watching ""Julia Roberts"". Erin Brockovich comes alive in a startling way and makes a fine counterpoint to the typical Julia Roberts role: she is brashy, trashy, strong but still utterly likeable. While many of the stylistic editing techniques that Soderbergh has used (most eloquently in ""The Limey"")have been toned down for this crowd-pleasing picture, they are still there. Fans of his previous movies will be pleased, and I daresay that Julia Roberts fans will be as well.",Erin Brockovich
326,Sparky-95,Great Movie from start to Finish,10,2 February 2001,Wow what a story! I was rather shocked that this was based on a true story. Roberts and Finny were awesome in this movie. The real Erin Brockovich was even in it ( The waitress @ the start of the film )I Recommend this film watched on DVD for the interviews of the real Erin Brockovich & Ed Masery. They fought a massive war for the people of Hinkly while Erin was only a single mom with attitude and working with a small firm lawyer.Julia was total in this role she was born for the part.GO WATCH IT TODAY,Erin Brockovich
327,fsmii-2,The movie beat my lukewarm expectations.,7,25 March 2000,"I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan (not that I dislike her but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch her) and after reading Roger Ebert's review my expectations were not very high.  But I found the movie funny, and Roberts' performance energizing.  While Roger found Roberts' dress distracting, I thought it part of a running joke.  Anyway, it's a nice, feel-good date movie, especially if your female date is in a bad mood.  It will cheer her up.",Erin Brockovich
328,lark710,Even with the Boobs it is still a Chick Flick,9,30 March 2000,"Excellent story, too much vulgar language to earn a 10. If you don't offend easily, it is a must see!

331,gwatzka,Fresh and invigorating,9,29 March 2000,"Julia Roberts does it again.A role that fits her perfectly. I have not seen her act this well since Pretty Woman. To see a movie  that is based on a true story, that pits the small and fragile against the super company and have the little guy come out on top is so refreshing. You really get caught up in the personal day to day struggle of Erin. Finney is also superb as Julia's boss. Together they are a kick them in the teeth team.It's great to see a movie about a company that has so little regard for human beings get their's in the end. A definite must see movie.",Erin Brockovich
332,William III,It has been done before...,7,31 March 2000,"It was a little above average.  This meaning it has been done before in several movies.

334,horsburghn,"Dull, dull, deathly dull.",1,12 August 2000,"Whilst I am truly grateful that their are people in the world like Erin who are prepared to stand up and be counted in the face of opposition, a documentary I feel would have fared better. A documentary could look at the situation involved in the film and present the situation sensibly. Instead we have a film that, but for the appearance of Roberts, deserves to languish in the TV Hell of bored housewife afternoon television. The biggest shame is that Julia Roberts had just gone up in my estimations after having appeared in Notting Hill.Had I not injured myself skiing on holiday in Canada, I would never have seen this film. What is more, I would have walked out if my knee had been better. Erin Brockovich is dull, dull, deathly dull.",Erin Brockovich

The lesson my son saw in this movie was not to be a quitter!  Julia Roberts played the part quite well.  The determination of this young single mother was an inspiration to some.  I've met people that seem to think they can't amount to anything in life but after seeing this movie some have realized that they can do almost anything they can put their minds to!  The vocabulary she used may not have been appropriate but she certainly got her point across.  The movie also makes me wonder how many large corporations in the world are getting away with illegal dumping of toxic waste.  I thought it was an excellent movie.  On another note, to have my son, who has learning difficulties as well as being dyslexia, enjoy the movie and to see the inspiration to not be a quitter was a bonus to us!",Erin Brockovich
336,cathness,A rare perfect ten--this movie has everything.,10,7 May 2001,"Maybe this movie is not the right choice for action fans, but that is the only restriction of my otherwise fullest recommendation for this movie. It has everything, ranging from real-life documentary through love story via comedy to tragedy. And it is so lovingly done, and played so well. And it also has a wonderful soundtrack. To all the non-English Europeans: Get the DVD or original VHS, because the dubbed translated versions aren't quite like the original in terms of atmosphere created.",Erin Brockovich
337,cinehed,Helpless sheep,2,11 March 2001,"Simply, this is the kind of movie that keeps people helpless.  When I saw it, everyone applauded, and my blood boiled.  There is no St. Julia gonna sweep down and save your asses.  It's a fantasy (yes, I know it's based on a true story--repeat...it's only [and always] a movie).  It's a fantasy in which the diseased lie around  without any effect on their own situation--where the working class is powerless, waiting for the tits of salvation to come and save them.  Take control of your life--refuse this fantasy.  Shame on you Soderbergh--what happened to your integrity?",Erin Brockovich
338,derderder,Trash,1,15 February 2002,"This film is simply trash, much like the woman it is about.  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a horrible movie.  Whoever thought that a woman with a bad taste in clothing, a vulgar mouth that spews obsceneties every time it opens, and continuous self-absorption could be the basis for a quality movie?  This movie tries to illustrate Erin Brockovich as a kind person with a good heart and will stop at nothing to help people and to make things right.  What a load of SH**!  Steven Soderbergh tries to fool us into believing that Brockovich is a good-natured woman trying to help the disease-striken residents within the area of PG&E.  Any wise viewer would look past this and see the truth, which is that Erin Brockovich is nothing but a bitch with a dirty mouth, a fraud, a dumbass, and not to mention a bad mother, which is well displayed when she leaves her children with a man she doesn't even know (George, who she treats like crap, even when they're together).  Another thing I couldn't stand about Erin was her selfishness and ungreatful, rude attitude that she displayed for her boss.  It seemed that every half hour she was asking for a raise, didn't seem to care when Masery was facing financial problems as a result of the lawsuit, and showed no respect for him at any point in the movie.  I guess she thought that she was the only one working her ass off in this whole thing.And another thing that really annoyed me was that this movie was praised by so many people!  The movie had no good taste much like the title character. How this movie was praised by the Oscars is the worst of all things about this movie.1.)Best Picture.  PLEASE!  This movie was probably one of the worst of the year!  It had no place to be in the running as the best of the year.  Its spot could've easily been taken by Almost Famous.2.)Best Screenplay.  Susannah Grant may have had a remote deserving for an Oscar nomination if her screenplay was true to the facts, which would've illustrated that Erin Brockowitch truly is a money-hungary fraud who dresses like a wench.3.)Best Director.  Soderbergh is a great director.  But it was nothing out of the ordinary here.  He did deserve a nomination for TRAFFIC,which he won. But the Academy shouldn't have squandered yet another nomination on something that was not worth it. 4.- Best Supporting Actor.  This was the only deserving nomination for this movie.  Albert Finney brings us the only likeable main character in this movie, and serves as the only bright spot in the film, except for maybe Marg Helgenburger.  He made the movie somewhat watchable with his strong, compelling performance. 5.- And now, last and certainly the least, BEST FU**ING ACTRESS!  Julia Roberts did a bad/OK job here.  Her performance might have been credible if she didn't accept all of these accolades.  All she did in the movie was flash her boobs, most of which were just a push-up bra, lash out at just about everyone in the movie for no good reason, and put in a sob, sympathetic facial expression, or a few tears in just to soften people up (didn't work on me Julia!).  The fact that she thought so much of her performance as to actually accept a nomination and then the award itself just shows how greedy she is.  Her nomination was a complete waste, and she couldn't hold a candle to any of those in the running.  Her nomination should've easily gone to one more deserving, such as Bjork for DANCER IN THE DARK.  The academy truly proved that it was out to boost egos and careers instead of rewarding for individual achievement.  The fact that every major awards organization (the oscars, golden globes, sag awards) and several critics associations gave their best actress honor to Roberts for her effortless performance instead of the true best actress of 2000, Ellen Burstyn, shows just how scandalous Hollywood is.  Roberts won the awards because she's the most bankable star in the business.  If these organizations did what they claimed, they would've awarded Ellen Burstyn for her heartbreaking performance in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.  Burstyn reaches out to audiences and rips their hearts out of their chests with her performance, which is unarguably the best in years, if ever, from an actress.  Not to mention the fact that Burstyn went through hell for her part, and still few gave her the recognition she deserves because they felt Julia should've won everything because she's younger, prettier(well, not really), and more people like her movies (yeah, sure: remember, Burstyn was the lead in THE EXORCIST [one of the most influential, scariest, and most talked about movies of all time in which she gave one of her best performances], not to mention her great performances in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE [for which the academy awarded her], and SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR just to name a few.)Overall, I give this an imdb rating of 1/10.  If I could give it a zero, I would.",Erin Brockovich
339,Eatmybolonga,Beautiful Movie - Based on a true story,10,30 August 2009,"I remember watching this movie back in 2000 being ten years old and understandably I didn't appreciate it for its technical brilliance at the time but still simply loving every moment of every scene. I watch this movie now and fall deeply in love with every line that comes out characters mouths.Julia Roberts has her ups in and downs but her acting in this movie has given new meaning to the term respect. Roberts portrays a single mother who through desperation works her hardest to put food on the table for her children and not for one second did I doubt her acting. This coming from a guy who looks at most top end actors and see's the actor not the character.Albert Finney, this wonderful man once again proves why it is he has constantly been praised with his Oscar nominations. This man puts the Act in actor. Finney plays the small time private lawyer who is responsible for giving Roberts character the job. Given that Finneys character was neither in dept nor well written (but not in a bad way) Al makes the character shine and brings the viewers into the story with his constant facial expressions and his expansive hilarity, all in all Finney plays his part perfectly as the supporting character.Aaron Eckhart plays the ""house husband"" nanny who looks after the kids for most of the movie. He doesn't have a major role but plays his part well and was nicely suited for the task. He also brings a nice side story to the major plot.All in all this is a very well written adaptation of the life of Erin Brockovich. The characters are lovable and progress nicely throughout the film. This movie will keep you entertained and have you laughing your ass off one minute and have your lunging for your hanky the next.Do not miss the Beauty that is, Erin Brockovich.I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it. ~J.D.

Until I watched this movie I had no idea who or what she did etc. But when I finished the movie i realized that she did so much, working wise with 3 kids and yet she came out with everything that she wanted or she got help at the end. She achieved so much during this time when she was dealing with this situation. There was only one thing that I didn't like about this movie and that was there was so much swearing in it. But I just got around all the swearing and I realized at the end that she did all that. This comment is just wait I thought of the movie and I hope that when you watched I hope that you will agree with what I said.",Erin Brockovich
341,lightville-1,Julia's performance saves the movie.,5,25 December 2004,"We've seen it before, many times. Poor and defenseless, albeit decent people, against rich and powerful entities. The movie is extremely predictable. Every motion is lead by another predictable action. Like when she met the biker. We know what is coming after wards. So the producers probably wanted to make it different from others. They dressed the heroine like a hooker with a foul mouth. We see a lot of Julia Robert's skin throughout the picture. And that's were the film diverts. It's hard to forget that we're seeing Julia Roberts instead the real Erin Brockovich. Even her children are not likable characters. She outshines them all. There's also a lack of suspense. Except for one incident, her life of safety is never threatened. Kind of odd if you're going against such a huge corporation.If the movie's purpose is to entertain, it succeeds. Thanks to Julia's performance. The rest is dull.",Erin Brockovich

If you watch behind the scenes on the DVD, there is an interview with the real Erin Brockovich. In this interview you can really see that Julia has done a fabulous job portraying her, and although this movie is about a very serious law case, there is a touch of humor that makes the movie even more enjoyable. This movie may follow others that are great but it is so different in its own way. I don't know how to explain it so i will just call it the 'X-factor'. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves Julia Roberts and/or Albert Finney as their performances are stunning.",Erin Brockovich

Delightful movie, with hysterical, sleazy clothes that ""fit"" her perfectly. The language kind of surprised me, but it was definitely in keeping with her character. Some parts were so funny and the audience laughed so hard that you couldn't hear the next lines; worth a second viewing to get those lines. Kept my interest throughout. Not as predictable as I thought it would be. Albert Finney was excellent in his role too, and the guy who played George should be getting more parts very soon :-).

I saw the film during a sneak preview and it had the audience riveted. In fact, it applauded when the movie finished, something I haven't witnessed since I was a little kid and that was standard behavior. At times the movie had parts of ""A Civil Action"" and ""Silkwood,"" but Julia Roberts and Finney, along with the others, gave this film its own flavor. It's too bad it was released when it was, because I fear the performances will long be forgotten when Oscar nominations come around next year.",Erin Brockovich

She gets a start by pushing her way in to a law firm and her curious attitude brings her across an Utility Company that has been hiding something for a long time.  The movie has its high points specially when Roberts brings her attitude into it.  All in all it just goes to show that sometimes it is all in the attitude.  Julia Roberts is great and Albert Finney does a wonderful job as well.  I cheered at the end!  Great movie. A definite feel good movie.,Erin Brockovich

Well, after more than two hours of nothing (except Julia's petty clothes !!), I wonder if just because this movie deals with noble things: cancer, children, the victory of the small against the big, etc, a score of nearly 8 is justified ? More than one time I was to abandon the cinema, but I resisted till the end hoping for something to happen. No way !! Sometimes the job of a movie maker is to transpose a real fact into a movie without adding anything. But if the reality is such a boring list of events .. think for a moment to the people that spends two hours of their time on a cinema chair. They aren't in the story, though a very noble one that touches everyone heart !! The  only ""live"" moments are the ... naked part of Julia's body!! and some nice sentences that waked up the audience and got some laughs. In conclusion, a boring two hours of a wonderful woman (that, by the way, meets a nice and handsome man) who does such a great and noble action so that you cannot say: what a bad movie !!",Erin Brockovich

Put another way, that means that this is about as good a movie as I'll ever expect Julia Roberts to make. It's essentially a vehicle for her, meaning it follows all the rules of a Julia Roberts movie: Julia Roberts will never wear the same outfit twice, Julia gets all the best lines, no other woman in the film will approach Julia Robert's level of attractiveness, etc. Nevertheless, this is an effectively told story with a good supporting cast, especially Aaron Eckhardt, who astounds me with his versatility.

Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were just outstanding in the lead roles. Only criticisms are two: The ""R"" rating for language was much deserved. The movie could have been just as effective if the language was curbed. The firey personality of Erin could have been displayed just as well, and the movie could have been more available to younger audiences, which would be beneficial. It was disappointing to me to see someone of the stature and appeal of Julia Roberts using such crude language and probably 95% of the foul talk was in her script. The only other negative feature was the tiresome politically correct themes that seem to always appear in Hollywood productions, of the bad capitalist corporations, and the strong capable female and weak dependent males. PC was violated, however, with insults hurled at an overweight female character. With these exceptions, it was in the top category of movies I have seen.",Erin Brockovich

I was emotionally involved from beginning to end, BECAUSE it's a true story. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were sublime as Erin and Ed, as was Aaron Eckhart as George.  Marg Helgenberger was amazing as Donna Jensen, the first litigant in the case against PG&E.The families involved were real. Their experiences were real. Erin's sexy, dogged determination was real.  This wasn't the first movie of its kind, and I'm sure it won't the be last.  But the story's message is a very important one. The huge corporation involved is Pacific Gas and Electric. This is an enormous utilities company that serves a large part of California. There are STILL cases pending against them. I think it's a wakeup call to people that the big guys can be wrong, and must be held accountable for it, and that the little ones CAN do something about it.The interwoven love story was very well written, and accurately drove home Erin's conflict between doing right by the families affected by the contamination, and doing right by her own family.I highly recommend this movie; whether you're a Julia fan or not.*Not to mention the fact that now is probably a good time to buy stock in the company that makes the Wonderbra!!",Erin Brockovich

362,The Bear-6,Never mess with anyone that has their back against the wall!,9,25 March 2000,"Erin Brockovich was a hell of a woman and I'm sure she still is. I can only say ""Thank the Good Lord"" that someone had the intelligence to have Julia ( a wonderful actor) Roberts portray such an amazing woman. All the people that gave a negative review of this movie are either blind, passionless, deaf or were attending another movie. Julia Robert's beauty may have gotten her in the door, but watch the hell out after she gets in! There is no one else that could have done a better job in that role. I hear that she made 20 million for the doing the movie, well if I were the studio powers that be, I'd have bumped her another 10! Julia is great, Finny is great and the Movie is great.

364,adunn-3,Very Entertaining -- Great funny one-liners,10,9 April 2000,"I probably wouldn't have gone to see this movie if I hadn't gotten an e-mail (along with all 22,000 other PG&E employees) from Gordon Smith, our beloved (ha!) CEO. I couldn't believe what I was reading. PG&E should have just passed on commenting on this movie...after all, the settlement's a done deal. But Smith had to remind us (as if we don't have a brain in our collective heads) that it 'primarily a vehicle for entertainment'. He goes on to make some extremely lame statements about how PG&E didn't move ""as quickly as it should have to rectify the problem"" but acted in good faith...yada yada yada. Jeez, cut your losses Gordie! Don't make it worse with such lame excuses!That e-mail piqued my interest in the movie. Although rather formulaic and featuring a few too many cardboard characters and scenes, EB is a very enjoyable movie. There are some hilarious one-liners, particularly toward the end of the movie. Unlike some others, I didn't feel the movie was overlong or slowly paced. However, I would have liked to have seen more on the legal issues and less on how poor EB is struggling to keep her personal life together. As it was, the movie completely skips the entire settlement process. In one scene, Roberts and Finney are collectly signatures from plaintiffs to pursue a settlement and in the next, she's telling a woman that the court has awarded her family $5 million.All in all though, definitely worth seeing.Oh, and for those of you who want to flame me for working for the big bad oppressive evil corporate empire, save your breath. PG&E is a massive corporation and I work very far from Hinkley (which, ironically, isn't even in the PG&E service area, though Kettleman Hills is). I currently work in the Vegetation Management Dept. (tree trimming and fire prevention mostly) but used to work in Energy Efficiency (trying to conserve energy and save people money). So I don't think of myself as a captalist running dog lackey, or even as a bad guy...but then, neither did Hitler. All I can say is that I probably enjoyed seeing them stick to PG&E more than you did.",Erin Brockovich
365,chadderbox23,Julia Roberts Best Performance!!,10,17 August 2000,"Yes, Erin Brockovich is your basic run-of-the-mill ""David & Goliath"" story of the lone hero (Julia in this case) who goes up against the evil monster (PG&E). Where this story differs though is simply in the performances and how real it makes the characters seem. You absolutely feel for these people not only because we know it actually happened but also because they make you feel like it's really happening to them. Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date by playing this woman honestly. I'm so glad they didn't try to gloss Erin up by making her seem to good to be true. They simply made her a woman of flesh and blood, good and bad. Kudos for all involved in what is the absolute best film of 2000 so far. Great job!!",Erin Brockovich

The difference between being a victim and a winner, I think it will be an inspiration to many people that struggle in their lives to be strong and go for it. Show them what you're made of.

It lets up the story of a woman called Erin Brockovich, who became the legal assistant of a small law firm in a legal process between a remote California population with serious health problems vs. a huge company of public services, which secretly uses toxic products.
And I love this film because it is able to exhibited the daily debates of the life of an usual woman with 3 children, without job but with all the strong willed to search the resources to survive, and in the middle of this fight, she discovers herself as a pusher, with an extremely ability to connect with the other, with their feelings, maybe empathy is the best word that could describe her.
I met a close relation with this film consequence of my familiar story with warriors women, who sustain the home; and also of my personal story as lawyer and a permanent battle for the justice in our country, against structural powers and companies, which don't know a minimum sense of respect or the meaning of equity, and maybe it is one of the most frightening characteristic that I know.
And I think that the best character selection for this film was Julia Roberts: the dapper as the transmit the sensations, the emotions, the strong and fast-paced personality of the real Erin is incredible; and when you mix it with the self-confident and the thought-provoking clothes that use Julia, you will be catch by this film.",Erin Brockovich

379,ehoule-75801,Great movie with a great story,8,9 June 2021,"Erin Brockovich played an integral role in the fight against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) in an environmental lawsuit despite her lack of legal knowledge prior to the case. Brockovich, a single mother in pursuit of a job to support her family, found herself working in the office of her lawyer as a legal clerk where she first learned about the case. She was an underdog who through her own determination was able to successfully fight for the justice of the people who were affected by PG&E's contamination of Hinkley's water with toxic chromium. This film was enjoyable to watch, not only because of the appeal of an underdog movie, but also because of the fact that it was based on a true story. Erin Brockovich (2000) is a perfect balance between raw drama and biography. The film is heartwarming and raw, but puts you on the edge of your seat at times which keeps it entertaining. The educational aspect of the film was well-complemented by the dramatization of her personal life, making it entertaining to watch without toying with the historical accuracy of the case. The film contained accurate and useful information about environmental law so for those who are interested in environmental law this film is the right choice! While watching the film I learned about the social and environmental impacts harsh chemicals that can come from factories can have. I am glad I watched this film because it has helped me become more informed not only on the 1993 lawsuit, but also on the impact that large companies can have on the environment. This film makes you think about all of the loopholes that companies can go through: How much are these companies getting away with?Julia Roberts, who plays the role of Erin Brockovich, played the role very well. Julia Roberts is known to play some roles that require the portrayal of a lot of raw, blunt emotion. In her role as Erin Brockovich, Roberts is able to illustrate the fire and compassion within Brockovich as she fights to help the people of the town of Hinkley. As a viewer of the film I really believed her performance and could feel how much Brockovich's kids impacted her life at the time. Not only is she passionate about her children, but she is also passionate about a case she learns about while sorting files at her job in a law firm office. I could sympathize with Erin in her pursuit of a job, and could understand even before she truly dug into the case, how passionate she was about helping others. Erin becomes so invested in the case, that she travels in order to get more information than what was written in the files. In the film we see how her passion for advocacy propels her further into the case, and how it impacts other aspects of her life that are not shown as often in the film.As I watched Erin Brockovich (2000) I tried to pick out the parts that I thought were truthful, and the parts that were not truthful. As the film went on I had to remind myself that each crazy aspect of this story happened in real life-- with a few exceptions. Although parts of the film were embellished for the screen, I am confident that the film stayed true to Erin Brockovich's roots and portrayed her story accurately throughout the majority of the film. In fact, after watching the film I was able to fact check many scenes of the film, which I was surprised to find true. This film did a great job at portraying not only Erin's role in the case, but also the vulnerable aspects of Erin's life at the time of the lawsuit. I was so inspired. The relatable nature of the film makes it something that viewers want to see. The story of Erin Brockovich is portrayed in-full. The mundane, personal aspects of the film remind us that Erin Brockovich at the time was a person just like the rest of us, which I found particularly inspiring.This film was dramatic without overwhelming the viewer with action. It was a calming film to watch because of the light-hearted aspects which were weaved in with the dramatic parts that put me on the edge of my seat. As a viewer, I felt relieved by the progress Erin was making throughout the film, and felt for her when there were hard times; a sign that I was truly invested.Seeing the detrimental impacts of what the Pacific Gas and Electric Company did to the town of Hinkley was disheartening, but Eric Brockovich's actions were inspiring. Seeing that someone without an educational law background was able to persist, and be so passionate about something in order to really make a difference in the lives of many people is inspiring and heartwarming.",Erin Brockovich

382,nes_reviewer3_2021_vgorbunova,Clever and brilliant whistleblower with a big heart,8,7 October 2021,"This film is a great opportunity to realize how simple empathy and indifference to people around in our everyday routine may influence and change someone's life for the better. ""Erin Brockovich"" is based on a true story of a young, provocatively looking and irascible woman copes with uncovering devastating actions of a local company.The movie starts with a scene of a car accident which involved a woman - Erin Brockovich. Julia Roberts, as always, did an amazing job in acting and presenting the main character - a divorced single mother of three, provocatively dressed and with no prospects of a stable job, but hard-working, strong-willed and, what is equally important, sympathetic. The first scene brings Erin to a lawyer office in which later on by blackmailing the lawyer (Ed Masry) she starts working. After a while her work boils down to a case of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) planning to purchase the home in Hinkley, California. The most striking feature of the case - it includes medical records of a family from Hinkley. By digging for more information, uncovering legal papers and meeting people from Hinkley, who experienced an irreversible lasting impact of uncontrollably used chromium by the PG&E on their health, Erin Brockovich manages to put together a lawsuit and sounds the alarm of the company's dangerous actions which let all hell break loose and cause PG&E's distress. However, with a help of a lawyer she works for and deep trust from plaintiffs of the lawsuit, Erin successes not only in exposing wrongdoing, but also getting tangible results in helping people such as financial compensation.Finally, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a biopic which raises a problem of whistleblowers and puts an emphasize on sacrifices and challenges they expected to face with and courage they usually have predisposition to which regularly cause social contradictions. In the movie Erin is a woman that generally isn't taken seriously by her employers and colleges. However, it is she who has enough courage and will to make a lasting difference to PG&E's wrongdoing by prioritizing her and her children's peaceful lives over health and happiness of complete strangers. Although the film ends happily, you may think of several examples of the latest whistleblowers who seems to be judged a lot, but their intents and positive effects are not mentioned enough. In such conditions, I am convinced, our attitudes towards such people should be changed in order to focus on the results society gets more than on benefits of interested parties.",Erin Brockovich
383,nes_reviewer3_2021_gilmievalbina,Great story with great Roberts,9,6 October 2021,"Erin Brockovich is a movie that has become iconic over the years. Movie gets viewers' attention by being based on real life events, the famous cast promises a great performance, and the best part is that it does not disappoint and leaves a very warm feeling after watching.Erin Brockovich (portrayed by Julia Roberts) is an unemployed, single mother of 3 with no prospects of a stable job. She is vigorous, decisive and will not shy away from problems. As if she had not enough on her plate, Erin gets injured in a car accident. Trying to get compensation she hires a lawyer Ed Marsy (Albert Finney) who is a partner in a small law firm. The case seems to be an easy triumph, however because of Erin's ability to easily stir up trouble, she ends up without any compensation (which is hard to believe).She gilts Ed into hiring her. As one of the assignments she gets files on a case where Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers to buy a house from a land nearby their manufacturers. Erin gets suspicious and starts her own investigations which provides her with interesting information. It turns out that PS&EC has been polluting the area with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium which has a devastating effect on resident's health.She believes that company has been aware of implications but prioritised profit over people's lives. Erin is determined to expose the wrongdoing, so Ed and her start to act. As they explain to residents that stakes are high, they convince everyone to get on board with pursuing arbitration. Not everything boils down to finding proof that PS&EC knew about chromium exposure and its lasting impact on people's health. Luckily, one of the residents approaches Erin and says that he used to work for PS&EC and was tasked to destroy documents that can be used to confront the company. With those documents PS&EC does not stand a chance in court and is ordered to pay a settlement of more than $300 million.It's hard to tell how much of the movie is true and which parts were added for a dramatic effect. Even though the story is funny, touching and attracts sympathy. Even though it is a movie about a law case, the viewer does not see too many courtroom scenes or legal terms. It tries to show the real people, their lives and problems they faced, something that people in white shirts sitting in skyscrapers have failed to see. Erin's determination to help them wins admiration. However, there are some things that raise questions. Julia Roberts' goes through so many outfits and looks stunning that you may sometimes forget about her life circumstances. But you cannot blame someone for being too pretty, moreover she is incredible in the role. The other thing is how they got required evidence. Watching the movie, I kept thinking that the main reason the former worker gave them documents was to get attention from Erin and be a bigger man in her eyes.Nevertheless, the movie is definitely worth watching especially during those days when you need to renew your faith in people.",Erin Brockovich

Clearly the true story of Erin Brokovich has been given a good dose of the Hollywood treatment here, but I don't know why other people have felt the need to complain about this  it's a mainstream movie with a story and a message that has universal appeal, so why wouldn't you want to sprinkle some of that Hollywood stardust and get as many people into the theaters as possible? All in all, I think the movie might be clichéd in parts but it is funny and heartwarming and it has a great message. It's always inspiring to see that one person really can make a difference, against all of the odds.

The plot is a bit soft and somewhat predictable, but some of the colourful characters in it do provide some entertainment.

389,crosales11,Movie Critique connecting Justice to the Film,9,5 July 2009,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. This film shows what hard work and determination can accomplish. Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a true advocate for justice. Her persistence in trying to achieve justice makes others try to achieve it as well. This film does justice to the issue of mandatory minimums by showing that the ""small"" person can rise up and make things happen. Just like Erin Brockovich, Julie Stewart was someone who rose up to a challenge and has been fighting for its just resolution. Erin was the main character and therefore provided the strength for the film. Her fiery demeanor gets the audience riled up and interested in the film and her cause. The basic plot of the film is that while working at a law firm, Erin tries to win a case concerning a water contamination scandal. Every time you hear victims of the contamination speak about their illnesses, it moves your heart. Some of the victims are even children. One scene that truly portrays Erin's determination is when she climbs down into a well to gather water samples. She is risking a lot by doing this because she could get arrested and the evidence she acquires could become voided. Nevertheless, she evades the men that chase her off the property. After going to PG&E, the water company of the film, she and her family receive a threatening call. If she did not have devotion to justice, Erin could have stopped investigation on this case, but she continued to investigate because of her dedication to bringing justice to the people affected by PG&E. Another compelling scene involves a lawyer, Theresa, and Erin. Theresa insults Erin's work involving the case. She says that Erin had holes in her investigation, but Erin insists that her investigation is more than thorough. Theresa claims that Erin is missing six hundred and some odd telephone numbers, but what she does not know is that Erin is so connected to the case that she memorized all of those numbers. She also memorized all of the illnesses and things that the contaminated water had caused. Erin has formed relationships with the people who were affected by the contamination, and this case became personal to her. Her commitment to justice is just as passionate as Julie Stewart's devotion to bringing mandatory minimum to an end. Erin was just doing her job to try to provide for her family. What she did not know was that she would become so passionate about this issue that she would neglect spending time with her family. She also missed the chance to develop a relationship with a man named George who had been so good with her children. While she was at work he always watched the kids. He eventually left Erin because he could not stand not being able to spend time with her. This multi-million case caused Erin to spend over a year investigating, and she missed her youngest daughter's first words. A very powerful scene is when George goes into detail about her youngest daughter's first word. Erin begins to cry as George sounds so excited about Beth's first word. Erin wanted to bring justice to this case, but in the process, she missed spending time with her family. She had to sacrifice time, and her son began to resent her for that. Near the end, though, Erin's son was able to understand the significance of this case, and he no longer thought that his mother was abandoning him. George also came back. The very end of the film is the scene that best encapsulates the lesson of the story. At the very end of the movie, Erin's boss gives her a very large amount of money, two-million dollars. Her boss at first said that the sum of money that they had both agreed on was inappropriate. Erin thought that he was screwing her over and that he meant he was giving her a lesser amount of money. She begins to yell at him but she stops when she picks up the check he put on her desk. It is a check for two-million dollars, and Erin is speechless. Her boss says that he felt that her work deserved more, and the initial amount proposed was inappropriate. Thus, he gave her more money. She was rewarded for doing justice. The reward for doing justice may not always be material, but highly valuable. With this one case, Erin learned work ethic, perseverance, and along the line, self respect. She gains a sense of self confidence after she works on this case, and she feels that more people respect her as well. Although she lost some time with her family, Erin learned many life lessons. Justice in this film is very apparent through Erin's devotion and connection to her clients. Dedication to justice, perseverance, relationships, and a willingness to help others at all costs allows Erin to close this case and bring justice to her clients.",Erin Brockovich
390,tmessner-849-384717,"Enjoyable, entertaining and motivating for improved social awareness!",9,19 September 2010,"""May contain Spoiler information"" The film is a story about overcoming odds, environmental pollution, and corporate deception. It is also about the persistence and struggles encountered in uncovering and exposing the truth. The central insight of this film pits right against wrong and a huge corporation against a couple individuals. It's the David vs. Goliath of corporate environmental contamination where power and influence are annulled and the truth eventually triumphs. Down on her luck and down to her last dime Erin Brokovich (played by Julia Roberts) a twice divorced single mother of three is involved in an automobile accident which leads to meeting attorney Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney). After losing her case in court and not receiving any type of settlement, Erin basically extorts a job from her attorney Ed Masry. Erin is asked to review some pro –bono files for Masry. While reviewing these files she is puzzled as to why medical records are being kept with real estate files. As she uncovers these answers Erin begins her long and tireless quest becoming the unlikely advocate to the citizens of Hinckley, CA in her epic fight against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) a powerful multinational corporation. Directed by Steven Soderbuergh and written by Susannah Grant this film is based on the true to life story of Erin Brokovich and the landmark case of environmental contamination and corporate cover up. The film focuses on the good vs. evil and the David vs. Goliath struggle where one, down on her luck uneducated girl through her passion, and tireless pursuit of truth, brings down one the country's largest corporations. This film in broad context is similar to other films such as ""The Rain Maker"" ""the entire President's Men"" and ""The Firm"" Where individuals face great struggles as they battle against and overcome insurmountable odds. By using various techniques Soderbuergh builds a relationship with the viewer where it is difficult not to cheer for Erin and her clients. As a viewer we watch the action through an objective view point as the plot develops. Soderbuergh uses a subjective view point in establishing and building the relationship between Erin and her clients. This perspective brings the audience in closer and forces us to experience the intimacy and intensity of each moment. Sounds effects were used effectively to subconsciously instill or associate the feeling of danger and suspense. I believe the music, sounds and editing were all carefully constructed to create a feeling with the viewers to relate to Erin and her clients and build on that desire to see them succeed in the battle. I believe that the film works because the writing, directing and acting is believable which allows us to identify and side with the little man. We want this woman, who has had a hard life to beat the odds and succeed, and we also feel for innocent victims of the town and we hope that they win their battle against their illness and against the evil big corporation.I enjoy this film and would give it 9 out of 10",Erin Brockovich
391,tyjennings55,living a nightmare to living a dream,9,19 September 2010,"Erin Brokovich is a movie based on a true story centered on Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) about how she was living her life as a nightmare to how she was living in a dream that she thought would never happen. Erin was driving her car and got hit by another car and took the man to court. No one in the court house believed her story because they thought she got hit on purpose to get money because she was a single mother that was hurting for money. She went to a law office to get a lawyer who was Ed Masry (Albert Finney). Ed took Erin to court and ended up not winning the case. Erin still was a jobless single mother with three children that could barely afford to pay for her bills and to put food on the table. At this point of her life she was living in her nightmare. She was very determined as the film went along to find a job as of which she did. She demanded that her Ed gave her a job at his law office which he ended up doing. She started at the law office as his ""secretary"" filing his papers away and just doing the normal office job. She really didn't know what she was doing and she really wasn't liked in the law office just because of her attitude. Erin was the best looking lady in the office and offended many of the other women in the office because of her clothing. Erin really didn't get any help from anyone else in the office. While Erin was working full time, her next door neighbor watched her children while she was at work. The next door neighbor ended up moving away and a ""Harley man"" who Erin got a bad vibe from ended up moving into the house next to her. They really didn't get along too well but then became really close as he watched her children while she was at work and pretty much became boyfriend and girlfriend. When Erin was filing papers at work she came upon a lawsuit for the PG&E water plant. Erin got very involve in this case and spent lots of her own time on it. When Erin knew that PG&E was wrong of what they were doing she had to do something about it. Erin did a lot of prospecting around the town where all of these people were sick. She spent a lot of time with mainly this one family. Ed and Erin ended up going to court with PG&E and ended up winning the case. Ed and Erin won millions of dollars with the case and help out the family to pay for their medical bills. Ed ended up giving Erin a huge bonus of 2 million dollars and Erin could not believe it. At this point of the movie this is where Erin began to live her life like it was a dream. She probably would have never thought that she would have ever had this kind of money. Film elements that contributed to the movie were dialogue and motif. The film element dialogue contributes to the theme through characterization. Dialogue is important to the theme of the movie because it shows how Erin was characterized throughout the movie. Dialogue shows what type of character Erin was in the movie by explaining her attitude and her willing to work for what she needed to do to better herself and her family. Motif contributes to the theme of the movie because it has a recurring element that has symbolic significance which would consist of Erin throughout the entire film. Erin would be the recurring element of the film that has a huge symbolic significance in the film.The film showed how Erin was a go for it woman. She was at rock bottom of her life and worked so hard to get to the part of her life to where she thought she was living in a dream.",Erin Brockovich
392,chartson,A Mother Who Fights for What she Believes In,10,20 September 2010,"Erin Brockovich is a film based on the legal wranglings headed by Erin Brockovich representing residents of a California town against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a down on her luck former beauty pageant winner who is a twice divorced mother of three small children. She is trying her best to find a job and put food on the table when she is involved in an automobile accident. Erin hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to represent her in her lawsuit against the other driver. Because of her scantily clad wardrobe and smart mouth she doesn't win the lawsuit but she is able to win a job in Ed's law firm.The first big assignment Erin is assigned is researching a pro bono real estate case. Erin stumbles across medical records in file and begins to dig deeper into the situation as to what the significance of medical records are in a real estate file. She finds out that PG&E has been illegally dumping a very toxic chemical into the town's water system. PG&E had been secretly trying to buy all of the real estate surrounding their plant. Erin ends up meeting numerous people who had become ill because of the contamination. This leads to one of the largest lawsuits against a corporation and ended with a record $333 million reward. Although things work out in the end for Erin, she researches and fights this battle for two years. Missing out on milestones that her own children attain and possibly sabotaging a good relationship.The movie was nominated for over 40 awards in 2000 and 2001, wining approximately half of them. Julia Roberts gave one of her best performances to date playing the sympathetic law firm employee who had the clients' best interest at heart. She was adamant that these citizens needed to be compensated for the lifelong health problems they now have because of the carelessness of a PG&E. The movie shows that there are people who are willing to fight for the rights of others even if their own life is briefly interrupted to do so.Both the lighting and angles give this movie a warm feeling and help you feel like you personally know the characters and the problems they are going through. You can't help but feel sorry for them when you hear their stories and be happy when they finally win their case.If you like movies with the same theme as Erin Brockovich, which is helping others, you may also like A Time to Kill (1996) about a lawyer who puts his family life on hold and in danger to represent an accused murderer. As well as Patch Adams (1998) about a doctor who only wants to help his patients any way necessary much to the dislike of his colleagues.",Erin Brockovich

394,phlebas3,Sort of good,6,4 October 2004,"This film really takes the best out of Julia Roberts: normally an awfully bad actress, she is, in the role of this bitchy, tackily-dressed proud mother-of-three, almost (but not quite) sort of good. The film is also a revelation in that it is the only Julia Roberts film with a somewhat sensible plot: amidst the wan (""Pretty woman""), banal (""Notting Hill"") and thoroughly idiotic (""Sleeping with the enemy"") movies in which we are used to see her, ""Erin Brockovich"" shines like a beacon. Still, there is far too much single-mother act, and far too much shrew-act in this movie for it to be thoroughly enjoyable, or even original. Some details are cute, though, like the abominable bad taste with which the protagonist is systematically dressed; the plot is mildly interesting, but its development is far too legal-oriented (a very common fault in Hollywood movies) while it could be a bit more centered on the human and ecological aspects of having an entire town poisoned by chromium VI. Altogether, this is an educational movie, which people with too much trust in corporate America should see, and which is certainly more interesting than the latest serially produced action movie. But don't expect a classic or anything like that: this is strictly a watch-once film.",Erin Brockovich
395,jadeignacio09,Truly an Award-winning piece!,10,11 October 2014,"I did watched this movie because I dearly love Julia Roberts. I know she does great in every character she portrays and this one really got my attention knowing she gets a lot of awards for this one. I have just watched it today and I'm glad I did. She portrays the character of Erin realistically and with heart. They also add comedy and it's great I really laughed crying. I can say after watching this movie, I am amazed and impressed with what Erin Brockovich did for the people of that small town. It just prove that there's still hope and justice will always prevail and sacrifices she have made for her children is really hard but it pays off in the end.The casting are also great. Albert Finney did a great job too and so were the others. Congratulations to the Director and the staffs for doing a great job. I must say this one is one of my favorite movie. A must have watch movie for that matter. Continue making great movies and God bless!",Erin Brockovich
396,jacksonj-03991,Paying attention to detail can pay off,10,22 March 2015,"Erin Brockovich is a movie based on a true story. Julia Roberts played the part of Erin really well. Erin is the single mother struggling to make ends meet. She's been divorced two times and has three kids. She is in desperate need of a job before she goes bankrupt. She walks into this attorney's office and basically begs for a job. Despite her style of dress and outspoken personality, she gets a job as a file clerk. While performing her job, she stumbles upon some paperwork that seem odd to her and so begins her quest for her investigating work to find out why people are getting sick and why the Gas and Electric Company are paying for their medical bills. Although she is not trained in legal work or has any kind of degree. Erin is very street smart and people actually trust her. She goes on against the biggest company in California and almost brings down the company with the biggest lawsuit in the history of California. The little train that could.The theme of the story is determination. Erin, an uneducated single mother of three. Who needed to go above and beyond in her job in order to retain it so she could pay her bills, was not going to let anyone intimidate her and call her stupid. The more people made fun of her or her work, the more determined she felt. She also had a sense of compassion for the ""little"" people who had been lied to. These people were dying early, kids were having chronic illness all the meanwhile they were being told that there was nothing wrong with the water they were drinking. She felt the need to help represent these people.Julia Robert's role as Erin Brockivich was outstanding. I loved the part where they met with Hinkley's attorney's for PG&E and the main attorney was about to drink the water and Erin tells her that they had brought that specially for them from Hinsley's well and she puts it down and would not have a drink. This tell you that they knew that the chromium was poisonous to people but they were trying to sweep it under the rug. Overall, the movie has a great plot to it. Julia Roberts, witty, trashy, bite me attitude combined with a sense of responsibility to the people of Hinsley and her children make this a movie to remember and makes you want to go out there and make something of yourself and not just push some papers around but really make a difference. It doesn't matter if you have a degree or not.",Erin Brockovich
397,paigeme-53992,One Bad Ass Woman,9,29 May 2015,"I'll admit, even I'm jealous of her. She's blunt, unapologetic, strong willed, independent, hardworking, and maybe a little hotheaded and manipulative. But still, this is one film all the hardcore feminists will want to see. The movie Erin Brockovich chronicles the life of, you've guessed it, Erin Brokovich, played by the amazing and talented Julia Roberts. This drama is based on the true story of Brokovich who, with no legal background of her own, helped win the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit.Erin Brockovich is a hardworking single mother of three young kids living in Southern California. In the opening scene, one sees Brokavich across from what appears to be a doctor. Brokavich explains she has kids and because of them she's learned a lot about medical procedures. Much to no one's surprise, she doesn't land the job. Immediately after she leaves the job interview she gets hit in her car at an intersection. Cue suspense. Well, this movie isn't a suspense film, but with an opening couple of scenes like these, one would hope for some plot twists. However, what really happens is that she ends up losing the personal injury lawsuit that resulted from the crash, which she claims wasn't her fault, and in thousands of dollars of debt, she is desperate for a job. Brockovich ultimately asks her gray-haired lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can offer her a job. He reluctantly gives her work as a file clerk in his office, despite her inappropriate cursing and outfits. During work one day Brockovich runs across some files for a case that was previously filed against the company Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). Brockovich, determined, starts investigating into the cases and visits people in Hinkley, California, to hear the first hand accounts of chrom 6 poisoning. She manipulatively persuades Masry to let her continue to do further research, but in doing so sacrifices spending time with her kids who end up being taken care of by her pseudo boyfriend and once unlucky neighbor George, (Aaron Eckhart). She discovers, however, that the PG&E Company has been purposely poisoning Hinkley's water supply, and covering up the fact that they were illegally doing so. This has what has been threatening the health of the entire community surrounding the plant where hexavalent chromium was found running off from the sites. For those of you people who don't know much about science (don't worry, I'm one of them) hexavalent chromium or (chrom 6) is very harmful to human and animal life. It causes chronic headaches, nosebleeds, bone deterioration, and cancers, all of which were reported by multiple residents of Hinkley. One scene that was heartbreaking was a slow zooming in of a girl around the age of 7 who appears to have cancer due to chrom 6 poisoning. Remembering that this story is based on true events, I can't help to think that this actually happened to someone, let alone a young child. It brought tears to my eyes. Do Brockovich and Masry end up winning the case? Well you'll have to watch all of the 131 minutes in order to find out. That's one downside to the movie- the length. Some scenes tend to draw out, but this movie is about a legal case, and those aren't really an edge-of-your-seat kind of thriller. However, the music complemented the pace of the movie and added suspension to some of the scenes. This movie is also rated R because of the foul language, so parents, don't let your kids watch this movie. But if you're a cool Mom, have your daughters watch this movie when they are teenagers and tell them that even they too can become something awesome like Brockovich. But don't teach them that using their cleavage, like she does in the movie, to persuade men is appropriate. Another reason this movie didn't get a full 10 stars is because there just wasn't enough romance. Maybe the writers (Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant) and the director (Steven Soderbergh) wanted to focus more on the full legal story than on Brockovich's romance with George. But as a sucker for good romance films, I wish there was more steamy scenes, if you know what I mean. The directors tried adding some more chemistry scenes between Brockovich and George but it still wasn't enough, at least for me. I wouldn't label this movie as a comedy either; the scenes are too intense to bring one even remotely close to a laugh. The movie in its entirety, however, was very well written and flowed nicely between scenes, adding to the fluidity of the film. Erin Brockovich herself makes an appearance in the movie as the waiter Julia in one of the first opening scenes. It is reported that the real Erin Brockovich sold the rights to her story to Universal Studios for a sum of $100,000. That's a lot of money, but given all that she sacrificed, she deserves it. Whether or not some of the details of her life, like the fact that she was Miss Wichita or actually used her cleavage to get what she wanted, is true or not, Julia Roberts does an outstanding job playing this role, which she even won an Oscar for. Ultimately, this is a film you'll want to see. If you like strong female roles, you'll love Erin Brockovich. Ed Masry says during a scene when Erin Brockovich is the last one at work along with himself, ""You're a girl. Why aren't you out to lunch with the other girls?"" She responds, ""I guess I'm not the right kind."" This statement pretty much sums up the kind of person Miss Brockovich is, in real life and as portrayed by Julia Roberts. This movie will give you the confidence boost you might need, cause I know it did that for me.",Erin Brockovich
398,sgrewe-84422,"Courage, Devotion and Feminine Mystique",8,5 June 2015,"Based on a true story of tenacity and humble beginnings, this film follows Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in her stiletto-clad stumble through the challenges of scraping by to pay bills, raising her children and catering to the whims of whiny boyfriends. It is clear from the beginning what a haphazard balancing act Brockovich's life is, opening on her painfully awkward attempts to make a good impression through an unsuccessful job interview, where we learn that she is an unemployed single mother of three. Wallowing in her defeat only long enough to smoke a single cigarette, she makes her way back to her old orange car, which has since acquired a parking ticket, and almost predictably is T-boned at an intersection minutes after leaving.The ways in which life is stacked against Brockovich are revealed gradually through her meeting with a lawyer in order to sue the driver that hit her, and later the disastrous cross examination in which her fiery temper and colorful diction cost her the jury's sympathy and her chances of winning any reparations for her pain and suffering. In her impatience at the defense lawyer's suggestion that she saw his wealthy client as an opportunity to capitalize on a lawsuit, it is clear that she is familiar with the ways in which power dynamics sway to favor the opposite of everything she embodies. Now confronted with the failure of her lawsuit, Brockovich is set back further than before, and forced to be even more driven and resourceful in her methods of obtaining her next paycheck. In this desperation, she turns back to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), demanding a job at the law firm in a grand show of shouting and refusal to leave, expressing that he owes her something for false promises and the failed lawsuit that left her in even more debt. When it becomes clear that Brockovich will not take no for an answer, Masry offers her a position as a file clerk. It is in the midst of this tedious paperwork that she discovers suspicious details of what was supposed to be a simple real estate case, which sends her on an investigation of a scheme bigger than she could have imagined.While the film was inspired by the story of how Brockovich investigates the ethics of the insidious corporation Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and touches on the intricate workings of the legal system, its strength lies in how deeply it appeals to the viewer's emotion, strategically taking the time to zero in on the struggles Brockovich faces in her personal life in order to humanize her, when on the job her abrasive personality could otherwise be off-putting. In the face of poverty, motherhood and romantic entanglements, it is clear how she grew to project a tough exterior for the sake of survival.Brockovich's home life is one device used often to make her more accessible to the audience, revealing the tension with her young children over the long hours she must work, and her dilemma between helping the families she represents in her case or focusing on her own family. A defining moment illustrating the struggle she faces as a mother is in an argument with her boyfriend (Aaron Eckhart), who feels that he is being neglected for her work and taking too much responsibility in caring for her children. In a decision rarely made in fictional stories, Brockovich chooses to prioritize her work over her romantic relationship, a powerful choice challenging the familiar trope of a woman realizing that love is more important than her ambition. This is a powerful, pivotal moment in the film.This film is more impressive than most in its portrayal of womanhood, Brockovich embodying a conglomeration of qualities which fictional accounts rarely conflate. It should not be groundbreaking to present a strong and intelligent female character who also has children and on top of this wears short skirts and high heels, but few other films with this type of character come to mind. And perhaps it is solely for the sake of remaining faithful to the true story on which this is based that her character was created with such dimension. Unfortunately, the other female characters in this film are disappointingly pigeonholed into familiar roles, deliberately contrasting with Brockovich in myriad ways only as a means to further glorify her and set her apart. There are the other women at the law firm who are mostly frumpy and overweight, and seem to regard Brockovich negatively based only on her fashion sense or out of envy. This reproduces the familiar but apocryphal idea that women are in constant competition with one another rather than being allies. There are the victimized clients she helps: rural, married and ignorant mothers who play the sympathetic characters. Then there is the other female lawyer, who, in spite of being on her side of the case, is portrayed as uptight and snobbish, unsuccessful in her attempts to connect with the working class community that the firm represents.This is the story of an underdog, a representative of a stigmatized group in our society: a single mother, twice divorced, and poor. Above all of this, she is unapologetic in her femininity, refusing to be shamed for her opinions, clothing choices or pursuit of justice. Although it has its weaknesses in succumbing to an uncomfortable number of clichés, the film weaves a heartfelt tale of determination and navigating the gray areas between work and personal life as a woman. I am confident that anyone more emotional than me (read: anyone) would have minimal critique of this evocative combination of comedy and drama, which culminates to a tear-jerking resolution, even more impactful given the fact that it is based on true events. In spite of a few shortcomings and my own nitpicking critiques, I would rate this film highly and recommend it.",Erin Brockovich
399,bazantovaa,"Very detailed review, contains many spoilers!",9,9 May 2016,"Erin Brockovich is a movie based on real life affair that takes time in the 90' s, but the occurrence of the movie can still happen today.. After watching first few minutes of the movie, you don't really know how can this character, Erin, be one of the biggest icons in civil rights. Erin is a struggling single mother of three little kids, one of them is only a few months old. She tries to get a job, but she's declined after the doctor who needs an assistant finds out about. her background. On the way back home from the interview, she is involved in a car accident where she gets hurt and both her and the other car are seriously damaged. She tries to sue the other person involved, because they made the mistake, but she loses the case. She starts working for a lawyer who lost the case and this job is what changes her life forever. She's not a lawyer, she doesn't have a college degree, but she's naturally intelligent which makes her very popular with the clients.. While cleaning the storage room in the office, Erin finds an odd combination of documents and that's where the whole main part of the movie starts. She discovers that a huge American company is selling people dangerous water that seriously affects health and can lead to deadly illnesses. By physical contact, honesty, and forwardness, Erin gets the whole neighborhood to fight against the company. Her boss, an old average lawyer is doing the case with her, because Erin isn't real lawyer, she doesn't know the whole trial process and all the legal necessities. Later on, when the issue gets bigger and the amount of money they could get gets significantly higher, he gives the case to a much more skilled lawyer, who has more finances and is from bigger company. The new lawyer and his partner don't really give the people in the damaged neighborhood much chance and they don't have as much commitment as Erin, who's deeply hurt by losing the case to the better lawyer. The whole case almost falls apart, the affected people don't like the treatment they are getting from the new lawyers nor from the water company that's trying to get them quiet by buying their properties. At the last minute, Erin and her boss are able to get the people back on their side by being honest and fair to them and in the end, they make the impossible possible and win. The case was settled for US$333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. The main reason why Erin and all the neighbors won was because the water company couldn't refute the evidence of knowing about the issue. The company knew for years and made their old employees burn and hide all the incriminating documents. Erin got her hands on them because of a retired employee, whose brother died of cancer after living in the contaminated neighborhood for several years. The water company went bankrupt shortly after their lost because more issues from different areas came to the surface. The company's violation against civil right was so severe that there wasn't any way out for them. Personally, I think that this movie amazingly shows how normal Erin is. Erin's nobody special, low class single mother and twice divorced. The movie is really great at combining her personal life, work and showing her character. One thing that I liked the most is that she did not change. She never liked lawyers before she worked in a law firm, she didn't like them when she was working there as a normal secretary and she still did not like them after winning the case and being a partner. She stays herself even after winning a huge civil rights case. The neighborhood that had dangerous water was not informed about the chromium in it because the water company was manipulating them. They wanted to buy their houses, but for very low price, and their lectures on chromium were a huge propaganda. If anybody in the area got an analysis of the water and found chromium, they would think it's the good kind they were told about, not the extremely dangerous one and wouldn't try to get more into the topic. The doctors the company provided were bribed to say that the chromium does not have an affect on the illnesses the neighbors kept getting. They knew how dangerous this type of chromium was and they kept it a secret, violating a civil right of public awareness and basically a censorship. This movie definitely proves its point and they did a great job at remaking a real story about legal issue, while still being funny and very interesting. What started as every other romantic comedy changed into a movie where you have to think so you don't get lost in the information. It also touches several civil rights topics, from public information to gender equality. The second one is mainly presented by Erin and her personal life, in which she has to go through many struggles to prove that she matters and has a voice.",Erin Brockovich

Because it's poignant, funny, touching, moving and a true story. Julia Roberts hits every note and makes her character accessible to all. I truly feel I understand who Erin Brokovich is and what a daring, amazing person she is.

401,cherryvanilla-45790,Badass Brockovich,8,1 June 2016,"Erin Brockovich, played by Actress Julia Roberts, is an unemployed single mother of three who finds herself with her hands even fuller when she gets T-boned at an intersection on her way home from yet another unsuccessful job interview in North Hollywood. Although her lawyer, Ed Masry, is confident that she will win the case against the careless driver, their optimism turns to disappointment when the jury decides that this foul-mouthed divorcée was just trying to make a quick buck. This seemingly inconvenient event will ultimately propel her into the launch of her career, despite never having any formal education, or a job for that matter. Despite Erin's abrasive wit and eclectic wardrobe, she eventually lands a job with her former lawyer who introduces her to the world of fax machines and file cabinets. All the while, after having a run of bad luck with a couple of babysitters, her three young children are now being taken care of by George; the hunky bearded biker from next door. These relationships continue to unfold throughout the film. Erin's intuition and curiosity leads her to begin unravelling what was at first a dispute between a small family in Hinkley and the monstrous monopoly that is PG&E. After much investigation, Erin attempts to expose what could be one of the largest crimes of health and environmental negligence committed by a company to date. In the midst of chaos, she tries to find a balance between being a mother, a lover, and an appropriate employee all while attempting to find justice in a sea of corrupt companies and tedious judicial systems. Her astounding work ethic and ability to think on her feet is ultimately her only ammo in the unthinkable battle that precedes her. Set in Southern California, the Rom Com Drama based on a true story alternates between glitzy Los Angeles and the dull, barren desert of Hinkley. Julia Robert's ability to portray Erin as a beautiful, bad ass, and yet somehow still relatable character is the driving force of the film. Her and Ed, who is played by Albert Finney, create an unlikely yet incredible duo who will have you cheering from the sidelines. Erin's selflessness, sass, and zeal creates a character that anyone would root for, and the exposure of PG&E's negligence creates a very qualified antagonist. Her love interest, George adds another element to the plot, showing Erin's sweet and feminine side. The ups and downs of Erin's personal life parallel those of the Hinkley case, creating an even more enticing story line. Overall, Erin and the people of Hinkley's battle against the giant corporation PG&E, resembles the classic David and Goliath plot line. This real life story of one company's carelessness that lead to the suffering of an entire town, is one that will make you laugh, cry, and even get a little angry. Erin plays the hero that we all strive to be, and so much more. The great acting, character development, and riveting plot line followed by a great overall theme and message is why I chose to give the film a high rating. However, this isn't necessarily a movie I could watch over and over again, as it doesn't leave much speculation or mystery. Nonetheless, it is a great movie that is most definitely worth watching.",Erin Brockovich
402,lkaplans,"Pretty good, would recommend to watch once, but not something to obsess over.",7,1 June 2016,"Although filmed sixteen years ago, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was and is the modern day ""badass"" persona that every woman secretly has dwelling inside of her. No filter for her language or sense of professional style, Erin is headstrong, determined, self-motivated, and frankly could not care less about the opinions of others. Based on a true story, I would give the film 3.5 stars and describe it as a drama comedy. Set in Los Angles and Hickley, California, Erin serves as both an inspiration and real life story of the American dream, motivating the viewers that with passion and hard work, anything can be achieved. Erin's cry for financial desperation and her unique sense of humor is portrayed in the opening scene of the film where she is applying to a medical job that she clearly has no experience in, but this shows how much Erin is unafraid of rejection and humiliation. Erin's strong confidence stems from her ability to have raised three children without the support of a man, and it is her confidence that allows her to poke her nose where most people wouldn't dare to. Erin's life is shown as a plummeting spiral that one can do nothing but empathize with or simply laugh at- Erin has no income, three young children, no money in her bank account, a neck brace, and an attitude that has got her nothing but trouble. Simple activities like feeding her children or even just being in the house are over intensified because Erin is so dissatisfied with her life. Erin finally lands a job in Ed Masry's (Albert Finney) office, which is the first positive change in her soon to be completely different life. She seems out of place and disliked, but that doesn't stop her from earning her place of respect. Erin's relationship with Masry turns from disgust and hatred to a fulfilling, meaningful friendship while also being business partners. Erin's stance for her originality and blunt difference from the other personas in the movie is what makes her such a fascinating protagonist. Even when Masry asks her to rethink her wardrobe, Erin shoots back at him with ""maybe you should rethink your ties."" A love interest occurs, like in all Hollywood dramas, but her boldness aids her in shooting down the bearded biker neighbor by the name of George (Aaron Eckhart) that would like to be more than just neighbors, even though love is the last thing on Erin's mind. Her bluntness is what makes her such an attention grabber and has people listen to what she has to say even though she has no formal professional schooling and acts far from how an employee would act in a law firm. Erin stumbles upon the records of Donna Jensen, who lives in Hinkley, and is perplexed as to why Donna's medical records are included in her real estate files. Finding this odd and unsettling, Erin takes this task into her own hands. Erin's personal search for Donna turns into something more than just completing her regular reception job, it becomes a passionate obsession that Erin is determined to get to the bottom of. Erin sets out to determine the significance and relevance of the medical records that were correlated with other real estate files. It's not obvious what exactly ignited the passion and concern in Erin to set out on her own to investigate these random real estate files, but this curiosity begins a long journey to attempt to provide justice to the residence of a small town in Hinkley, California. With the help of her wit and feminine beauty, Erin is able to dig through the water records of a notorious company by the name of PG & E, which may have something to do with the health of the residences surrounding the town of Hickley.As Erin's care for the families of Hickley grows deeper, her own personal life becomes more significant, fulfilling, and mature. Erin develops a deep and true care for the lives and well being of these people, no longer for a need of financial desperation, but for a need to do good unto others that have been unluckily touched by the illegal doings of big money companies. Erin gets to know the residences of Hickley on a far personal level and induces pathos in the audience. The film is not a full five star rating because although it's interesting it is just not a film that I would re-watch years from now or highly recommend to a friend. Although, it does accurately depict and raise awareness to the true events that happened in Hickley, there were many parts that caused me to be disengaged. Overall, the film is much more dramatic than the average documentary but allows the audience to be inspired by the determination of Erin Brockovich to do what's right while also improving her life.",Erin Brockovich
403,joepanger,Erin Brockovich: When Self-Preservation Leads to Passion,10,4 June 2016,"What happens when you mix a struggling, single mother of three, an accident, and a lawyer together? Well, you get Erin Brockovich. A film written by Susannah Grant and directed by Steven Soderbergh, this is an Oscar-winning biographical drama that is based on a portion of the life of Erin Brockovich, a woman that has dealt with unemployment, poverty, and just plain bad luck. Erin lives in Hinkley, California, a small town located between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada. That is where she and her three children live on the fringes of poverty in a small house located in a suburban neighborhood. To exacerbate an already unfortunate situation, one day, after Erin leaves an unsuccessful job interview, she gets into an accident, suffering damages to herself as well as her car. To add to her frustrations, her appointed lawyer, Ed Masry, is unsuccessful in winning her settlement case. After a heated confrontation with Mr. Masry in his office, Erin comes out of there with a job as a legal clerk for Mr. Masry. Her employment under Mr. Masry eventually leads her on a unwitting path to fight for justice against PG&E, an electric/utility giant. In the film, Brockovich is tasked by Mr. Masry to look into a case where the plaintiffs were suing PG&E for damages due to groundwater contamination caused by dumping waste-water which contaminated neighboring water supplies. As the film progresses, more and more victims of PG&E's contamination come forward and join Brockovich to fight against the giant. Although this film is a biographical drama, I would also suggest to Mr. Soderbergh that this is one of the best documentaries I've seen. You may ask: ""What are you talking about? This isn't a documentary! This isn't even close to a documentary."" Well, I'll have to stop you there. Although the film is captured in a dramatic way, the focus of the movie is not the drama, rather, the events. The film detailed the conditions that not only the protagonist, Brockovich was faced with, but those affected by PG&E, as well. Erin Brockovich was able to create a more powerful message that not only addressed environmental awareness but also corporate greed. One thing I liked about the film was that it wasn't littered with special effects or over-the-top dramatic music. Films that are considered documentaries nowadays are usually chalk-full of propagandic editing and loaded questions. This is especially prevalent in environmental documentaries. This type of documentary usually leads viewers to one conclusion: that corporations are bad, and the environment is dying. Overflowing with dramatic music and cut-offs, those kinds of films, to me, should be considered dramas, not Erin Brockovich. Erin Brockovich is able to make viewers aware of those issues, and more. Grant and Soderbergh immerse the viewer into the movie by giving a context for which many viewers can connect to or sympathize with: a single mom that has nothing but a few dollars, 3 mouths to feed, and a wild personality. She is split into many directions, and her personality is what gets her into as well as out of sticky situations. By introducing us to Erin, a mother, a foundation for connections are established with the viewer. They also introduce realistic conflict into the movie. In addition to her struggles for employment, Soderbergh includes a romantic relationship that the real Brockovich had with a neighbor, named George. Even after she eventually pulls her and her family out of near destitution, she is faced with the task of balancing her passion for her work with time spent with her family and George. Chasing her work would mean putting everything else on the sidelines. Spending time with family would mean that precious time would be lost in the fight against PG&E. Even as she works to repair her relationship with George and her kids, Erin has created a connection to those that were affected by the groundwater contamination. The issue then is where to focus her humanity. Should she sacrifice her family's happiness, potentially ruining her relationship with her kids for good, so that she is able to attempt to save or at least ameliorate the hundreds of lives that have been affected by PG&E? By introducing these aspects, Soderbergh gives a more realistic view of our society as humans, rather than the clips of starving African children you see in every other documentary. I think the addition of these elements keep the viewer more glued to their screens compared to typical documentaries, which try way too hard to grab your attention. Erin Brockovich, aside from the comparisons, is an excellent standalone film. Its unique story line/situation makes the film memorable. Its inclusion of the real Erin Brockovich in the beginning gives the viewer an impression of what the real deal was like, and what the dress, mannerisms, and vulgar language amalgamate into. His seemingly accurate portrayal of Brockovich greatly contributed to the film's intensity as a biography. Soderbergh's film, to me, is a 5-star (10/10) movie. It's incorporation of realness is what clinches the 5th star. Erin's situation was a very unique and rare occurrence. Her strife to survive in life led to successes and failures. Her fortunate chance to work in Ed Masry's office established a previously unknown passion about something that may have never crossed her mind: the environment. It is through random luck that history is made. History is not a set prophecy. Story lines are constantly being created, however, many go unacknowledged. Erin Brockovich created that story, and Soderbergh acknowledged it.",Erin Brockovich
404,kassandracobarruvias,Erin Brockovich is a riveting film about a woman who goes against a powerful corporation to bring justice to those who were harmed.,9,7 June 2016,"Erin Brockovich Saves the DayErin Brockovich is a riveting film that will have you rooting for the underdog and hating large corporations that are out to get the little guys. This plot has been done many times before and in many instances, it has failed but not in this case. The film stars Julia Roberts as the protagonist of this film, Erin Brockovich. This film also stars Albert Finney as Ed Masry and Aaron Eckhart as George, who is Brockovich's love interest in this film. This film is based on a true story about a brave woman who goes against a huge corporation to pursue justice for others. Erin Brockovich is a single mother trying to raise her three kids. The opening scene of the film shows Brockovich desperately looking for a job so she can support her children and she ends up in a car accident. Jobless, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry into giving her a job at his firm. While working at the firm she begins to look into a real estate case involving Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E). She finds out PG&E is trying to secretly buy land that is contaminated by toxic hexavalent chromium, which they have disposed of incorrectly and has now affected the people living in Hinkley, California. The inhabitants of Hinkley are unaware that the land has been exposed to this dangerous chemical and think the company is solely trying to buy their homes. She decides to go to Hinkley and begins to question some of the people she read about in the files. As she talks to the residents, she digs deeper into what is actually occurring in the small town of Hinkley. She investigates further and soon Brockovich and Masry are involved in the biggest class action lawsuit case in American history against the powerful PG&E. Erin Brockovich is an inspirational film that will inspire you to do great things for the environment. She's a single mother of three, who without any formal education decides to go after a large multi-billion dollar corporation to help bring justice to those affected by the contamination of water in Hinkley. She was able to obtain the job in the law firm due to her tenacity as she convinced her lawyer to give it to her, which to me, says a lot about her character and how driven she is, which will help her as the film progresses. Despite her financial situation not being great, she still chose to help the people of Hinkley. This was a truly admirable act because she was fighting for a much greater cause. Even though she was not a lawyer, she was still an important asset in this case. I feel this helped the people of Hinkley trust her and bridge the gap between the lawyers and the clients. She was able to help the residents of Hinkley understand what was going on with the case in a way that they would understand. I think Julia Roberts did an exceptional job as Erin Brockovich. She was able to really connect with the character and it showed in her acting. This is a biographical film and I think it is vital that the writers don't stray too far from the truth and this film achieved just that. The costumes used in the film were great and helped bring a point across. The fact that she is working in a law firm brings a certain image to mind when it comes to the type of clothing you imagine employees wear and the clothes she wore were the exact opposite of that. Her clothes helped her stand out from the women in the law firm who wore pant suits and looked down on Brockovich because of her clothing choices. Even though the other workers were uncomfortable with the type of clothes she wore she did not succumb to their wills and she kept on dressing the way she wanted to. This action may seem insignificant but it really shows her refusal to conform to societal norms. The plot in the film is intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end because I wanted to know what the outcome of the case was going to be. Throughout the movie, you can't help but root for her and want her to succeed. She's a single mother going against a huge corporation because they did the people of Hinkley wrong. This really helps play on the emotions of the viewer. While watching the film I found this to be an admirable quality of hers. While there is an underlying romance in the film, it is not the main focus. The directors do an excellent job at not taking away from the plot and the story that is being told. I would highly recommend this film. The acting is phenomenal and the plot keeps you wanting more. After watching the film, it got me questioning the trust we put in the people that provide us with water. I'm sure there are many cases around the world similar to this and I think it is a topic that should be discussed more. This film really highlighted Brockovich's many admirable qualities and it inspired me. She was just one person who happened to stumble upon this case but that did not stop her from further investigating the situation and doing the right thing. The fact that she did not go to law school and yet achieved something great serves as an inspiration to us all. I think we all have something to learn from Erin Brockovich and we should continue to fight for things we believe in.",Erin Brockovich
405,ktapia-04277,Brockovich keepin it real,8,7 June 2017,"The movie starts with a man's words on a black screen, the next frame shifts and focuses on Julia Roberts beautiful face heavy with baby blue eye shadow and big voluminous hair. You almost believe you're watching Pretty Woman, but you'd be mistaken! Julia Roberts is Erin Brockovich in the biographical movie directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by Susannah Grant. This movie tells the story of the people from Hinkley, California in the San Bernardino County and how Erin Brockovich unlocked the secret to Hinkley's many unfortunate health issues. The story of Erin Brockovich is by far an interesting one. It is a story about a strong, motivated, and driven woman who never took no for an answer. Erin Brockovich is a single mother of three who has been kicked down and hit with misfortune after misfortune. After leaving a disappointing and discouraging job interview, Erin gets hit by a rich asshole zooming through a red light. Seeking compensation from the reckless driver, she ends up in Ed Masry's office in search of lawyer. My 8/10 rating stems from the great performances done by the actors, the amazing wardrobe and costume department, and the great directing. It is no secret that a good movie and a good director go hand in hand. Director Steven Soderbergh did a fantastic job at creating a film that depicted Erin Brockovichs' life and the Hinkley Water Crisis on screen in an easy going and realistic manner. The characters were likable unlike other ""underdogs"" that annoy the audience because we just know things would work out for them eventually. I was rooting for Erin and I was rooting for Hinkley.",Erin Brockovich
