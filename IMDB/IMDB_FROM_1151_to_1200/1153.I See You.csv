0,SnoopyStyle,one twist too far,7,23 January 2020,"Another kid has gone missing in a sleepy bedroom community. Police detective Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) investigates. His psychiatrist wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) starts sensing strange happenings. Their teenage son is angered by her infidelity.I like the spooky mood which fits nicely with the icy coldness within the family. The phrogging is an intriguing reveal. I'm good with the second point of view. Then the reveals keep happening and it probably goes one too far. There is no need to bring in the missing boys. The last reveal has no foundation. Also Mindy has to be the last to confront the husband. Alec could come upon them and he's the one to get shot while she escapes. It would maintain the danger since she's the one who witnesses everything. Once she's dead, the man has no reason to believe that there is another person. Alec only knows that he killed Mindy. The movie is a terrific Hitchcockian thriller for the first two thirds. The ending has a few minor issues.",I See You
1,kosmasp,Hidden evil,9,7 February 2020,"If you can overcome how Helen Hunt is looking (Botox is my guess without researching it), the movie has a lot to offer. And just because she looks bloated, there is still some acting behind it all. But what really is the driving force behind the movie is the story and structure/edit of it all.You may be weirded out when certain things get shown again (from a slightly different perspective), but you will see (no pun intended), that it does make sense! It's well told and acted and it has a few surprises along the way that really elevate the movie quite a lot.",I See You
2,Sleepin_Dragon,A very good watch.,8,29 August 2020,"This is a very entertaining, clever thriller.I would class this as an intelligent piece of writing, somehow it's a thriller within a thriller, it has a jigsaw feel to it, you will watch it and have many questions, how, what and who. Those questions will be answered as the film progresses, the intensity also increases, it is very satisfying.What starts out as a relatively mild thriller soon morphs into something a lot darker, it goes through phases, ending as a very dark, twisted thriller.Nicely acted, Helen Hunt does a good job, but all the cast are good.It's a fine watch. 8/10.",I See You
3,Coventry,And I see... a plastic version of the once-ravishing Helen Hunt?!?,6,10 April 2021,"Whatever happened to Helen Hunt? She was one of the greatest actresses of the 90s and early 2000s, thanks to ""Mad About You"" and a couple of glorious film roles like ""As Good as it Gets"" and ""What Woman Want"". And - moreover - she was a natural and charismatic beauty! Unfortunately, it's a commonly known fact that Hollywood hardly has interesting film roles for strong and talented women over forty. This is the first time I've seen her act again in almost 20 years, and sadly you can't but immediately notice her plastic surgery, or facial Botox-treatments, or whatever it was. It's a real shame, and even quite painful, because she can't even depict emotions or different facial expressions anymore with her plastic face. But hey, if that is what Mrs. Hunt wanted, fine then. And I'm only here to review the movie ""I See You"", anyways.Speaking of which, it's praiseworthy - to say the least - that a film can alter my perception/opinion so drastically throughout its running time! Honestly, my overall thought of ""I See You"" during the first half was just a big giant ""meh"". Via a lot of pretentious but cheap tricks, like ominous music and short & abruptly edited interior shots, the inexperienced director Adam Randall too obviously tries to generate an ambiance of mystery and ambiguity, but it doesn't really work. In the house of the Harpers, a middle-aged couple with a rebellious teenage son and a giant martial crisis, there appears to be a strange supernatural entity at work. Meanwhile, the rest of the village is concerned with the disappearance of yet another young boy in the neighborhood. Halfway through, however, the same string of events is told again, but from a completely different and explicatory angle. This makes the film change from a seemingly dull supernatural horror movie into a raw and gritty survival thriller.I must admit that, even though I've seen and reviewed more than 4000 horror/cult movies already, I didn't see the principal twist coming at all. Some of the other plot twists are more obvious and used before, but the story idea that clarifies the missing silverware, locked closet doors, etc., is very clever, innovative and effectively disturbing.Surely Helen Hunt must have been very impressed when she first read the scenario, but I bet you couldn't tell by the expression on her face!",I See You
4,deloudelouvain,Great twists and turns.,8,22 January 2020,"I See You, categorized in the Crime/Drama/Horror genre, I would add the Mystery genre to that as the strength of this movie is definitely the surprise factor, the very clever twists and turns make this thriller more than enjoyable to watch. It's one of those movies you think you will figure it out to be completely surprised by the end. Very good job from writer Devon Graye. As for the directing Adam Randall maybe should have used creepier sound effects to make it even better but overall it's a good job. The cast was good as well, Helen Hunt can still act but what a transformation after all those years of absence, she didn't age very well but that doesn't effect her acting skills so it doesn't really matter. I See You is a pleasant surprise for this genre, better than expected. I would just ignore the negative reviews, they clearly don't have a clue when it's about a movie with suspense and clever story development. Definitely a movie I could watch again in the future.",I See You
5,DKosty123,Well Scripted Acted Directed,8,18 May 2020,"I see there is some young writing talent out here. This script is not the orthodox one and in fact it is written in a layer form. The film starts out and does everything in order up until a certain point in the story with the main characters. Then it restarts the entire story using a different set of characters point of view and shows us viewers what is really happening. The way to enjoy this film is to watch the first part, and try to guess what is really going on. Then expect to be wrong on some parts when you get to the second layer. It is darned entertaining to do it this way.I think it falls short of perfect in 2 places. First- the music theme tries to imitate John Carpenter's Halloween but this new theme is way over done. I think if the music was toned down or even lost it would be a more effective film. Second - spoiler- there is a point where a character named Alec is left alone in a garage for a long time. Logically with everything that has already happened most folks would have not sat there and waited for anyone to return to the house. Logically, they would have gotten the heck out of there and possibly gone to the authorities. That would spoil one dramatic scene, so I guess that is why it's not done.As far as the acting, Helen Hunt is fine though her role is limited in some ways. It is a fairly large cast so I can understand that her role is a lead, but she is not -spoiler- the action lead- so she really only has a handful of scenes. Judah Lewis as her son is the same way, his acting is fine but he has little action so his role, like Hunt's is a bit limited. Jon Tenney as Hunts Detective husband is excellent and he is one of the major roles in the entire film because his role is totally involved.Libe Barer plays Mindy very well and she is heavily involved in the story, though only in the second part of the film. Owen Teague as Alec is more involved in the second half and is very good too. Spoiler - the second half gets into certain clues visually which you see in the first half if your attentive. When watching this movie for the first time, pay attention to the clues, and then see how they turn out. That makes this a solid entertaining film.",I See You
6,Edvis-1997,8,8,16 May 2020,"Very well played. Nice movie I was thinking that this will be lame spiritual movie about ghosts and etc. but when they've revealed everything wow, nice job, my top 10 best movie of 2019.",I See You
7,851222,Original and good,8,15 July 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""I See You"" (2019) had a pretty original story which is rare these days. I did not see any trailers nor i read synopsis before watching it, so this movies plot was a really pleasant surprise for me. Its a good thriller with no winners and i will leave it at there. The only downside for me was Helen Hunt - the Oscar winning actress i actually like very much - she was amazing in anything she done in 90's - ""Twister"" (still a good guilty pleasure), the amazing ""As Good as It Gets"" - i like this actress but in this movie she was very stiff and wooden - whether she was miscast or it was a disappointing performance.Overall, ""I See You"" is a good mystery thriller with an original plot. The less you know about this movie the better it will be for you.",I See You
8,westsideschl,Mish·Mash,4,20 February 2020,"First sign of cheap, & used a lot in this movie, are lots of drone type overhead views of streets, houses, country side. Second sign, is the really poor quality audio where the speaking voices seem echoey, and at times out of sync with the actual speaking mouth. Also out of place & almost disconcerting was the background music & sound effects - didn't fit the storyline. Viewer made to think we have a haunting w/the usual electronics turning on/off.
Acting was as poor as our home invasion/kidnapping/dysfunctional family disjointed script.",I See You
9,nairtejas,Gripping,8,7 May 2021,"I See You is a gripping tale that brings together a family of three, the law enforcement, and some strange beings that first gives you a feeling of horror but then later takes a virulent turn to shock and impress you as you stay invested in the plot till the very end, only supported by the arresting background score. Best watched in a home theatre. Also, I learned about a new concept here.",I See You

11,Thanos_Alfie,Surprisingly good...,6,26 July 2020,"""I See You"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a detective trying to find a missing young boy while he and his family starting experiencing some strange events at their house.I liked this movie because it had a simple but very interesting plot with some plot twists that I did not expect and made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Adam Randall was good and he did an excellent job without using any unnecessary jump scares that could lower the quality of his movie. I also have to admit that I was surprised with the very good interpretation of Helen Hunt who played as Jackie Harper and she was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Owen Teague's who played as Alec, Jon Tenney's who played as Greg Harper and Libe Barer's who played as Mindy. Finally, I have to say that ""I See You"" is a nice crime movie and not a horror movie so, if you want to watch a classic horror movie then you should watch another movie and not this one. I recommend this movie because it feels very real and I am sure that you will feel it too, after watching it.",I See You
12,RosanaBotafogo,Magnificent...,9,25 April 2021,"Wow, quite a movie, it starts enigmatic, it becomes a drama, it probes the terror, but it flows into an excellent police suspense, with excellent plot twist, intelligent script, almost everything fits perfectly (except for the boy flying from the bike and the window broken), everything that hypnotizes us, and an outcome that revolts us, however fair, magnificent...",I See You
13,jtindahouse,If you're patient with this film it will reward you,8,4 January 2020,"The opening scene of 'I see You' is an interesting one. It implies a supernatural element to the film and consequently made me lose interest for a little while. In hindsight it's a really clever and well executed scene that I can appreciate. And that's the thing about this movie. Everything is about hindsight, and I love that. I love a movie that presents something seemingly bizarre and then explains itself. The problem with that is that the audience has to be patient through the first half of the film. It requires trust and in the modern world of terrible films that can be a tough thing to give to a film. However if you do use patience with 'I see You' you will have a great time.It was hard to tell early on just how dark the film was going to be. I knew it had an R rating so there had to be more going on than initially met the eye. The film tends to get darker and darker as it goes along and reveals itself. There's a concept used in this film that I can't reveal because it would be a spoiler, however it is starting to be used more and more in films. It's a really creepy idea because it could happen to anyone and could even be happening to you right now without you knowing. 'I See You' puts its own twist on it and does it a little differently which I liked, but it's just another element to this film that works extremely well.I love it when horror movies gets things right. 'I See You' is a well crafted little film, that is well worth your time and almost demands a second viewing afterwards to fully appreciate it. This is one not to be missed.",I See You
14,kevin_robbins,This movie is absolutely brilliant and impressive in every way.,10,10 May 2021,"I See You (2019) is a stupid good movie available for free on Amazon Prime. There are severally tightly woven storylines in this pictures - one around people who sneak into peoples homes after scouting it for sometime and sleeping inside without the residents knowing. Another storyline focuses on a tumultuous relationship that involves infidelity, and a third storyline about missing children. How these pieces of the puzzle fit together is brilliant. This movie is directed by Adam Randall (iBoy) on a $3,000,000 budget and stars Helen Hunt (Twister), Jon Tenney (Tombstone), Judah Lewis (The Babysitter: Killer Queen) and Owen Teague (IT). This movie is absolutely brilliant and impressive in every way. The storyline reminded me of The Outsider HBO television series in terms of the look and feel. The pace of this series is outstanding in terms of how they fit together and the intensity at the end. This is an absolute must see and one of my more recent favorite films. I'd score this a 9-9.5/10.",I See You
15,kwenchow,Another worst horror film! Too slow and bored! Even the twisting ending can't save this film! Not recommended!,1,2 January 2020,"This film start with a little girl buying an ice-cream, a boy riding a bicycle and ejected from his seat, a woman ""Jackie"" cooking and her son ""Connor"" talk with her, she went away, and her son talk with her husband ""Greg"" scene! As turnout, this film is about a pedophile police officer ""Greg"" kidnap a bunch of innocent kids in a caravan, a man who break into his house(Alec) eventually expose his crime! Entire film quite slow and bored! The background music in the film also super annoying! Barely intense scene is at the ending of the film! Alec found out Greg is the kidnapper, and Greg also kill his friend ""Mindy""! Alec kill Greg with his gun! Detective ""Spitzky"" arrive and shot at Alec, but Alec survive! This scene a bit bloody! At the end, Alec tell Spitzky all the truth about Greg! The missing kids eventually save by the police, and Alec sent into an ambulance! That's it! Another boring film!",I See You
16,henry8-3,I See You,6,31 August 2020,"Amidst the background of a hunt for missing boys, a detective and his family are plagued by strange events at their house.Beautifully and imaginatively photographed, it is difficult to determine until the end of the film quite whether this is a thriller or a horror film. It certainly features elements of both, but continues to twist, turn and generally sidestep the audience. It got to a stage where I was content that I'd 'got it' and 20 minutes later I realised I hadn't - in fact the twists keep coming until practically the final frame. I think perhaps some of the performances needed a bit more work to bring out the mystery further, but this is a small quibble in what was a very pleasant surprise - worth catching.",I See You
17,dar0417,Getting Lots of Praise,6,24 June 2020,Getting lots of praise and the film was pretty good but more of a mystery than a horror film. Great acting and a lot of fun and good twist but to me just another abduction story.,I See You
18,yusufpiskin,Wastin my Time,3,13 December 2019,The family drama that went on for about 45 minutes or so was painful. The phrogging part was at least a distraction and made more sense by the end. The psycho killer part was pretty good thriller material and the twisty turny part just made me dizzy. The highlight for me was a pretty darn good score.,I See You
19,kirbylee70-599-526179,MASTERFUL MYSTERY,9,9 March 2020,"I love a good mystery. The problem I have with most though is that I've seen so many I tend to figure them out before the final moments of the film. So when one comes along that catches me completely off guard it becomes one that I want people to know about. I SEE YOU is one of those films.The movie is actually divided into two parts, the second half reflecting on the first. It's fall in a small town and the people are frightened for their children when a young teen goes missing. Det. Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is the lead detective on the case, a case with few clues. But that's not the only issue Harper is dealing with.There is problems at home as well. Harper's wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) was cheating on him and they're trying to make things work. His son Connor (Judah Lewis) is resentful of his mother's indiscretion and holds her responsible for the falling apart of their family. Every effort she makes to try and correct things he tosses back in her face.The ""have you seen"" posters are placed around town and the search for the boy continues. When Harper and his partner Spitzky (Gregory Alan Williams) go back over the crime scene they discover something they missed the first time around. It's a green pocket knife and references a previous crime they worked years ago. Could that same killer have returned?As the case moves forward strange things begin happening in the Harper home. And entire drawer of silverware disappears. Noises are heard. Windows are found open. Then the worst of it all happens when Jackie's lover shows up trying to convince her to run away with him. Leaving him in the garage when she goes to answer the door, someone kills him. Is there something supernatural involved here? Or could it be something else. Time for a spoiler alert if you don't want to know.This is where the movie shifts gears as Connor reads a text screen that asks him if he's ever heard of phrogging. If, like me, you haven't I'm sure your hitting your cell phone now to look it up. Phrogging is when perpetrators, mostly teens, sneak into a home and attempt to live there without the knowledge of the home owner. It's a way to have a place to stay and to get some sort of thrill.Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague) are two such teens who have placed themselves in the Harper home, hiding out when they are home and wandering around when they're gone. These are the two responsible for the mysterious goings on. But it gets better. Alec is one to push things to the edge while Mindy plays it safe. Could it be that Alec plans on taking things even further than Mindy expects?This plot twists is mesmerizing and director Adam Randall uses a deft touch to bring it all about. Using up perhaps two thirds of the films short 96 minute running time he crafts the story to fit a certain mold, a horror film if you will involving what are potentially spooks gone wild. And then like Hitchcock did when he altered the story of a secretary stealing money into a serial killer in PSYCHO, the movie changes into something completely different. Quite an accomplishment for only a second film from Randall.Screenwriter Devon Graye is now someone I want to watch. An actor with 53 films under his built this is the first one he's written. He's done a magnificent job for his first time out. The characters are believable and ones we come to care for. We wonder if perhaps Jackie is losing her mind. Or is there something supernatural? Or is it the phroggers? Or could it be something else entirely?Hunt doesn't make that many movies these days and it was a pleasure to see her back in a role she handles with ease. It looks like she's making a return to acting after several years away and that's a good thing to happen. Tenney is an actor who's been overlooked for too long. He too does a great job here. And all of the young actors on hand also turn in performances that are exceptional, something we rarely see from teens on film.To my knowledge this film played in few if any theaters and that's a shame. I've seen bigger budgeted films with more hoopla upon their release that didn't compare to this one. For me I know it's one I can not only recommend heartily but could sit and watch more than once looking for those tiny details I might have missed the first time around. For now I would tell any and all that this film makes a great viewing night and suggest you rent it when you can.",I See You
20,Pairic,Mixed Tropes Horror Thriller,7,30 August 2020,"I See You: A film of mixed tropes - child abduction, domestic disharmony and intruders living secretly in a house. A detective (Jon Tenney) is investigating the disappearance of a boy which may be linked to old cases. His wife (Helen Hunt) is having an affair and her paramour becomes involved in strange events which occur in the house. Throw in a surly son (Judah Lewis) and you have a natural suspect for the oddities. But this movie is even stranger as twist after twist occurs and we see the same events unfold from several different perspectives. Nothing is quite as it seems. Some shocking and violent scenes but the tension is mostly maintained through the use of psychological horror. Maybe the film has one plot turn too many for it's own good but I See You is well worth watching. Directed by Adam Randall from a screenplay by Devon Graye. On Netflix. 7/10.",I See You
21,andrewchristianjr,NICE TWISTS.,8,14 February 2021,"Good murder thriller with some nice twists. Seems obvious at first but it keeps you guessing. The only problem for me is the motives of the child abductor are never explained. Just out of the blue the character is revealed, and yet we have zero idea why the crimes were committed. There is also serious marital conflict in the family, but yet again, no background for the precipitating acts.",I See You
22,ks-60500,When things go to,6,10 June 2020,"When think about the mysterious part of supernatural, it's just too powerful those spirits can do. It links me up to many ghost stories ever watched.

23,aidanratesmovies,A Wonderful Surprise,10,17 July 2020,"Incredibly unique, thrilling, and with some truly twisted and original storytelling- I See You is certainly an unexpected scary delight that I am glad I had the chance to see (no pun intended). The acting in it is actually very good for a horror film, and though I wouldn't explicitly call it a horror film (more of a thriller), it does have its genuinely frightening moments. Helen Hunt, Owen Teague, and Jon Tenney give some fantastic performances throughout the film, as well as the rest of the supporting cast also giving it their all. The film may seem to completely change about halfway through, as a large majority of that second half can seem very different from the first half, but surprisingly, I See You is not only able to tie its loose ends together, but also brilliantly weave two very different plot lines into one story. Its direction is surprisingly solid, and its script quite brilliant and unique. I have never quite seen a film like I See You or at the very least, a film told the way it was like I See You and I am honestly very impressed at the fact they were able to pull off such a frightening, suspenseful, and interesting thriller with it being so simple. In the end, I See You is definitely an underappreciated indie flick that I encourage anyone to see. It may feel uneven at times, but more often than not, it is a quite interesting, and very well crafted flick that I wouldn't mind watching again.
My Rating: 9.5/10",I See You
24,questl-18592,I See Garbage,3,18 October 2020,"This weirdly reminds me of Full Metal Jacket. Not in a sense of quality so much as that one half of the movie is substantially better than the other.The latter portion of this movie is actually per fascinating and I would've loved a movie that actually followed through and maintained that level of intrigue from beginning to end.Unfortunately, the first two thirds of this is an absolute nightmare of disjointed events, underwhelming performances and sloppy technique. Everything is such nonsense at first and it takes to long to really explain anything. By the time the movie actually kicks into gear I'm so annoyed and bored that it's just not good enough.For as much as I didn't enjoy this, I could see some people not having the issues I did. If the beginning doesn't drag you down as fast then the ending doesn't have as much ground to make up. I still wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it, but if you wanna check it out, be prepared for a very slow start.",I See You

26,begob,Ms Hunt to the Intensive Care Unit,7,28 April 2020,"During an investigation of the disappearance of a local boy, the detective on the case finds disturbances in his home life getting in the way.Interesting movie, but kinda heavy handed. The opening brings us to small town America, and I was just settling in, checking the sound, the camera work, the location, when ... Whoa! What was that? A very odd introduction to a mysterious world that from thereon drips with tension and menace.The music especially is unsettling, even using timpani drums to give a sense of occult malevolence. And then ... a great big switcheroo! The pace had been a bit of a drag up to that point, but the plot puts its skates on to get us to the climax through clever story telling. Is it contrived? I guess, but it is worth piecing the whole thing together in the end.The acting is good, but there is one odd feature others have remarked on: what's happened to Helen Hunt? Her face really does have as much expression as a burn victim, and there's one shot where the cinematographer fully exploits its dead fleshiness while she's sitting in a car. Don't ask me.Overall: heavy thriller, a bit overcomplex.",I See You

29,omendata,Clever Thriller With More Than Meets The Eye,7,23 June 2020,"This just shows that you do not need a multi million dollar budget and what you can do for a meagre 3 million dollars.Although the film builds itself up with clever scenes and sound effects to be a horror the film is actually a cleverly constructed thriller and it succeeds in its modest budget tenfold.First off the acting is decent, photography is well crafted and it is written very cleverly to reveal the story slowly almost with spoilers all the way. Helen Hunt is fantastic as always but oh my what has she done with her latest plastic surgery, I do have to admit that seeing her now it is quite disturbing as she looks like Mason Verger from the movie Hannibal so disastrous is the plastic surgery she had in 2009 that it does actually impinge on her acting now and distracts the viewer every time you see her as she actually looks like she has had horror movie makeup and latex fitted to make her look unworldly - how very sad that such once beautiful and talented actresses such as Hunt have to do this to keep up in Hollywood - what is wrong with growing old gracefully but for me it does distract your attention in almost every close up scene she is in.I digress however, the movie itself is well paced and thought out and the ending is masterful. I wonder how many people got the little scene at the end intimating that Alec was indeed the child who escaped from the serial killer at the beginning of the film and that was his reason for Phrogging the house as he wanted to exact revenge on the Serial killer who had killed his friends. It is little things like this that make this film a better than average thriller, even the scene where the little boy is mysteriously pulled into the air from his bike seemingly by an evil ghost/spirit to draw the viewer in when in fact it was actually just a tripwire - magic!But what elevates this film above the usual is the superlative music and sound effects reminiscent of the recent Stephen King series The Outsider and which lends itself to making the film seem like a horror movie rather than the thriller which it is - my advice on this one is if you have 5.1 surround then turn it up to the max; pure cinematic ingenuity so this one gets very good 7/10 hatchets.",I See You

This is most certainly not a horror, but it might take a while to see that. I won't divulge the story, but it gets very good.

34,IonicBreezeMachine,A solid enough thriller that stretches its credability a bit further than it should witha few twists too many,7,5 September 2020,"I See You is a solid suspenseful thriller that keeps you engaged from the beginning thanks to its unsettling mood, committed performances, and multiple story threads that keep you engaged with the mystery behind what's going on.The film follows the Harper family consisting of counselor Jackie(Helen Hunt) Detective Greg (Jon Tenney) and son Connor (Judah Lewis) who are dealing with their own personal inner turmoil following Jackie's extramarital affair. Connor is openly angry while Greg is more aloof and this creates engaging and downright uncomfortable interactions that brings adds to the already present tension. Adding to the conflicts is the investigation of a child abductor that Greg is investigating that has eerie similarities to a case from the past. Meanwhile strange occurrences happen within the Harper household that test the already strained family unit.One can't discuss anything beyond the set up because this movie is very much built upon its twists and for the most part they do work. However there are elements that do strain credibility in just how perfectly aligned certain story elements need to be in order for events later in the movie to transpire as they do. Without giving too much away the direction we're shown in the opening is revealed to have been a misdirection and we're instead taken down another direction, and then another, and then another one in the last 15 minutes. Its usage of twists and misdirection do work in the moment, but they do not hold up to much scrutiny after the movie ends.I See You is an effective thriller with an engaging mystery, haunting mood and atmosphere, and committed performances, but it stumbles later in the story due to building itself upon a few too many twists. But because it does keep you engaged I do recommend it.",I See You

Yeah, there are many reviews that say Helen Hunt now looks like Caitlyn Jenner complete with a face so tight you can bounce a volleyball off it. Personally, I just think she gave all her hard earned cash to the wrong plastic surgeon and perhaps should've seen the ones responsible for Michael Jackson's transfiguration. Looks aside, ""I See You"" is actually worth your time because of its wholly original way of telling a story. I won't say how because that'd be spoiling all your fun.

But, the overall storytelling was lacking. I don't want to be spoon fed material, but at the same time, this movie leaves a few details vague and that ultimately detracts from the overall impact of the film.

51,johannes2000-1,"Involving and original, very cleverly made thriller.",9,24 October 2020,"This movie was a real surprise! The premise is quite original, with a very intelligent story and direction. There are some major plot-shifts, the first one tilts the whole previous story like 180 degrees and the movie then repeats all the previous scenes but now from the perspective of this new knowledge, which produces some surprising new insights. A second plot-shift pushes you off your feet again, and in the very end there's yet another, that more or less ties the remaining loose ends together. So you don't end up frustrated with some open ending (like in so many other movies) but get a real satisfying closure.The acting is over-all fine, with trusted forces Helen Hunt and Jon Tenney as the central characters. My only reservation concerns Helen Hunt's looks, there seems something weird amiss with her face, I guess her character is supposed to be like 40 something, but she looks here like she's seventy, which doesn't make it very probable that her character is supposed to have had a stormy love-affair with a good-looking guy of about 40.

56,danielmanson,Not a bad thriller. Few too many flaws,6,31 August 2020,"Ok, so I love a good thriller so when I saw this trending on Netflix I thought I had to give it a go. And as the title suggests it's not bad at all. But the issues I'll illustrate below is what stops it being a 7/10 or higher, real solid movie.Characters were underdeveloped massively. The mother and son in this story served little to no purpose throughout and you forget they even exist after the midway point. The ""villain"" aka the person who you find out has been kidnapping these kids, doesn't give you a reason as to why. And yeah, none of the characters are likeable due to the lack of depth on them all.So I think the story is told pretty well on the whole, it's done different and it works. You watch this story unfold from one point of view, then the other. It also has 2 storylines to follow. My only issue with this is that, after the 45 min mark, it basically bins off one of storylines and then comes back to it with 10 mins left. This leaves the ending a little anti-climatic for me. Same for that huge ""twist"". It was just too anti-climatic and lost that emotion.I know I've just slated the film, but on the whole it's well worth watching.

66,TwistedContent,Flawed but Admirably Constructed and Atmospheric Indie Horror,7,7 December 2019,"Once again it was the trailer that got me all excited for ""I See You"" (poster's also cool), somehow I was anticipating a horror movie that'd feel like a hybrid of Blumhouse and A24 (to clarify, the movie's produced by an entirely different studio) - I could smell the potential in the air. Now I've seen it & I'm mostly impressed in unexpected ways, but the more I dwell on it, the more critical thinking starts to point things out.I was wrong though, ""I See You"" feels much more like Blumhouse than A24. ""I See You"" is particularly interesting and feels fresher because of two reasons, its twisty script structure & the eerie atmosphere, driven by creative cinematography and an original score that does indeed remind me of the horror movies from A24. It'd be hard to speak of the plot, harder than usual, because the story is shaped by two or (arguably) three major twists. Before we get to that, I also want to compliment all the actors for doing a terrific job, although I didn't like one of the key characters/performances much - Alec, portrayed by Owen Teague. I don't know why, it was oddly hard to accept him. As I previously mentioned, major props to the cinematographer, as well as to the composer - top notch design on all levels, both are important driving forces of ""I See You"". Back to the script - it's admirably constructed, highly effortful story with twists that shift the plot greatly. While that seems to be this flicks secret weapon, I also deem it a flaw in the process. The turns, while getting set up, explained and shifted again, take time and pacing suffers a bit at times. That's the least of it though. It feels as if ""I See You"" is multiple movies in one and the consequence is that it never finds its real ground. The tricks are effective, but drawn out and helped greatly by movies technical factors and overall tone, basically, some of the tricks in use are cheap in disguise.""I See You"" is more than just enjoyable horror movie with nice touches of crime and family drama genre elements, it's technically and aesthetically amazingly done & is awfully ambitious, playing out lots of elements - a third of them work, a third of them feel questionable and another third of them could've been excluded.

A young boy goes missing, and the detective assigned the case must deal with it, as well as problems at home. This is a very subtle piece. We're not too sure what is going on at home, but know that the wife (Helen Hunt) has committed a betrayal of some sort. The son hates her, and the father/detective just sneaks about the house and sleeps on the couch. To add to this stress, weird things are happening in the house. Stuff is going missing, amongst other strange occurrences. Is it supernatural? Is it somehow linked to the missing boy? Then we get to the halfway point and the sudden revelation makes things very interesting, and I was reminded of 2017's sleeper-hit horror ""Hangman"" (If you've seen that, you may guess what is going on here). Then there is another sudden twist and revelation and things are fired up nicely... but then there is another, at the end, and it just completely sinks the film. Overall, excellent, brooding score, good performances and a strong, uncomfortable atmosphere, which makes this review from me all the more negative because the film ultimately becomes entangled it itself and strikes for a cliched, overdone and predictable pay-off at the end.

73,movieman6-413-929510,I See You has a messy story and is promoted a bit wrong.,5,9 June 2020,"I See You is a new mystery thriller movie directed by Adam Randall, the director of iBoy and Level Up.In the film, a 10-year-old boy goes missing without a trace. Detective Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is busy investigating what happened to the missing boy. The only link he knows to make is that this case looks a lot like an equal, unsolved missing case from ten years ago. Greg is too busy with the case, so he has little rest. He didn't get much rest after discovering that his wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) was having a secret affair. For example, there has been a restless atmosphere in their household for some time. Jackie also claims to hear strange noises when she is alone in the house and often loses things. For example, Greg begins to wonder if there is a link between the strange things that are happening in his house and the missing boy, or if Jackie is starting to lose her mind.This movie is promoted a bit wrong with the trailers of the movie, so you expect that there is a more supernatural something behind the story of the movie. The same problem also happened with the film The Village by director M. Night Shyamalan. Another problem with this movie is the script written by Devon Graye. This is only the first film script he has written in which he tries to put all his twists side by side, but he has forgotten to pay close attention to the details of his own script. For example, the revelations of the film happen a bit too precisely at the end, so that they ultimately do not seem really credible anymore.The acting is done well by most of the cast, but due to the somewhat messy script, they do not all come out equally well. This movie is not her best acting for Helen Hunt. Her character also looks a bit confused, so as a viewer you can not always follow what she is doing. The best acting in this movie comes from Gregory Alan Williams, who plays Jon Tenney his police partner. Unfortunately, he only has a small part in this film.",I See You

The mother, Jackie (Helen Hunt) is a psychologist, the father, Greg (Jon Tenney) is a policeman. The relationship between them is not going well at all and this is reflected in the behavior of Connor, his teenage son (Judah Lewis). On the other hand, Greg is in charge of investigating the disappearance of a minor in a case reminiscent of others that occurred 10 years ago, whose culprit is in prison. But some inexplicable events begin to happen in the house ...All of this would seem to indicate the starting point of one of those good thrillers or horror movies based on a good family drama. But unfortunately it is not like that.Adam Randall's is one of those typical films based on a concept and the narrative and genre twists that it entails. In this case it is about the change of point of view and the new information that this provides to the viewer. But a good idea is not enough to make a good movie. In the first place, the characters do not develop and become mere pieces in the staging of a narrative chess. But the main problem is that the script presents numerous forcings, implausibilities and loopholes (see spoiler area below) that spoil a proposal that was interesting, perhaps in order to sustain the impact of the surprise it causes on the viewer.Anyway, the film (in short, more a thriller than a horror one), while accumulating inconsistencies, achieves moments of good suspense and shows an elegant staging, with an effective soundtrack at times to shore up the weakness of the story.",I See You

82,quaseprovisorio,Meh. the second half uses lame explanations in order for this film to work.,5,19 April 2020,"First: it forces the viewer to see this as a ""mystery"" movie since the beggining. I mean the first shots, the light, the music...it's like... you don't even see the characters and already know ""oh..they want us to believe this is a scary or dark flick"". it's forcing us to believe that.second: the mystery itself it's not that well explained, because they put all these strange happenings in the house. it's like ""oh we have a crime case going here, but that doesn't matter, look at all those noises, and the music, and the forks and stuff!"" i would prefer more a movie mystery honestly.third: the second half. it's a bit of disappointment when you understand what's going on. They spend such a long time explaining all of that, giving an unnecessary perspective about what's really going on... the only thing that can surprise you is to understand who killed helen hunt's lover. from then on you easily guess who that kid is and what type of person is hunt's husband. i think the progging thing it's a lame excuse, because it's unknown to a lot of people. they shouldn't call it frogging, just someone occupying their house.i mean...it's not all bad, the movie progresses well, you're engaged mostly in the first half, the pieces kinda are well together... but when you use a resource to explain most of the happenings that most people are not familiar with, you're using an excuse to mske your film work. you could even have people occupying the house, without calling them phrogging. might be only that guy wanted to terrorize for revenge, and that would be ok.and i wouldn't occupy so much screen time with those two tenagers honestly. the movie would benefit to be more like the first part when it was a pretty watchable thriller. it's no awful but nothing special.",I See You

84,CabbageCustard,Interesting movie but stupid ending,6,14 August 2021,"This movie will hold your attention throughout, as you try and work out exactly what is happening. I don't want to ruin it for the viewer by giving away the clever plot device which more or less divides the movie into two parts. Once you work out what is happening you will be quite intrigued. Pity then, that originality ruined by a stupid, pointless, illogical and unnecessary plot twist at the end which you may see coming well before it arrives. It suddenly piles a lot of plot holes onto an otherwise clever and intriguing movie. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it certainly detracts from its overall impact.The cast all do a good job. I haven't seen Helen Hunt in a movie for quite some time and I honestly didn't recognise her. Was that the fault of the make up department; has she just aged poorly; or has she had cosmetic surgery that didn't go as planned? I don't know, but whatever it was, I was surprised by her appearance.Bottom line with this movie, it is well worth a watch, even with its disappointing ending.",I See You

Interesting film though, a little predictable if you're familiar with the formula but still fun.",I See You
86,peeedeee-94281,Had potential but chooses style over substance,3,2 January 2021,"I saw all the positive reviews (as well as the negative) and had an open mind with it. My first impression was that the director tried way too hard to establish atmosphere with the overly loud, moody music, brooding shots, over and over again. It was like it was trying to be It Follows but cranked up 200%.
The infidelity angle felt shoe horned in there when you think about it after finishing the flick. It was overly done, the screaming, arguing. After a while, it was just getting annoying.
Now the twists. I understand that the director wanted to establish half of the movie, then reveal the new POV in the second half as a twist. I didn't get the concept of living in another person's house WHILE they were still home. I did a google search and see it's been done in real life. I think of it more as being a Parasite than a 'Phrog'. I guess using the latter name is meant to diminish the negativity of the act. I already figured out early on that the house was targeted, so there was an agenda by one of the Phroggers. It wasn't clear what their relationship was, though. Were they romantic, just friends, or did they team up via some website like couch surfing.
The problems with the movie: Well, besides what I mentioned, I definitely found Helen Hunt distracting. She looked like an 80 year old who had just gotten the 'alien deluxe' face lift. Or was that due to some bad CGI filtering?
The husband is a cop, and yet sleeps through an intruder STANDING on his bed, and taking a leak all over him?!!
How did the cop husband know the secret lover was at the home? And why didn't the girl escape from the home during the time the cop husband left the house and before the mother returned from dropping the son off at school? Then the husband shows up again, soon after? I may need to rewatch that again, it was confusing how much time passed.
How did the police know where to find the tied up boys? The only person who knew the location of that trailer was the girl, and she was dead, as was the kidnapper.
I did figure out after a while that the guy who picked the house was a victim, but I was under the impression the kids shown in flashback walking on the tracks included that crazy guy in the shack in the backyard. And why didn't that guy ID the kidnapper already since he survived?! And that's what's really odd overall, two surviving victims who know the serial killer/kidnapper, but neither of them spoke to law enforcement to say who it was?!
So while I appreciate the attempt to build a suspenseful twist plot, the holes just make it a less rewarding viewing experience by the end. And showing the movie from the second POV just felt like we had watched only half a film, that was repeated. All of that could have been done via a montage of less than a few minutes.",I See You
87,Otkon,Watch it at least twice. Because it is two movies in one.,9,29 May 2020,"This movie came out of nowhere. And I really had no expectations. I was a bit apprehensive when I saw Helen Hunt's name in the cast. But honestly, her expressionless face works in selling her part in a very complex story. A story that even if you think you got at the end, I will tell you the movie's even bigger secret up front:It was no accident or coincidence that Alec was in that house. You see, right when the movie turns from what you think is a supernatural thriller into the actual story, Mindy literally tells you that Alec, who is from the town while she is not, picked the house. Why this house? Because he knows who lives there. And the resurgence in the kidnappings has triggered his memories. We know from the end that he was one of the two earlier victims who escaped the man in the ""house in the trees"". We also know that the experience really traumatized the other boy. Watch Greg's reaction during that scene. On the second viewing, it becomes something entirely different. And then we are cleverly led away from the subplot of the two surviving boys which helps set up the ending.Also on a subsequent viewing, you understand Alec's motivation for
what he is doing inside the house. We know the initial kidnapping really messed up Tommy so it is not that unbelievable that Alec has become also equally unhinged. And this explains why Alec stalks Greg in the house. He watches him obsessively. He trashes his photos. He literally marks Greg in his bed. Alec is out for revenge by mentally and physically torturing his childhood kidnapper. It is also very likely he is in the house looking for evidence like the pocketknives.During the climax when Greg tries to explain his criminal reasoning, he is so readily dismissed by Alec because Greg and Alec have already been acquainted for 15 years. Alec is there on a mission and has no need to empathize with the monster who ruined his innocence and youth. And then Alec as he lies wounded on the kitchen floor gives us the signal that he knows and remembers the other detective who alone interviewed him and Tommy all those years ago by calling out Det. Spitzky's name.And then the flashback ending that we were teased about and made to forget finally reveals itself. And while we already know that Greg is the villain of this story, we learn ultimately who Alec really is.But what triggered Greg's return to child abduction that in turn triggered Alec's revenge? Well, it is highly likely that Jackie's infidelity leading to Greg's feelings of masculine inadequacy and Connor's rebellion pushed him. He briefly tries to blame some events of his youth before Alec shoots him. Neglect, abuse, divorce, even the enuresis - hallmarks of a serial abductor/killer in training.This movie is so very well-constructed and layered. It really is quite something. Beautifully plotted, shot, acted. It is far deeper than it seems. Well-done indeed.",I See You
88,jdring2007,cop-out twist that should be in the synopsis; yawn alert,3,27 March 2020,"It's been a while since I've utterly misjudged a movie and wasted nearly 2 hours of my life in the process. This movie has 3 twists, the 1st of which is revealed less than 30min into the movie and thus should be part of the synopsis. What starts off as an intriguing mystery/suspense with great eerie music and buildup turns out to be about phroggers/squatters. One of them is crazy. If I'd known this I'd never have clicked ""play."" Oh and the husband is the killer; expected about halfway through. The final twist, which any remotely intelligent person could see from a miiiile away, is that the crazy phrogger is one of the two boys from the beginning. Lame revenge plot! Yawn alert.

It's a decently well done thriller with some great directing.So the thing that really got me into this movie was the directing, some may love it, some may not. But I did and it kept me hooked throughout. Similarly the cinematography was great.Though the movie felt contrived and somewhat odd overall. I didn't like the first half at all, it felt intentionally confusing and just had odd edits in general. The second half, when it comes together, is a lot better. But still suffers from some plot holes.The music is not that great, not the quality, but the quantity, almost every scene has this suspenseful music without it even being a scary scene. It just made the actual thrilling moments much less intense.The acting is good overall, the dialog not so much. Overall the dialog was just a bit of a slog to get through. That said, Helen Hunt... felt disturbing and off looking throughout the movie and not really sure what to think about that.The script, which aside from the directing is the main thing that carries this does it pretty well.

100,eelen-seth,Twisted! - intoscreens.com,7,29 June 2020,"Strange occurrences plague small town detective Greg Harper and his family as he investigates the disappearance of a young boy. 'I See You' keeps twisting its story to keep you on the edge, until the shocking ending reveals the Harper family's secrets and a decade old unsolved mystery that will make your jaw drop to the floor.What seems like a peaceful small town at first, actually hides a dark secret of missing children. When a boy goes missing in the woods, detective Harper (Jon Tenney - True Detective) and his partner Spitzky (Gregory Alan Williams - Greenleaf) get put on the case, they discover connections to a similar missing person's report from a decade ago. At home, Harper's family is dealing with their own setbacks, with wife Jackie's (Helen Hunt - Mad About You) infidelity being the main cause of this seemingly perfect family's tribulations. Son Connor (Judah Lewis - The Christmas Chronicles) isn't handling the news very well, and strange things start happening all around the house.More than once we get to see the house as if we're flying over it, or when we slide through the halls of this lavish seaside mansion. Philipp Blaubach's (Gunpowder) stylish cinematography is so smooth, using every location to its full potential, with some interesting angles in the second half of the film. Photos and mugs go missing, the television switches on at random times and duvets get pulled from unaware sleeping inhabitants. With an eerie score, composed by William Arcane, the mood goes from dark to pitch black in nano-seconds to drive up the tension even more.What really works in Adam Randall's (iBoy) newest film is the element of surprise. The film starts of a mystery-suspense thriller hinting at the supernatural, but dives deeper when it flips the film upside down halfway through. First time screenwriter Devon Graye has come up with a clever and well constructed script that leaves breadcrumbs from the very start to hint at events later on in the film. Is Jackie losing her mind? And is the family really in danger?! This doesn't just make 'I See You's mystery fun for the viewer in guessing what exactly causes these bizarre occurrences, but Graye also succeeds by turning the story into some sort of whodunnit, which isn't an easy thing to pull off.As far as acting goes, Hunt is surprisingly under utilized in the film, but is the biggest name to attract an audience into seeing the film. Her character is nuanced, but it definitely would've been nice to explore the guilt that visibly devours her from the inside. Lewis, who plays Hunt's son in the film, is growing into a versatile talented young actor who's getting ready for a huge breakthrough in mainstream media.Nothing is what it seems, but one thing is for sure - 'I See You' is best experienced when you don't know too much about its premise.",I See You
101,iamtherobotman,Disappointing after a promising start.,4,27 August 2020,"The first half of the film is good, it builds a bit of tension along the way. Is thioe ocurrances supernatural or are they going to be easily explained?
The acting is decent, though is let down badly by Hunt, whom has never been a very good actor.
Then we hit the second act, where its explained to us blatantly what's been going on the whole time, which ok, wasn't the worst idea in the world but i feel it coud've been handled in a more subtle way, certain character just seem to do stupid things for no reason and really, that whole trope is tiring now. Of course the stupid actions lead to them getting into danger needlessly.
The film then swings again into the third act and playes through to a conclusion from the perspective of the father.

104,chi_town_fed,First two-thirds are painfully slow. Great premise. Sub-par writing and direction.,6,14 December 2019,"Worth watching, but definitely not a ""10"" by any stretch of the imagination. I could go as high as a ""7"" as it depends on one's mood at the time they watch this film. Some may view this as a ""3"" ""4"" or ""5"".The writing and direction reminds me of one of the M. Night Shyamalan films. There are some subplots that are not flushed out well. A couple of people pop-up out of nowhere with bit-parts as though the wind blew them on the screen and then they are gone with little to no follow-up. The family dynamic was a bit odd and not flushed out well even when taking the special circumstances associated with the mother into account. I think they would have been better off if they did not include that issue in the family dynamic, which was not written well and was more of a distraction. In doing so they could have focused more on character development and added more substance to the overall plot.Instead, the film seems like a patchwork of people and circumstances as they toss scenes in for a few minutes then jump somewhere else a little too soon for my taste making the audience fill in the gaps. The closest description that comes to mind is ""Jack of all trades but master of none.""The twists and the climax were very cool. I give them points for that. Other than that this is a mediocre film. Gets better in the last 15 minutes. The build up is too disjointed and slow in my opinion. Still, it is worth watching. I may have thought better of this film had it been made for TV, versus a rental. I expect more from movies that charge box-office prices to watch. That said, I have seen much worse films than this.I recommend watching it with the knowledge you have gained in this and other similar reviews. Do not go in thinking you are about to watch an epic film that will make you jump out of your seat. Think of it as a made-for-TV movie with a moderate budget and suburbia setting.

This was released as a VOD not in most theatre's and it's the best thriller of 2019 imo. Judging by the decent trailer I was expecting a watchable thriller/horror and what I got was something completely different in the best way.The film sets up with an intriguing bizarre intro that pulls you in from the start with mystery, filled with crisp camerawork and a fantastic ominous soundtrack that never lets up. You're introduced to the characters and their problems and as things unravel you think you know whats happening until it's the exact opposite with an utterly creative take midway through. As insane events start blending chaotically from every direction, this quickly becomes an absolutely intense and well woven tale of the creepiest and most twisted nature that will hit viewers out of nowhere.Many films try their hand at non linear stories and only few work with such meticulous effectiveness like this film does in such a smooth style. It makes you want to restart the film right after its over and that is a quality that only truly great films posses. This will stick with people for quite some time.

Nicely put together thriller.For some reason I had in my head it was a sci fi thriller. In fact, the opening shot seemed to indicate something invisible yanking the child from the bike. Then there were little things that made me question what is happening and when is the monster going to reveal itself.The movie starts off pretty quick getting to the point. You meet the characters and are instantly intrigued by the story.Helen Hunt cheated on her husband. Her son is rightfully pissed as her infidelity has led to a rift in the family. In the meantime, someone has abducted a child, which is actually the second one in a couple week period. That sets the backdrop. The husband is a detective assigned to the case with another one who handled a case years ago with similar patterns. Knowing that he put the guy behind bars, they believe that they're probably dealing with a copycat.The man with whom Helen Hunt had an affair drops by her house. She rebuffs him but not before someone throws a mug from of the roof causing a pretty nasty cut and bump. She takes him to the basement to treat the wound and leaves to take the son to school. While she's away, someone knocks him over the head killing him. When she returns, she sees his dead body and looks to her husband for help. Concerned that the son would be the likely culprit, they proceed to bury the body deep in the woods.While they're away, the son is knocked unconscious by a masked figure creeping up behind. The next scene you see Helen and the husband find him and Helen drives the don to the hospital while husband remains to check the house. While upstairs, a record begins playing and when he starts to turn it off, a figure creeps up behind with a weapon seemingly injuring or killing him.The story takes a flip to two ""phroggers"" who move from home to home for a place to stay. But they do so without the people knowing. They are actually filming their antics and it becomes apparent that we are watching a flashback to earlier parts of the film. They've been there the whole time. The guy in the duo becomes increasingly weird wanting to mess with the family. As his behavior becomes bizarre, he drives the girl to want to leave.It is revealed that the guy threw the mug at the dude who hooked up with Helen. When the girl goes to the basement to retrieve her stuff, she sees the guy and dips behind a shelf. As she watches, it is revealed that husband killed the guy in the basement.When she tries to convince the boy to leave, he accidentally knocks her unconscious. He places her in s trunk which is then driven by husband to undisclosed location. It is there that we find the husband is the serial killer the whole time. When the girl tries to save the two boys who were kidnapped, husband suffocates her. Next scene he wakes her up so he can stage her death as self defense. He shoots her. When her buddy sees that she is dead, we learn that he is the one who attacks husband. They have a fight and husband is stabbed then shot by him. The partner enters and shoots the guy. It is revealed to the partner that husband was the killer all this time, even former ones and the guy who was in his house was one of the kids who got away. Helen learns her husband was a serial killer.Good flick.",I See You

126,rarepeperonis,Wow this is bad,2,12 May 2020,The acting is atrocious. The mom especially it's horrendousThe story is all over the placeThey put suspence music where there should be none... why would we need some BOM BOMMMM BOMMM BOMMM SUSPENSEEEE music when a simple garage door is opening in an non scary pointless scene. It makes no freaking sense. I swear every scene had some heavy suspense scary music but it's the most pointless things happening.It looks like a TV movie nothing in this screams professional screenplay. The editing as well makes no sense. Dad is at a crime scene in the woods 3 seconds later he's in the garage in his house.People make dumb nonsensical decisions.The villain mask is laughable how non scary it is.Can't believe this get's over a 4/10. What a garbage movie.,I See You
127,hjchuijbregts,Different but nice,7,22 March 2021,"There is a lot to say about this movie. But I won't. What I liked was that's it's filmed a lot with drones. That's give such a big difference in wachting the movie. Love it. The sorry is nice. But there are thing that I don't get. And yes maybe it is me. But its something different and that's cool. For shure a must see. But damn Helen's face, if I did not know it was her, I probably Wouldn't recognize her. There is a other example of bad plasticsurery. What a shame. It really takes away your attention of the move. But anyway you still should see it. Enjoy",I See You
128,ryanpersaud-59415,Not as Bad as You Think,6,4 May 2021,"The Good: I was surprised by this taut, fun little thriller. The film gets significantly better by the second half, switching out a generic haunted house for something far more interesting. Anything that reminds me of Cache a little bit is a win in my books.The Bad: the movie can get a little cheesy at times. I also found some of the dynamics between the characters to be a little underdeveloped and I honestly would have liked the movie to be slightly longer to explore the characters a bit more.The Ugly: the cinematography is a bit bland and the Frog Mask is just super goofy and obviously made for the poster. Also, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room. Helen Hunt looks incredibly weird.",I See You
129,ajzeg,I'm gonna be honest with you guys...,7,13 February 2020,"For the first half hour or so of this movie, I was not enjoying it at all. It was kinda boring and derivative (just a basic murder mystery/home invasion horror plot) and I was really close to just shutting it off. However, after that first 30 minutes or so, something happens that completely changes the whole movie that I don't dare spoil. It made me so glad that I stuck with it. I still feel like I've seen stuff like it before, there are elements of Don't Breathe, Summer of 84, The Perfection and even The Simpsons, but I still enjoyed it in the end. That's all I can say without spoiling anything. Check it out if you're a horror fan.",I See You

I see you stops off slow and typically. You assume you know what's going on and what is going to happen, but you really don't. A lot 30 minutes or so in, things really started picking up steam with different twists and turns. Quite enjoyable and keeps you on your toes plus, at the end you are disappointed by unanswered questions. Well, not too many anyway.

133,freddy_at_home,Pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would,8,16 August 2020,"First off, I did not watch the trailer for this. I feel trailers give away too much of the movie. I felt for seeing something a bit scary this Sunday night. Me and my buddy opened a bag of Cheese Doodles, a cold Fanta and turned off all the lights.Not knowing what this was about ,I pretty fast felt I figured it all out. And I asked my friend if we should turn it off and watch another movie. But my friend reminded me off the 15-20 minute rule. So we gave it 20 minutes. And I am very glad we did. It got me slowly sucked in, with it's scary music and mystic behavior. It had the element of surprise. A small budget, even smaller than Get Out, witch was fantastic!! So bravo to the production for making so much out of so little. It felt more expensive.After watching it, I felt pleased it was such a good movie. A lot better than I thought at first. It made me surprised and got me thinking. I will recommend this to my friends. It's a little exciting pearl. 7.5/10 from me (Rated it 8 because I feel it deserved that, rather than a 7)",I See You

It was only after reading a ton of the reviews that I decided to see it through and I'm so glad I did.

This movie delivers thrills, chills and then some.
I want to see more from Director Adam Randall after this film with more twists than a roller coaster.
Do yourself a favour with this flick that deals with real horror not torture or the supernatural.
Shot on a low budget of just 3 million dollars it deserved wide cinema release over so much crap that gets green lit.
The opening scene is a beautiful setting complete with Chagrin Falls, Ohio waterfalls, just outside Cleveland...but it gets dark real quick and works in three parts from different perspectives.

1. someone says ""you don't have to do this"" before he is shot.
2. a woman comes home and the first grip goes to the wine bottle
3. children with asthma.
4. the handle to the pillbox""I see you"" has 3 of these 4 things to offer, starts as a horror movie and develops after about 30 minutes into a revenge thriller. Mindy and Alec are two teenagers phrogging and settling into the Harpers' house. What we learn only at the end is that Alec has a plan, but is initially presented to us as a disturbed young man. What makes the story here completely illogical is that Mindy is the one who lures Alec into this house, but Alec apparently knows where she is leading him. There are some not very plausible situations in this movie, which might make it exciting and surprising for newcomers to the thriller genre. For me it all seemed rather contrived and it also took me quite a while to get used to the mask-like face of Helen Hunt.

145,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,I see you and so should you,8,28 May 2020,"Another week, and hopefully one step closer to a cure but until that day... STREAM TO BIG SCREEN will have to do. Thanks for coming back to get your daily or weekly dose of movie reviews. This week, we are reviewing a psychological crime thriller, I See You. This movie stars the acting veterans Helen Hunt and Jon Tenney as some strange occurrences are popping up in their lives personally, professionally, and physically. We get a look into their lives during an intense few days. So let's get to what there is to watch about I See You.Definitely going into this movie with zero expectations created streaming gold. Now, my wife and I love a good psychological thriller or horror movie, and this only slightly disappointed. By slightly, I mean, this movie takes a little too long to get going and also somehow takes too long to end, even though it's only about 90 minutes. It was a strange fit. I felt myself saying hurry up and get to it; and, then once we were in the meat of it, I found myself saying hurry up and resolve this thing. One could take that as a positive sign. There was a constant state of anxiety in this movie. If that's what Adam Randall was going for, then he succeeded. If this wasn't intentional, then you lucked out, buddy!It was luck in the sense that the storyline is very similar to a lot of movies or even Law & Order: SVU episodes. However, the movie has a pretty good twist that I wish I could say I saw coming but in reality I didn't. I think I must have been distracted by wanting the movie to getting going, and then being engrossed in the thick of the movie, and then, finally, wanting the movie to resolve. In fact, that's the sign of a very good movie. You think you know what's coming and BLAM-O the movie crosses you up like A.I. did Jordan (watch The Last Dance documentary, if you all get a chance).The only unfortunate part of this movie is the forgettable acting. Helen Hunt doesn't shine, and here, she can be quite annoying. ""Fitz"", or Jon Tenney, is just normal - literally nothing to write home about. The only standout performances were probably from Libe Barer and Owen Teague, but, they were also too minimally in the movie and/or a bit annoying during their scenes. Libe was too whiny and cautious for the actions she takes in the movie and Owen, while appropriate in hindsight, seemed too weird for the characters mindset.Nevertheless, I See You is solid addition to the Prime streaming service. The movie provides needed entertainment even with forgettable performances from the cast. The movie presents a familiar storyline with an intense and unique concept twist that keeps the viewer on their toes and full of anxiety. The thriller/suspense fans out there will be pleasantly surprised with this streaming feature. Grab that big box of popcorn and enjoy.",I See You

Then when the new characters are Incorporated for the second portion it becomes disappointing, far-fetched and then predictable. Once we get to the big reveal at the end it's anything but. On a snarky note, Helen Hunt's husband is the producer. Sadly, with what she's done to her face, which by the way is a VERY distracting element of the film, nepotism is the only way she can get work.

156,izzypito,Horrible,3,3 May 2020,This movie tried to be different and it did add a couple of good plot twists but they failed on the delivery. The whole phrogging story should've been there from the beginning of the movie instead of adding that element halfway through and basically going through the whole movie again. The ending was actually decent with the plot twist but other than that the movie was horrible.,I See You

It's so good, I've watched it twice now and it's enjoyable the second time round. Things makes more sense and everything connects. Even fine details to what's on the tv connects.

Halfway through the film it just completely shifts perspectives that disengages the viewer. Also, after the perspective change it becomes very predictable as to who the ""bad guy"" is. It's so obvious it can only be one person. I just wish the why was explained a bit more. Not a terrible film but still barely passable. One final note: Helen Hunt has obviously had some surgery and her face was actually very distracting. She actually reminded of rocky from the 1985 film Mask. Yikes.",I See You

How would Alec know the Kidnapper ? It is not clear at all even though at the end it may give you some clue, and I still have no idea. And one of the characters (Tommy) in the movie. What's his purpose there?Overall, this movie does give you some suspense and it does reveal things in the other angle. However, it still lacks of some explanation and logic.",I See You
160,QuentinJ444,"This movie is a game changer, I don't think any author out there can match this one.",10,19 April 2020,"Author Devon Graye and Director Adam Randall, have challenged the imagination of movie viewers with this Masterpiece.
Authors like Edgar Allen Poe, Steve King, and M. Knight should watch out for this combination, I don't think you can get any more creative than this.
I SEE U, is a game-changer. The background of this movie is perfect, in middle America, there is a family of three, a mother, which is a doctor, played by Helen Hunt, whos been out of the movie scene for what seems like a lifetime, but she's back with a VENGEANCE, her husband, Detective Harper, play by Joh Tenney and son Judah Lewis who is a high school student. This family has problems like the average American, like the mother having an affair and begging her husband forgiveness, which changed their family dynamic, causing them to fall apart and lose trust in one another, which sets the stage for one of the most creative films I've seen in a dog's ages.
Detective Harper is working on a case in which he believes it's copycat murder/kidnapping from one of detective Spitzky's old cases, played by Gregory Alan Williams, for which the suspect was captured and sent to prison.
If you're a Crime, Drama or Thiller fantastic, then I challenge you, to figure out the ending to this film before it ends. I believe this to be the Crime film of the DECADE. With this All-Star cast, I would put this up against any Steve King or M. Knight film. It's a wonder why it didn't make it into the Theaters. I See U, is a must-see, film for everyone that's into these genres. They labeled it as a horror also, but I do understand why they could put it in the horror genre, but I don't do spoilers.
This film has more twists and turns then Michael Jacksons' performance at the 1984 Grammy music award show Writer Devon Graye and Director Adam Randall collaborated to make a MASTERPIECE. If you can't rate this movie higher then an eight, then you need to watch it again.
I believe this may be the being of something beyond our imagination. I can't wait to see more of there work together, which out M, Knight.

165,mjfhhh,an interesting concept is enough to make a movie stand out,8,29 February 2020,"Sheriff Greg Harper is plunged back into a nightmare he hoped had ended for good. The child kidnapper that he had seemingly caught many years ago had returned with a vengeance. But the strangest things happen at home, where he cannot get rid of the feeling that he and his family are being watched. Is there a stranger in the house? And how is it connected to the case he is working on?Sometimes an interesting concept is enough to make a movie stand out. I SEE YOU definitely has an original take on a thriller plot structure, making us wonder what the heck is going on, but the surprises regarding the murder mystery or the identity of the kidnapper are easy to predict. Nevertheless it's a tense little thriller and while it's hard to care for any of the characters, it is an enjoyable ride.On the negative side, Helen Hunt is terribly miscast as the protagonist's wife, and only there to raise the stakes. She doesn't really do anything apart from looking scared, helpless and occasionally bemused.Director Adam Randell (you might have enjoyed his Netflix superhero flick I-Boy) does well when it comes to original ideas, but I SEE YOU is a mixed bag, as it makes too many u-turns and while none of the twists feel out of place, changing direction doesn't help caring for the characters the way we should.Dark, mysterious and devoid of any gratuitous violence I SEE YOU is rather a mystery than a horror movie. It is definitely trying to do something new with a tired serial killer formula and deserves high praise for the effort.",I See You

178,gooseshaw,Sloppily written but otherwise a fine thriller.,6,16 June 2020,"This movie had me interested, then I was uninterested, and then it got me interested again, and then I was uninterested again.This review's gonna be a long one, where I pretty much explain the entire movie and then point out the parts of it that don't make any sense. Skip to the end if that's all you want to see.The summary of this movie claims that a small town detective is investigating the kidnapping of a child. We soon learn that this crime may be connected to a series of past child-murders through the discovery of a green pocket knife. Apparently the killer has a bunch of green pocket knives and he buries all of his victims with them.There's drama in the detective's house. His wife (Jackie) has cheated on him and his son (Connor) is angry. Strange things happen in this house, as if there were an intruder. At one point, the the wife's lover shows up and gets hit in the head with a mug. We are to assume this was the angry son. The lover is brought into the basement where he is killed my someone. Possibly the Connor (as the Jackie assumes) or more likely an intruder attempting to frame the son.At this point we're given a parallel story about a couple of young adults, one of whom is an avid home invader (yet the two of them take this crime quite lightly...). One of these two (Mindy) witnesses the death of Jackie's lover at the hands of the detective himself (Greg). Is this a simple revenge plot?Barer and her partner in crime (Alec) want to escape, but Alec has been playing pranks on the family (including throwing the mug at Jackie's lover) and for whatever reason, decides tranquilize and hogtie Connor and place him in the bathtub. While doing this, Alec places a green pocket knife in a bar of soap... Is he the child murderer?Alec and Mindy get into an argument and Alec pushes her down some stairs. Mindy loses consciousness, so Alec decides to put her in the trunk of Greg's car... Greg and Jackie find their son tied up and panic. Jackie takes Connor to the hospital, while Greg drives into the woods, gets out of the car, and disappears for a moment. In this moment, Mindy wakes up and finds a camper with some kidnapped children tied up inside. Greg (the detective) comes up behind her and knocks her out.Greg returns home and now decides to search his house for the intruder who tied up his son. Greg also kills Mindy, placing a gun that he had for some reason into her hand, making it look like she was trying to kill him. Alec confronts Greg. He knows that he is the murderer, and is also responsible for the series of child murders years before. Alec was one of the children that Greg tried to kill, hence why he had the green pocket knife. Alec kills Greg, Greg's partner shoots Alec, but Alec survives and exposes Greg.So, why did Alec decide to tie up Connor? That goes quite a bit beyond his usual pranks like turning the TV on randomly... Why did Alec stab a knife into the bar of soap? Was is just so we'd see that it was the same green knife from before? Why did Greg drive into the woods and just disappear for no reason, right after his son was tied up by a home invader? He wasn't in his camper, so where was he? Where did Greg get this second gun? If it's his gun, the police will be able to trace the gun back to him... Also, why did Greg's partner shoot Alec on sight? Was he also involved in the child abductions? You can't just shoot a guy on sight like that, but whatever.All in all this movie was entertaining at parts but there were just too many instances of sloppy writing for me to give this anything higher than a score of 'slightly above average.' Otherwise it's fairly well made, the acting is fine, and the music is actually quite disturbing.",I See You

182,connorundrumme,"Wish there had been more substance in this thriller, but it was O.K.",7,30 May 2020,"All-in-all it would have made a better 3-4 part tv series. In that medium, some of the pacing, the resets, and the gaps would've been more acceptable, and it would have left room for more (any) back story on the 'why' of multiple threads that otherwise lead to blunt-impact fact bombs. It did have some twists and reveals that worked, but there was a lot to get through before they happened.So, it starts out right away with a surly, hostile teen. What fun? And, apparently, there is no fury like a husband and son 'scorned.'It only took half the movie to get to the 'intruders' part. The concept seems dumb, i.e., risky and pointless. And who'd bring a restless, sh!t-stirring headcase along, anyway? Is it at all believable that a person who thoroughly disrespects and drugs someone would have any kind feelings for them? Anyway, it didn't seem difficult to guess what the very last reveal was going to be.The reviews for this title are too frequently coming from the cultural cesspool that is prejudice against those who have managed to age, as well as who happen to be female. They even cross into judging her lifestyle, career choices, acting, etc. - all because of her appearance. (How low brow, childish, and pathetic.) If a movie contains bias and prejudice, that's one thing to speak about, but who comes here to hear about other peoples internal mental garbage of that nature? Those Comments Have Zero Value. If anyone looked like worse-for-wear, it was Jon Tenney, and you know how much it matters? IT DOESN'T!!",I See You
183,its-me6611,It is a clever film with some genuine surprises in the story,8,18 December 2019,"8/10Plot: Jackie Harper is trying to fix her marriage after her affair with her high school sweetheart but her husband and son is not making it easy. To make things worse there is a creepy presence in the house.The poster seemed cool and I thought it would be cool horror film. It is actually a mystery/thriller film, not a horror film.There are three phases in the film. First phase revolves around the Harper family and the little strange occurrences that happens around the house. As the film progresses those strange events become increasingly creepy. There is also the drama centering the unfaithfulness of the wife. First phase takes almost 60 percent of the run time. I loved this phase, I had no idea what was going on, lots of questions were running around in my head.
Then comes the second phase which takes a totally different turn in terms of cinematography and the tone of the film. Some hand held shots were used which distracted me from the ambience created by the first phase. This is the weakest phase of the film. Thank god it was the shortest phase as well.The last phase shows lots of details and tries to tie the story lines. I liked most part of this phase as well. The tone of the film shifts here as well.The acting was good by all the actors and music was nice as well. The frog mask is creepy. There were some solid twists which surprised me.As the film has distinct phases and goes from mystery to thriller to action the overall experience diminishes a little. The production value is low and sometimes feels like a low budget TV-movie. There are some inconsistencies in the story.I enjoyed the film. It is a clever film with some genuine surprises in the story. I liked the creepy ambience of the film and also the little dramas between the characters. Short run time also works in the favor of the film.",I See You

I expected a lifetime type of movie but was pleasantly surprised. The acting is really good if you can overlook Helen hunt's bad skeletor face job. I'm a horror and thriller buff so I can usually spot the twists a mile away; however, these ones were pretty well hidden and not really foreshadowed to the point of being blatantly obvious.",I See You

There's a whole lot more that happens, but spoilers would ruin the only good aspect of the movie - the story.In all other ways, the film falters. It's mainly a one-location movie, so there's not much happening visually. However, that doesn't stop the cinematographer from going absolutely bananas with the camera. There are so many pans, zooms, long pulls, drone shots, crane shots, dolly shots... it constantly throws a whole bunch of random camera movements at you that make no sense, eg. A 10 second panning shot from a blank wall, past a door, to someone sitting on a bed. Why?Editing is shoddy too. It cuts from an action scene to a static shot of an empty hallway, holds it for a while, a bit longer, then cuts to another scene entirely. For absolutely no reason. I don't get it.The acting is tonally inconsistent, with characters behaving like they're in different movies. The soundtrack is dreadful, incredibly bass-heavy, poorly mixed and generic.BUT! It unfolds at a decent pace with some creative twists and turns as the whole thing races towards intentional pulp fiction. Definitely worth a watch if you're into classic thrillers. I think in the hands of more seasoned filmmakers, it could have been truly gripping. As it stands, it's just gripp-ish.",I See You
190,stairways,Messy mix of styles and points of view,4,3 October 2020,"Like the spawn of Parasite and any of a dozen utterly interchangeable and forgettable kidnapped kid detective stories, this movie is badly written, thinly plotted, woodenly acted and, worst of all, juggles points of view like a drunk in a big top. In fact it is at least three different stories and styles of story awkwardly tied together and staggering along a lonely forest track. That is the scariest thing about it.Actually the 'base' story of a couple driven apart by infidelity, and their teenage son's rising anger, is not bad, but it's abandoned for a much flashier story the director (and the scriptwriter) have no idea whatsoever how to manage or give dramatic life to.As Samuel Johnson said of a rival's book manuscript:'It is both hood and original, but the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not hood.'",I See You

The only reason I'm not rating it 10 stars is because Helen Hunt (as much as I love her) looks old enough to be Conor's grandmother and not young enough to be his mom. Also, did Mindy survive the gunshot? They found the boys, but how? She lost service when she called the police and then was driven back to the home. Did they track her cellphone and place her at both locations? That part left me feeling confused.Edit: I wanted to add a bit more now that I'm watching it for the second time. I caught something I didn't catch the first time I watched it. Alec is a teen, but he was interviewed 15 years ago by Spitz when he was at least 9, which would make him at least 24 - not a teen.

When it comes to the second part, it can well explain all these twists. I'm so shocked about the out-of-control teenager and his several behaviors become so unreasonable.

This made the first half hour an interesting experience but then after that it went a bit downhill for me as I couldn't identify with any of the characters. In any case, the movie makes up for a relatively entertaining viewing but the interest and suspense factor diminished long before it reached the conclusion due to the absurdity of most of the happenings and the unlikable characters.

216,davejones,A movie that thrives on its plot twists,7,1 September 2020,"This movie lives by its many plot twists and by abruptly cutting away from moments that would give too much away. This leaves some of the characters' actions appearing to be a bit dumb in the moment, although they make much more sense when the final plot twist is revealed. It's an original and largely successful bit of storytelling. And if you like a taut and twisty story, it's worth sticking with until the end.The thing this movie most lacks is a character that I was really rooting for. I suppose that the most sympathetic character is the mother, played by Helen Hunt. Unfortunately, she isn't much of a force in the story for most of the the film, and is nowhere to be seen in the climax. She's really more of a viewpoint than a full character.The father, Greg, seems like the world's least suspecting police detective. His wife tells him that all of the silverware has disappeared from their house, he notices that pictures have gone missing from their frames, he's locked in a closet by. . . someone. . . and he's also told that a repairman who came to the house has reported being let in by a well-behaved young woman (when there is no such person living in their household) and his only reaction seems to be, ""Huh. I guess stuff happens sometimes.""As a detective, he did not come across as a credible character. But then, as it turns out, he's got a lot of other things on his mind.I know that a lot of obvious stuff that goes unsaid between our main characters is supposed to be because it's a dysfunctional family where everyone is angry with everyone else, but there's a limit to how far you can push this. These people let an awful lot of very strange stuff just slide.One last, small complaint: Enough with the drone shots, already.

Watch It!,8,24 April 2020,"The script by Devon Graye, whom I knew from his portrayal of the teenage version of serial killing antihero Dexter on the Showtime series, is a Master Class in plot twists and red herrings. When I see a story this good, on a budget of only $3,000,000, it pains me to think of what might have been with a larger budget and yet what they were able to accomplish with the money they had was pretty spectacular.It's not the low rent thriller knock off that it may seem but you have to get through the first act's genre ambiguity (is it a family drama, a thriller or a supernatural horror?) to get the well-worth-the-wait payoff. You might be tempted to give up on it 10 minutes in, given its straight to video feel, but you shouldn't. The Premise: A boy goes missing. He may be the victim of a serial killer who was already captured, a copycat killer, or something more supernatural. As the Lead detective investigates, family drama unfolds inside his homeThe performances, ranging somewhere between acceptable and above satisfactory, contribute to the first half's generic feel and yet, ironically or planned, they give the finale all the more impact. I wouldn't blame the actors though... there's no snappy dialogue, no breakout character scenes, no Oscar worthy monologues; this one is all about the story, the atmosphere, well crafted segments and a script that turns genre cliche's into the best part of the movie.Normally I give separate ratings for script, acting, cinematography, score, etc. but it would be difficult to do that without giving away the inventiveness of this film.

It was described in local papers as a ""horror film"" during production, but it really isn't a horror movie.I would best describe it as: What is really going on here? Ghosts? Murderer? Serial Killer?Very interesting first half of the movie that involves the manhunt for a missing boy, possibly related to previous cases, and a family in crisis over infidelity. I was beginning to wonder if someone in the family was trying to gaslight another member of the family. But this film does NOT go where you expect.

Doesn't make sense to have such luck to get in to the right house, hold myself back the hold time, to reveal the super plot, have steel head to survive strong hit and even shot and other to have master bad guy who doesn't double check if everything is thought through. It is really good thriller, and horor because of Helen Hunt's face - seriously if you can, pause the movie on her face, try to get used to it, talk about it, make jokes about it, and when you feel you're done, continue and focus on the movie.

I don't even know how it got through 2019 so hidden, where I thought I didn't really have any movies to beat Parasite that year, but after seeing this one, I feel like here it is.At first (even due to the original title and the 6.8 average rating on IMDb, very unfair by the way!!!), I thought it would be more of a horror generic or something like that. But incredibly I found him impeccable both in terms of script and technique, and look at the beginning I was picking up on things that until then I thought were kind of meaningless). First, the script is very well written and there is no way to predict the plot. Which starts presenting itself as a horror, where we are in doubt about what exactly it is, leaving intentional holes that will later be filled and transformed into a fantastic thriller, putting the two together. Different and quite unique in what it proposes even though there are several of the genre close, having a plot twist that I particularly loved.In addition, the technical issues, given that the budget is not very high ($3 million, according to the IMDb), are magnificent, an exemplary cinematography, accompanied by a beautiful montage of the scenes (including the ""holes""), also featuring a soundtrack that creates a very interesting atmosphere, especially in the first half when it still focuses on convincing the viewer of the horror, without any use of forced jumpscares.Magnificent work that manages to mix thriller and horror in a spectacular way.",I See You
256,TheSchinppenSchnaff,Depressingly overrated,4,3 May 2020,"If you like mystery movies, then you'll already see the 'twist' coming by the midway point of the movie. Fact of the matter is, without any suspects a movie like this only has two options: either the 'good guy' is the murderer, or the murder is introduced in the final scene via a non-sequitur. I'll let you guess which.There seems to be a trend in a lot of modern films where the concept of an anti-hero is cast not as a chaotic character with a benevolent heart, but as a low-life who's actions drive the plot as oppose to enrich the narrative. If the view finds the hero of the story repugnant, then how can the story work?This bring us to this film's two main weaknesses:1. When the bad guys is the only interesting character, there is not point in resolving the story. I don't care how it ends as the complication in the plot is more enjoyable than the resolution. When the twist is revealed I was genuinely hoping the serial killer would be victorious in this tale.2. When the story is resolved by the actions of what is ostensibly (for the first 70 min of the movie) a low-life creep, why would I care about anything vindicating qualities he/she might possess? You can't tell the audience that a character is a thief, a liar, show them commit an act of sexual assault and violate their child and then expect them to not want to see that character lose in the end.5 stars for being well shot, well acted and well scripted.

For the first bit of the movie, I was wondering why this had such great reviews, as it seemed kind of generic and whatever. Then the film takes a very sharp left turn. My interest was immediately piqued. From then on, things start to take shape and make sense, but something sinister is growing beneath. There are several twists, all of which were jaw-dropping and feel incredibly rewarding. The film ends up being an entirely different creature than what it began as, and the ending is tense, despairing, and answers so many things. And yet the film does not spoonfeed whatsoever. It may demand a rewatch in order to pick up on the motives behind characters' actions.The sound design actually stood out to me, as others have said. I didn't think it would, but genuinely they did a good job.There are no jumpscares of any sort, which is good.

It was very, very good. Helen Hunt was FABULOUS, and the other actors were very good too. There's nothing wrong with Helen Hunt's face, by the way - except just one thing: it's called AGING, folks. Some of us age more than others, and actresses tend to age fast due to hours, booze and less sleep! And I applaud her for not going under the knife like most!

But both are not that much psychopath that the come together of them is very thrilling. Furthermore there is no explanation of why the dad kidnaps Young boys or why the guy likes to confuse people. So why are they doing that? The plot had a great chance of getting a very good movie and I think the actors had the potential to make it interesting, but in fact this movie is more the sort of a good family drama more than horror or thriller, which it suggests in the first half hour.

However, the only two people that knew where the missing boys were stashed are dead: the villain and Mindy. Neither had the opportunity to expose the location. Absent that faux pas, I'd have rated it a 7 or 8. The suspense timing was superb: the audience does NOT have to wait too long for the next ""oh NO!"" moment which is common in this thriller genre.

296,anthony_ian,"Not Great, But Solid",6,31 October 2020,"It starts out great, with an opening plot about young boys being abducted and killed which is reminiscent of ""The Outsider"" on HBO. There's also an unrevealed back story that Helen Hunt's character had done something to damage their small family which was creating unbearable tension in the household.The house itself is also sort of a character, with a lot of very Kubrick-esque shots of it's sometimes ominous-looking rooms. So far so good. Then some weird things start happening and you begin to wonder if the house is, yes, haunted.Then it detours into a found-footage second act which at first seems to disrupt the entire flow (it is indeed too long for what it's needed to do) but eventually appears to establish a new villain that would explain a subsequent murder that occurs onscreen and the highly improbable coverup that occurs.It's here when the film then pulls a neat reversal of perspective where you get to rewatch much of what just happened from a different character's perspective, which reveals a huge plot point.It gets an above-average rating for this cool twist and the ultimate reveal of who the villain was, along with the reveal of somebody you thought was a villain but was in fact a victim. The third act salvaged what appeared to be at first a weird insertion of found-footage into act II.So, worth seeing, if not a horror classic. Stay for the ending though. If you bail midway (as I contemplated doing), you'll miss what redeemed the film.",I See You

298,isajademarilyn,Could have been much better,4,24 January 2021,"The supernatural twist of the first half of the movie fell flat from the get-go. A transparent wire was likely used to trap the kid.
The events in the house have tons of flaws. The television that won't turn off, I often do that with my cell phone.A full drawer of silverware is missing and the mother blames her son. He's the typical angry teen, maybe 16 years old, who'd rather groans than talks to his parents (Even more angry at his mother, for cheating on his dad).The son is in his own bubble, and his attitude doesn't show a need to steal or hide something. It's beyond silly to believe he could have stolen the silverware. It's extremely heavy, makes lots of noise when moves, and not so much value for the trouble. If he was in need of money, he would have stolen much smaller items, that can be easily sold, like electronics, or jewelry.One of the worst moment is when the glazier responds to the mom that her daughter let him in, and that she had great manners, you taught her well!
How on earth you can hear that and not stop him, question him about the girl and call 911 right away!
Her husband is a cop!By the way, he didn't wake up when the intruder peed on him, and in the morning he's not worried at all when he discovers his flooded bed. No doctor appointment?Everything is fine?Silverware is gone, a photo on the wall is gone, he just wet his bed... he's a detective and everything sounds right? As a cop he must be familiar with the phenomenon of intruders.The photo was most likely one of the hints that help figure out the timeline.I loved Helen Hunt in As good as it gets, and it's very sad and disturbing to see her emotionless face.So many other things didn't make sense, who keeps antiseptic and bandages in the basement? I also wouldn't leave alone a friend with a bleeding head injury.Anyway, too many things were done to create suspense but didn't make sense.

328,mitchw-61-305942,And I'd see you again,7,14 July 2020,"I See You has a few interlocking narratives throughout. It's as though several subplots connect the film into a whole. While watching the film, I felt some frustration and disappointment because I wanted to see at least one story play out in detail. However, it was satisfying at the end when I understood this was the films intention.The camera work was effective.
The music was effective.
The acting was solid.
Everything that makes a movie a movie was done well and professionally.So that leaves my impression. There was one scene with Helen Hunt at work, which was very short. I wasn't sure it was necessary for the film, except to give her character a bit of depth. In order to do this, I think there needed to be another scene of her at work. Perhaps it was to demonstrate her ambien dependency (if it is a dependency). This storyline here doesn't have much relevance either. There was relational drama between the characters which felt short and abrupt. I wanted this to be explored more.When the film made a dramatic shift in storyline and cinematography about two thirds through the film, I felt a little disappointed because I had to get familiar with new key players. That being said, it was this shift that explained much of the mystery in the first half of the film.Throughout the film, I didn't know who's side I was on. The protagonist and antagonist in this film is not consistent, which is the point. It may have been difficult when writing the script and editing the film to avoid plot holes. Fortunately, I didn't identify any, but there were probably minor discrepancies.I'd say the characters were underdeveloped but the suspense and overall production of this film is well done. Interesting twists. By the end, I definitely wanted more from the film. I wanted more reaction from the characters when all is revealed to everyone. The credits role instead. Bum.",I See You

Clearly no experts in policing weighed in in this movie. Even i, a regular citizen, is wondering what the hell with some stuff here with the Dad/Detective. Do you really keep so perfectly organized bags of evidence in police bags no less, against yourself? Even i, a non murderer, know that less than a foot to bury someone is ridiculous. If it weren't for things like this I would have been 100% behind this movie but come on!I will give super props for how the movie was laid out in how they presented all the characters. That worked really well. It was like a 20/20 mystery where your opinion flips around the more you know.",I See You
354,gsaxon,No redeeming qualities; not worth watching,1,13 September 2020,"The movie starts off with making the viewer think there is a malevolent and invisible creature hunting young boys. There is no such creature and the movie disappoints from then on. There are too many illogical twists and turns that try to confuse and involve the viewer, but that doesn't work. There is little character development and the movie quickly becomes not only boring but stupid. A very disappointing movie that wasted 1-1/2 hours of my time.",I See You

She was just awful; wooden, slurring words and honestly appeared as though she couldn't be bothered.

Not good for people with a heart condition as it is annoyingly irritating. The movie is an island as it fails to make any connection with the viewer or realty. Seasoned cop just makes irrational decisions. Doesn't even know how to plant evidence. It would be attractive to Americans under the Guano Act.

She had no purpose in this film at all. Not to mention, 3/4 of the way in, she just drives off and we don't see her again (do we? If we did, I had either fallen asleep due to boredom or blinked and missed it).The premise of the movie was okay and probably could have been done better, I imagine.The big reveal at the end was significantly less impactful than it could have been if I had any clue as to what was going on during the first 90% of the movie.

The entire first act was flat and boring, nothing happened to keep me interested in the characters or what was happening. But when the second act came it managed to pick up the pace of the film making me want more. The idea of the second act should have just been a film on its own, as this entire film is two completely different story's that are pushed together in that's last 5 minutes of the film trying to make them one, this then making it feel rushed and abit pointless.

417,lagos_sam,People are giving this 10/10...?,5,31 August 2020,"There are some okay elements, it's somewhat entertaining but it's predictable and suffers from typical thriller cliches which really bug me. Alec (Owen Teague), whilst meant to be an a unlikeable character is just too annoying. Helen Hunt's plastic surgery abundance is so distracting and no character is very likeable except Spitzky.There are borderline ridiculous moments where the Phroggers would be seen, like on the roof or behind the glass door when Jackie is STARING RIGHT AT ALEC!? Mindy's meant to be a super cautious person, yet before she dies she's yelling on the phone when she knows Greg's around and just wanders into the caravan? The most annoying bit is when Greg is looking for Alec in the house, he's a detective, he knows he's there and he knows the record player was put on as a distraction so what does he do? Stares at it like it's a complex puzzle? No detective would be that stupid. Soon after he hits Alec in the HEAD WITH A METAL FIRE POKER which let's be real would've killed him, yet Alec's up a second later completely fine...It's okay... but the fact that people are giving this movie a 10/10 is simply ridiculous. There's no real build up to the main reveal. It's a plot twist just for the sake of it and its not overly surprising or clever.Overall it just loosely ties plots together, with twists that have zero substance and I guess people think that's worthy of a 10? Are you serious? You must have to be young or seriously simple to think this is worthy of anything more than a 7.",I See You

There are a handful of surprises and will make you want to see it at least twice (I didn't really saw it twice but I definitely rewinded to some parts).It has a smart script that keeps you guessing, and while the behaviors of the characters sometimes made my eyes roll, most are explained later. There are only two or three things that they had to force and you have to turn a blind eye to in order to fully enjoy it.I See You will stay with you for a little while and won't give you all the answers.

It is a thriller/detective movie. If you expect anything Supernatural or horror elements, you will be very disappointed.The writing had some very good ideas. The cast could have been really good. Unfortunately Hunt's face looks quite distracting. It looks like she had a lot of plastic surgery or some Botox injections. It looks so distracting that at some point in the movie it looks like she as some CGI face.Now when it comes to the execution overall there are so many coincidences and times where are the villains should have been caught. But it was just complete plot conveniences.

424,davecoak,Superb thriller/horror,10,20 February 2020,'I See You' is a superb thriller/horror starring Helen Hunt in one of the leading roles with other well known faces. The film manages to create a pulsating tense atmosphere from the very beginning which seems to suggest a supernatural horror of sorts. You learn very quickly Helen Hunt's character has cheated on her husband of many years and it has created a volatile domestic atmosphere which coincides with seemingly supernatural occurences. This all builds up to twist after twist. The story is excellent and the direction from Adam Randall is masterful. This film is so good it could have benefited from another 40 minutes of running time the story is so good and relatively complex. Highly recommend to all horror and thriller fans alike!,I See You

The story starts up well, with that serial killer who liked to kidnap boys, and should be dead, but now someone starts to kidnap boys using his methods again and ""Oh my godness! Could him be still alive or it's an emulator?"" (Freddy vs. Jason anyone?)
Then the storyline goes in concentric loops where every single character does stupid things again and again for no apparent purpose, some characters just get off the radar for half-hours and you have no idea of who's alive or who's dead who killed them and who's investigating on that, and in the end (if you're still awake), you REALLY no longer care about it.",I See You

Not sure why it didn't receive a higher rating. I am a movie and tv addict not sure how this one didn't fall in my radar. Saying that, there are 2 things that made me have some questions: 1. Why did HH not have her lips done to match the rest of her face. Couldn't quit looking at them. Age is age but you can't do a couple of tweaks and not make your face as even as possible. Otherwise, she was great as always. 2. What is the back story of the killer, would have loved to know more about the past and what drove this person to do what they did.

The basic plot is a decent, no frills basic semi-horror/mystery. It is in the details that this film loses all credibility as well as all direction. There are so many logical error and unnatural mannerisms that it becomes a distraction. If you dislike seeing the dumbest choices possible in any given situation, avoid this film at any cost.

455,d_vsbrgh,A decent thriller with some surprises,6,22 April 2020,"Things are not going well for psychologist Dr. Jackie Harper ( Helen Hunt) and her police detective husband Gary( Jon Tenney) due to the former's marital indiscretion. Jackie is attempting to make amends but is getting nowhere, especially with her angst riddled teenage son Conner(Judah Lewis) who blames her for the current family dynamic.
When a local boy goes missing, Detective Harper is assigned lead on the case, adding to his already stressful domestic situation. He and his partner, Detective Spitzky( Gregory Alan Williams) soon realize that this case resembles a child abduction case from fifteen years ago. A case where Spitzky was the arresting officer and is positive they got the right guy.
Simultaneously, strange things begin occurring at the Harper residence. Items go missing, televisions and record players turn on by themselves, and other seemingly unexplainable things happen. Each member of the household is aware of the strange goings on but since no one is speaking to the other, the mystery remains unsolved.
Are the unusual occurrences at home somehow connected to the missing child case? That is the question, and one I cannot answer without spoiling the movie.
The tension is ratcheted up by director Adam Randall by using a creepy minimalist score as well as overhead and point-of-view shots giving the viewer the feeling that the characters are being watched by someone or something. As with any good thriller there are some plot twists and turns along the way. Unfortunately, when the twists are revealed, they raise as many new questions as they answer.
The performances by the leads are, at best, fair. Hunt spends most of the movie walking around with her mouth agape in a constant stunned/surprised/horrified expression. Tenney's performance is restrained and may have been better handled by someone with better chops( for some reason Mark Ruffalo comes to mind). The supporting cast, however, is actually quite good and their performances carry the second half of the movie.
Overall, it is a solid effort despite several plot holes but would likely be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of the genre and probably a few who are not.",I See You

The execution of all the story lines is pretty great. They were able to tell a few different story lines and point of views without leaving a bunch of questions at the end.

Or is it a movie about a poltergeist? Is it about intruders? It's packed with so much that it takes away from one idea, and making it great.
Helen hunt isn't the greatest actress at the best of times, but when I watched this, I wondered if she agreed to make the movie because she needed the money to pay bills. The acting was on par with a c list made for tv movie. The teen son's acting was a little better, which stopped me from giving this movie a 2 star rating.
I'm normally not one to judge a person's appearance, but I'm afraid that I also found Helen Hunt's new face extremely distracting. It has been filled and pulled so tight that she can't seem to make any facial expressions, and can barely open her mouth.

Let's be clear - while other reviewers are praising the story craft here with its ""twists and turns"", the movie is actually straight-forward, dumb, and even sadistic. The craft is below-average, and the emotional resonance is completely off. Imagine, if in The Silence of the Lambs, it was revealed in the end that Clarice is the real serial killer all along with no other context. How would that make you feel? How would that even make SENSE? Without sharing spoilers, that's sort of how this movie goes.

the sound effects and music are really really well done, it hooks you from the start and do not dissapoint throughout the movie;well made story overall;decent ending;no silly/unnecessary jump scares;it does leave you creeped out for a bit (again, credit to the sound producer and crew)Bad points:
I feel like they picked Helen Miren mostly because her name adds some weight to the movie, but her character and lines fall flat. In this role you can't see any difference between her and any other lesser known decent actress, there is pretty much no development or relevant back story to her character;The teen actors (except one, and if you watch the movie, you'll know who I'm talking about) aren't bad, yet again flat characters;Close to the end some decisions don't make much sense and feel forced and a bit rushed, also due those decisions the plot twist is given away to easily;the dragged out shoting/fighting scene (way to overused adds nothing ""thrillery"" wise;the movie ends a bit abruptly, I sort off see why, but they could have added just 2-3 more scenes with the aftermath.Overall not a bad movie, it sets itself for more expectations then it delivers but it remains decent.

Absolutely painful going each stupid little prank step by step from a second perspective. We get it. Phroggers.The plot twist was absurd and unbelievable as well. We have no reason to believe the young phrog man, Alec, would need to take revenge into his own hands. Why weren't the kids able to ID the small town cop, Greg, who tried unsuccessfully to kidnap them? What was the deal with their mysterious sounding interviews?

500,zelahproductions,The elephant in the room.....,6,29 August 2020,"The thriller was pretty average. The first act was ok, the second act was laboured because we already knew the events that had happened and therefore the reasons for them happening, once we got the idea, could have been condensed much more tightly. The third act was ok, but if you are a thriller fan then you would have suspected the husband cop was something to do with it all along. So as I say, average but not awful.The elephant in the room was Helen Hunt. She is a great actress and could have aged gracefully but what the hell has happened to her face! Well, even though there is no confirmation, we kind of know don't we? But the result is probably a lawsuit of some kind against a cosmetic surgeon since she looks like one of those make up jobs in the original Star Trek when an alien beauty suddenly becomes a lipless, gaunt, ghoul which makes Captain Kirk step back in pitiful horror. I'm seriously not getting at her, she is very talented and I actually feel sorry, because with natural ageing her face would have been so gracefully embracing of old age and for that reason, attractive, and consequently the parts she was offered so much better than this. There is not a director of photography around who wouldn't be looking at the rushes and thinking....ok, let's see what we can do in the edit.",I See You

Because I think this film deserves a higher score. Because this is genuinely was of the more creepy and original thrillers I've seen in recent years. There is some interesting misdirection (I think?) used here that makes for an interesting twist. Owen Teague is amazing in this, and he only shows up halfway through, I took notice of him ever since I saw him in the show Bloodline. Some of the other performances are really good too. Not everything is great, and I wasn't fully into it until almost halfway through, but I think the direction and more importantly the writing is really good.

504,trishbb,5 for the plot line minus 5 for character development,5,29 August 2020,Not what was expected in terms of storyline - was expecting a creepy horror but pleasantly surprised to watch a genre change halfway through but oh boy not a whiff of effort went into even attempting any character development - would have been a much better film if some back story had been included. Ending also let it down and what on earth has happened to Helen Hunt - she used to be such a good actress !! This film is a good advert for not having plastic surgery - watch and see ....,I See You

I can see how some viewers were enamored by the plot twist which was mildly interesting but the pacing was bad, the score was loud and used in inappropriate places, the acting was weird, Helen Hunt looked weird, the plot was super messy and convoluted...I can go on and on.

513,aclassydelight,Finally. A creative mystery thriller,10,11 May 2020,"I'm a huge thriller/mystery fan. But I'm super picky and critical about what I like. First off. Don't let the negative obsession with Helen hunts face reviews get in the way of enjoying this film. So what, she's aging how she chose to. That's not why we're here. This hugely underrated film I've never heard of deserves way more attention and recognition than the likes of ""parasite"". That film is a joke over all the attention it got. However the acting, production, screen writing, creative multi layered plot and right down to the score all check the boxes for me! No wasted time to get the story going either. No stupid side romance plots. Just enough information to throw you off and then guide you into what's really going on. And not overly jumpy to make it more realistic to connect to the true story unfolding. It's been a while since we had a good one. I highly recommend.",I See You
514,ejwarring,Overhyped At Best,4,15 April 2020,"People are actually calling this flawless. This movie makes no communication that it is a supernatural movie. In fact it goes against that after the ""big twist"" which awkwardly changes the whole genre of the movie. But back to the supernatural thing, why is that an issue that it doesnt push to be supernatural? The first scene in the movie shows a kid floatng off of his bike into the air. So I am given a supernatural impression. Apparently everyone else forgot about this part of the movie. So that put me off for the rest of the movie. Good cinematography and fairly original. Also the music mixing and timing and overall choices were horrible and not subtle in the slightest. Watch Funny Games (the remake) if you want an actual fantastic home invasion. And if you want the mystery part of the movie then watch prisoners which also does a much better job. You will like this if you want a twist and dont want to think about the movie as your watching.",I See You

521,artemis8,Heavy-handed movie that tries too hard.,3,21 August 2021,"From the start, the movie attempts to create an extreme atmosphere of suspense, even when nothing in the least suspenseful is happening. It lacks any buildup of tension, but instead attempts to create it where it doesn't yet exist, even in the most innocuous scenes, using the most obnoxious soundtrack I've ever had to endure. Making pancakes for her rude, sullen son? Intense, dramatic music. Driving down the street to take the annoying son to school? Pounding, shrieking tense music. This got very old very fast. Weird occurrences in the house that point to something unexplained clearly going on? Nobody pieces any of it together or apparently even makes the slightest attempt to. Just more overly-dramatic, pounding music. All of the characters are unlikable, and I didn't care at all what happened to any of them-I just wanted the horrible music to stop. Suffered through about half of it before turning it off. Don't waste your time on this.",I See You

537,ellieroyce,Just wow,8,4 November 2021,"I've done a review without spoilers but I had to do another review with spoilers just to address everything because I thought the ending was beautifully done! The film was definitely a journey, every plot twist just shocked me even further.I've read a lot of reviews and it seems that some people are confused by the ending for some reason even though I thought it was perfectly clear?Alec knew all along that Greg was the killer due to him being one of the boys who escaped his clutch years ago!! This is why he was so obsessed with 'playing with them'. He even chose the house for them to stay in which means he knew all along what he planned on doing!!! When it was revealed that Alec and Mindy was living in their house (phrogging) and that Alec wanted to mess with their heads I was sure that Alec was a psychopath who was going to end up killing them all, however when it was revealed that the Dad was the psychopath I was completely shocked, to then revealing that Alec was a survivor years ago, just wow!!! The look on the Dads face when he realised who was pointing the gun at him just made the whole film! Leaving you so fulfilled at the end!I think the only twist that could have been done differently is when it is revealed in the car that the Dad is the one who abducted the boys due to Mindy finding the t shirt, I think I would have left it a little longer to Mindy running from the car with the audience thinking he was just going to bury her thinking she's dead and stumbling over the caravan (trailer), the reveal would maybe of hit harder if he had walked up behind her when she was in the trailer with the boys saying 'he's back' as she turns around and the audience realise he is the killer.. I don't know, maybe?Must watch!!!",I See You

You can't have that many face lifts and botox and play a character who seems from the story line was in her young and prime before getting pregnant with a now high school aged kid and that caused her to marry and settle down....helen you would be better embracing the wrinkles then that lifeless, sunken in face you have now.",I See You

569,rfronapfel-11106,Surprisingly Well Crafted Thriller,7,14 November 2021,"Admittedly, my expectations were low going in, as the majority of Ms. Hunt's projects have been less than spectacular for some time, but what started as a very familiar-feeling story turned out to be a smart, entertaining and somewhat unique thriller.What impressed me most about the film is what it DIDN'T do. It didn't underestimate the intelligence of its audience. Far too often, filmmakers feel they need to hit you over the head or put in a ""here's what just happened"" scene or flashback. All of the questions raised (or at least 95% of them) in the film are answered, and I for one, was thrilled they didn't feel compelled to spell it out for me.The performances are all controlled and solid, and the pacing is good...maintaining a feel of unease throughout.I did feel that there could have been a bit more exposition regarding the original investigation from years earlier. Would have served to make the final twist a bit more jaw-dropping.For those of you that watch a lot of films in this genre, I'm not saying that you won't be able to predict what's coming, but... you won't be able to predict them in the first 10 minutes...for me...that's a win.Overall, I would say this is a very enjoyable watch. Helen Hunt does not chew the scenery, and I would recommend it as a rainy day, home alone, kinda view.",I See You

This is not your run-of-the-mill formulaic thriller. I found myself saying 'what the...??' to myself fairly regularly by Act 2. You never know who you're rooting for, who is a reliable narrator and where are those MacGuffins hiding??The plot is thin, but it's filled out well with direction and acting, apart from Helen Hunt who spent the entire movie with the expression of someone who has just remembered the Vicar is coming to tea and she hasn't done anything to prepare for it.I liked the twists, i liked the story and Owen Teague who recently played the execrable Harold Lauder in The Stand (also surprisingly good) was excellent, hitting just the right note of someone unwittingly (or was he??) caught up in a seriously bonkers situation.The last third of the movie was intense as everything up and careered toward the finish line to explain, tie up loose ends and leave you with a little thinker at the end.It's on Netflix.

What gets me is the lazy details. When the cop is being 'stalked' by Alec with the axe, why have him stare blankly at that record player for so long? A cop with that much experience would never. That scene could have been so much more fast paced and believable. And the girl in the woods at the end yelling into her cellphone, come on. Run away and get taken down that way. Also - those flimsy particle board cupboards locked with zip ties? My toddler could escape those. There was a bit too much repetition for me as well; once they revealed the surprise we don't need to see it all over again from the other persons perspective.

Its obvious the producers wanted her for name recognition and gambled that the reaction to her messed up plastic surgery wouldn't be what it is. Please next time Hollywood, find actors who don't look like aliens after plastic surgery. Its a sad commentary on why actors should not mess with father time and just age naturally. A naturally aged Helen Hunt would have been totally fine.One comment said she looked great - must have been either Helen Hunt posting that, a relative, or a plastic surgeon.",I See You

Three things immediately strike me:
1) over rated fixed reviews

588,CTap96,Well Crafted,8,9 April 2020,"First off, I want to say that I am sick about all the people bashing Helen Hunt's appearance. I thought this was the age of anti-internet bullying. Just because someone has had work done, does not give any of us the license to be cruel about their appearance. If you know her personally, are in her line of work, or are a qualified doctor, contact her or her agent and have a conversation. Or, if you're someone who, if you were in her position, would enjoy having the same kinds of things said about you, criticize on.Now, about the movie. It started out like a paranormal thriller, and paranormal things make me giggle. I was giggling the first 20 minutes. Then everything switched, and it became a different genre all together, and I was into it. The ending of any story will make or break it. The ending of this story made it. After watching and thinking about it, all I can say it is a tight, clever story. Well worth the watch.",I See You
589,meganeoglevie,What in the world?,2,19 April 2020,"It's clear to me that the people who gave this flick high scores either worked on the film or know someone who did. Or, they got paid to leave good reviews.I have loved Helen Hunt's work since childhood when she used to play mean, snobby, little jerks, through all of her adult roles, so I was terribly disappointed to feel like I'd been betrayed by a lifelong friend. I know it's not altogether her fault, if at all. I just found all of the acting to feel detached, uninhabited. Actors acting. Not once did I feel swept up in the story, except perhaps when Libe Barer was in the scene. She was exquisitely believable as a teenage girl thrilled by phrogging. There was no depth to any of the other characters. Is that the actors' faults, or the director's?The only even barely redeeming quality to the movie was a plot twist about halfway through when it was made clear that the character you assumed did the bad thing was revealed to not have done it, when you learn who did. But that is it. All the other potentially interesting story lines were so watered down as to make it a film of barely-there stories, each one separated from the other, brought together in a mishmash concoction that had no grip to it. I was grateful when it was finally over.The long slow shots had me hitting the fast forward button more than once, partly due to the sound design which seemed overwhelmingly creepy on shots that otherwise would just be a suburban house or living room.I'll refrain from expounding very greatly on my disappointment at seeing that Ms Hunt has fallen into the celebrity trap of plastic surgery. There IS beauty in the natural order of things, and I hope one day soon our society will accept women over 40, 50 & up for the exquisite grace that comes with years. Think Katherine Hepburn, Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave. It makes me grateful to be of modest means so as to avoid the temptation.",I See You

When the two home invaders are introduced you can already tell what's been happening, so there's literally no point of watching any further.This movie wants to do something bigger than it could realistically ever hope to achieve (which is a 2/10 movie).Most shocking thing about this film is the high ratings it gets...Feels like I'd watched something entirely different.",I See You

I understand these elements are to keep the audience guessing and throw us off course, it was just poorly executed to the point it was boring.

While it's far from being a perfect movie, it's entertaining, has a good story, and is plenty suspenseful.The story does repeat itself though, albeit through a different set of characters point-of-view, halfway through the film. While this second pass explains the odd things that were happening the first time the story is told, it does start to feel a bit long and repetitive (even though the audience is getting knew information from the different point-of-view).Overall, though, there's plenty of twists that you'll never see coming (mixed in with a few giant cliches that you knew were bound to happen from the beginning).

There are some drawn out parts where you just want to say, ""alright already move on."" One long part was filmed in a video camera style. That style is antiquated and boring. I don't watch my own home movies without editing them first. Music was not a great choice and not sure if they knew what they wanted or just compromised. The right music sets the tone without realizing you hear music. When its over you will definitely keep talking about it with whom ever you watch it with, and will analyze over and over again. But, not willing to rewatch to verify any holes. One scene a woman asks Helen Hunt's character about the investigation. Hunt seemed cold. It feels like the director wants you to feel its a small town, but is it really? Don't really know the characters. No depth, no passion, a good anger seen from the son. You really want to love them or hate them so at the end you are either heart broken or happy with the outcome. No matter what, definitely surprised.",I See You

It's not supernatural - I don't consider this a spoiler. It's just a warning to anyone looking for some ghosts because this isn't that movie. This movie is for the open minded. I think it's unfair to give the movie a low rating just because you expected ghosts. 2. It's a story with a twist you will not see coming. It has a steady build up that might make you think you know where it's headed and may seem strange and even silly at times, but coming from someone who is a thriller movie fanatic, I had chills and a jaw drop. It definitely did not go in the ""typical"" direction I expected and turned out to be very clever.

It uses the idea of changed perspective but done pretty poorly compared to other movies that use it. It prides itself off being a movie that keeps you guessing. But as soon as the perspective changes (less than halfway through the movie) you instantly realize who the new male character is and also the person behind it all.

Movies with award-winning photography, acting and stories.But having read some of the glowing review for I see You, I realise there is a generation of movie goers who do not have the same standards as me and others.What is wrong with I see You? Well the fact it only cost $3 million tells you something. Tells you a lot. Tells you they couldn't be bothered to make a decent movie. They went for the hand held shaky camera option which I have to say I hate. I hate it in horror movies and I hate it in thrillers. It's lazy, boring and very irritating.Someone said I had to see I See You, 'it's great'. Oh no it's awful. Badly acted, a boring story but worst of all is there are no proper scenes. We're meant to believe people spend their lives walking around with a camcorder recording everything. You know why they did that, because the director couldn't be bothered to set up the scenes properly. Couldn't be bothered with the lighting, camera angles, etc. Nothing. In fact the lighting in this movie is terrible.I also couldn't finish the movie. It got me so annoyed I stopped watching 45 minutes in.Garbage from start to finish. Cheap and lazy. 1/10.",I See You

Definitely recommend checking this out!",I See You
687,sbrimberg,"I See You, Too",2,18 March 2021,"I'm one of those people who most often pushes through a book I'm not enjoying for two reasons: first, I figure, this thing has been accepted for publication, has made it through editorial, has actually been published, and is popular. If I'm hating it, must be my fault. Second, It's the old story of throwing good money after bad. I keep hoping things will turn around. Now, after having spent almost two hours on this movie for those same reasons, I'm left with the same feeling I get when I've missed the parking meter by five minutes and there's a ticket on my windshield.My objections and questions:
1. I think it's finally occurred to me that I like Helen Hunt better as a person (although I don't know her) than as an actress. Even in the Mad About You days, it was Paul Reiser who drove the comedy. She was the beautiful foil. I know that it lacks a kind of fairness, especially in these times, to talk about a woman's face, but an actor's face is one of his/her principle tools, so I'll plow ahead. I don't know if Helen Hunt has had any work done (no criticism if she has; I'm a fan of cosmetic surgery done well if that's what a person wants to do), but in I See You, her face looks so smooth and taut that very little in the way of emotions register. This isn't helped by her often wooden delivery of her lines. I get that she's forcing herself to try to be cheerful and normal in order to try to to reach her angry son, but it's not only in those scenes. I never believe her character. I'm always saying to myself, ""That's Helen Hunt acting."" Also, not her fault, but how about a little makeup? Get those deep set eyes out of her brow a bit.
2. One of the very first things we see is 10-year-old Justin getting kidnapped in the woods. But not just getting mugged and pulled into a car. Flying, flying up into the air backwards, a clear sign to me that this is an alien abduction at least. Reinforcing that premise is the abundance of drone shots, suggesting that there are supernatural forces at work. But then, at the end, nothing about that. It's just a garden variety human serial killer/kidnapper. So was that flying supposed to be? A metaphor? Sorry. Not fair.
3. I won't even touch the whole parallel plot of Phrogging, which explains so many of the mysterious events going on in the house (the missing mug, the mug that not only falls down off the roof, but arcs out at just the right angle to hit Tommy in the head, the missing flatware, the missing photos, Greg getting locked in the closet, and the music on the turntable). I mean, aside from the fact that, on some level, they all sort of accept these very spooky events in a way (blame them on Connor's bad mood?), well, okay, pretty dubious, but you would think they'd want to spend a little more time and energy unpacking these things even if it's by interrogating Connor. Greg is a detective, after all.
4. The music is heavy, ominous, spooky, and terrific. Just not for this movie.Now onto the mess of the climax and the ending:
5. a. Greg was kidnapping kids into a trailer in the woods, to do what? When is he there? What is he feeding them? Where are they going to the bathroom? What are his intentions?
b. Are we supposed to believe that Greg is a copycat criminal or that the person in jail for the Swiss Army knife crimes has been framed by Greg? His partner, an African-American cop with an unlikely German last name (Spitzky-okay, possible, but why?) wanders around in bewilderment. That's fine, Spitzky, you're right: it doesn't make any sense.
c. Was that a bag of green Swisss Army knives in the trailer? Aside from psychotic criminals in cat-and-mouse crime movies, the closest I come to understanding why Greg is leaving these knives around is Marv from Home Alone, turning on the faucets of the houses he robs so he and Harry will be known as the Wet Bandits. Just stupid.
d. I admit I may have missed a detail, but once it's discovered, at the house, that Greg is the bad guy, how do the police find out there's a trailer in the woods and where it is? Who knows the way? Greg can't tell them; Alec killed him. And again, how are those two kids alive and pretty well?
e. And Jackie's reaction: pretty much nothing. Shock? Maybe, but I'd have preferred a little hysteria here.6. And now, the part that makes the least sense of all: Tommy and Jackie were high school sweethearts. By now, they have to be in their forties, right? Alec, the Pfrogger, is a teenager. Or maybe he's supposed to be a college student. Give him early twenties, even though it's a stretch. Yet, at the end, the two of them are walking along the train track as children, approximately the same age, buddies, when they encounter Greg, who looks like he's offering them a green Swiss Army knife. Wha'? I mean, the close-up of young Alec, pre-orthodontia, cutting up and back with the close-up of present-day Alec on the gurney, that's supposed to let us know that it's Alec, no? So, the ridiculous anachronism aside, does Alex recognize Greg when he's still in the house? Or, oh no, is the train track scene supposed to be another metaphor?I just don't understand the number of good reviews this film has gotten. I think it's a package of tropes that doesn't hang together.",I See You

I was very pleasantly surprised to feel my heart beating faster and I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. During this time of quarantine, I've been watching a good number of movies and I've not been too picky, so it was a treat to come across a movie that got my blood pumping. I thought it was going to be a paranormal premise and I was a little disappointed about that but then events were explained and it turned out that the cause of everything could be attributed to normal, everyday occurrences and actions by normal, everyday people. I may be naive, but I just like to be entertained. So, when seemingly ""good"" people end up being the villain and then the villain is good again- I'm not mad or confused, I'm surprised and entertained! I thought it all meshed well and the ending wrapped things up fairly well but I would've like more explanation about ""why???"" But, there are those viewers who like to be left to fill in the blanks.

The movie directly starts with a creepy vibe music and it keeps going like that throughout the whole thing. Sometimes less is more and this is a perfect example. At the parts when it should have been creepy, it wasn't any more, as the music has already drilled our ears to death. The acting of the mother was weird and the whole thing with the family not forgiving her was a bit over the top from acting point of view. The end twist was interesting but the part from the second perspective (of the kids in the house) was dragged out for too long.Overall, considering above mentioned points and all the classic horror movie ""stupid"" moments, movie was a bit of a disappointment.

721,kaiulani-94071,"A few turn offs, but satisfying overall",8,11 April 2021,"Yes, there are some things to overlook -- striking appearances, the cheap cinematography early on, and some bad and/or amateur acting here and there -- but once the film settles in, it really isn't as bad as the ratings suggest. The setup and structuring early on could've used a little more work, but once the setups begin to pay off, you'll find yourself willing to overlook the film's flaws. It's a slow burn, but a serviceable thriller, nonetheless. Like many other viewers, I agree that the early section of the film isn't its most appealing, but the scenes are necessary and once you get about halfway in, you won't want to turn it off.",I See You
722,rebeccaduer,"Not a horror film, but even better!",10,3 June 2020,"This isn't a horror movie. It is a psychological thriller told from two different perspectives! It is a 'pull you feet up, knees to chest, nail biting' thriller. Not one ounce of predictability, and an amazing plot twist!",I See You
723,ayu-35644,Surprising story line!,8,8 May 2021,"It was surprisingly good, you can't expect to know what you're diving into. The storyline was really a great factor that makes this movie so enjoyable. However, I won't say the same for the actors and their work. But regardless of the mishaps in acting, it's syill really interesting and engaging. This movie deserves a better rating.",I See You
724,jmccadden-76227,Amazing !! So many twists and turns,9,19 September 2020,"I went into this movie not expecting much, thinking it would be your typical cliche paranormal horror. But I was far from right.This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole 97 mins. If you're a fan of mystery horrors that keep you guessing until the last scene, then definitely do not give this one a miss!Not only was the story line gripping and excellently put together but the production and camera work was brilliant. The score added a chilling feel that caused the hairs to stand on the back of my neck.Highly highly recommend",I See You

728,nicrob-93414,Awful casting,6,31 August 2020,In her day Helen Hunt would have been perfect for this role. It's hard to see past how awful she now looks and how unconvincing her character is. I actually didn't want to believe this once beautiful woman is reduced to this. The film could be good but Hunt is not the wife who would have the affair and keep both men,I See You

734,bj-55612,Great story but could have been tightened up a little,6,8 October 2019,"It's not easy to review this film without giving too much away, as there is a twist in the tale.
It is part murder mystery and part family drama with some points teasing at supernatural goings-on.
We have a couple trying to get through a recent affair and their teenage son reacting very negatively. This gets overshadowed by some unusual occurrences in the house and a recent spate of missing children, which is being investigated by our poor cheated-on husband.
The film shifts entirely halfway through and we start seeing the story from another perspective.
Though the twist and the execution are very clever, the second half needs trimming. We are shown things that are somewhat unnecessary and the set-up for this act is a little long.
What could have been a great film is just a good one because of the overly long reveals at the end.",I See You
735,vipbrowneyes,Did not expect that,9,1 April 2020,Personally I think this should have made it into the theaters over many others,I See You
736,Platebreaker2,Excellent Storytelling in a Slow and Deliberate Unfolding,9,30 May 2020,"This is a well-told story that slowly unfolds with an unconventional timeline. It may seem a little slow, for some, in the beginning, but stick with it. The pace is purposeful. The bad reviews seem to come from people who are more interested in simple blood and gore horror. This is horror, too... but it is also, suspense, mystery, and thriller. It was obvious from the beginning that the viewer would be exposed to multiple storylines, but the deliberate layering pays off later with a reveal most won't see coming.",I See You

738,rmelvin-34658,Loved it !,10,4 April 2020,"I wanted to see it right from watching the trailer. Was feeling a bit disappointed when I thought the movie was following a "" Same old same old "" direction. Then it went scattershot in all kinds of F'd up. Not usually left feeling like I saw something new but this time is different.",I See You
