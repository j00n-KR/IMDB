0,SnoopyStyle,great sex scenes,7,2 June 2016,"Amy Townsend (Amy Schumer) sleeps around taking a page out of her womanizing divorced father Gordon (Colin Quinn). Her younger sister Kim (Brie Larson) is the opposite being married with a stepson. They're moving their father into assisted living. Amy and her gay-adjacent boyfriend Steven (John Cena) break up. Her boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) assigns her sports surgeon Dr. Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) because she doesn't like sports. She finds that she's falling for Dr. Conners.Amy Schumer is funny doing her drunken slutty mess character. She's a functional actor otherwise. With some work, she could improve. Director Judd Apatow is able bring out some hilarious scenes and add in a sweet romance. Some have complained about the length of Apatow's movies. Two hours is a little long but the easiest way to cut from this movie is to eliminate John Cena. That would rip my heart out because he's hilarious. In fact, almost every sex scene is full-on hilarity. There are loads of big laughs.As for the romance, Bill Hader is a super nice guy. His nice guy nature is front and center. His friendship with Lebron is fun. He might be too nice. It's missing one of the basic rom-com tropes. The couple needs to first fight to heat up the relationship. They get together so easily and so quickly that the relationship never seems to be in danger. It's sweet but the drama is not that intense. Amy's chemistry with Brie Larson is even better. Their relationship is deeper and fuller. If JLaw doesn't have the time, Brie should do the sisters movie with Amy that they're writing.",Trainwreck
1,Prismark10,Just a wreck,1,15 January 2016,"Trainwreck is written by Amy Schumer who also stars as a professional writer (Amy) who is a good time party girl, sleeping around and drinking a lot. Her father told his kids when they were young that monogamy sucks. Amy has a series of one night stands and she literally throws the man out of the bed once they have climaxed.However once she meets celebrity sports surgeon Aaron (Bill Hader) who she has sent to do a story on and who falls for her, Amy realises that her life was actually in a rut and deep down wants commitment.I should had sensed trouble when my daughter refused to watch the film on account that she finds Amy Schumer horrible. I was expecting a gross out comedy with slap stick and bad taste.What I got was some pseudo comedy with third rate Woody Allen undertones, empty characterisation and over-long. I really could not wait for this dismal film to end.What is worse apart from some celebrity cameos there is also an Oscar winning actress in this movie, Tilda Swinton and centenarian Norman Lloyd who started out with Orson Welles.In fact you know the film is bad when the funniest person in it is wrestler John Cena.",Trainwreck
2,nogodnomasters,FUDGE RIPPLE ICE CREAM,7,22 June 2018,"Amy Schumer wrote and starred in the title role. Her movie personality is very much like her onstage stand up persona. If you have seen her just a few times, the sexual humor and jokes will seem stale. I laughed really hard the first time I heard them. Messed up by her absentee father as a child, Amy has trouble with long term relationships (as measured with a watch and not a calender) which leads to many sexual role reversal scenes that seem artificial especially the one with LeBron James, who like Amy played himself. As a writer, Amy meets Dr. Aaron Connors (Bill Hader with nerd glasses), the premier sports doctor and a man who is basically too good for her. There are things going on with her sister, father etc.I did enjoy the Marv Albert scene. Tilda Swinton was great. I am not partial to successful director/producer Judd Apatow as is the general population. I thought his influence turned what could have been a classic into one we will forget...""No not 'Bridesmaid', that other one...you know, the one with the chunky blonde in it."" I am just kidding Amy, I think you're great and I know the Hebrew alphabet. ;) The film had some really good scenes and a few that didn't work. For people who have never seen Amy Schumer, you are in for a real treat.Guide: F-bomb, lots of sex, male hard body butts (John Cena).",Trainwreck
3,kosmasp,Dating Queen,7,30 April 2016,"It's the German title of the movie. Yes they always have to alter stuff like that, for whatever reason. They probably know best. It also sheds a different light on our main character here. Amy Sch. is a great stand up comedian, even if some of her material does offend a lot of people (which is more than intended).And any movie that can make John Cena (Wrestler) and LeBron James look funny and sort of natural (both but especially the former really poking fun at themselves as much as is possible), has done something right. Now I'm not sure little ""victories"" like that do count to your viewing pleasure or if you're down with a woman being the aggressor and the male the one seeking a relationship and monogamy. But if you do, there is a little raw gem to be found here",Trainwreck
4,lee_eisenberg,live however you can,8,29 November 2015,"I learned of Amy Schumer in the past year or two. I haven't seen any of her stand-up performances, but I understand that they're pretty raunchy. Having seen ""Trainwreck"", I have a good impression of her. Some of the movie's is plain old sophomoric stuff, but it manages to address relationships seriously. I guess that if I had any problem with the movie, it's the repeatedly appearances by noted athletes. It seems as if they did that just to show off the athletes. But other than that I liked the movie. I hope that Amy Schumer makes more movies, and I'm going to have to start watching her show.I think that Amy Schumer and Melissa McCarthy should co-star in a movie. Preferably with Margaret Cho.",Trainwreck
5,jboothmillard,Trainwreck,6,23 August 2015,"I saw the leading actress and writer chatting about this film on The Graham Norton Show, from the trailer it looked like an alternative rom-com, it wasn't what I expected having seen the trailer, but I did watch it all, directed by Judd Apatow (The 40 Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Funny People). Basically young sisters Amy (Devin Fabry) and Kim (Carly Oudin) are told by their father Gordon Townsend (Colin Quinn) that he and their mother are divorcing because monogamy isn't realistic, he uses a doll to illustrate the metaphor that he wants to be with other women. Twenty-three years later, Kim (Brie Larson) ignored this because she resented her father's constant sleeping around, drunkenness and cheating on her mother, she is married to Tom (Mike Birbiglia), but Amy (Amy Schumer, also writing) lives what she sees as an uninhibited life, with no boring romantic commitment, regularly getting drunk and stoned, partying and sleeping with various men, but no sleepovers, but she is dating gym-addict Steven (John Cena). Amy works as a writer for men's magazine S'nuff, during a meeting for pitches with editor Dianna (Tilda Swinton) Amy talks about her thoughts that sports are stupid, and with that Dianna assigns her take on the sports section article, she will interview sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), despite the fact she doesn't want it. Amy goes ahead with the scheduled interviews with the charming and successful sports doctor, soon after after a couple of interviews Aaron asks her for a date, she is apprehensive for a while, but eventually, during a date, she breaks up with Steven, admitting she sleeps with other men, he is crushed and leaves. Amy slowly finds herself falling into the article she is writing, and dating him often, and eventually giving in and sleeping with him, she finds herself falling for Aaron, she starts to question herself and thinking that if guys she has been with are on to something. Despite him saying often, Amy cannot truly give into her affections and be committed towards Aaron, her article seems to disinterest Dianna, who fires her, Amy opens up about her feelings to LeBron James, Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert and Marv Albert, and in the end she decides that she is truly willing to commit with Aaron, performing a cheer leading routine to get his attention, in the end they embrace true love. Also starring Vanessa Bayer as Nikki, Dave Attell as Noam, Randall Park as Bryson, The Perks of Being a Wallflower's Ezra Miller as Donald, Daniel Radcliffe as The Dogwalker (the movie within the movie) and Marisa Tomei as The Dog Owner (also the movie within the movie). Schumer is likable as the not conventionally attractive promiscuous and commitment-phobic ""trainwreck"" of the title, Hader is alright as the guy she fancies, but the one that surprised was Swinton as the brassy editor, I had no idea it was her until I came out of the cinema, she pulled off the American accent impeccably and was fantastically feisty. Schumer as well as being a good actress, with her career in stand-up and sketch shows, has made a well delivered script, I admit I did find little bits slowing things down, but the overall on and off love story is interesting, and there were a few moments that crack a smile and get a good laugh, a worthwhile enough romantic comedy. Good!",Trainwreck
6,Quinoa1984,a smart and sharp romantic comedy that does a clever gimmick but keeps it real,8,1 September 2015,"Trainwreck is one of those winning cases of an original movie being a success from this summer. Director Judd Apatow makes Amy Schumer (also the writer) a star with just one movie. It reverses the roles of a romantic comedy, and in this case the woman here is the one who ""sleeps around"" a lot, then meets the man who clicks with her and then the tropes ensue. What makes it all work is that Apatow, Schumer (who also writes the script) and Hader and Quinn et al *commit* to it and the acting is really terrific across the board.And it is FUNNY throughout, very funny, all about behavior and not even innuendo, just coming out and saying things. It has people you also wouldn't usually expect in a movie like this, people like John Cena and even more surprisingly basketball star Lebron James, and, no kidding 100 year old Norman Llloyd. I recommend it, except for one caveat: it's too long. Apatow needs an editor to tell him no, but he won't listen since he doesn't have to. Thus we get a very good movie in the style of his influences, James L Brooks and John Cassavetes once again. Though with Schumer in the lead, it's crass in the best ways and likable too.",Trainwreck
7,tavm,Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow's Trainwreck is a very funny adult comedy,9,6 August 2015,"Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. Amy Schumer wrote and stars as a promiscuous woman who works at a magazine that writes articles about sexuality and celebrity. So the fact her next assignment is about a sports doctor (Bill Hader) who has celeb patients and celeb friends like LeBron James, well, it's not something she's really interested in but when she meets him...There's more like her family relations with her misogynistic dad (Colin Quinn) and her domestic sister (Brie Larson) and many of her conquests, especially with John Cena, but I'll just now say that me and my friend really laughed hard at many of the comments Schumer makes throughout the movie. I liked her comment about cheerleaders the best. I also liked her use of Billy Joel's songs ""Uptown Girl"" and ""A Matter of Trust"". Or was that director Judd Apatow's idea? Anyway, I and my friend highly recommend Trainwreck.",Trainwreck
8,writers_reign,Doctors And Curses,5,22 August 2015,"Essentially this is a one-trick pony with no surprises, the kind, in fact, where the prologue telegraphs the wind-up which means that your level of enjoyment will largely depend on how you feel about a leading lady whose potty mouth makes Joan Rivers sound like Audrey Hepburn and whose sexual escapades make Madonna look like Doris Day. Amy Schumer, who also wrote the screenplay clearly favours the scatter-gun approach to raunchy, cramming in so many verbals and visuals that the law of averages decrees that at least one or two will resonate with even the most puritanical. It doesn't help that leading man Bill Hader bears such a close resemblance to the young Stephen Sondheim that you keep expecting to hear Schumer break into Another Hundred Make-Outs. Just about passable for one viewing.",Trainwreck
9,grantss,Has its moments but mostly quite dull,4,31 May 2016,"Amy's (played by Amy Schumer) parents divorced when she was still a child. Her father didn't believe in monogamy, and this left an impression on Amy. 23 years later she lives by her father's model, sleeping around and not believing in long-term relationships. Then she falls for a sports doctor, Aaron (Bill Hader), and everything changes.Some very funny moments, but these are few and far between. Mostly quite dull or silly. The plot was very unoriginal, predictable and basic. The romance/drama side doesn't work at all. The best comedic moments are provided by Colin Quinn, but unfortunately he doesn't get much screen time. Amy Schumer the actress does okay. It's Amy Schumer the writer that's largely to blame for this movie.",Trainwreck
10,oscaralbert,It's hard to say whether TRAINWRECK is more like . . .,9,27 July 2015,". . . STRANGERS ON A TRAIN or TRAINSPOTTING. The people at my showing were laughing more than at the other movies mentioned above, which is a big plus. TRAINWRECK seems about as long as STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and TRAINSPOTTING put together, which is another bonus, since that means you're getting more movie for your money (not unlike those folks who pay the regular amount for baseball tickets, and then are treated to an 18-inning game). TRAINWRECK is by an American director (unlike that Hitchcock guy who filmed STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), so the characters in it speak the American version of English (whereas the guys in TRAINSPOTTING were so incoherent that they had to subtitle the movie for showings on this side of Columbus' ocean). That's all to the good. Even though TRAINWRECK takes place in New York City, which has plenty of train traffic, the only mass transit vehicle I remember seeing is the Staten Island ferry, yet one more benefit to those who dislike train movies because they fear derailments (or GODZILLA picking up one of the cars). TRAINWRECK could be the best Train Movie since the original How to Train Your Dragon.",Trainwreck
11,neil-476,Exceeded my expectations by far,9,21 August 2015,"Amy writes snarky pieces for a snarky New York magazine. She also drinks too much and too often, and has a great deal of sex with a large number of highly unsuitable male partners (possibly as a reaction to a childhood explanation of his infidelity from her father), and has an uneasy relationship with her homemaker younger sister who she clearly greatly envies. Then she is given an assignment of a hatchet-piece on rather nerdy sports doctor Aaron and, to her discomfiture, finds herself completely unprepared for having feelings towards him.This quasi-autobiographical tale, penned by and starring Amy Schumer (who I didn't much like, from interviews), and run through the Judd Apatow production and directing machine, is not a film I was looking forward to. I don't care for excessive profanity and coarseness when it is there just for the sake of it, and everything I heard and read, and my experience of Apatow, told me that was what I was in for. And then Amy Schumer pulled a Bridesmaids on me by delivering a film full of profanity and coarseness, and using it to tell a story so full of heart that it had me in tears three times (it is the first time that hearing Billy Joel has ever had me welling up). While it is undoubtedly amusing, it turned out to be a drama and character piece, and a good one, too.The supporting cast was terrific – an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton in particular – with Schumer and Bill Hader as Aaron both being first rate. I have two minor criticisms: one, the romcom formula is followed somewhat obviously and, two, the film is judgemental on what Amy does, rather than why she does it. Neither of these made the slightest difference to my enjoyment.I have reported on 125 previously unseen (by me) films in 2015 to date, and none has exceeded my expectations by such a wide margin as Trainwreck. I loved it, and I loved Amy Schumer in it.",Trainwreck
12,evanston_dad,Amy Schumer Vechicle Highlights How Not Funny Amy Schumer Is,6,28 April 2016,"I've seen Amy Schumer make a couple of pretty funny appearances at award shows in the past year, and so I was quite surprised by how unfunny I found her in this comedy vehicle whose sole reason for existence is to showcase her. She's an irritating presence on film, and though her character to a certain extent is supposed to be, I don't think she's supposed to be to the point where we stop rooting for her and wish there was something else to watch. There are some other people in the film, like Bill Hader and an uproarious Tilda Swinton, who manage to keep the film funny enough to stick with, but the only reason I don't categorize it as a major disappointment is that I didn't have high expectations for it in the first place.The film goes through its predictable paces, and I arrived at the ending about 30 minutes before the movie did. Did it really have to be over 2 hours long? Grade: B-",Trainwreck
13,anaconda-40658,Schumer Wrecked.,10,29 July 2015,"Trainwreck (2015): Dir: Judd Apatow / Cast: Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Colin Quinn, Brie Larson, LeBron James: Another Judd Apatow comedic masterpiece with a title that symbolizes the struggles of maintaining relationships and clashing personalities. Amy Schumer plays Amy Townsend who works at a magazine outlet where she is put in charge of an article on a sports doctor named Aaron Connors. She hates sports but that is the least of her concerns. She goes through men like underwear night after night, refusing to spend the night after sex. Bill Hader has a more calm role than usual playing Dr. Connors. Sports teams trust him and his likable nature but when he meets Amy and discovers her dislike for sports despite the article, he moves on with his curiosity. She struggles to commit whereas he is close knit with those around him, particularly LeBron James who plays himself stealing several comic scenes. He gives Connors advice while skipping out on restaurant tabs. Colin Quinn steals scenes as Amy's father whose advice when she was younger was damaging. He cheated on her mother and constantly boozed. He now resides in a nursing home where his crass demeanor wins no prizes for social enlightenment. Brie Larson plays Amy's sister Kim, who is married and has a stepson, and is currently pregnant. Her reaction to their father is less sympathetic and her life is viewed as too together by Amy. Apatow reveals a strong theme regarding dealing with relationships within all areas in one's life but the real trainwreck comes with the realization that one causes their own wreckage with a future of promised mending. Score: 10 / 10",Trainwreck
14,FlashCallahan,Apt title.....,3,9 August 2015,"Ever since her father drilled into her head that monogamy isn't realistic, magazine writer Amy has made promiscuity her trademark, her shield. As much as she enjoys a life free of commitment, Amy is really just rolling with the motions, wasting her night getting wasted. While writing a profile about charming and successful sports doctor Aaron Conners, she finds herself falling in love for the first time, and Aaron seems to like her too. Amy starts to wonder if it's time to clean up her act........Judd Apatow, what went wrong? After the brilliantly stupid 40 Year Old Virgin, you decided to go all snobby and just make films about the middle class and their problems dealing with the real world. In Apatow's world, according to the focus character of the narrative, people who settle down are boring, and dull, and too safe, until they have a moment of self realisation toward the end and everyone makes up.And it's no different here. Amy Schumer isn't really a big deal here in the UK, and after seeing this, she needs to pick better projects. Her acting is perfectly fine, it's just her character is so spiteful, so selfish, so bitter, that you couldn't care less what happens to her.And you really wonder what Aaron really sees in her, because she is one of these people you'd cross the road to avoid, and you'd avoid all of her associates to boot, because they are just as poisonous as her.Apatow seems to think that the height of humour is alcoholism, homophobia, sexism, and everyone's favourite, Mental Health Issues, seriously one of the key comedy set pieces involves Amy attempting to have sex with an underage (unbeknown to her) boy with ADHD, oh how I laughed.But despite all of Amy's behaviour toward people that actually care for her, she comes all good at the end, because she realises that sleeping around with everyone isn't really the best way to get on in life, sometimes it's actually quite nice to have someone in your life to share heartache and good times with.Good for her!!! What a role medal for everyone.It's a smug, self centred, up its own backside piece of snobbery that should be avoided. It's making me angry whilst writing about the wretched thing.Apatow? Apa-Low.",Trainwreck
15,phd_travel,"For fans of Amy Schumer, her comedy delivers",8,12 December 2015,Amy Schumer has more or less successfully put her brand of humor into a comedy with some autobiographical elements. She plays a girl who has many men in her life until she meets a sports doctor (Bill Hader).You will laugh. There are some really funny love scenes and a very original eulogy. Some big name sports stars like LeBron James as well as John Cena make cameos and they are quite funny in their comic roles. Brie Larson as her sister is a little under used. The cheer leading thing at the end is a bit painful but kudos to her for keeping up with the real thing. The ending kind of runs out of jokes but there are enough. Another minus point is the not terribly convincing chemistry with Bill Hader. They are just too different and look like they wouldn't work out in real life.Worth a watch.,Trainwreck
16,zetes,I'm not really a big Amy Schumer fan in the first place,6,20 July 2015,"Okay, right off the bat, I have to confess something: I don't really like Amy Schumer. I don't exactly dislike her, mind you, but I find her persona kind of tiresome, maybe a little cliché. I watched the entire first season of her show and liked approximately one sketch. I would sit stonefaced through entire episodes. I hear it gets better in the second season, but I'm not really eager to find out. I went to her big movie debut mostly because I'm a Judd Apatow fan. His regular flaws, though, were never going to help me fall for Schumer. As one might expect with Apatow, the film runs on for far too long, and when there's someone I don't really find that funny at the center, it feels even longer. There are a lot of good comedy ringers in the cast, including Vanessa Bayer, Dave Attell, Jon Glaser, Mike Birbiglia and Tim Meadows. Each get about one good scene before they fade into the background. Perhaps the most successful part of the film are the athletes who show up, often playing themselves, in particular LeBron James and John Cena, both of whom are hilarious. Bill Hader plays Schumer's love interest and doesn't get much to do, but he has a few funny scenes. Brie Larson plays Schumer's sister and is quite good (it's the least comic role in the film). Someone had the terrible idea to resurrect Colin Quinn to play their dad. I definitely laughed plenty throughout the film, but there are tons of comic lines and bits that fall flat. It might be worth a rental or the equivalent.",Trainwreck
17,namashi_1,A Great Romantic-Comedy from Judd Apatow!,9,2 August 2015,"Judd Apatow delivers A Great Romantic-Comedy with 'Trainwreck'. Its lighthearted, hilarious & also heartfelt. Also, the performances are of high-order!'Trainwreck' Synopsis: Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy.I Loved 'Trainwreck'. Despite a highly sexed & unlikely protagonist, the narrative never gets uncomfortable. Amy Schumer is at the of her game, quite literally! Her Screenplay is penned with moments of hilarity & heartfelt emotions. Though crude, there is still a sweetness to the story, which certainly works! Apatow's Direction is excellent. 'Trainwreck' ranks amongst his finest films to date. Jody Lee Lipes's Cinematography is perfect. Paul Zucker's Editing is good. Jon Brion's Score is decent.Performance-Wise: Schumer is splendid. A sensational performance! Bill Hader is wonderfully restrained. Brie Larson is fantastic, she's emerging into a versatile performer! Tilda Swinton is matchless, yet again! Colin Quinn is in fine form. WWE Superstar John Cena springs a pleasant surprise. He enacts a funny part, with superb comic-timing.On the whole, 'Trainwreck' works big time! Heavily Recommended!",Trainwreck
18,StevePulaski,A strong comedic vehicle amidst some lesser elements,7,18 July 2015,"Amy (Amy Schumer) is a woman with a personal ideology I presume many women today have, which is put themselves before anyone else and get themselves on a successful path before worrying about a relationship. This self-sufficiency is commendable and a pleasant indication of how far gender roles have been subverted in the present, but Amy's ideology is one of manipulation and selfishness. Working as a writer for a sensationalist rag, she spends most of her time hooking up with numerous men, not telling them all she wants is a one night stand. Furthermore, she always finds an excuse to leave in the morning, leaving her hookups clueless and used.As one can imagine, massive confusion sets in not only when Amy is tasked to write an article on acclaimed athletic doctor Dr. Aaron Conners (Bill Harder), but starts to find herself in love with him. Aaron is simple, charming, and, most importantly, accepting of Amy's undisciplined vices, be it excessive drinking, smoking, or having sex, be it by blissful ignorance or pure choice. On top of juggling this, Amy must take care of her aging father (Colin Quinn), who was the inspiration behind her mindset to forgo monogamy in favor for something with no commitment, as he hops from several nursing homes with the opposition being her sister (Brie Larson). Amy has always sided with her father and his decisions, whilst her sister condemns him for leaving her mom and not recognizing her stepchild as his grandson.Amy's contemptibility ostensibly brings down the quality of Judd Apatow's ""Trainwreck,"" though that's quite the contrary. Between Schumer's biting, no- limits comic performance, her quip-heavy, fast-paced writing, and a strong supporting cast, ""Trainwreck"" works as a solid vehicle for Schumer's talent in a mainstream setting. To be fair, though, Schumer's style of comedy isn't anything new or groundbreaking. In a world where Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, and Melissa McCarthy have ditched the conventional, ladylike disposition for something racier and more crass, Schumer's lengthy monologue about fishing a condom out of her crotch and her numerous sexual encounters is hardly a cinematic taboo anymore. Yet that doesn't mean her comic energy isn't something to discourage. Her ability to assimilate into numerous setups - a fine restaurant, a sports venue, a bar, etc - and flawlessly provide her quips and zingers is something that the most skilled comedians do with complete fluidity. The fact that she found that ability in herself at a young age shows her talent immediately.The movie around her, however, doesn't always function on a plane of with she's worthy. Amy's sorta-boyfriend in the film is a musclebound meathead played by John Cena, in an empty, seriously stupid role that does nothing for the film, and worst of all, doesn't create any kind of character despite the amount of minutes wasted on him. Also a needless distraction in the film is LeBron James in the worst kind of a role; a role that, again, provides no character and splices an instantly recognizable personality in settings you'd never expect. Therefore, you're expected to laugh at anything and everything LeBron James says simply because he's LeBron James; it's lazy screen writing.However, this kind of laziness is remedied by great supporting performances by people like Bill Hader, who continues to be a surprisingly convincing comedic and dramatic presence, and Tilda Swinton (who reunites with costar Ezra Miller from ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"") as Amy's demanding boss. Swinton dives in head first when it comes to playing a sassy and emotionally detached woman and she is one of the defining people to show that supporting characters in comedies have been greatly extended into almost primary forces in and of themselves.Whilst ""Trainwreck"" deals with hookup culture, a culture I largely detest, it is sure to examine it from an angle that's at least human and tender. It shows that even if you're lost in life and uncertain of what path to take, manipulating and leaving people in the dark as to your intentions is a cruel and disrespectful thing (even if on some occurrences, Apatow tries to lean into the comedy realm with that). However, through all its shortcomings, ""Trainwreck"" is both a strong comedy and a strong comedic vehicle for almost everyone involved.",Trainwreck
19,lasttimeisaw,"TRAINWRECK is serviceable at its very best, and the elephant-in-the-room is that has Judd Apatow lost his mojo at this point of his career?",6,22 September 2016,"American comedienne Amy Schumer's star-making mainstream rom-com, or chick flick, grossed over $110 million in North America, while its international prowess is way less impressive which heartily tells that its appeal may barely register out of its home turf.The script is written by Schumer herself and the man in the director chair is none other than Judd Apatow, his fifth feature film. TRAINWRECK starts off with a cranky divorcé Gordon Townsend (Quinn), instils the idea that monogamy doesn't work to his two young daughters, Amy was 9 and Kim was 5 then.22 years later, Amy (Schumer), now becomes a column writer for a glossy men's magazine supervised by the editor Dianna (Swinton, unrecognizable at first glance but killing all her scenes with a pungent whiff of supercilious nonchalance towards her miserable subordinates), has serious commitment issues and practices promiscuity on a daily basis; yet by a routine contrast, Kim (Larson) leans to another opposite: gets married, has a stepson, and now her own baby is on the way, whereas Gordon, in poor health condition, stays in an elderly home and squabbles with an extraordinarily sprightly centenarian Norman (Lloyd, who is born in 1914 and still with us today).Amy's current sex-mate is Steven (the WWE champion Cena, overplays gay cant and maladroit sex act out of left field), contrary to his bodybuilder appearance, he is essentially a vulnerable, non- violent family guy wants to settle down with her, naturally Amy bluntly cuts their relationship off, and Steven's last line is ""Amy, you're not nice!"". In hindsight, this is the point, Amy is not a nice gal by any standard (partially thanks to the influence of her awful father), which makes the following story of her romance with an utterly normal guy sounds and appears like pure hokum, she doesn't fit to that conventional category, she cannot just be a sucker for a harmless dude like Aaron (Hader), that's too absurd for viewers to stomach with a smiley face. However, this is where the plot insists going.Aaron, a well-to-do but slightly gawky sports doctor (therefore, we will meet a dozen cameos of celebrities from the sports field, not that I care), is Amy's subject of her next article (which is not even her pitch since she thinks sport is plainly nonsense, which I must second personally, especially for competitive sports). He is blandly good-hearted and harmless, yet, Bill Hader is no prince-charming either, after Amy lures him into sex, Aaron falls for her hard (some geeky guys are really into loose women), and against all her misgivings, Amy agrees to start a relationship with him. Everyone but Aaron dreads a disaster ending is waiting for this ill-paired couple, including Amy herself, still, she cannot forfeit the opportunity of ruining Aaron's I-need-sleep-because-I- have-a-surgery-to-perform-tomorrow-morning night while having no trepidation at that moment of how self-centred her behaviour is, well, after that, Aaron still refuses to sever the tie (hope I am not the only one who wonders what is the problem with that guy?), but it is time to take a break anyway, since Amy needs time to prepare her triumphant third act return (strenuous rehearsals are required), so she can win back the apple of her eye, just as corny as that, believe it or not, the train has crashingly derailed to a phony happy-ending, churned out to ingratiate an unearned and forced good feeling.Disguised as an earnest semi-autobiographic comedy banks on Schumer's talent, TRAINWRECK as its name overtly claims, is an unfulfilled self-reflexive journey of a liberated and independent woman in America jammed with raunchy and rowdy sketches, Schumer has busted her chops to elevate both the flick's farcical set pieces and emotional curve (if any of you who thinks Gordon Townsend is one of the best persons you have ever met, we are definitely living on two very different planets), but the sad truth is that laughter rings self-consciously harrow and teardrops have never ever left tear gland.TRAINWRECK is serviceable at its very best, and the elephant-in-the-room is that has Judd Apatow lost his mojo at this point of his career (or can we just allot all the blame to Schumer's oscillating script)? The only mildly conciliatory effect is to see an unexpected reunion of Swinton and Miller after their terrific turn in Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011), the latter is genuinely simpatico to a fault of creepiness and the former is as per usual, unbelievably chameleon-like.",Trainwreck
20,KineticSeoul,"Annoying female lead, but not a bad movie.",7,3 August 2015,"Now I am not a huge Judd Apatow fan. But I do enjoy the style of movies he comes out with when directing. And this is one of his installment that I sort of got into. As a matter of fact, I personally thought this was him at his peak especially with his early previous works. Maybe he will churn out something better, but this is a Apatow film that I was at least amused with from beginning to end. And that has to do with the execution of the awkward humor. Now the premise has been done before. Where a character that doesn't believe in love or that gets into a relationship with a person that does. But I liked the direction Apatow went with this for the most part, mainly because it has that Apatow signature vibe going for it. Which is raunchy, a bit crude but amusing without going over board. I however couldn't see what the lead male character saw in the lead female character that made him really fall for her. I mean he is a sports doctor that knows a lot of athletes and is rich. Plus the guy has integrity and a heart of gold, he could get just about any women if he wanted. And yes I know, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. But it just didn't make any sense, he just deserved better. It seemed like this was going into the radical feminist fantasy direction during certain parts which actually got quite annoying. On the plus side though, this has to have the best cameo appearances from an athletes in a movie ever. John Cena is hilarious in this and LeBron James nails it. I didn't expect LeBron's cameo scenes to be so darn entertaining to sit through, but he really works in this film. This isn't one of the best romantic comedy I have seen, but it's still a fun and amusing watch. It's a raunchy comedy that does have some genuine heart to it and I liked that. Yeah, if Amy Schumer wasn't so annoying and aggravating while spilling messages that drag down women from achieving happiness. Just so her and her group can feel better about themselves by bringing others down. And sending messages that men should put up with the crap she did in this movie and bend over backwards. I would have given it a higher score. Still not a bad movie. 7.5/10",Trainwreck
21,Hellmant,"Definitely a can't-miss, despite the usual Apatow movie flaws.",9,17 July 2015,"'TRAINWRECK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Filmmaker Judd Apatow's fifth feature film directorial effort, is the first movie he didn't also write. This comedy flick is written by it's star, stand-up comedian Amy Schumer (in her feature film debut). It tells the story of a career-driven woman, who's always been afraid of commitment, that finally meets a guy she has feelings for. The film also stars Bill Hader, Tilda Swinton, Brie Larson, Colin Quinn, Mike Birbiglia, John Cena, Ezra Miller and LeBron James. Schumer makes a very impressive 'movie star' debut and Apatow doesn't disappoint either.Amy (Schumer) was taught, by her father (Quinn) at a very young age, that true monogamy isn't possible. As an adult, she's now a successful magazine writer; that's afraid of commitment. So she constantly uses men, she meets at bars, for sex. One day her boss (Swinton) assigns her a story, on a popular sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Hader). After getting to know the guy, she's amazed to find out that she actually has romantic feelings for him. Her way of life is put to the test. I'm a huge Judd Apatow fan ('THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' is one of my all-time favorite movies) and I've really enjoyed all of his films (even 'THIS IS 40', which is definitely his weakest). They tend to be way too long (usually close to 2 hours, or more), and they also usually contain several repetitive actor 'improve scenes', that seem to never end, but they're always hilarious and heartfelt. Apatow is amazingly skilled at combining really emotional drama, with silly slapstick comedy. This film is no different, than any of his previous work, even though he didn't write it. It seems exactly like an Apatow flick, just with a female lead instead of a male; so it's really impressive that he found a female comedian/actress/writer, that seems to think just like he does! Schumer's script is brilliant, and she's also a very talented comedic actress as well. The supporting cast is awesome too; especially Swinton, who's unrecognizable yet again, and totally hot in it (Cena is a scene-stealer too). The movie is definitely a can't-miss, for fans of Apatow or Schumer, despite the usual Apatow movie flaws.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N95IMM6Vork",Trainwreck
22,cherold,A less satirical but still entertaining Schumer,7,21 December 2015,"This is a sort of reverse rom-com, in which it's the woman who is a hard-drinking commitment-phobe and the guy who is too good for her but loves her for reasons that aren't completely clear.It's a popular formula and works well, with many funny scenes and a story that keeps moving.The cast is good. Schumer and Hader don't have incredible chemistry, but they make it work, with him being just nerdy enough that you can believe he wouldn't have spent enough time dating to have developed a fear from a compulsive liar with serious self-esteem issues. Tilda Swinton is excellent as someone terrible. While it's often funny, and Schumer proves to be good at both funny and serious (and, of all things, dancing), the show is considerable less prickly than her TV series, whose mix of silliness, provocation, and cutting feminism make it one of the best sketch comedies of all time.

25,Robert_duder,The biography of Schumer's life...a trainwreck,3,27 August 2015,"I've really only been exposed to Amy Schumer's so called ""comedy"" on comedy central's Roasts. I've never found her funny. She is the worst kind of comedian in my books. She is as raunchy and disgusting as possible and then people laugh to tears because she said something dirty. So I certainly was in no hurry to see this film. It was basically exactly what one would expect from an Amy Schumer written comedy. This is her through and through and for me that's not a good thing. I'm actually shocked that Judd Apatow would agree to direct this even though he certain pushes the envelope of gross out comedies. In some ways its a by the numbers romantic comedy with a whole lot of dirty comedy and in other ways its one giant awkward comedy routine. She goes by her own name, she tells the same tired jokes she tells in her comedy act, the casting is poor, the story is slow, the pace is off...there was very little enjoyable about this. There were a few moments worthy of chuckles but that was literally despite myself. Its a dark comedy of course and if you love Amy Schumer then you will likely love this but I had to force myself through it.Amy Schumer wrote and stars in the film and she is incredibly irritating. I can't believe people see her as the next big up and comer. She is cruel and unfunny and fake and annoying. Get the picture? I hate to be so harsh but I can't stand her. Maybe someday she'll win me over but Trainwreck only served to prove my opinion. Bill Hader is cast awkwardly as her romantic interest. Hader, to me, is not exactly a leading man sort of guy. His comedy is awkward as well and he and Schumer have a very strange chemistry that doesn't really match up. Lebron James is the typical Apatow ""star"" playing himself. He does a decent job considering and has better chemistry with Hader than Schumer does. Brie Larson plays Schumer's sister and while her character is very underdeveloped she is decent. John Cena is actually a shining spot in the film. He has a small cameo as Schumer's boyfriend early on and he is really good and funny.Judd Apatow has built himself a reputation for a certain type of storytelling and comedy. Trainwreck does sort of loosely fit his style. This is the first film written by someone else that he has directed and my advice to him would be to stick to his own writing. Even when the film tries to tread into a more serious emotional turn, its too late. I didn't care about any of the characters and I really just wanted Schumer to stop talking. This really was a poor excuse for a comedy with a terrible story and unlikable annoying characters. I will do my best to pass on future Amy Schumer movies. 3/10",Trainwreck
26,ThomasDrufke,"Rehash, but it's no Trainwreck",5,21 December 2015,"It took me a long time to see this film. I wasn't thrilled with the trailers and I've never really been a fan of Amy Schumer's comedy, but I finally sat down and gave the film a shot. Only to see pretty much exactly what I expected out of this film, raunchy comedy, plenty of cameos, clichéd story, and a lengthy Judd Apatow film. It's not that there's anything wrong with any of that, but there's just wasn't enough to this film. It wasn't funny and there wasn't a ton of depth with the clichéd story. I will say however, the cameos were great, and supply with the film with some of it's rare comedic moments. I didn't hate Trainwreck, but I wasn't thrilled with it either.Trainwreck focuses on Amy Schumer's character amply named 'Amy' and her lack of desire to stay with a man for an extended period of time. The refreshing thing is that this time the character who can't settle down is a woman, considering we get so many of these films each year focusing on a male character. The problem is, the story isn't new at all. It never separates itself from other clichéd rom-com-drams. With that said, there are a few redeeming qualities.The first being the numerous great cameos (or in some cases small roles). The obvious one, especially from the trailer, is LeBron James, who absolutely crushes the comedy he's given. So much so that I feel as though they wrote specific scenes just for him and added them in later (an example of the film probably being too long). There also other cameos, mostly tied to James, that make the film far more entertaining than it should have been.Schumer and Hader have solid chemistry as an odd couple and I really enjoy when Hader takes roles that call for his dramatic chops rather than only his comedic side. But I think the standout for this film, which should be no surprise, is Brie Larson. Easily one of the best up and coming actresses today, and likely the Oscar winner this year for her role in Room, she outshines Schumer in scenes that are specifically built to make us care more for Amy, that's an incredible actress.So in all, Trainwreck was just okay. It's not particularly funny and it doesn't take advantage of what should have been a fresh premise. But it does have some memorable moments with funny cameos. Just cut down the length and focus more on the dramatic side without pushing the raunchy comedy down our throats and it could be a solid film.+Cameos+Larson-Comedy doesn't hit-Too long5.9/10",Trainwreck
27,lesleyharris30,"A Stellar Comedic Cast with a Talent for Improvising make this a Winner,",8,31 August 2016,"Trainwreck is a great movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast that can also shine in more dramatic moments. The film takes a somewhat groundbreaking turn of making the woman an imperfect character, who has an addiction to sex and does not believe in monogamy. Meanwhile the male was the more perfect character, whom the female was trying to win over by improving, it fought off clichés and did so successfully. However, for Judd Apatow's standards, I was a bit of a let down, with films like The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Funny People, I was expecting a more meaningful, honest and realistic movie. His previous work was both comedy and drama, Trainwreck is simply a comedy, which disappointed me. The cast are certainly the highlight, Amy Schumer shines in the lead role and has excellent chemistry with her love interest Bill Hader. Versatile actress Brie Larson also shines as her sister Kim, and two people make unexpectedly brilliant comedic turns, John Cena and LeBron James, who are actually hilarious. Simply very funny, with a bit of heart, Trainwreck is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good comedy. Having fought off the idea of monogamy for all her life, Amy meets a man who may change her mind. Best Performance: Bill Hader",Trainwreck

I don't mind Amy Schumer as a person but I thought her jokes were too outdated like I know I only saw her the first time in this movie, but still it was just a little corny reallyI wouldn't consider this a best movie for the SNL cast because pretty much it went downhill for me I'm afraid!",Trainwreck

I think her stand up is hilarious and I was looking forward to watching this because of her. The first 20 minutes or so is typical Schumer, very over the top sex jokes, but because of who she is it doesn't come across as angry or mean. As far as the movie goes, it wasn't as funny as I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing. I would compare this to movies like Funny People, or This is 40. Comedies that are funny, but at the same time dramatic and real and have a really good message. The writing in this is very well done and I look forward to more movies written by Schumer. I also was really surprised at how good of an actress she was. Again though, this is not as straight laugh-out-loud comedy as I was expecting but I did like it.

32,ironhorse_iv,"It's funny, but Trainwreck is far from a train wreck in a good way. It didn't go off the rails, enough.",6,29 August 2015,"Choo-Choo! Amy Schumer's film career is gaining some speed. In the last couple of years, Amy's popularity has skyrocket, thanks to her raunchy sketch comedy series on Comedy Central. It's no surprise that the comedienne landed her own movie, which she wrote herself and Judd Apatow directed. In Trainwreck, Schumer plays Amy Townsend, a magazine writer who lives her life under a one-track mind, which is that Monogamy isn't real. Life as a single woman was going pretty well for her, but soon she finds herself falling, madly in love for the subject of the new article she's writing, a charming sports doctor named Aaron Conners (played by Bill Hader). Both start to hit it off, but Aaron became to challenge her, by seeking a more commitment relationship. Can she resist the vow, or Amy's one-night stands done? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the movie's story to be, somewhat typical & predictable. It didn't add anything new. Very formulaic. If you've seen any rom-com ever, you've seen them all. For a movie called 'Trainwreck'; Amy's character isn't that bad. She has a steady job with an upper middle class lifestyle. She's doesn't really push, anybody buttons, too far. Last, for somebody that drinks and smoke way too much; she's in good shape. She's way too likable. I would think, she would do a lot more horrible thing, but they barely show, her screwing things up for Aaron Conners or her family. Don't get me wrong, it's not really that, much of a problem. After all, you still get all the raunchy sense of humor that Schumer is known for. I just saying, it wasn't as risky as I thought, it should be. Still, there's plenty to enjoy here thanks to Schumer's writing. I just wish, the story had a longer conflict. More conflict makes better comedy. Amy's character, gives in to commitment, way too fast in the first- two acts. Honestly, I wish, Judd Apatow pitch in, with the screen writing, because the script did somewhat, went a little too long with the awkward third-act break-up. The scenes that follow it, didn't seem too realistic. It's really hard to believe that a magazine like Vanity Fair would be willing to hired, a recent fired child-molester. The ending for the film was a problem as well. It didn't gave the audience, the awesome 3 point buzzer beater that the film kinda deserved. Still, the movie had a talented ensemble cast to make the film, somewhat enjoyable. Amy's performance was pretty decent for the most part, but I wouldn't call it, acting, since she pretty much, wrote the character as herself. I saw, way too much of her stand-up specials to know that, there was barely any new material, being used for this film. Bill Hader is ever charming and funny as Aaron, and he has solid chemistry with Schumer. The supporting cast of Colin Quinn, Tilda Swinton, John Cena, LeBron James, Daniel Radcliffe and others—had some very good hilarious bit parts in this film. James & Cena in particular. Both shines in some pretty infamous funny moments. I wish, the movie had more scenes with them. Surprising, for a Judd Apatow's movie, there wasn't that much controversy. The film was far tamer, than his previous films. Amy's humor was mostly a miss than a hit for me, as well. The humor for the most part, was mostly profanity sex jokes. Most of them, I couldn't really relate to. Still, I somewhat get, what's she trying to say. Some people might not like the homosexual humor, the film has, but in my opinion, it wasn't too offensive. The nudity scenes were alright, for the most part. I think ladies could probably like the fact, that there is a lot to see, with most of the male cast in that department. Still, nothing too visible. The movie was beautifully shot. I think Judd Apatow did a swell job, capturing the New York City, limelight. It's remind me, so much of an old school, Woody Allen's comedy.

I guess the script does make an effort to provide a deeper prospective in Amy's character, by providing us with her relationship with her father, but it never goes deeper than the superficial visits to him.

38,leonblackwood,Funny but predictable! 5/10,5,28 December 2015,"Review: This film was quite funny in places but it did seem to go on forever. The dry humour throughout the movie is cleverly written by Amy Schumer, whose also the main star in the film and it's quite emotional in places but it's very predictable. It's about a girl call Amy (Amy Schumer), who, from an early age, is told by her father that monogamy isn't realistic, so when she gets older, she sleeps with many men without getting attached at all. Whilst drinking and taking drugs, she works for a magazine called S'nuff, which is head by the demanding Dianna (Tilda Swinton) and although she doesn't like sports, she is asked to profile a sports doctor, Aaron (Bill Hader), who hasn't had a relationship for years. After a while, Amy and Aaron start dating and Amy finds it hard to deal with her emotional feelings that she has for Aaron. Because of Amy's sexual past and Aaron's non-existent sexual past, they end up in a steamy argument which causes them to break up. Amy soon realises that she really does love Aaron, so she goes out of her way to prove her love and win back her man. It is a typical Rom-Com but Amy's boyish behaviour does make it slightly different. Some of the racial jokes do go a bit too far but I did chuckle through most of the movie, especially when the dad was ranting and raving. I did find the main character a bit annoying after a while but it's light hearted fun which has something for everybody. Watchable!Round-Up: Amy Schumer is known for her hit series, Inside Amy Schumer, which is shown in the US, so I personally didn't know who she was before watching this movie. When I saw Judd Apatow, 48, was in the directing chair, I knew that there was going to be quirky jokes with a romantic undertone. In 2005, he directed the popular 40 Year Old Virgin and 2 years later, he hit the big screen again with Knocked Up. In 2009 he directed Funny People, which wasn't that funny and then in 2012 he released This Is 40 which starred his wife Leslie Mann. He has produced over 60 movies, which include Cable Guy, Anchorman I & II, Superbad, Talladega Nights, Bridesmaids and Pineapple Express so he is known for his contribution to the adult comedy market. I personally don't think that this was his best work and I didn't know most of the sporting cameos that are throughout the movie but there are some funny moments, which is mostly due to the witty script from Amy Schumer.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $140millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/comedies starring Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Tilda Swinton with special appearances from Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei and Method Man. 5/10",Trainwreck
39,TheMovieDiorama,"Trainwreck wasn't a complete crash, but did derail from its comedic tracks.",5,29 September 2018,"Look, I like comedies. Laughing, smiling or even rolling on the floor in stitches. It's a beautifully contagious emotion, allowing you to forget about your woes. So, once again, another modern comedy failed to hit the mark. I'm getting sick and tired of subjecting myself to critically praised comedies, only for the end result to be ""meh"". Just give me something legitimately funny! A magazine writer, who enjoys sleeping around without consequence, starts interviewing a doctor who quickly falls in love with her. Predictably, we witness her come to terms with the dreaded word that revolves around relationships. ""Commitment"". Say it with me now. ""Com-mit-ment"". Now, there were a few aspects I appreciated. The chemistry between Schumer and Hader felt natural, exhuming a sense of realism. The minimal use of typical Hollywood romantic clichés (aside from the face-palming ending) felt refreshing and certainly made the story and its characters relatable. Surprisingly, John Cena and LeBron James provided the most humour. But when the sporting superstars are far funnier than the usual SNL actors, you know something went wrong. Honestly, Schumer isn't funny. She isn't! Objectively and subjectively. Hardly a ""tour-de-force"" performance, however some of the emotionally charged scenes were conveyed adequately. The character she portrays is mostly uninteresting, and unfortunately is the primary focus of the story. It's Hader's character that garners the most interest, but is rarely explored with a lack of backstory. Larson and Swinton were underused. And, I've saved the best criticism til last, they spoilt the ending to 'The Usual Suspects'. Really? You honestly thought ruining the ending to a classic, to which many still probably haven't seen it, would generate laughs? Uncalled for. So besides that sickening crime against humanity, the lack of humour, boring characters and horrific ending...it's alright. It's fine. Watchable atleast. But darn it, I'm done with modern comedies. They just further illustrate how cold I am.",Trainwreck
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Schumer shines in totally formulaic yet freshly atypical rom-com,8,9 August 2015,"Amy Schumer has made the jump to the big screen in a big way with ""Trainwreck."" The comedian whose Comedy Central show has gathered a well-deserved fan base couldn't have made a better choice than to team up with Judd Apatow to bring her self-deprecating and shameless sense of humor to a movie genre in great need of it.In ""Trainwreck,"" there's a fine if not blurry line between conventional romantic comedy and flipping rom-com clichés on their head. Schumer plays Amy, a 30-something staff writer for a superficial men's magazine who overindulges in pot, booze and one-night stands, in large part because she internalized the advice her father (Colin Quinn) gave her and her sister Kim (Brie Larson) when they were kids: ""monogamy is not realistic.""Amy's personal rules about not letting men sleep over are soon tested when a work assignment has her interviewing wildly successful sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), who is best pals with LeBron James and loves sports, which Amy detests. After seducing him, she soon finds herself in an uncomfortable, exclusive situation.Hader and Schumer seem like an unlikely pair, but Hader's improvisational brilliance and Schumer's clever writing work well together, and they also have terrific repartee with the supporting cast, from LeBron James to the nearly unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as Amy's editor. These talents (yes, even James, but especially Schumer) pull of some of the script's really corny moment by infusing a little extra honesty and self-awareness into their performances.Then there's the Apatow factor. True to the types of films he has made since his career took off with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up,"" there is a strong dramatic element in certain aspects of the film, namely Amy's relationship with her father and the way she treats her happily married sister. Schumer colors these moments with some somewhat dark humor, but both she and Apatow are not interested in just fluff, which is interesting considering how cookie-cutter much of the plot of ""Trainwreck"" is.Romantic comedy fans will feel at ease in this story: wild woman figures out a way to settle down with guy, they hit a major roadblock and things get bad for awhile and then she must decide if she's really committed to him and if they can live happily ever after. The biggest difference, however is the gender roles are reversed. Normally it's the out-of-control guy who finds ""the one"" and nearly loses her. So in one sense, Schumer has written a film that flies against Hollywood gender roles, but on the other, she hasn't at all.So, somehow, Schumer and Apatow have crafted a classic date movie yet one that's fresh and a little edgy. More so the former than the latter, but most romantic comedies don't ever find an edge. There's something in ""Trainwreck"" for everyone, whether you're a guy into sports or not (especially if you are into sports though) or whether you're a woman who loves chick-flicks or a hardcore feminist. Somehow, the film exists as this acceptable contradiction. Schumer might not be able to pull that off time and time again, but she certainly has a promising career on the big screen.~Steven CThanks for reading!

41,paul-allaer,Raunchy rom-com starring Amy Schumer at the top of her game,8,2 August 2015,"""Trainwreck"" (2015 release; 124 min.) opens with 2 young girls being told by their dad that he and their mom are divorcing, and that ""monogamy isn't realistic"""", which the girls repeat after him ""monogamy isn't realistic!"". We are then told that it's ""23 Years Later"", and we get to know Amy (played by May Schumer), a who is in her early thirties, with a great job at S'NUFF magazine, a hulk of a boy friend, and a series of one-night stands. Then one day, Amy gets an assignment to write an article about celebrity sports doctor Aaron Conners (played by Bill Hader). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie no only stars Amy Schumer, she also wrote the script, and one can only assume that the Amy character is loosely based on Amy the real life person. The director is Judd Apatow, who brought us most recently ""This Is 40"" and before that ""Funny People"" and ""Knocked Up"", among others. But let's not kid ourselves: this is the Amy Schumer show all the way. The movie is not shy on sex and sex-related jokes and double entendres, so if that is something that might bother you, by all means, stay away from this. Amy has plenty of zingers in her script, in fact at times they come so fast and furious, I'm sure I didn't catch all of them. Yes, this is a comedy, but the second hour of the film shows plenty of more serious and wistful undercurrents. Amy is surrounded by some great talent. Bill Hader does okay as the romantic interest. But the performances that really catch the eye are first and foremost Tilda Swinton as Amy's boss/editor at S'NUFF (looking almost unrecognizable) and of course also LeBron James as himself, playing it straight up, with hilarious results. There are a TON of cameos, the best of the bunch being Chris Evert and Marc Albert towards the end of the film. There is plenty of song placements in the film, including Billy Joel (Uptown Girl; Matter of Trust), Miley Cyrus (Do My Thang), Bombadil (Amy's Friend), and many more. Bottom line: this is a raunchy with some serious undercurrents, featuring Amy Schumer at the top of her game.The movie is now in its second weekend at the box office, and the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very nicely attended, somewhat to my surprise, to be honest. But it shows that there is a target audience for a Hollywood movie that is clearly not for everyone. If you are in the mood for a brassy sex comedy with some great acting performances, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Trainwreck"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Trainwreck
42,subxerogravity,I found the movie laugh out loud funny.,7,18 July 2015,"I'm not up on who Amy Schumer and what makes her eligible to spotlight this picture but she's she's really funny, I love her since of humor and how out there she goes with the comedy. The Character of Amy is a wreck loose who learned at an early age from her promiscuous father (played by the very funny Collin Quinn), that being in a relationship is not worth it. I love the character because it's not defined for a woman or a man just a person who does not believe in relationships, I think that's what makes the jokes funnier. Judd Apatow can put another winner on his list. The movie reminds me of This is 40 in which it has a lot of comedy and than this long stretch (or what seems like it) of seriousness to address the issues of the main character, but unlike This is 40, the format did not completely turn me off, in fact it was done quite well by Amy and her leading man Bill Hader.I'm not really a fan of LeBron James but can't deny his acting debut was nothing but funny. He played himself and himself was just charming and filled with personality. I'm also impress with the comedic chops of John Cena, who I go to see literally way too much of in this flick.I think I'm gonna have to put Amy Schumer up there with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarty. She crafted a well done comedy here.",Trainwreck
43,Turfseer,"""Trainwreck"" Schumer and funny, irreverent first half devolve into typical rom-com territory past the midpoint",5,8 September 2015,"For connoisseurs of ""raunch cinema,"" ""Trainwreck"" might just be your thing. But it's in the first half, the irreverence of writer/protagonist Amy Schumer, might just leave you impressed with a new comic talent. Schumer plays a fictional version of herself also named ""Amy."" Raised by a father who divorces early on due to his serial philandering, Amy is also afflicted with her father's propensity to pursue affairs with the opposite sex. Sister Kim, however, Amy's ""better half,"" is happily married with a quirky son who formally addresses her as ""mother."" Schumer's ""shtick"" is that she can't control her nymphomaniacal tendencies. Schumer is best when she plays off of characters who are even crazier than she is. ""Steve,"" her main heart throb, is an excellent comic concoction—the scene where Amy begs him to ""talk dirty"" while they're having sex is a hoot, as the ""gym rat"" is completely deficient in the ""language of love"" (albeit of the lusty variety.) There's also a hysterical scene while Amy and Steve are at the movies and Steve gets into a verbal tussle with an angry African-American patron who wants Amy to quiet down. Amy flinches when Steve's insults peg him as gay-centric, despite his efforts to appear ""manly."" Another pretty hysterical character is Amy's boss at S'nuff, the men's magazine where she works: Dianna (Tilda Swinton), the high-strung editor who hails from the UK, is not all ashamed to publish articles titled, ""You're Not Gay, She's Just Terrible."" When she discovers that Amy hates sports, she assigns him cover an up and coming sports surgeon, Aaron Connors.Amy's growing interest in Connors is the main plot of ""Trainwreck,"" and unfortunately the turn in the direction of traditional rom-com narrative prevents this critic from awarding Schumer's oeuvre, more than an average 5 out of 10. Simply put, the bumbling but goody two-shoes Connors is not worthy of Schumer's irreverent tone nor his sidekick played by a real-life Lebron James (the best Schumer can come up with for James is that he's a ""Downtown Abbey"" fanatic.) In fact, Schumer chooses to give ""basketball"" a free pass by not skewering any of their ""bad boys,"" probably because she knows little of the tawdry behind-the-scenes goings-on of that sport.You can easily guess where Schumer's by-the-numbers plot will end up: she eventually sees the errors of her way and ends up with Mr. Nice Guy. But before that happens, the irreverent Schumer simply turns obnoxious. While Connors receives an award at a ""Doctors Without Borders"" dinner, Amy forgets to turn off her cell phone and is forced to take a call from Dianna, leaving Connors to receive his award without her being present. Afterwards he confronts her and they have an unpleasant argument which leads to a temporary separation. Even more obnoxious is that Amy almost commits statutory rape by having a fling with an underage office intern (Schumer's shenanigans are no longer much fun at all!)There's also a sub-plot involving Amy's conflict with her sister over putting their father in an assisted living facility. After the father's death, Amy gives a heartfelt eulogy about her Dad which showcases Schumer's ""serious"" acting chops but seems out of place in a movie that introduces itself as fun, raunchy and irreverent, in the first half.""Trainwreck"" is not only a worthy appellation for Schumer's character but a description of the film's second half. Schumer manages to lose her comic timing and ends up grating. As for the screenplay—chugging into sentimental rom com territory makes us forget that Schumer is actually quite talented (not only as a comedian but as a writer.) I'd recommend ""Trainwreck"" but be forewarned this is clearly a mixed bag in both the writing and acting departments.",Trainwreck

Bill Hader is also great has the doctor who Schumer who falls in love with. They where so good to the point, I believed they where in love and not acting.

45,strong-122-478885,Ho-Hum!!!,1,1 July 2016,"You know, after watching Trainwreck - I'm totally convinced that its star, Amy Schumer (who also wrote the screenplay), must have, literally, scribbled off this big load of crap while she was relieving herself on the toilet. I'm not kidding! Yeah. I thought that this dumber-than-dumb movie was pure outhouse excrement, from start to finish. And, to me, its biggest downfall was how desperately Schumer tried to pass off her character as being both adorably cute and shamelessly shocking, all in the same breath.And since Schumer's character was so despicably cheap and whorish, throughout, these 2 conflicting personality traits only caused her to fall flat on her face, over and over again.Insincere, pretentious, shallow, and predictable - Trainwreck definitely scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel when it came to delivering its laughs.Like, haven't we already seen this sort of trite ""boy-meets-girl"" rubbish about 1000x before??",Trainwreck
46,stevendbeard,Different But Funny Rom-Com,7,17 July 2015,"I saw ""Trainwreck"", starring Amy Schumer-Inside Amy Schumer_tv, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World; Bill Hader-SNL_tv, Men in Black 3; Colin Quinn-SNL_tv, A Night at the Roxbury; Brie Larson-The Gambler, Scott Pilgrim vs, the World and LeBron James-The LeBrons_tv, Entourage_tv, oh yeah, he is a basketball player, too.This is a romantic comedy that is a little different; Amy Schumer does not play a very sympathetic character. She also wrote and stars in it, and if you have seen her TV show or her stand up routines, then you know about her sense of humor. Judd Apatow is the director and he has had a few comedy hits, including This is 40, Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old-Virgin. Amy plays a woman that comes from a dysfunctional family-mostly, her father, Colin. Colin was a womanizer and did not believe in monogamy-a good role model for little girls. Amy is following in his footsteps by sleeping with lots of guys-what some might even consider as being a slut. She also drinks a lot and uses drugs. Brie is her more adjusted sister; she is happily married, with a step son and her own child on the way. Amy works for a magazine that publishes mostly Enquirer type stories-sensationalism to get people titillated. Amy is assigned to interview Bill, a sports doctor, but ends up falling for him as more than just a one night stand. She then starts working on sabotaging their relationship with her routine bad girl behavior because she doesn't think she deserves it. LeBron plays himself, a patient and personal friend to Bill. He also has a lot of funny lines and delivers then rather well. There are lots of cameos; I remember seeing lots of SNL comedians, Marisa Tomei, Daniel Radcliffe, John Cena, Mathew Broderick and Norman Lloyd. Plus, a lot of sports people like Marv Albert and Chris Evert-I'm sure there were other sports personalities that I do not know; if you know me at all, I'm not a big sports fan. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I liked it and would buy it on DVD.",Trainwreck

48,meeza,Wrecking up the laughs!! Loved it!!,10,28 December 2015,"I ""am-track"" to proclaim ""Trainwreck"" as one of the best movies of 2015, and definitely the paramount comedic film of the year. Comedy movie director Judd Apatow's latest gem stars comedian Amy Schumer as Amy, a commitment-phobic New York party-girl lush, who unexpectedly falls for restrained sports surgeon Aaron; nicely played by Apatow fav Bill Hader. But there is so much more to ""Trainwreck"" than its opposites-attract romantic story. Simply put, it is filled with some authentic and clever comedic scenes that made me laugh to pieces. Schumer not only is deserving of a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her spot-on starring performance, but also deserves another golden- boy nod for her outstanding comedic screenplay of the picture. ""Trainwreck"" is also filled with super supporting performances from Brie Larson as Amy's sister, an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as Amy's editor boss, and Colin Quinn as Amy's non-monogamous pop; and it also had some surprising good cameo-thespian scores from famous athletes Wrestler John Cena, NBA former star (sorry Amar'e) Amar'e Stoudamire, and a NBA basketball player that won a couple of championships in Miami and then deserted Miami to go back home (yes, I am a Heat fan); and yes, I am referring to LeBron. So get on that comedic gem train, and take a ride with the stellar ""Trainwreck"". ***** Excellent",Trainwreck
49,runamokprods,"Funny, smart, and has a heart.",8,8 October 2016,"A tremendously funny comedy, with Judd Apatow doing a very good job with Amy Schumer's script – the first time he hasn't written a film he's directed. But Apatow and Schumer are a very good match, sharing senses of humor and senses of humanity, managing to mix up hysterical, low brow humor (the funniest throwing up moment since Monty Python's ""The Meaning of Life""), with heart and wit. And, Apatow has managed to get some terrific performances from pro athletes, starting with LeBron James. James' role isn't just a cute 2 minute cameo, it's a real , juicy supporting role, and he carries it off with surprising aplomb.Indeed, in another trademark for an Apatow film, this is full of terrific performances, starting with Schumer's bawdy, crazy, sexy, sharp and wildly neurotic and vulnerable Amy at the film's center. Bill Hader is also a delightful surprise as a sensitive, funny leading man (and how nice to have an on screen couple who are attractive, but also look like real people – imperfect bodies, faces that don't come out of a modeling agency. Score one for the great majority of us). And Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller and a lot of other talented folk seem to be having a blast in supporting roles.The film isn't perfect. There are a few times when it's humor crosses the line into forced (Marv Alpert 'sports casting' an emotional intervention seems to come from another movie – specifically Woody Allen's 'Bananas', where that kind of Marx Brothers surrealistic absurdism made more sense when Howard Cosell did it). There are certainly no surprises at all in where the story ends up going (a moment of doubt somewhere in the two hours would have been nice). And if one looks too close, the morality is pretty surprisingly conventional – it doesn't quite seem the feminist embrace of a woman being free to live a crazy, sexy life without it being a sign of an emotional problem one might have hoped for from Schumer. But when all was said and done, I laughed out loud – a lot. And I liked the people. That's a hell of a lot to get from a Hollywood comedy these days.",Trainwreck

I suppose I should have seen it coming, but did not due to the television advertisements. Nothing wrong with rom-coms. But this one really wasn't very good. With all of the comedic talent assembled, it was much heavier on the romance side. It had a few chuckles, and some pathos toward the end, but it really did not resonate with me. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were just okay. The celebrity cameos were okay, if gimmicky. By far the best performance was by Brie Larson. If I am not mistaken, I saw her in something recently, I think ""21 Jump Street"" playing a teenager, (very well) and just three years later, playing a part near her own age, (27 according to IMDb).

However, not much can be done with a weak script and with overextended dialogue that doesn't substitute for quality.""Trainwreck"" deserves its title for it crashes early on and never recovers.We are subjected to the required introduction to explain the protagonist's wishes to remain unattached. It's most likely the first misstep for now there's not much to discover in the development of the film. We know and see a disturbed and socially inept person who is unable to bond with a person of the opposite sex. What we also get is a very unattractive person because her language, attitude, and behavior are really not much to entice any guys beyond the overnight date.Yes, we can look at it as statement for a woman's right to choose how to live her love life, but why make the character so unlikable and vulgar. We have our share of challenging and difficult girls on screen before, but there were compensating qualities, and the script gave us intelligent and funny lines. Apatow continues on his crusade to trivialize and gives himself an easy way to please the crowds and not demand much from performers and the audience. Overall, it's an experience that will tempt you to walk out if you are in the mood to expect at least a decent film.",Trainwreck

It tells a hard truth: we do a lot of immature things to attempt to fill in the void of the love of two people. When that love is possible changes come slowly requiring self-introspection with determination to risk being hurt for the jump to something meaningful...yet, this ain't even on the level of ""When Harry Met Sally"" good.Schumer's persona is sandwiched in a few funny, often raunchy, humorous vignettes. For senseless entertainment with a side of romance it just doesn't quite gel because you don't buy Schumer's melancholy heart. Her character ain't gonna change into a great writer or a mature fiancée.

57,jadepietro,Crass Class,7,22 July 2015,"((Ratings: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: In this romantic comedy, the rom works very well, even if the com doesn't always deliver.GRADE: BAmy Schumer is one of the hottest comedians in show business right now and her movie Trainwreck, directed by proved winner Judd Apatow, should make her an even bigger household name.Written and starring Ms. Schumer, Trainwreck is a raunchy rom-com that has its share of laughs but, more importantly, has a wonderful chemistry between her and her co-star, the talented Bill Hader of SNL fame, that is the film's main strength.The comedienne plays an aptly named character, Amy, who is a cynical boozy floozy more interested in one night stands that a committed relationship. She is a ""trainwreck"", totally hedonistic and self-absorbed and living life in the fast lane. That is until see meets Aaron, a doctor, a romantic, and all-around nice guy. Let's call him Mr. Right. It is their relationship and the changes that happen to her because of him that are the crux of the film. This is, after all, a romantic comedy. Both actors are in top form, especially Mr. Hader who is charming and quite believable in his role.Apatow has assembled a fine cast of actors including Colin Quinn as Amy's monogamy phobic father, an unrecognizable (and hysterical) Tilda Swinton as her cold-hearted British boss, Vanessa Bayer as Amy's best friend, Brie Larson as her loving sister and Mike Birniglia as her doting husband. Cameos playing against type by professional wrestler John Cena (very funny), Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei and especially basketball star LeBron James as LeBron James, Aaron's best buddy, add to the fun.The screenplay is well written by Ms. Schumer. The jokes are action and character driven and their delivery is perfectly timed for maximum effect. Sometimes the depreciating and sarcastic humor is laid on a bit thickly, but the shock stock of one-liners and the political incorrectness seems par for the course nowadays. While some gags are laugh out loud, others barely cause a titter. But the romantic elements of Trainwreck work effortlessly, leading to a memorable. if predictable, climax.Apatow directs his film with a nice comic touch and he rightly focuses on these mismatched lovers' dilemmas. He also pays homage to Woody Allen's far superior Manhattan in many scenes, a film he himself probably admires. While this film never comes close to that film classic, Trainwreck is immensely entertaining and retains its own type of class, crass as it may be, to warrant a visit.

58,Seraphion,Great humor especially at the first half,7,10 September 2015,"The story is basically a clichéd relationship comedy where the main character hits home after getting tired of being free. It gets nothing but predictable at the opening and at the ending. Yet the movie did well in spicing things up and adding twists after making the audience get comfortable with the story flow and pace. But this movie's main attraction is indeed the humor. And it's not just Amy Schumer's parts that were hilariously entertaining, but surprisingly the athletes involved in this movie thrown in great jobs in making the humor live. The most surprising for me is to see how John Cena instead did very well in the comedies as opposed to his lame action roles. His scenes just crack laughs all over the duration. The sex talk scene is hilarious, but the movie scene tops all others. LeBron James' performance here isn't bad. But still Cena's humorous scenes are way better. The acting overall is surprisingly nice. Amy Schumer did well but I think it's more because she wrote the script so she really understands the character deeply. Bill Hader did good also, although not being adequately funny for his individual part. It becomes that good because the movie nicely incorporates other familiar faces that attracts audience's focus to them and adds to the movie's humor. It's very nice to see Tilda Swinton, Randall Park, Dave Attell and even Method Man to join in.",Trainwreck
59,Movie-ManDan,Ignore the Bad Reviews.,10,5 January 2016,"Trainwreck is a very funny romantic comedy that caught a bad rap from non-hardcore movie-buffs. My 10-star rating is hope for the 6.4 rating to increase. (If the rating was higher, I'd give it a 9)Before watching this, the only thing I knew Amy Schumer from was the Roast of Charlie Sheen. Her joke to Steve-O was a little harsh, but it's a roast. Since I was very unfamiliar with her, I had no idea what to expect from this. Would it be a dumb, brainless movie or a hilarious heartfelt film? The latter.I think most people that didn't like this were surprised that there were no real ""belly"" laughs and the laughs did not pull the movie, it was just a side-effect. Well, for a romantic comedy to be realistic and work well, the laughs can't be in the centre leading the movie because the realism would be diminished and the seriousness and romance would't work as well. Instead, we get genuine humour that fits with the scene and makes us laugh to the point were it is ""real"" laughter. Maybe we are not howling, but what we get is enough.Amy Schumer plays Amy. No, she does not play herself; just a character with the same name. Her playboy father (Colin Quinn) affects her judgement of relationships which leads her to develop a phobia for serious commitment in relationships. She mostly goes on enough dates with a guy until they have sex and she dumps them as they put their clothes back on. There's lots of sexual humour in the early part of the film. This is a little immature, but it works to the point where they are actually funny. Her latest boyfriend is exercise nut, Steven, played to the full by John Cena. John Cena is a polarizing pro-wrestler who is hated by some for being too kiddie and too corny. John Cena abandons his kid character and develops a sexual, profane character that will catch his haters off guard. Him playing a purely adult-oriented role is not the reason why he is awesome. yeah it is a shock, but he was legitimately good. This will mark the beginning of a new John Cena that everybody will like again.Despite Amy being pretty young, her immature antics are catching up to her. She is shocked when Steven breaks up with her after he discovers her infidelity. Plus there are family problems with her sister (Brie Larson) maturing faster than her with her own family and her father is placed in assisted living after being diagnosed with MS. Everything around Amy is moving so fast. Amy is a journalist, and matters are made worse when she is assigned to do a story on sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) because she is the only one in her job that hates sports. Conners is charming and he is not willing to give up on Amy that easily, but she is still very nervous and confused. It eventually, near, the end, becomes a standard rom-com, but it is still a good try.Trainwreck reminds me of a Woody Allen movie: the characters are nervously romantic and sexually frustrated. The character of Amy is very funny and so deep. In fact, everybody in this movie is so well-written and likable. The subplot with sports is also a lot of fun because Amy's negative view of sports (which reminds me of me) clashes with others' in very smart ways. LeBron James is also in this playing himself, which is cool to see. Everything in this movie works. The serious portion is awesome, the comedy is funny, the subplots are great and the characters are so fine. My rating: 8.5/10. A-.",Trainwreck
60,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Trainwreck,6,17 July 2015,"OK. So I've made some observations about 2015's Trainwreck (my latest review). Note to the movie itself: Bravo on the most dead-on walk of shame sequence to ever grace the silver screen. Note to LeBron James and John Cena: You guys are the top tier in your sport (NBA basketball and WWE wrestling respectively) but your acting still needs a little work. John, I'm not sure if it's the dialogue you've been saddled with or your improvised line delivery, but you come off as unfunny while everything you say seems relatively cogent. Note to Amar'e Stoudemire: You aren't really an actor either but your cameo in ""Wreck"" (with hardly any lines) outshines James and Cena profusely. I'm not saying you're Lawrence Olivier but keep up the good work. Note to the New York Knicks organization: Just because you are talked up in this flick doesn't mean we as an audience, don't know that your team is still kind of in the crapper. Finally, note to director Judd Apatow: We know you like the concept of raunchiness (you speak of it in interviews) but you need to hire a screenwriter who doesn't let said raunchy scenes get out of control while dragging on too long. People don't interact with a vulgar nature in every adult situation (especially during funerals, baby showers, and professional business meetings) and believable sex scenes don't involve one party being fully clothed. Now granted, Trainwreck is your latest release, it's gonna make a lot of money (I could tell from an opening day screening), and I give you credit for turning virtual unknowns into leading men and woman (Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, and currently, Amy Schumer). For me though, this is a mixed bag. And I shed a tear knowing that it could have been so much better.Now as a vehicle, Trainwreck involves a thirty-year old woman who sleeps around until finally finding the man of her dreams. In the cannon of Apatow's filmography, it's a step below 2007's Knocked Up and 2012's This Is 40 (both of these films were funnier, seemed like they had more of a script, and didn't strain for comic transgression). ""Wreck"" is more on par with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, an exercise that doesn't equal a movie so much as a series of drawn-out, earthy scenes. Yeah its story is more coherent but it's improv to the max and overlong (an Apatow affidavit). As for the courtship between its characters being Schumer's Amy and Bill Hader's Aaron Conners (a big time sports doctor and said dream guy), well it's simply not believable. These people are polar opposites and there's no evidence to say that they could ever function as a couple (despite giving them a two hour running time to prove it). (Spoiler Alert) oh and did I mention the ending? Well it's faintly predictable (you just knew these crazy kids would end up together). To my dismay though, I was surprised by how unique it was (just think cheerleaders dancing at Madison Square Garden). All of this in the end, doesn't negate Apatow from being Apatow. He would rather have his cast members talking like perverted sheep than showing some unadulterated emotion. He likes everything ostentatious but I wish he would just grow up.In conclusion, I was surprised by how deep Trainwreck tried to project itself (don't let the trailer fool you). This is not necessarily a comedy (especially towards the second and third act). It deals with depression, death in the family, drug use, and of course, promiscuity (which actually just occurs in the first half-hour or so). For what it's worth, Amy Schumer is the best thing going for it. Her character is real, multilayered, and has issues. Her performance here deserves a better movie, one with an actual script and not ad libs. As an actress, she's likable, strangely attractive, and backed up with some good supporting work (Brie Larson as Amy's sister, acts with her eyes, and as usual, is solid). However, this numbing movie is indeed, a ""trainwreck"". Apatow like in Knocked Up (remember the scene a la a baby coming out of the womb), wants to gross you out with close-ups of someone getting stitches and a flask knee getting operating on graphically (to the Billy Joel jam, ""Uptown Girl""). He's the frat boy version of John Waters, a real jester.Of note: Trainwreck didn't pulverize me with its negligible, comedic vibe but I chuckled threefold. You have Amy Schumer's narration which is unconventional in a sense yet totally humorous. There's also a cameo- laden sequence involving Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and Marv Albert. It had to do with some sort of intervention (Evert says the word c**kblocker, I'm not kidding). Finally, look for a scene where Aims walks on a treadmill and has her body type plastered via a large computer screen. It's crazy sexy cool and sort of reinvents the whole ""Hitler"" strut (I felt squeamish but still laughed nervously).",Trainwreck
61,brando647,Amy Schumer & Judd Apatow are the Perfect Combo,8,18 July 2016,"I've enjoyed Judd Apatow's films since the beginning but even I can admit that his material has gotten a little repetitive. He's a great comedy filmmaker but I was anxious to see him branch out from the topics of family and getting old. TRAINWRECK gives us just that, as he keeps his seat in the director's chair and lets comedienne Amy Schumer handle the writing duties. The best advice for writers seems to be ""write what you know"" and Schumer has followed suit with this semi- autobiographical romantic comedy; as far as I can tell, certain characters are based on people in her life (her father, her sister) but the story itself comes from her personal view on modern relationships and dating. In the film, Schumer is Amy Townsend, a reasonably successful woman with a job writing for a trashy men's magazine (think Maxim), a relationship with a musclebound softie, and scores of men passing through her life in a constant parade of casual sex. An ill-timed text message puts an effective end to her relationship just as she's assigned to write an article on sports surgeon Aaron (Bill Hader). Aaron isn't Amy's typical sort of man but she allows herself the chance to have a little fun with him and she's subsequently terrified when he reads too much into it and pursues an honest relationship with her. Monogamy and ""good guys"" aren't generally in Amy's repertoire but she discovers feelings for him she's not accustomed to feeling; can Amy overcome her own fears and self-sabotage to make this relationship work?TRAINWRECK is a really fun movie. I'd say it's certainly Apatow's best since KNOCKED UP in 2007. Bringing in Amy Schumer's brand of comedy was a perfect way of changing things up a little. I've only ever seen the occasional clip from Schumer's comedy specials and a handful of episodes from her Comedy Central show but I dig her style. She's hilarious and there's an honesty to her comedy that I enjoy, and it carries over here. I took the time to watch the behind-the-scenes footage and listen to the commentary for this film, and this is obviously a deeply personal project for Schumer and a real triumph for her to see it come to fruition. So, congrats to her because it was one of the funniest comedies of 2015. It takes a little while to gain its momentum but once the movie's in gear it's a good time. As with any Apatow movie, some of the improv'd lines fall flat on delivery and the first couple scenes had some groaners but it doesn't take long to find its footing. I was worried that, knowing Schumer's comedy is famous for her frank sexuality, TRAINWRECK would try and skate by solely on shock humor but, no, it incorporates into a surprisingly touching story for a perfect blend. Schumer and Apatow are a talented duo and I'm hoping they'll find reason to collaborate again in the future. TRAINWRECK is equally adept at tugging heartstrings (there are a couple of unexpectedly emotional moments) as it is at mining laughter from its well-tread premise.The movie's success comes in part from a grade-A cast and a phenomenal team of supporting players. Schumer and Apatow must've called in some favors because they've scored a seriously great group to fill out Amy's world. In addition to featuring one of Bill Hader's best, most honest performances, we get Colin Quinn in a minor role as Amy's father Gordon and the fantastic Brie Larson as her level-headed sister Kim. The great Dave Attell appears has a bit part as the homeless Noam heckling strangers for change outside Amy's apartment, reminding me how much I miss Comedy Central's ""Insomniac"". None other than Tilda Swinton plays Amy's boss Dianna and I completely failed to recognize her the first time I saw the movie. I'm so accustomed to her playing such bizarre characters that seeing her in a somewhat ""normal"" role, especially in a comedy where she scores some laughs, threw me off and I had to check the end credits to verify it was really her I was seeing. And on the topic of surprises, some of the best laughs in the movie come from the non-comedians. Seeing as how the movie is set in the world of sports medicine, there are naturally a handful of athletes that pop in. Lebron James, who legitimately made me laugh more than a few times, even has a relatively sizeable role as one of Aaron's close friends. John Cena appears in the first act of the movie as Amy's surprisingly sensitive boyfriend and his scene in a movie theater dealing with a heckler is hilarious.TRAINWRECK is a great segue from TV to big screen for Amy Schumer and she couldn't have found a better partner to bring it about than Judd Apatow. It was a major accomplishment for her and a breath of fresh air for fans of his. It's not your average rom-com and it has fun with the genre, but it still maintains a good heart at its core and the relationship at the forefront feels legit. Fans of either shouldn't be disappointed, and now I'd love to see Schumer team with Paul Feig.",Trainwreck
62,moviewizguy,A star on the rise,9,21 July 2015,"When you team up Judd Apatow, one of the best comedy directors working today, with Amy Schumer, one of the best comedians working today, you've struck gold. TRAINWRECK subverts the rom-com genre because of its unlikely protagonist, Amy, a woman who doesn't look perfect and is totally likable because of that. At the same time, the film's biggest flaw is how much it adheres to the rom-com formula, but it doesn't detract from the quality overall. TRAINWRECK essentially is a showcase of the many talents Schumer has to offer. It's a vehicle for her to tell the world, hey look, here's someone that you should be paying attention to. Additionally, it happens to be semi-autobiographical, and while often hilarious, it's also honest and heartfelt. In one surprisingly moving monologue, she gets to show a vulnerable side of herself, which you never get to see on her show.In addition to Schumer, everyone else is pretty much perfect. Bill Hader, playing the love interest, is reliable as always. Brie Larson is also very good as Schumer's sister, reminding everyone the world's greatest mystery: why isn't she in more films?! However, John Cena surprises with a supporting role filled with hysterical one liners. On top of that, he has great comedic timing! Lastly, Tilda Swinton is flat out great and unrecognizable and even LeBron James manages to be quite funny. Sure, there are some scenes that fall flat, one of which involves Matthew Broderick and some sport announcers(?), making you question why the scene wasn't cut in the first place. Despite those minor bumps, TRAINWRECK is a hit. It's a hit for Apatow, and it's a hit for Schumer. Overall, TRAINWRECK is easily the best comedy of the year so far and solidifies Amy Schumer as a talent to watch.",Trainwreck
63,jellopuke,Everything bad about Apatow movies,4,25 March 2018,"Thirty minutes too long with virtually every scene going on far longer than necessary. A constant need to have minor cameo characters get funny improv bits in, pointless celebrity cameos that needlessly fill up time, and scene after scene that could have been either completely cut, or drastically re-worked to make the movie flow better. Just about the only thing that this movie has going for it is the gender swapping of tropes, other than that, it's just bad. Sure there's a couple of laughs, but Apatow NEEDS someone to tell him when to cut, that not everything he touches is gold, and a tight script is worth a million improv jerk offs.",Trainwreck
64,Sergeant_Tibbs,Doesn't quite break the rom-com mould but it's subversive where it counts.,7,21 July 2015,"At first, it felt like Trainwreck was inviting its title to summarize the critic's reviews. Our most recent memory of Judd Apatow behind the camera was for This Is 40, an overlong epitome of his self-indulgence. I don't know, I didn't see it, but the trailers were enough. Fortunately for him, Amy Schumer emerged since 2012 with her incisive sketch show Inside Amy Schumer among other notable guest appearances and stand ups performances. Her brand of feminist jokes are often eye-opening for the way women are presented in the media, when she isn't focusing on slut humour anyway. She's on a mission to change the perspective of women, though it isn't a clean cut job. Writing her own rom-com, it's a very satisfying debut effort, but it doesn't break the mould as much as it promised. Dipping between reality and the absurd, it has its fingers in so many baskets - such as a montage scene which is self-aware but it hardly breaks the fourth wall again when it could have struck gold - that it's not 100% its own thing. It's not fair to expect it to completely pick apart the genre. But as far as the new wave of female protagonists in R-rated comedies (nudge, Melissa McCarthy), Trainwreck is top of its drawer. There's strong comedy and there's strong drama here, it just struggles to marry the two. The drama in the second act completely envelopes the film that it struggles to bounce back, no matter how much its climax hops around. I do like the idea of accepting that fights shouldn't break up relationships, but I always think of Chandler in Friends when that comes up. Admittedly, Schumer does struggle to stand out amongst the professional actors in the cast. She's solid, but outdone by Brie Larson, Bill Hader and Tilda Swinton in a chameleon- esque role. LeBron James has a similar problem, having gags that are much stronger than his delivery, though his cheapskate attitude is priceless. His role probably has more novelty for fans though. John Cena unquestionably stole the show, I really wished for him to return. To go just by Apatow's directed pictures, it is refreshing to see him near Knocked Up level. This is the deepest he's gone emotionally and even though it has its own issues it's better balanced than Funny People. Of course, it's overlong as he lets his actor's riff too much, but this is very likable company. Here's hoping Apatow continues to focus his position of power to put talented comediennes in the limelight.7/10",Trainwreck
65,Screen_Blitz,Pretty much your average Judd Apatow comedy-fare,6,14 November 2015,"From Judd Apatow, the guy that brought us The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), Knocked Up (2007), and Bridesmaids (2011) comes a romantic comedy striving the talented cast of Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller, Brie Larson, Colin Quinn, Vanessa Bayer, Lebron James, and John Cena in this romantic comedy that expands upon the flair of Apatow's fluid sense of humor, though less memorable and perhaps less polished than his previous outings. Schumer plays Amy, a woman who goes through a bad breakup with her immature boyfriend Steven (Cena) when he finds out she has been sleeping with other guys. From there on out, her life becomes completely out-of-shape. When she meets Aaran Conners (Hader), a sports doctor who works with Lebron James, she quickly falls in love him and learns he is someone much more than any guy she has ever dated. However, their relationship becomes a challenge when she decides she must reinvent herself. Brie Larson plays her younger sister Kim who is pregnant with her second child and has a son and boyfriend she hopes to marry soon. As far as Judd Apatow comedies go, audiences get a taste of the raunchy, yet clever sexual humor that Judd Apatow is best known for. As a romantic comedy, this movie doesn't fail to bring out the fun and laughter. While the talented manages to deliver some hilarious dialogue and charm as well as some surprising messages about dating someone of shallow quality, the film doesn't quite sustain itself too well through its entirety. For the first half, we get some fairly frequent laughs from Amy Schumer and John Cena, and some somewhat funny one-liners from Bill Hader. Colin Quinn who plays Amy's eccentric father has a few good lines for a portion of his screen time. Towards the second half, the laughs quickly wind down before the film takes a rather dramatic turn. From that point, the jokes become weaker and weaker and the story begins to lose its appeal. It got to the point where I started growing impatient until the end, then the film finally goes back to being wild laugh-out comedy. Above all, the characters are written with clever faults, and very relatable in many ways, and the story manages to avoid many (if not all) of the romantic comedy clichés.Trainwreck maybe one of my least favorite Judd Apatow comedies. However, this was in no means a bad movie. It could have done better and leaned on a better script but on the bright side, it still uses some of its potential. If you are a Judd Apatow fan, I would say give this movie a try. You may like it, may not.",Trainwreck
66,blumdeluxe,Easy humor that works,6,6 September 2017,"""Trainwreck"" deals with a middle-aged woman whose life mainly consists of one-night-stands and very superficial relationships with the people close to her. When she is forced to write an article about sports, a field she is anything but firm in, she falls in love with a doctor that turns her life upside down.The film mainly works with easy humor, although I have to say that the producers mastered the art of creating funny moments through different speed. I find it quite worrying that the movie plays a lot with stereotypes and in parts racial humor, because even though they are attached to characters that are considered negative, they are meant to create laughter and thus get confirmed. The plot itself is a very basic story of a romantic comedy, two very different lovers who rush into each other's life and form a deep relationship. This is spiced up by a lot of celebrities guest-starring that differentiates it from similar films of the genre.All in all this is a basic romantic comedy, with questionable but clever humor and a set of well-known actors and celebrities. Not for everyone surely and with some difficult jokes but surely carefully produced.",Trainwreck
67,maurice_yacowar,Hardened girl learns to accept emotions and commitment,8,20 July 2015,"Amy Schumer's Trainwreck is a romantic comedy that stakes out a new position in the feminist reworking of American film.Most obviously, Schumer's comedy has a candour and profanity traditionally reserved for men. Like her TV show and standup, her riffs are transgressive bawdry. Her candour about cunnilingus, tampons and erections are tabu-turning cases in point.The three women of Snuff magazine establish the spectrum. Boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) is the woman executive taught that success requires her to be like a man. Amy seems feminine in comparison, soft, recessive, but still stronger than Nikki, whose nerves — outside the women's toilet stalls — reduces her to a girlish titter. Nikki apologetically backs into the editorial promotion when Amy is fired for supposedly molesting an underage masochistic male intern. On this spectrum Amy struggles to find her integral balance of male and female. The two male writers reflect the same contrast between macho and effeminate. Naming a men's magazine Snuff clearly plays with the idea manliness kills. Hence Amy's line to the super endowed man: ""Have you ... before? Where is she buried?"" Amy is limited by her masculine traits. She was brainwashed by her father's conviction that ""Monogamy is unnatural."" Where her sister outgrew that mantra to become a fulfilled wife and mother, Amy stuck at promiscuity and insecurity. She has the conventional male fear of commitment, urge to leave after sex, need to control the relationship. She reduces her men's sexuality to her immediate needs. The super-endowed pickup is thwarted when she falls asleep after her brisk orgasm. When her ""ice sculpture"" boyfriend gets into a quarrel at the cinema she feeds him lines that make him seem gay. Amy is saved from her insularity by her interview assignment with sports doctor Aaron (Bill Hader). He's idealized by his work for Doctors Without Borders and his fame as a major sports surgeon. Here the man plays the nurturing healer role, domesticating the uncontrolled sexuality of — completing the reversal — the woman. Hader's lunch scene with Lebron James is a male parody of he Women's Lunch, from their discussion of relationships and emotions to their careful parsing of the check. When Dr Aaron is served with an intervention he faces a range of sexual license. The soft, caring Lebron is joined by the very sensitive Matthew Broderick (married to the star of the seminal feminist Sex and the City), the lesbian Chris Evert and — to provide the play-by-play — by the erstwhile cross-dresser Marv Albert. Amy's intervention is an arranged scene with her step-nephew, who educes her affection for her lost Aaron. Amy wins Aaron back by performing a number with the Knicks' cheerleaders. She proves her new discipline and her desire to make their relationship work by performing the athletic ritual she initially disdained. She now accepts sports on Aaron's terms, as an agent of community. She also performs the persona of female sexuality, the antithesis to her Snuff work. The muscular hunk climaxed when he admitted that from behind she looked ""like a dude."" That went with her male life-choice of promiscuity and flight from emotion. To recover her relationship with Aaron she embraces the female role as cheerleader and her new pool of emotions and commitment. Once an emotional trainwreck, she goes on track and pulls into a station.",Trainwreck
68,educallejero,The irony of the title being trainwreck!,2,20 October 2018,"It might be that I just don't enjoy Amy Schumer. It might be that, or it might be just that she's annoying. I think she does it on purpose. The ""point"" of the movie is showing a woman ""living the way she wants, being the way she wants without apologizing"", and while I love the message, the way of selling I didn't.Great! Woman should be free of any restraints that men do not have, so I'm not opposed to do that. But being disgusting in every possible way is not a succesful strategy for men, but here she's fine. She has a job, she has sex with all kinds of men. She has a friend. I just ask ""HOW?"". It makes no sense. Maybe the character is being funny where I just see her being rude. Maybe she's being cute while I see ""annoying"". Maybe is ""awkward honestly"" when I see incompetence.In the end, for a romantic comedy, the movie is not funny except when Schumer is not around (in particular the LeBron's scenes), is not romantic (the ""love"" is totally forced as Bill Hader's character has no reason to fall for her), is not realistic (she shouldn't have a job, being the parasite that her character really is) nor is ridiculous enough to be funny that way (everything that happens is plausible, only not expertly done).I wanted to give this movie points for having LeBron, Bill Hader and Tilda Swinton. But only a handfull of their scenes are not infected by the sins of awful humor that destroy this movie.",Trainwreck
69,aciessi,"Say Hello to Movie Star, Amy Schumer",7,25 June 2015,"I'm not so proud to say that I belong to the ""Tinder"" generation. We tend to cater to the id, cutting right to the chase. It's between the sheets first, and maybe love after. I saw this film in college, where I would bank on the hook up culture thriving the most. Do you think this kind of accidental love story resonated with anyone? Will it make you think twice about being loose? Highly doubtful. For the most part, we were too busy laughing to care. Trainwreck in on track to becoming one of the most interesting, talked-about films of the year. I hope I'm not wrong. This is a new, bold, intelligent comedy from Amy Schumer. Regardless of how the rest of America will feel, she isn't going anywhere. Trainwreck manages to be a unisex comedy, that is more guy- centric than Bridesmaids... and Bridesmaids had some classic guy humor. Amy Schumer is really something to behold. She is as nasty and brutal as her ""Comedy Cellar"" friends, but then, she's adorable, and vulnerable. This is unique, and something we haven't seen before. This isn't just her show, however. Trainwreck features the most unexpectedly funny cast in any movie I can think of. What sticks out in my mind is John Cena and LeBron James. Two sports legends, and wouldn't you believe it, they have terrific comedic timing. Hollywood should take note, and cast people in comedies that have never done anything funny. I also have to single out praise for Colin Quinn. A great comedian, seen rarely on screen these days, and his performance is stellar. As for Judd Apatow, he's still so incredibly gifted with directing new talent, and surprisingly restraint from placing his wife Leslie Mann and his two daughters in cameo roles.. not that I don't think they're talented. This is a sweet movie. Spread it's praise.",Trainwreck
70,RforFilm,It's not that Trainwreck isn't sweet or funny; it's simply boring,4,21 July 2015,"I think there is a general fear with putting yourself in a relationship as an adult. When you're a teenager, the feeling of having a loved one is fantastic because this is the first time this burst of warm passion has hit. But like most, your eventually have to face heartbreak. I can say that I have had my heart broken when it was decided that my relationships weren't going to work. It feels awful and you feel like the whole world hates you. Heartbreaks don't even always come from a bad relationship. Sometimes it can come from a death or a loss of something. Or even for some, it's simple denial.What cures heartbreak is how someone goes from there. I find it best to stay out of another relationship for a bit to reexamine who I am; to get a good grasp on who I need to be. Some others also feel the need to place their emotions into a hobby. That's not a bad choice as some of the best writers and artists had gotten to their fame through a broken heart. The one thing that broken people do that's bad is to indulge and stay away from relationships all together; the kind of person that's the subject of Trainwreck. A young writer Amy (played by Amy Schumer) has no desire to live a boring life. Drilled by her alcoholic father that monogamy is unrealistic, she proudly sleeps around, and gets drunk and stoned without worrying about her effect and cause to those around her, including her sister Kim who has married and settled into the family role that Amy is disgusted by. The closest thing she has to a real relationship is that she is kind of dating a bodybuilder Steven (played by John Cena), even though she still sleeps around. She's forced by her editor boss Dianna (played by Tilda Swinton) to write an article on a sports doctor, despite Amy's dislike for sports. She meets up with Dr. Aaron Conner (played by Bill Hader) and things go professionally for a bit until they sleep with each other. At first, she takes it as a mistake, but after chatting with her coworkers and Aaron, she decides to give the relationship a try. Meanwhile, she's trying to keep her father in a nice nursing home while Kim would rather have him in a cheaper place. Unlike a lot of people who have watched Comedy Central to get a general impression of Amy Schumer, I'm indifferent to her. I went into Trainwreck only knowing that she wrote the screenplay (I know that Judd Apatow directed it, but it feels different in tone), waiting for a laugh-fest. And that's the problem; I simply did not find her material funny. I have nothing against a comedian who wants to push darker material, but most of it left me silent. Something about her delivery seems a bit too ""half assed"" and never fully seemed engaged in the material. I think I laughed at three of her jokes at the most.Everyone else seemed to be ready to go. Bill Hader gets plenty of jokes, despite not playing the comedic character. Even the sports stars John Cena and LeBron James got a laugh out of me. As far as story goes, I was in full support of this for a while. After her monologue of explanation of her lifestyle, I wanted to see where she went with it. Though boring, I stuck to the end to see where the relationship was going to end, and without spoiling anything, it sticks to romantic comedy clichés even though Schumer seems to be against those ideas.I'll give this four Knicks tickets out of ten. Trainwreck suffers from not being a bad idea or having bad players. I just found it boring. I will say though that as comedy is subjective, perhaps you'll find Amy Schumer funnier then I did. I'd say watch her material on television first before your watch Trainwreck; you'll get a good idea on whether or not your going to like her.",Trainwreck
71,ivo-cobra8,This movie f***** sucks garbage pure garbage!,1,11 August 2017,"*SPOILERS* This movie truly sucks, it is over long not funny stupid, lame and honestly the worst comedy movie ever! This is garbage men pure garbage stinker film! It has the worst actress in this movie! It is not entertaining it is not a comedy it is some weird drama! In my opinion Amy Schumer is the worst actress on the whole planet she is absolutely horrible and she stinks. She looks all washed up. I couldn't finish this movie because it is so terrible to watch. It feels like someone punched me in the face. The plot is confusing and really bad with clichés all around.OK John Cena is in this movie and he is horrible, he's acting is terrible and I was never a fan of him since he made The Marine. Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin is better WCW wrestler and better actor to me. John Cena can not act. The script , the dialogues are terrible. Amy's character is not likable but she is an asshole bitch. She treats men like sh** she is awful. Amy's sister Kim (Brie Larson) doesn't give a damn about their father Gordon (Colin Quinn). I also did not like that Amy was cheating and switching their boyfriends like t-shirts. I did not liked the Mark Whalberg joke from John Cena at all in the movie theater.I don't like this film, the director was awful, the script was lazy and confusing. The writer Amy Schumer made an horrible job with the confusing script. I did not like Amy Schumer calling a sport stupid and dumb at all! This movie is sad and no one is likable in this movie! I still can't believe that some people are buying this crap and give it higher rating.I am sorry folks for this review but this movie is overrated and horrible. I have seen better comedy's than this. How about 13 Going on 30 (2004) with Jennifer Garner better actress and better movie. How about Walk of Shame (2014) with Elizabeth Banks I like Elizabeth better than fat Amy Schumer and I also liked that movie and I thought was better than this. Another thing those two young girls who played Amy and Kim (Devin Fabry and Carla Oudin) were only in the opening scene in a cameo role and that was an horrible scene and that was it, that was there story no explanation what happened with their mom, nothing. And again this movie is not funny is 2hrs way too long! Why should I care about this damn movie if the actress does not care about the audience. I watched last night Fist Fight and it was also horrible but at least it was entertaining and I had a few loughs this movie has nothing guys! How can you say it is good? I don't understand.Amy Schumer please retire from movies you suck and you are horrible awful at acting and your character is dumb and stupid not likable. Oh end the boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) is a horrible person and Amy Schumacher since you hate so much sports kiss my ass! Score is F 1/10 Avoid like a plague!",Trainwreck
72,Quietb-1,"Starts sharp, turns dull.",6,20 July 2015,"Here's a romantic comedy from the female perspective. Written by Amy Schumber, who made a creative choice to use the name Amy for her character. After a life of fear of commitment, Amy meets a great guy and can't handle the truth. Schumber had the good sense to get Judd Apatow to direct. Perhaps she should have gotten an actress with more confidence and range to play the lead. The only person more stiff was Chris Evert. A romantic comedy is usually funny short and tight. This one seems to loose it's way. Nothing like the death of the father and the fight at the funeral to end the laughs. It took until a trampoline gaffe about thirty minutes later to get a laugh.There is a outstanding use of music. Great cameos, especially from the sports figures. The movie will enjoy a good run in theaters and will play long and well on home platforms.",Trainwreck
73,Danusha_Goska,Awkward Handling of an Unlikable Drunk,5,16 August 2015,"""Trainwreck"" has gotten really good reviews and I did laugh out loud while watching it but it went downhill fast and in the end I felt like I needed a shower. ""Trainwreck"" is about Amy (Amy Schumer), a narcissistic, abusive, alcoholic and drug addicted slut who meets nice guy Aaron (Bill Hader) who falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and Amy's life changes. The drunken slut part of the movie offers some funny scenes, and some creepy, cringe-worthy scenes. In one unfunny and gross scene, drunken Amy attempts to have sex with a sixteen year old boy who calls her a ""pathetic, childless MILF."" She punches him in the face and his mother interrupts them. The scene seemed to be about the movie punishing and humiliating Amy. I didn't much like Amy. She castigates a man for breathing on her after one encounter. She is unkind to her sister within minutes of her father being buried. She treats Aaron horribly, taking a phone call during one of the most important moments of his life. ""Trainwreck"" is directed by Judd Apatow and written by Amy Schumer. They are both very funny and prolific talents but the material here is simply above their artistic maturity level. They know how to make funny scenes; they don't really know how to deal with a drunk who tries to get sober, or a malicious narcissist who tries to be nice to other people. Aaron is a sports doctor and famous athletes are sprinkled throughout the movie. That just doesn't work. You never really believe that LeBron James hangs out with this sports doctor and has heart-to-heart talks with him about his girlfriend trouble. The famous-sports-star scenes take the viewer out of an already rocky movie and lower the verisimilitude. It's also unbelievable that a sports doctor at Aaron's level would be so desperate for a girlfriend that he would put up with Amy for more than half a date.",Trainwreck

Was it that Amy just wasn't up to a feature length film or was it Judd Apatow's direction that made this not work. Where Amy's mischievous bad taste gender stereotype flipping gags work on her show, here they were missing the knowing nod. Amy fitted her self centered character's skin too well and at feature length you started to believe this was a real person and someone you wouldn't want to spend time with, even in a movie. Schummer was too ugly, and I don't mean that in a physical sense. Hader was good, as were most of the actors, apart from the product placement sports stars. It really started to drag in the last 3rd, possibly because it had nowhere to go, which is exactly where it ended up.",Trainwreck
75,HabibieHakim123,Same Plot As Most Other Movies,7,18 July 2020,"""Worth your time, even though it's 2 hours movie it's really enjoyable movie, but nothing special in this movie the plot is the same as most other movies, Amy Schumer in debut writer she was incridible, and Bill Hader he always gave his best performance""",Trainwreck
76,bryank-04844,Amy Schumer is just incredible in 'Trainwreck'. Recommended!,7,21 July 2015,"Comedy mastermind Judd Apatow is back this year with a new feature film called 'Trainwreck' and is his best film since 'Knocked Up'. That was eight years ago. Sure, Apatow has written and produced dozens of films since then, but has only really directed two other feature films since, being 'Funny People' and 'This is 40'. The usual actors are nowhere to be seen in 'Trainwreck' either. There is no Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, or even James Franco to be seen anywhere on screen. Actress and comedienne Amy Schumer wrote the screenplay here for Apatow to direct and the two are a perfect pair.I wouldn't go as far as to say this is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen, however it can be added to the greats, and I have to say that Amy Schumer is amazing in this role. Schumer plays, well, Amy, who writes for a fashion and gossip magazine in New York City. She seems like a lot of fun from far away, however, when you get up close, she's not always a nice person. She can't seem to have any sort of relationship with really anyone. She cheats on her boyfriend, she hooks up with any guy she sees, and can drink anyone under the table.Even when her one-night stand lovers try to be nice and caring, she throws them to the curb without a single further thought. Needless to say, she's not really a good person, nor could you trust her by any means. Her sister Kim (Brie Larson) on the other hand, has a great family, and seems to have the up and up on life, as she and her husband (Mike Birbiglia) try to guide her through unsuccessfully. An assignment from her hell-boss (Tilda Swinton), sends Amy to interview Aaron (Bill Hader), a doctor/surgeon to the famous athletes in almost each sport.Hell, he's even best friends with Lebron James, who has his biggest acting role to date here. Slowly. but surely, Amy starts to like Aaron and might just be right for a normal life, instead of hooking up with people like WWE's John Cena (who hangs dong in the movie), or Ezra Miller, who's safe word is ""pineapple"". There are so many other cameos in this film, that it would take another twenty minutes to list them off, so I'll move on.Throughout the movie, you can't help but dislike Amy. Her attitude and bad habits will really rub you the wrong way, however Amy Schumer is so talented in that she can make you hate her and fall in love with her in a split second. It's a very rare talent, one that I remember seeing in Gene Wilder, when he played Willy Wonka. That ability to truly scare or anger you in one moment, then completely turn you 180 degrees and make you fall in love is a rare gift, and Amy Schumer has it. It's the big driving force in this movie.Sure, Hader and the rest of the actors are funny and great, but this is Amy's movie to own, and she does just that in every scene. Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem like the typical Apatow movie. There aren't tons of dick and fart jokes around every corner, and there doesn't seem to be overly long improv riffs of cut downs. I mean, those are all welcome , but it seems Apatow has matured a little bit. 'Trainwreck' is an endearing film with a damn fine performance from Amy Schumer. You'll laugh a whole lot, maybe learn something, and may even get choked up here, no matter if it's from weed, sex, or emotions.",Trainwreck
77,Ben_Cheshire,"Risky title for a Judd ""35 mins too long"" Apatow movie.",6,3 September 2015,"Amy is in her 30's, still living like she's 21, and wild even for that. She's not actually that likable here (this coming from a massive fan of her sketch show) but is joined by the completely affable Bill Hader and the adorable Brie Larson, so it balances out. Oh, and LeBron James is in there for some reason. For what feels like forty-five minutes. Trainwreck is hilarious, and that's all you need to know before going in. However, as a companion piece to Amy's sketch show, or a movie in its own right, its pretty disappointing. It lacks the structural and cultural anarchy of the sketch show, and is pretty bloated and conventional for an Apatow comedy. There are about 50 terrific laughs, more than worth the price of admission, but considering the fact that Schumer's show has set a new standard for sketch comedy, I'm going to suggest that she can do better than ""Trainwreck.""In romantic comedies, protagonists need to be likable, and her persona here is a selfish brat with no redeeming features. That's fine for a regular old comedy, but here there's no reason to care whether she ends up happy or not, therefore its easy to get bored between the jokes. There's a serious lack of coherence to the plotting. There's no progression, it just plays like a series of moments, far too many of which don't feature Amy Schumer, they instead feature LeBron James (for some reason) or Amy's father in an unnecessary nursing home plot. So many characters, so much unnecessary subplot.Her character is also not quite deep and nuanced enough to justify the length of this movie. But then again, no earthly human can justify the way Apatow movies outstay their welcome. I liked Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin, but in general the man doesn't seem to have an entertainer's sense of when to get offstage. Next time, more sketch comedy, or a movie with one of her TV directors please.",Trainwreck
78,witster18,this film was a...,4,11 December 2015,"Not all is rotten in Denmark.Amy actually handles some of the more serious scenes really well. Probably the highlights of the film actually.Past that this is NOT a good movie. There isn't much chemistry between the leads here, and the whole thing is just so crass that it really takes away some of the impact of the serious stuff. A little more prying into Amy's past... a little more discussion and serious themes to add to where they were dabbing into, and this might have gotten pretty interesting. Instead they scrap the idea and go quickly back into cliché' boring territory.The last 20 minutes is the real shot to dulled senses. Time starts flapping-by without much drama to update us on the characters, and then things quickly fly-back-into happy-go-luckiness, and that all clashes with the films crass/class-ness like glitter in a western.I credit Shumer's performance(which is surprisingly solid) for saving this from an even lower score. The film just seems scared to go over-the-top with anything. It makes you think it's over-the-top with the sexual themes, but in-fact the film is just scared to go the extra-mile with the drama or the comedy. I would have given it a passing grade if it had done either.Pass. It will settle into the high 5's by summer of 2016.",Trainwreck
79,Carycomic,Boring! Boring!! Boring!!!,1,18 July 2015,"I mean, I tried. I really tried! Somehow, I sat through the first hour and forty minutes of this piece of crap with patience that even a saint might envy. I had even taken a front row seat! Although, admittedly, part of the reason for that was the surprisingly packed house.But, it was no use. Even as a cure for insomnia this movie failed! Because merciful sleep refused to come for me. So, I finally wised up and walked out during her attempt to drink up all the wine at the Doctors Without Borders benefit. I can literally count on one hand the number of times I genuinely enjoyed the intended jokes and laughed along with the rest of the audience. And, I shed a few authentic tears during the funeral scene. But, the rest of the time? Forget it! The only times I empathized with Amy Schumer's character is during the enjoyably witty banter with her, Colin Quinn (as Gordon, the terminally ill father) and one hundred year- old acting legend Norman Lloyd (as Gordon's roommate at the assisted living place).Everybody else in the cast? Forget it. Even Jon Cena proved that acting and professional wrestling aren't always synonymous! So, imagine how unfunny Bill Hader's performance, as Aaron, must have been if LeBron James (as the straight man in their scenes) seemed more hilarious by comparison.In short? Don't waste your money going to see this at the movie theater, renting as a DVD three months from now, or even ordering it via Netflix or On Demand!

81,Imdbidia,Not good except for the acting,5,25 February 2017,"I expected this film to be a proper comedy. Why? Because it was advertised as a comedy, it was talked about as a comedy, the promos by the main actors sold the general public that this was a comedy. And it is not.This is mostly a family drama mixed with a romantic drama mixed with gross humour mixed with some humour. The story is mildly entertaining, it is unoriginal, definitely not a comedy. It tackles too many things at once and without any focus, depth, or any level of success. There are too many characters in the film and some of them don't add anything to the story. There isn't real digging into the psyche of the main character played by Schumer.The main thing I enjoyed in the film was the acting. Schumer is a good actress and she's convincing as the alcoholic comittophobic Amy. I also liked Bill Hader as the normal-guy boring doctor, and I thought that he and Schumer had chemistry on camera, but he had more comic chemistry with Lebron James (I loved Lebron!). Tilda Swinton is always brilliant, even here, as the unrecognizable dull glamazon journo boss Dianna.Overall, I found the film passable and a bit boring. I was expecting a comedy and, therefore, to laugh often, but that didn't happen.",Trainwreck
82,cliftonofun,I laughed a LOT,8,26 December 2017,"I laughed a LOT. Granted, I could have laughed more...it ran 25 minutes too long, and the story's pacing seemed really off at moments. But Schumer nailed every line and every moment; she made you laugh, and she made you care. Plus, Hader, Birbigs and LeBron are worthy co-stars. It was mostly a typical rom com with extra vulgarity and a female lead. But that was enough.",Trainwreck
83,billygoat1071,Not Enough Novelty,5,9 September 2015,"Amy Schumer is a breakout comedian star known from her show which lead to this feature film, Trainwreck, that is supposed to showcase much of her talent. And it's mainly about a woman who sleeps with a lot of guys and suddenly met the one that she could learn to be loyal with. At this aspect, it seems too predictable. Unfortunately, it is, but not quite. The film does follow a formula which brought down which should have been a novel comedy, but the personality stays intact and the actors do shine in their moments. Though, it could have run better with a somewhat shorter runtime and an easier pacing, but it's funny enough to keep it entertaining.The story is kinda simple; we follow a one night stand woman, guys who take her seriously get disappointed, she doesn't understand marriage and despises the concept of it. And then the pace changes when she meets someone who she could go after more than another night of sex. Of course, it doesn't take itself too seriously, though the clichés and obvious morals are all over the place. But what people are supposed to be seeking here is some unique sense of humor. The movie really concentrates each comedic set piece and many of them do work while some can be a little too extraneous. It's not always meant to move the plot forward, but it's not really about plot. It's the atmosphere of cynical people learning about their mistakes then resolve them with contrivance. If you could look past some of its extravagance then it would be better, but nonetheless, it's still kind of fun anyway.The only thing to note about its filmmaking is this is one of the rare that uses actual film than a digital camera, but that doesn't necessarily impact anything at all. It's just a method that is supposed to indicate that this project has ambition or something. The cast is good, nothing more and nothing less; they bring their own charming personality each of their roles.Again, Trainwreck should have been a little shorter and a little less extraneous at some points. The plot is too predictable and so is its conclusion, but it has something to speak of its own and I guess that is its only strength other than its slick direction and cinematography. There is some good laughs to spare, at least, but even with some gripping personal outlook towards its main character, there's hardly anything remarkable around here.",Trainwreck
84,statuskuo,Not A Typical Rom Com,7,20 July 2015,"People are going to want to cram this into a typical rom-com, but it is not the movie you think it is. Well, it is and it isn't. Amy Schumer plays a big city editor for a men's magazine who is put into a story about a surgeon who is (literally) a game changer in terms of surgeries that help professional athletes heal quicker. In doing so, she gets a taste of something her father has warned her for so long...""monogamy doesn't work.""This phrase alone sets her into a spiral of sex and alcohol. In what can only be described as grotesque self-loathing behavior. Her only connection to men being something to plug (literally) up this bleeding, destructive emptiness. To ground her, she also has a sister, played beautifully by Alison Brie. In both patience, kindness and acceptance, she has a nuclear family. To which Amy can only be disgusted by normalcy. It's dull and dumb to her. And brain deadening versus the hustle and bustle of a fast paced world. It reminded me of a time when someone had told me to slow down in life, because when you run past it, you don't grab any real memories along the way. Amy's character had shot past what may've been a sincere family life of her own, and now realizes a level of regret. What Apatow does, which is absolutely spot on, is INSTEAD of allowing Amy to ""get her lesson"" she dips back into her old ways. Why? Because it's comforting to her. Until it ultimately takes away the lifestyle she built for so long.There's another moment, and I won't ruin it for you, where she goes on a date with John Cena. John is everything a woman would want from a man. I mean, aside from some of what they depict as the obvious...but he has hopes and dreams and plans. For them both. Yes, he had plans for both of them. In a heartfelt confession, we realize how truly broken Amy is, because we see Cena's flaws...as we see in our mates, but use them as more of a reason to leave than a reason to stay. That balance alone should tell you how fragile this dynamic is. And how well they skate through something that could've been dumb.I really liked this movie. Schumer is so comfortable in front of the lens. I would never want her as a friend, just not my speed. And quite honestly, are we at ""happily ever after?"" I think it's up to you to decide.",Trainwreck
85,davidgee,A rude-n-crude version of MIRANDA,6,19 August 2015,"This is being marketed with heavy reference to BRIDESMAIDS, which had a few 'set-piece' scenes involving all the girls in mega mishaps on the way to the altar. The set-pieces in TRAINWRECK are mostly bedroom 'train-wrecks', although Amy Schumer's delivery of a funeral eulogy is a high spot and Tilda Swinton's appearances as Amy's uber-bitch boss at the magazine shift the film into a higher gear. The movie - and Schumer's shrill in-your-face performance, melding all four of the SEX AND THE CITY girls - is like a stand-up routine with supporting cast: think Miranda, only much, much ruder and cruder. She's clearly meant to be annoying, which she surely is: I several times wanted to smack her! But she's also trying to warm your heart, which Miranda always manages to do, but Amy does not. There are a lot of laugh-out- loud moments, as there were in SATC, , but Bill Hader came over as too dorky and bland, especially after what we saw of Amy's comic array of one-night-standees. The last half-hour descends into rom-com cliché. Funny, yes, but hilarious (which BRIDESMAIDS was) - nah.",Trainwreck
86,ClaytonDavis,'Trainwreck' makes a star of Schumer but also John Cena and LeBron James,7,14 July 2015,"The comedic brilliance of female actresses is no secret to the industry. People like Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, even veterans like Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep have demonstrated their comfort in a genre that is dominated by slapstick chubby guys and constant flushing bowel movements. Writer and performer Amy Schumer joins the élite list with her work in Judd Apatow's ""Trainwreck."" In the funniest film of the year so far, Schumer not only magnifies a hilarious performance with sharp, fearless writing, but successfully inserts beats of dramatic moments that both feel real and honest in today's thirty-something generation.""Trainwreck"" tells the story of 'Amy,' (Schumer) a thirty-something journalist that has sworn off monogamy. Night after night, she indulges in alcohol, marijuana, and the frequent company of a man. Things change dramatically when she's assigned to profile a sports doctor named Aaron (played by Bill Hader). Along with Aaron's barrage of professional athlete friends and celebrities (LeBron James and Matthew Broderick to name a few), the journey of their very awkward and new relationship is put to the test, along with the influences of Amy's sister Kim (played by Brie Larson) and ailing father Gordon (played by Colin Quinn).This very well could be Judd Apatow's best movie ever. When he's taken on raunchy comedies with heart (""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin""), magic tends to happen, especially in his lead actor's portrayals of the characters. Since 2005's hit-comedy, Apatow has come up short in many regards with films like ""Knocked Up,"" ""Funny People,"" and ""This is 40."" All respectable in their own bodies but either overlong, overblown, or over zealous for its own liking. In ""Trainwreck,"" what normally feels like 30 minutes too much of on the nose direction and dialogue, only feels about 10 minutes. There's the very apparent and typical Apatow hump felt in the middle of the film but the direction that the script takes, in allowing its central characters to exist and interact with other people within their world is refreshingly positive. Apatow has a handle on the story he wants to tell, allowing the location of New York to be a fluid, real presence, echoing at times something of a Woody Allen picture. It's his single most impressive outing yet in the director's chair.The star through and through is actress and writer Amy Schumer. A staple of Comedy Central with her uproariously hilarious ""Inside Amy Schumer,"" the 33-year-old comedian fascinates in her vision of relationships and the pitfalls that come to them. Raw and honest, Schumer fixates on the male psyche from the female perspective, bringing to light the questions that constantly run through gender opposition and perception. Beyond the thematic elements captured, Schumer's creation of magnificent supporting characters should be applauded by anyone who wants to be a screenwriter. Though it should be noted, some of the behaviors exhibited by them at times are a bit too far-fetched, even for a comedy such as this, but nonetheless, it works. As a matter of fact, in many instances, they steal the show. AMPAS writing branch, please don't ignore.LeBron James and John Cena in particular are comic gold. James' stoic and vivacious expressions are things that people like Michael Strahan wish they could inhabit. He dives into a role, which is just himself, and turns it on its head in a real and ridiculous way. I loved him. John Cena's sensitive and vibrant interpretation of a man desperate for a connection, is some of the film's best moments. Every frame he shared was completely memorable. Please do more movies like this. As a matter of fact, can we get a ""This is 40"" spin-off of his character please?Brie Larson adds a dramatic and serious element to the film that is sorely needed and shows once again that she's a talent that is only getting better as the days pass. As Amy's father, Colin Quinn's dour yet whimsical outlook on life is a welcomed addition to the film. Tilda Swinton shines as the guttural and foul-mouthed Dianna while Vanessa Bayer has the time of her life as the ditsy and naive Nikki. We even get an amusing interaction with the clever Ezra Miller. Dare I say that is a wonderful candidate for the SAG Ensemble award? Damn right I will. An inspired and deserving choice this one would be.As the love interest Aaron, Bill Hader, whose resume already sings with stints on ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Skeleton Twins,"" plays it pretty straight, and in many ways is the only believable character in the whole story. When everything around you is so outrageous, your normalcy can stick out like a sore thumb. However, Hader rises to the occasion with a thoughtful performance that will have many guys saying, ""that's me in my relationship."" Breaking news, Dude, it probably isn't.Mixed with a relationship intervention, a one-on-one basketball game, an S&M introduction, girl time on the toilet, and a dance sequence that the MTV Movie Awards would be stupid to omit from any lineup come next year, ""Trainwreck"" does most of the things it sets out to do, while invigorating and entrancing many of us into the world of Amy Schumer.

87,MattBrady099,The title says it all,4,5 August 2015,"My heart goes out to those who died and got injured at the Trainwreck screening shooting in Louisiana cinema.The story is about a woman raised to believe monogamy isn't realistic finds her uninhibited lifestyle starting to wear thin. When her magazine job leads her to interview a charming sports doctor, she finds herself falling for him - and maybe finding romance is just what she needs in her life.Okay I'm just going to say it, I never was a fan of Amy Schumer. I was never a fan of her work and to be honest I'm not such a big fan of her. I don't know what it is but these just something about her that I just can't put my finger on it. I only say I'm not a fan of her because I don't hate her as a person, because right now as I speak shes taking action on gun control because of the Louisiana cinema shooting that was showing Trainwreck. I'm happy that shes calling out this big issue that's still around and how this gun control problem needs to solved. A simple gun can land into the wrong hands. But all that aside and focusing on the movie I thought the movie Trainwreck wasn't all that great of a movie.The movie wasn't written that well, I mean the jokes in the movie got old after awhile. Some people say that the movie was well written but I must disagree. Amy Schumer did okay in the movie but these a couple of scenes in the movie that she didn't do such a great job, for example when shes at a funeral and she starts crying and the tears didn't look even remotely look like it was brought on by emotions the character was experiencing, it just looked like an actress trying to force whatever emotion to force out.While watching the movie I kept saying to myself ""Is this real humor?"" because the audience that I was with only chuckled a couple of times. There are a few gay jokes in the movie and that's mostly with John Cena who would say something and then somehow accidentally imply that he wants to have sex with another man and this joke happens too many times in the movie. That's pretty much the joke, now some many think I got offended by the joke but that's really not the case, I can laugh at many jokes that might be offensive to some people who take it too seriously. The problem here is that there was no joke, gay was the joke. These many gay jokes out there that are funny if there's a joke behind it but not on it's own.Tilda Swinton was the only one to give a good performance in this movie. She did the best of what she had to work with by poor directing and the terrible script.The movie is called Trainwreck which is Amy Schumer character, which the movie keeps referencing about her alcohol and marijuana use but we only see her intoxicated in a couple of moments in the movie but after awhile the movie just tells you about it without Amy Schumer acting like it.Bill Hader was good in the movie but he didn't do anything special.Overall Trainwreck wasn't all that good to me. A lot of people may easily disagree with me on this one but this is just my honest thoughts on this movie. If you enjoyed the movie good for you.",Trainwreck
88,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Like Schumer's stand up, moment of hilarity but a personal narrative",7,6 August 2015,"Written by Amy Schumer with inspirations from her stand up comedy and her real life, Trainwreck is irreverently funny but completely sincere.Amy is a monogamy-challenged magazine writer living and working in New York. She's pretty rad, and bags men often, but even though she feels pretty great about herself, something isn't working. When she's tasked to write about a sports doctor to the stars Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), she surprisingly finds herself attracted to him, in more than just a one and done kind of way.You might think Trainwreck is going to be a raunchy comedy centered around sex, dick and vagina jokes, but it is way way more than that.There is so much gold in Trainwreck, you almost don't know where to begin. Amy Schumer must be a creative and comedic genius to not only write a screenplay that Judd Apatow would want to direct, write parts and scenes that were so funny that she had the pick of the litter in terms of comedic actors, have a crystal clear story to bind everything together.John Cena, Lebron James, Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller are just some of the famous faces in Trainwreck. And don't worry, they don't partake in tired token cameos. No, they are highlights in some of the funniest scenes in the movie! Seriously, Cena and Miller, where did you come from and please come back! It all comes down to Amy Schumer's writing. Of course, it will be offensive to the faint of heart – but why anyone who is easily offended would try watching this film is beyond me. Schumer takes a stab at funerals, cunnilingus, gerontology and makes refreshing jokes on all fronts.This is still an Apatow production, so it feels very much like all of his other films. And yes, the humor is very similar to Schumer's stand up – but it is hilarious and so appreciated! Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Trainwreck
89,bbewnylorac,Really great,8,25 July 2015,"I didn't find this film constantly hilariously funny, but considering it's Amy Schumer's first effort as a Hollywood movie screenwriter AND as a lead actress, it's an awesome achievement. Just look at her in the scene dancing with the cheerleaders, or crying and speaking at her father's funeral -- she really gives it her all. She's in almost every scene and you never feel bored or skeptical about her character. The sex scenes are very explicit, but I guess it does illustrate how blase she is about who she sleeps with. You get the sense she's playing the traditional male role of reckless commitment-phobe. Bill Hader is great as her doctor boyfriend. Mainly he's the straight guy, but I like how later in the film his friends point out that he has flaws, too. I like how he explains to Amy that he loves her, but he hates her drinking and dope smoking. Colin Quinn as Amy's dad is witty and spirited, and Tilda Swinton is brilliant as the tough cockney editor always looking for the smuttiest stories. Apparently Trainwreck started when director Judd Apatow asked Schumer to write a screenplay. Hopefully Apatow or someone else will ask her to write a second one.",Trainwreck
90,estreet-eva,Less radical than you've heard,6,3 March 2016,"For a film that generated a fair amount of gender card controversy and Twitter flame wars the story is more old Hollywood and far less radical than you've heard. The comedienne plays an exaggerated version of herself (although not quite as an exaggerated version as Chelsea Handler plays). The fictional Amy drinks and serial dates to cover up childhood and adult difficulties with her father now disabled by MS. After she establishes this premise, the Old Hollywood rom-com formulaic elements are followed in sequence with the expected results. Along the way we get some stellar casting choices and a decent although not outstanding script. The hype rendered about LeBron James - who may eventually be the best to ever have played professional American basketball - is fully earned. The contrast between conventional expectations about the mega-rich world's most famous basketball player and the fussy, thrifty, thoughtful, modest non-caricature of himself realized on-screen make for a movie-stealing performance. Collin Quinn as the bad father was a dead-on choice and the deftness of the writing makes him not just the stock Hollywood bad father but rather a real character whose had some bad luck and made some worse choices. The only questionable casting choice is Hader as a nebbishly, highly successful doctor. An actor with more screen presence or machismo might not leave you feeling concerned for his future that he winds up with the ""broken"" Amy. Maybe he doesn't need to save her but just getting run over by her is no fun either. The plot never drags but in some scenes you can feel Apotow call cut and then talk about the next setup. In short, a never stellar but always good old-timey rom-com.",Trainwreck

She's assigned to do a story on successful sports doctor Bill Hader, and they essentially fall in love although all of Amy's instincts send her running from commitment. On the face of it, a fairly routine romantic comedy scenario with the typical gender roles reversed.

93,diac228,"Despite the usual Apatow frustrations, Amy Schumer rises above the flaws to deliver a great debut",7,20 July 2015,"Continuing the fantastic Summer season for females (Charlize Theron, Melissa McCarthy, Anna Kendrick) we have Amy Schumer branching off from her stand-up and television success (Comedy Central: Still Trying to Replace Dave Chappelle) to deliver a fine performance in an Apatow movie that has all the typical Apatow strengths and weaknesses. Just like Apatow's best, we have a delightful staff delivering the laughs and the dramatic undertones to make up for sloppy directing and loose editing that we've seen far too many times from the Team Apatow comedy circle.We've seen this movie before, and we know the destination. Regardless of how raunchy or how off the PG-13 spectrum, romance movies carry the same formula and usually produce the same results (With 500 Days of Summer and Before Midnight being notable recent exceptions). We continue watching these because of the joy of said journey. Amy's voyage as she tries to shed her provocative past to become happy is a lengthy yet enjoyable watch, mostly because of her slick and slightly jagged sense of humor. This is her script and it has her brand of comedy sprinkled all over the place. Expect off-the-cusp movie references, uncomfortable content, good raw emotion, bite of New York flavor, and even some MacFarlane-like unpredictability.Schumer has the comedic chops, and will earn your attention even when she is at her least charming. Helping the movie is Bill Hader, who played the perfect straight man getting caught up in Amy's whirlwind of a life. Although the cameos are a bit distracting (This Family Guy-like technique dates the movie slightly), LeBron James, John Cena, and a few others provided a surprising amount of laughs, with Cena being especially impressive in a short yet pivotal scene.Apatow still lacks the ability to chop the movie to a more acceptable length. This has killed/damaged his recent efforts like This is 40 and Funny People (especially). Trainwreck once again has that slowdown period that has people checking their phones and watches, which especially hurts after a strong first half. And as previously stated, we know the destination, the journey has to maintain its interest. Despite the strongest efforts from everyone involved, it gets a little tiresome before the heartwarming finale. Unless the movie spans decades, no romantic comedy should run past two hours. All of the best romantic movies (Princess Bride, Eternal Sunshine, Beauty and the Beast, Before Sunset/Sunrise) run under two hours.Yes, I know the gem Love Actually breaks the rule I just placed. Moving on....Despite the flaws of time and distractions, Schumer does a great job in her debut cinematic vehicle. I can see a good future with her as long as she works with the right people and expands her range. She's funny, fearless, and has a nice dosage of New York charm. All of those ingredients make this an entertaining viewing and far better than Apatow's previous flicks. It won't shatter the movie industry or alter your perception of her or the genre, but it won't be a total disaster sitting through this---you'll find plenty to laugh and be shocked at.",Trainwreck
94,dcarsonhagy,All Aboard!,7,10 November 2015,"This film opens with the father of two girls (played by Colin Quinn) drilling the mantra monogamy in any relationship is just asking too much. Quinn uses the girls' dolls as a hilarious means of getting his message across. Such is the case for Amy Schumer in ""Trainwreck."" The film was written by Schumer and directed by Jud Apatow. Flash forward to Amy's later years and you find she took her father's message to heart. She's known by everyone as a one-night stand. One of her ""boyfriends"" is expertly played by WWE champion, John Cena. I was disappointed that he was not in the movie any longer than he was, because he knocked his role out of the ball park! Amy distances herself from everyone until she is assigned by her boss to do a story on a sports doctor, played wonderfully by Bill Hader. When she realizes she's in love, she tries to look for excuses to break up. Another reviewer gave this movie a 1-star rating, and I will say this is a very adult look at today's society--pulling few (if any) punches. Although I did not think it was as funny as advertised-- don't get me wrong; there are plenty of laughs and site gags--I enjoyed the story. However, I did think the movie lasted just a little too long (it comes in at just a shade over two hours). I watched the unrated version, which contained full male nudity, lots of simulated sex, and TONS of language. Still, I would recommend viewing.",Trainwreck
95,DavidYZ,Starts off well,6,15 April 2017,"This film starts off as a funny, lively comedy about a slutty party girl, played by Amy Schumer. Her scenes with John Cena's character are very good. However, the film turns into a drama when the protagonist inexplicably quickly changes into being monogamous after starting a relationship with Bill Hader's character. This relationship isn't believable at all, nor is it entertaining. There's no way that she'd want someone as dull as him, nor that he would want a promiscuous drunk like her. His acting is wooden and he derails the film rather than adding anything useful to it.There are two sex scenes, but it's disappointing that we don't see her body properly in either. In the one with Cena she's not nude; in the one with Hader, it's dark. Schumer should be flying the flag for curvy girls, showing off how hot she is.There's a dreadful, miserable, unnecessary subplot about her father being chronically ill and dying. This is totally out-of-place in a comedy film and adds nothing positive or useful to it.",Trainwreck
96,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,17 September 2015,"When you're talking about ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and especially ""Knocked Up"", you would be hard pressed to find a person that worships those movies more than I do. And not just from a comedic side, I really admire how the films are made, those aren't just lightning in a bottle, those are genuinely brilliantly directed films, so of course I was looking forward to the new Apatow film. He will get a lifetime pass from me. Unfortunately I am so saddened to say that this is a really, really average-at-best dromedy.All the emotion and respect with which the characters were treated by Apatow in his first two features is really notably absent here. There simply aren't all the brilliant and subtle touches that make you emphasize and relate to the characters. They are always separated from you. What I am trying to say really is the fact that the movie just can't figure itself and its characters out. Are we supposed to laugh with the characters? at them? are we supposed to laugh at all? hell, at one point I started seriously thinking is this even a comedy? But I didn't think that because I wasn't laughing, which by the way I didn't for the whole two hours, there are many supposed to be comedies where I don't laugh, it is simply the fact that I never fully understood what was going on with the characters, what was the movie's tone, I never knew if something was funny or serious and the gags too weren't excellent, on the contrary the majority were very dull.Looking also at the romantic side of the film I couldn't help but be unimpressed. It does avoid some clichés but falls into some other huge ones. I also never bought the chemistry between the leads and again the characters weren't in a place were they felt interesting or genuine. They were never whiny or annoying, but they weren't anything for you to be holding your seat onto. There were many subplots that weren't going anywhere, running gags that weren't really running gags and so on, just a lot of unfocused stuff.On a side note: I never watch trailers, ever before the film. I just watched the trailer for ""Trainwreck"" before the review and looked at a different film, it feels almost like the trailer is better than the movie. There is so much stuff that has been cut out that I can immediately located in my mind fitting in the film and making it what it should have been. That really annoys me. Cut the Lebron stuff, cut the subplots that weren't needed and give me the funny, relatable romantic comedy this should have been.As you noticed I never used any mean or despicable words above to describe the film. That's because it really is harmless and actually you feel it's good hearted. It also has some smart ideas and briefly touches on some interesting themes, that are unfortunately really underdeveloped and hardly set up to begin with. Where did that whole monogamy thing go? where did the pot and alchol versus relationship thing go? there is much, much more than you think to be explored there and those things are left hanging. But then again, the cast is fine, engaging at best, the movie isn't boring and always feel like it's coming from a good place.",Trainwreck
97,scottshak_111,"Not exactly weighing on a plot, but it's damn funny!",7,19 November 2015,"So this is how comedy movies ought to be. Okay not exactly slow paced, and rummaging at a snail's pace for a plot. But I am talking about the humour. A1! Amy Schumer is excellent with her slapstick witty comebacks. Her one-liners and her prime comic timing crack you up and you burst out into fits of laughter at times. Bill Hader complements her beautifully. Both are excellent comedians and have been placed beautifully in the flick that see a lot of cameos by the renowned.Judd chooses a quirky storyline to punch in huge sports figures like Lebron, John Cena, Amar'e Stoudemire. Also, he doesn't leave out the entire cast of SNL. So it's like watching SNL do a bit, only that lasts 125 minutes. Also, there are quite brilliant cameos by famous actors like Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei, Matthew Broderick etc. each one of them imparted an excellent humorous bit to nail.The drama doesn't exactly tingle your nerves but it wasn't supposed to in the first place. The story whatever little we had in the baggage was basically the most clichéd one. Also quite predictable as you see everything coming. But the characters and the cast of the flick furbish it quite superbly.So the bottom-line: A comedy movie that tries to walk on a sports backdrop and on comic ventures of the famous.",Trainwreck

We watch her steer a course between her bigoted dirtbag dad---as played by Colin Quinn, he's pretty adorable---and her blandly domestic sister; the opening one-night-stand montage has some great observational sex jokes, and the rest of the dialogue's pretty sharp: She tells Hader that one of her favorite sports teams is ""the Cincinnati Thunder Wizards"" and remarks brightly to her sister that her husband's wearing his ""'To Catch a Predator' sweater.""Ironically, it's only when movie character Amy decides to get it together for Dr. Right (Hader) that screenwriter Amy starts to get all loose and sloppy, resulting in one of those dumbass break-up-so-we-can-make-up romcom finales (the less said the better about the big dance number). LeBron James, basically playing Mr. Natural to Hader's Flaky Foont, gets some of the best lines (contributed by Chris Rock, apparently; -see above under ""Trivia""), and the kid who plays Amy's sister's metrosexual stepson has a brilliant future. Four-fifths of a pretty good film, so 6.5 stars.",Trainwreck
101,troyputland,Trainwreck is a great Rom-Com/Comedy.,8,9 September 2015,"Trainwreck's leads, Amy Schumer and Bill Hader, are placed in the different gender's shoes. Amy sleeps and boozes her way round New York, caring little for her nearest and dearest. Aaron (Hader) is the sensible, kind-hearted sports surgeon looking for a woman to settle down with. Aaron's presence threatens to turn Amy prim and proper, which scares her. With Judd Apatow directing and Schumer putting pen to paper, there's a level of assumption. The laughs come thick and fast and the serious moments are dappled with genuine humour. Schumer, Hader and Schumer's on-screen sister Brie Larson are compelling, in-depth characters, the latter two the likable ones of the trio. Schumer pushes the character-audience relationship to the edge, bombarding us with a mixture of feelings. She's at her best in the serious sections, at her worst (spoiler) when scene-stealing WWE star John Cena breaks off their relationship. Schumer is the human definition of a trainwreck. She's is the most unlikely of leads, but that's why this is memorable and enjoyable movie.",Trainwreck
102,ginocox-206-336968,"Slightly flawed, but many hilarious moments",8,17 November 2015,"""Trainwreck"" is brilliantly hilarious at times, but the story structure is seriously flawed. Great performances by Schumer and Hader in the central roles, with outstanding performances by James, Cena, Swinton, Quinn and Miller in supporting roles and amusing cameo and bit parts by Broderick, Radcliff, Tomei, Attell and others. Cena is hilarious playing a parody of bodybuilders. A one-on-one basketball match between Hader and James is funny and nicely choreographed. Production values are excellent, although it does lag a bit at times. Kudos to the filmmakers for actually planning their shots and locking the camera down to avoid those annoying jiggly-cam shots. Amy Schumer plays a character who burns her candle at both ends, and she looks the role. She has good features, with blond hair, blue-grey eyes, good teeth, etc., but looks overweight and bloated. At thirty-four, she could be mistaken somebody in her forties, while at thirty-seven, Hader looks as if he could still be in his late twenties or early thirties. Schumer's character, also named Amy, needs to clean up her life. She drinks until closing hour then resumes at an after-hours club. She smokes and has no interest in exercise or sports, as a spectator or participant. Her two main romantic interests are played by John Cena, playing a bodybuilder with aspirations to become a fitness guru, and Bill Hader, playing an orthopedic surgeon who treats athletes. These are two guys who are very much concerned with fitness in both their personal and professional lives, yet both seem unconcerned about Amy's unhealthy lifestyle. Either or both could be agents of change in Amy's life. Her character needs to change for her own benefit and to graduate from the succession of one-night stands with losers looking for easy scores, so she can commit to the monogamous relationship that her father told her was unrealistic. In the girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back plot progression, she symbolically abandons her bad habits and Attell has one of the funniest lines in the movie when she does. What follows is an intricate scene in which she wins the boy back, which is well done in its own right, but inappropriate to the plot. It would have fit if he had dumped her instead of her leaving him. She needs to put her resolve into action and there needs to be a transformation that he witnesses. It probably would work better if he became alarmed by the extent of her risky behavior. Instead we have the rather tedious theme that all she needs to do to find true love is to open her heart to it and stop rejecting all the top-notch suitors who seem blind to her faults. The movie should also show more and tell less regarding her job. Her editor tells her that she's one of her best writers and is being considered for a promotion, but she doesn't seem at all competent as a writer. She doesn't ask any insightful questions when she interviews Aaron, doesn't pitch a story idea, does nothing to assist the intern and pukes while observing the surgery. When we finally hear the opening lines of her story, it sounds more like a billet-doux than an article for a prestigious magazine. As a writer and an actress, Schumer shows a lot of vulnerability and has the courage to portray an unsympathetic character with honesty and commitment. It would have been a better movie with a stronger moral if her character had shown the courage to grow and change, rather than simply announcing she was ready to change. But the movie has enough good material to make it an enjoyable viewing experience, despite the fairly lame central theme.",Trainwreck
103,jmoneyjohal,"A fresh and breezy rom com, was enjoyable, but nothing too novel.",6,17 July 2015,"Judd Apatow is now know for his quirky un clichéd romcoms and with Trainwreck he just pushes the envelope a bit further. In his new film its a role reversal of sortd where instead of the the guy being the playboy, here the girl is the playboy, shes the one who doesn't believe in love, and loves in indulging in drugs, alcohol more than normal. Where in the guy follows the typical girl romcom traits. Couple that with some very raunchy humor, thats make fall out of your seat, and this film is very engaging (the comedy might be a little to raunchy for some).Acting wise both leads Amy Schumer and Bill Hader excel, and are tailor made for there roles. Amy however does leave more of an impact as the film revolves around her. And its nice seeing that the Director tired to pick people who look like everyday normal people rather some ultra glam leads, which would make the film lose novelty.Overall all though the ending is very clichéd, the film is breezy and fresh in its genre, and realistically what else could be the ending anyways. It was also nice seeing Lebron James and Amare Stoudmaire in special appearances. Overall the film breaks no new ground in the genre but its nice enjoyable watch.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",Trainwreck

Although it may not be his most riotously funny film, it's both an entertaining and heartfelt story that you will undoubtedly enjoy.Let's start with the most important part of the whole film, the humour, and it is fantastic. The first hour of the film is a brilliant laughter-fest, with jokes galore left, right and centre, almost all of them guaranteed to land and give you a good chuckle.Amy Schumer is immediately likable and funny here, with her promiscuous character being surprisingly understandable (thanks to a hilarious opening scene explaining her background), and that makes such a difference to enjoying the multitude of gags that are thrown at you in the opening stages.The other impressive thing about the first half of this film is that the characterisation is fantastic. Everybody seems like a real person, with their own individual motives for everything they do, and that's what makes it such a surprisingly convincing and engrossing romantic comedy, because you can understand and genuinely empathise with each character.However, the main reason that this isn't an absolutely incredible film comes about in the second half. Normally, Apatow's films are consistently jokey all the way through, with some drama woven within, however this takes a less comedic approach towards the dramatic side of it all.That's not to say that the drama in this film is boring, far from it, however the story loses its really enjoyable vibe in the second half when the relationship and romance becomes the main focus, and at a running time of 126 minutes, it can drag a little.In the end, there are jokes everywhere you look here, and an interesting dramatic story in the latter stages to boot, however this isn't a consistently enjoyable watch because of its uneven balance between comedy and drama, as well as its somewhat overlong running time.www.themadmovieman.com",Trainwreck

So my reaction comes from personal taste vs. what is a valid movie that women would enjoy. But I really have not enjoyed those films personally.I had a rare reaction. It was clearly a good movie, but I didn't enjoy it. Amy Schumer is a smart comic. I've enjoyed many of the episodes of her show. The script was smart and almost a drama/comedy, which confused me.But analytically I feel many of Aptow's movies are like that and usually too long. Same with this.Scummer plays a borderline drunk/pot head, which is uncomfortable for a lead in a comedy. But I wasn't feeling it. It was tacked on and wasn't working.Someone suggested gender stereotypes were reversed. That was kind of true. But then Hadar took the reigns early on after Schummer's character tried to pull away.The actual love story started way late and was cut short by silliness.

Start with Amy herself, who I loathed from the moment she broke up with her sweet but dopey boyfriend. The guy is pouring his soul out and she wants to leave because she's high and ""needs this interaction to be over"". This is meant to be our protagonist? Usher! I want my money back! I want to see the other half of the film, the one that follows John Cena's Steven as he recovers from Amy's dumping him. Its more conventional, but Cena was the only character in the film I actually liked. He completely steals the movie with his gym-obsessed (or spoken in Chinese) pillow talk. Speaking of steal the movie - when is The Dogwalker, starring Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei, hitting theatres? That little gem was one of the few delights in the script.For the most part, Schumer's screenplay baffles me - how can it create such good dialogue for Cena (I want three boys and two...other boys. Enough for a basketball team!) and a few nice scenes (the funeral scene was surprisingly profound) but be so flat for others? Brie Larson and Tilda Swinton (Tilda Swinton! I thought her transformation in Snowpiercer was huge!) both give great performances but unfortunately, they're stuck with extremely unlikeable characters (I don't know, but I found Kim shoving her stepchild down her father's throat to be a bit grating). Bill Hader (who I like but don't yet buy his leading man status) is Amy's new love interest. Here the movie jumps into conventional territory, which is fine if it wasn't pretending to be otherwise. Amy's baffled reactions as Aaron tries to court her properly felt forced - I'm sure other guys had tried that during her life. But that's a large part of the problem - I didn't buy Amy as a character. She introduces us to these rules (whilst breaking them, buy the way), professes to love casual sex (which she avoids in the first scene) and then says she'd have sex with Edward Scissorhands because ""he'd stay?"" Are you Barney Stinson or Ted Mosbey in this situation? The two of them share very little chemistry - their initial sexual encounter was one of the clunkiest I've ever seen - and after that the story is generic enough that its not worth commenting on.What irked me the most was the audacity of Schumer to completely unnecessarily write in a spoiler for The Usual Suspects. Now generations of people who saw Trainwreck have had an infinitely better film spoiled for them. Don't bother with Trainwreck, just rewatch Fool's Gold or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. At least McConaughey and Hudson are nice to look at.",Trainwreck

She is charged with writing a piece on a sports doctor, played by Bill Hader.The film's couple seems like a strange combination, but they do have a few good moments in the film. Amy's reactions to most things in the film and sarcastic, dead-pan humor works pretty well. But most of the plot falls flat.This is just a mess of a film overall and the purpose of the film seems lost. Bill Hader just doesn't have the ability to be a lead love interest. He doesn't seem like a highly successful sports doctor. Best part of the movie comes from non-actor LeBron James and his scene- stealing time in the film. Beyond that, this film is definitely a wash.

110,Jerghal,You could do a lot worse in this genre,7,26 October 2015,"Amy Schumer is someone you might know from her stand-up comedy or as one of the foul-mouthed members of the Comedy Central Roasts. Trainwreck is a film she wrote and also stars in as her first lead role. Well writing it must have been rather easy because the story is one of those romcom templates: a wild girl with commitment issues meets a nice man who isn't her type but falls for him against the odds. So much for originality... But...if you absolutely do want to see this type of film you could do a lot worse. The acting is pretty good and you can identify and care for the characters. As it is however a Judd Apatow film you can expect it to be overly long. 128 mins for this kind of movie is way too long, it should have a bit more pace but Apatow never let's his editor cut anything it seems.

Amu Schumer is NOT a leading lady and it has nothing to do with her looks, which is what feminists will claim. She is, quite frankly, obnoxious. Surprisingly she isn't a bad actress but too often her true personality comes through and, as a protagonist, it destroys much of the film. I think she would be better suited for the obnoxious friend of the main girl. Bill Hader does a solid job but is mostly forgettable. Honestly, the only reason this film is worth watching is for the plethora of celebrity cameos, highlighted by LeBron James. They all play versions of themselves in hilarious skits that fit neatly into the plot.

112,Michael Fargo,A score!,9,23 July 2015,"This a sweet, beautifully filmed, tender (and very profane) first outing for the talented Amy Schumer. When I heard she was involved in a film project I so hoped it would be one worthy of and didn't exploit her talent (and potty mouth).You don't have to be a fan or even be familiar with her stand-up routine or inventive TV show to embrace this film or its star. Apatow said he approached Schumer to make the film, and if that's the case, we should all applaud his outreach and the result.Schumer doesn't hog the screen either. There's a funny mock documentary with Daniel Radcliffe that could launch a spin off. And Lebron James is allowed to nearly steal the movie. Bill Hader, as the love interest, is a sensational foil for Schumer (I wouldn't have anticipated that). Their chemistry keeps the film within the framework of a romantic comedy. Frankly, the entire cast is working at their highest level and that alone makes the film a must see.The profanity, which is Schumer's hallmark (such language coming out of that sweet face) could offend those who object to such, but its framed as a problem for the heroine (in truth, in Schumer's case it's anything but a problem; it's made her a star). And the film makes her flaws self-deprecating which, again, is anything but the case. So I was a little disappointed that Schumer is made to be humbled by what the film's characters see as flaws. I'd pity the poor soul who said that to her face in real life or during her stage show.And the final scene (involving cheerleaders) was so off the mark for Schumer herself that I wondered how much control she had over the project. Neither she nor her character has anything to apologize for. She has made a career of standing up to some very real problems for women, and it's sad that in her first film outing she's made to apologize for that.She's a brilliant, original talent, and nothing and nobody should stand in her way.",Trainwreck
113,dussaultjulien,The first of many unfunny Amy Schumer movies.,1,10 April 2019,"Schumer is a jerk. Let's just get that straight here. She is a horrible person in this film and doesn't really change for the better by the end. I feel bad for Bill Hader's character, but then again he enabled her behavior so it's his demise.",Trainwreck
114,cordenw,surprisingly good,7,21 July 2015,"I've seen clips of Amy Schumer while flipping through the TV channels and I have to say that her style of humour didn't do a lot for me. Maybe it's my repressed English upbringing but I got the feeling that she was a bit too crude for my taste. I wouldn't normally have gone to see her in a movie because of this feeling, but I have read some rare positive reviews on IMDb so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I have to say that it was a chuckle filled experience, it had some great ""Airplane"" type moments in it and several scenes where real-life pro athletes clicked with funny performances. It would be a stretch to say it's a fabulous movie but there were some great one-liners and you had to be on your toes to catch them. Amy herself portrayed the part very convincingly but knowing what we now know about comedic actors, I don't think she had to go too deep in the well to find some of the emotions she displayed. She was very good though, as were all the foils in the picture and I thoroughly enjoyed the interplay. I'll probably have to watch it again to catch some of the good jokes but it's a job I'm up for. Good comedy is very hard to produce and this one helped laugh away a couple of hours.",Trainwreck

Although I enjoyed this film despite being a little cliche, but I don't think I will ever make an effort to see ""I Feel Pretty"".",Trainwreck
116,blakiepeterson,A Winningly Subversive Romantic Comedy,8,18 July 2015,"""Monogamy isn't realistic,"" Gordon Townsend (Colin Quinn) declares to his daughters, Amy and Kim, after his wife files for divorce. This statement, repeated by the girls in a robotic chant, is sickeningly funny — such an announcement sounds odd coming from the mouths of two kiddos under ten — and while we laugh, we can only wonder what effect it will have on them in the future. We know their childhood is going to end up more than a little messed up, and we know that a parent who finds cheating to be a natural part of life isn't the best figure to have around. So decades later, we're surprised that the sentiment has lost all meaning for Kim (Brie Larson), now married with a stepson and a child on the way. But Amy (Amy Schumer), expectedly (based on the abrasive promotional posters for the film), keeps the quote up on a flashy banner in the inner workings of her pessimistic brain. She's a maninizer (ensuring none of her one-night-stands stay the night), a hard drinker (she oft finds herself in bars when the going gets rough), and an opponent of, you guessed it, anything even resembling monogamy. By day, she works at a sleazier version of GQ, S'Nnuff; by night, she's the trainwreck we expect her to be.During a meeting at work, she is hastily assigned to write an article about Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), a sports doctor whose clients include LeBron James, Tom Brady, and a bunch of other heroes I can't remember the names of because I watch movies, not athletics. She is hesitant (she was only given the task because of a vocalization that she hates sports, her editor (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) believing it would be an interesting angle), but Amy, being the charmer she is, handles the situation like a pro; until she ""accidentally"" sleeps with Conners and ""accidentally"" falls for him. Such a situation terrifies her — she has never been in a serious relationship — but, like all decent romantic comedies, it becomes obvious, and desired, that the two will ultimately become the pair Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine always wanted to be.""Trainwreck"" has a plot line found in most romantic comedies you can think of (boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy loses girl, and then boy, getting a hold of what he's missing, wins the girl back over), except the gender norms are reversed and the girl is the one with all the baggage while the boy waits for her to sort things out. A person as quick to pass off rom- coms as me would normally rip apart a movie so predictable, but as a huge fan of Schumer (I've watched ""Inside Amy Schumer"" since its debut), I expected things wouldn't be cheesy but subversive, knowing, whip smart. And we get exactly that.Schumer has never been afraid to embarrass herself — consider a sketch from her show this year, a black-and-white homage to ""12 Angry Men"", was a star packed debate trying to decide just how fuckable she was — and in ""Trainwreck"" she goes all out. She introduces herself, just minutes after the flashback in which her father throws out the monogamy line, with an embarrassing walk of shame. She continues the shame with a drunken voice-over. And then we find out that she's been sleeping around while still dating a devoted giant portrayed by John Cena of all people. We shouldn't like her, but Schumer is a lovable woman, not because she's disarmingly perfect like Meg Ryan but because she's so unafraid to put herself out onto the table and make fun of herself.Some of the film is personal: she really does have a sister named Kim, she really does have a father with MS, and she really does have vaguely unhealthy living habits (though her writing dramatizes the notion). Schumer's disarming honesty is what makes her such a refreshing comedienne. Unlike other brilliant comics in her category, the raunchy Sarah Silverman and the borderline offensive Chelsea Handler, Schumer is so appealing because she mixes shock with intimate layers that may or may not suggest vulnerability. In ""Trainwreck"", her self-deprecation only goes so far — there comes a point in which her character completely breaks down in realization that her lifestyle only hides deeper troubles. It's this kind of tearful candor that will make Schumer a game-changer in her generation.Technically, the film is a Judd Apatow movie (he produced and directed it), but this is Schumer's ballgame, and she knocks it out of the park. Her screenplay is as frank as it is hilarious, the characters exquisitely characterized. Giving great parts to comedy usuals Quinn (foul-mouthed) and Vanessa Bayer (grinningly scene-stealing), while fleshing out roles to unexpected players like James (sublime as Conners' BFF), Swinton (wigged out, tanned, done up), and Brie Larson (the straight-woman), she gives her supporters as much of a chance to shine as she does herself. Co-star Hader provides an exceptional performance as the love interest, so good that we're reminded of charismatic talents of the yesteryear rather than the personality-less heartthrobs Matthew McConaughey used to specialize in.The buzz surrounding Amy Schumer these last few months is timely and well-deserved — as a comedian on the rise for too many years, it's awesome to see her develop into a talent big enough to murder the big screen. She's always formidable in her TV sketches and her stand-up routines, but ""Trainwreck"" is the film that's going to turn her into something besides a Comedy Central find. This woman is going places.",Trainwreck
117,nims-1975,Great in many ways but needed small changes,8,8 December 2018,"Trainwreck is a very good film. It was quite funny and entertaining but needed small changes. The film featured a big cast of different actors and actresses including Amy Schumer, Brie Larson, Bill Hader, LeBron James, John Cena, Matthew Broderick etc. When I started watching I was worried that I won't see much of John Cena in the film. I did see quite a bit of him in the film and his acting as Steven was absolutely brilliant. The only thing about this film that needed change was that they should have used John Cena in this film a bit more, maybe in other scenes after his split from sexy girlfriend Amy played by Amy Schumer. The film wasn't absolutely hilarious but it was quite funny and had some funny scenes such as the one where John Cenas character Steven got in an argument with a black in the cinema when he was watching a film with girlfriend Amy and said some funny things to the black guy. The film wasn't an excellent film but it was a very good one which was entertaining.",Trainwreck
118,lia00027,The Real Life Going,8,18 September 2016,"Just like the title of my review this movie's story similar with individuals' issues happening in society today. No one can know that the title ""Trainwreck"" is really happening on this movie with train wreck of emotions. The plot already telling a modern woman with issue of insecurity due to her childhood's remembrance of what happened to her parents having low-esteem about her life, work, even love life, but then out of emotional roller coaster mistakes of her life she was trying her best to fix her mistakes and not to be ashamed of who she is which I really appreciate a lot since it lacks on most of the modern movies stumble upon her issues, fixed it and made up with her lover. The idea of modern woman of having too many one-night stand, afraid of being a mom, care for her only sick parent, cold-situation at work (it happens in real life), too insecure to commit to one person (that you thought is the one), etc are not wrong it happened to her and can be happening and may be already happens to most of us (women). The acting of the actors are decent and enjoyable, the happy ending is short but is good. Overall I think this movie is good even though it's not a typical romance-drama movie.",Trainwreck
119,abouhelier-r,Trainwreck,8,19 November 2015,"Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy. Trainwreck isn't as radical as I expected, it even subverts the formulaically feel-good ending implied in its setup. After all, Apatow has always been a pretty conventional moralist. Even if Schumer's doesn't have quite the range of some other recent stars Apatow has worked with. Her writing makes up for it. Amy's attitude toward her deep flawed dad is interesting as he helped shape the mess she became. However, Schumer is more than credible in this kind of role, usually associated with men, making fun of her character's distrust of love while showing how honestly she comes by it. I also loved the chemistry between her and Bill Hader, they're some relevant moment, like arguing, moments that real couple could have. Plus, LeBron James continues the Apatow tradition of working famous non-actors into the cast. Fortunately, James is charming in the part: a penny-pinching Downton Abbey fan who is protective of his friends emotions. Schumer's script conveys the story's psychological cause and effect without needing to express it in clichéd dialogue and too busy squeezing jokes. They've achieve a right balance while throwing some dramas in the comedy itself, some relatable things. The execution is a little different that's where the drama comes in. I was impressed with this movie, mainly because Schumer wrote it, it just blows my mind. She got skills and that's always awesome to see it. Overall what you expect will happen in this movie will definitely happen in this movie.",Trainwreck
120,stephendaxter,Great comedic timing from Any Schumer and a hilarious supporting cast,7,2 August 2015,"Trainwreck is a romantic comedy directed by Judd Apatow and starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader, and this film comes in very strong with the comedy. The romance side of the film kicks in about 30 minutes in, so for the first act of the film it really has some pretty damn good laughs. There was a pretty steady flow of jokes and comedy gags throughout the film and you have to give most of that credit to Amy Schumer who was incredibly hilarious in this. She is one of the funniest people out there today and she proves it in this film with perfect comedic timing. Her style of comedy is so blunt and fairly subtle at some moments and that makes it very unpredictable so she can hit you with great jokes left right and centre and you never see it coming. Now even though she does manage to pull it off the best, Bill Hader and the supporting cast are also hilarious and provided a lot more laughs than i had initially expected. Bill Hader of course is hilarious and he works in this film really well but he was slightly overshadowed by Amy at some moments in the film, and the large supporting cast also took away from him a little. But man were the supporting cast hilarious, i have to give credit to LeBron James because that guy is hilarious. He was one of the biggest surprises of the film, almost every scene he was in i couldn't stop laughing, it looks like Apatow and Schumer managed to teach him a few things in terms of comedy. As well as being jam packed with great hilarious moments this movie really had a basic but also pretty good rom-com story thrown in there. And it worked well, they didn't just force any random plot in there to add to the run-time. For the first two acts they did a great job at blending those comedic scenes and romantic more plot driven scenes well so they could switch between the two vary naturally. But the third act for me didn't work as much. The romantic side began to take charge and the comedy took a back seat. There were still some pretty funny scenes in the third act but it felt uneven tonally and a little jumpy. There was a pretty sad moment at one point then it tries to crack a few jokes immediately after then going back to the romantic stuff and it didn;t work for me as well as the rest of the film. I don't think it was an issue of being too long just needed a little more refining towards the end. But otherwise it was a great funny movie. Amy Schumer's comedy may not be for everyone so those who are not a fan of her 'Inside Amy Schumer' skits probably won't like this as much but as far as a romantic comedy goes, this one was actually very good and had quite a bit in there for everyone. - 7.1ALSO, on last thing, i just checked the list of cast and was surprised beyond belief when i found out that Tilda bloody Swinton was in this film. Like WTF? she was completely unrecognisable and hilarious, so see if you can pick her out when you see the film.",Trainwreck
121,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Trainwreck,7,26 March 2016,"I find the Universal, Judd Apatow and Friends movies to be very hit and miss.This was definitely a hit!I have watched some of Inside Amy Schumer and I couldn't get into it so I was a little apprehensive about seeing a movie with Schumer as the lead star and now after watching the movie, I didn't need to worry.Schumer and Bill Hader are both pretty awesome in this but are both easily overlooked by the awesomeness of the scene stealers: John Cena, Lebron James and Tilda Swinton.If I didn't know Tilda Swinton was in this, I would not have recognized her! Completely different from anything I have ever seen of her.I don't hold much value of sports stars being actors, Dwayne Johnson is probably a fluke exception but both John Cena (who was in one of my worst movies of all time: The Marine) and Lebron James did a pretty awesome job in this movie. They were both funny and natural and had bigger and better roles than I expected them to have.It did get a little slow three quarters of the way in but got it's groove back for the end, complete with an AWESOME dance number!While this film is entirely predictable, it is still entertaining with plenty of laughs.Deserves a watch, or two, either at the cinemas or DVD/Bluray.",Trainwreck

First of all, to be honest, I did NOT like this lady Amy Schumer starring. I think she's really ugly to be playing this part of the sex-hungry 30 something, working in a fashion magazine type of girl. Apart from that, she seemed really really inexpressive throughout the movie, which I guess is no good for an actress right? Apart from that, I really really loved Lebron's acting in this film, and I think that this is the apocalypse of the movie overall. He was so good! The morals and life lessons were there and the story with their father is something that appeals to most. The scenario was well-written and the guy that played the doctor was also really good. I think that someone can spend some quality time watching this one, just for the fun of it and quite some laughs that came along the way. That is if you can really get over the protagonist's face, as she's really not fitting for the part at all, and personally I find her a bit annoying, just by looking at her. Now that I come to think of it, she's like a chubby, ugly version of Jennifer Lawrence, with blonde hair (sorry for that Jennifer).",Trainwreck
124,dale-51649,"Dumpy but ""do-able"" blonde finds love, then doesn't know what to do with it",5,15 May 2016,"I have mixed feelings about the film, it was preachy and hackneyed, but did provide a few good laughs.Schumer plays a chubby blonde with a bad body and OK face. She works at a tabloid mag where she can exercise ""the dark sense of humor of the abused"". Just picture a chic playing the kind of character Will Farrell has made a career out of, then add the extra intellect writers feel they are required to give females in order to be PC. Oh ,by the way she is also a cynical, promiscuous drunk.The character Schumer is dating is a dumb gym rat, and probably a latent homosexual to boot (not that there is anything wrong with it). This allows for tons of locker room and jock showering jokes that are the hallmark of Apatow films (makes you wonder what high school gym class was like for him ). Along comes this doctor who would never date Schumer in real life, but he falls madly in love with Amy without explanation.The rest of the film is predictable with a capital P, where Amy realizes her jokes about family life were all wrong and that if she doesn't get married and have kids she will spend the rest of her life either suicidally depressed or criminally insane. Her beautiful sister has a dorky kid and douchey husband, so I'm sure for wealthy writers living on the west side this all had a very realistic feel.The film did have a few priceless scenes, the one where Schumer is trying to have sex with a weird guy gave me belly laughs . However, it went from a 7 to a 5 star because of it's hackneyed , predictable Hollywood mantra ""Children/family good, single bad"". There is nothing worse than a message flick , especially one billed as a comedy. Packed with childish bathroom humor (not that there is anything wrong with it).",Trainwreck
125,FilmMuscle,A Familiar Rom-Com Stacked With Humor,7,19 July 2015,"Following off of a critically disappointing reaction to This is 40, director Judd Apatow decided to move on to his next project, titling it ""Trainwreck"" as if generously handing critics an easy opportunity for a pun should this next movie go bad as well. ""Well, that sure was a trainwreck. Get it?"" Thankfully, Apatow returns with a bang and scurries all the haters away quickly. The joke is on them now. Trainwreck follows a female lead this time around, Amy (played by rising-star comedian Amy Schumer), who lives an incredibly promiscuous lifestyle. One-night stands with burly jocks and wealthy dentists provide her with enough emotional/physical comfort, and so much as a romantic gesture from a partner scares her away. However, what happens when she suddenly falls for the sports doctor (Bill Hader) she's assigned to interview for a men's magazine feature?Schumer is joined by an amazing cast including appearances from Lebron James, John Cena, Daniel Radcliffe, Marisa Tomei, Tilda Swinton, Brie Larson, and more. Honestly, it's thanks to the actors surrounding Schumer that make this film so damn funny. Cena (who's easily the best part of the movie) and James, in particular, essentially poke fun at themselves throughout the entire film without any fear of embarrassment. What's it like having sex with meatheads, for example? Of course, then there's Bill Hader who is incredibly likable as usual, carrying brilliant timing and sarcasm around like an instant comedic weapon. The awkward and ill-fitting dynamic between him–a normal man who wants a normal relationship–and Amy–a woman who's having trouble hiding her highly licentious history and maintaining her composure–never drains of amusing entertainment.Lebron James apparently watches Downton Abbey. Such a riot! Schumer herself, however, when the spotlight is solely focused on her– while occasionally funny as well–really just relies on the raunchiest of sex jokes the whole time. At that moment, it turns into a competition of just how descriptive the sexual conversations and insults can get. Personally, that sense of humor has grown fairly tired since Apatow's debut twenty years ago (The 40-Year-Old Virgin), and I haven't been a fan of Schumer's comedic work so far anyway. Then again, a month ago, Melissa McCarthy actually impressed me and forced me into incessant, painful laughter with Spy–something I never expected from her. In this case, Schumer is exactly the same foul-mouthed, dirty-minded comedian we see so much of nowadays (Sarah Silverman being another example).Now, like Woody Allen, Judd Apatow treats the comedy genre with respect. We see dozens of lazily-shot comedies every year; the cinematography is always crystal-clear and modern without any sense of visual flair. However, Apatow makes his comedies look like actual films rather than the careless, 90-minute quickies Hollywood is known for. We see beautiful lighting in classy restaurant scenes with the right level of depth of field. (The fact that the movie was shot on film rather than in the digital format certainly helps bring that nicely saturated look to the screen.)That being said, Trainwreck unfortunately feels like another romantic- comedy with nothing really new to say once we truly start looking at the plot. Okay, monogamy is stupid and senseless? Interesting concept. The main character lives with that mentality until she meets ""the one"" and decides to go the romantic route once all is said and done. What made her change her mind? What is the solution to monogamy or crass human nature? Trainwreck gives us an extremely conventional conclusion to the rom-com story but never a fitting climax to these fascinating societal themes, thus failing to drive its semi-unique premise to the end and losing the originality the further we delve into the duration. The story hits its predictable beats right at the most predicable points. So, is it Apatow at his most creative? I really don't think so. With that being said, considering a summer that's lacking in laughter, Trainwreck will undoubtedly regenerate your sense of humor and get you back on Lebron James' side.",Trainwreck
126,lucasversantvoort,Tries to be straightforward and parody itself simultaneously...and fails,5,18 November 2015,"Trainwreck, an appropriate title if ever there was one. Nah, it's not that much of a waste of time, but I did leave the theatre disappointed. This is one of those self-aware rom-coms that nevertheless remains trapped within the very genre conventions it parodies. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The first scene introduces us to nine year old Amy and five year old Kim as they're taught a valuable life lesson by their soon-to-be divorced dad: that monogamy is overrated. Skip ahead about 15 years and we see the end result: Kim's got a family and Amy screws around, making sure to never let the guy spend the night after sex. Dear old dad has grown old, has MS and now lives in a home, aka an assisted living facility. Amy writes articles for one of those modern peppy magazines and is told to write something about a certain Aaron Conners, a doctor who treats basketball players. They start talking which leads to dating which leads to Amy feeling uncomfortable about those strange feelings of intimacy she's experiencing, etc, etc. I knew next to nothing about Trainwreck beforehand, but I did hear that it was self-aware which given its genre it has every right to be. Rom-coms can be some of the most mind-numbingly boring films your eyes have ever had the misfortune to behold. But Trainwreck was supposed to be different, I had gathered. So, I went in expecting all kinds of in-jokes only seasoned rom-com veterans would get and, to an extent, that's what I got. The film is at its best during these disarming moments, like when there's a big hug involving Amy, her sister and her family and Amy says something to the extent that she can't handle so much affection, 'love overload', etc. Or when Amy (despite having said she hates cheerleaders) dances with them for Aaron and afterwards explains how it's supposed to be a metaphor thus ridiculing similar scenes from other rom-coms. You get the idea. And then....*sigh* there's the rest of the film and it's many failed attempts at straightforward comedy. There are jokes here that are so terrible, I actually started feeling sorry for the actors. Tilda Swinton does what she can as Amy's editor, but there's a point when a script is beyond saving. I mean, what does it say about your comedy that some of the high points involve what are basically glorified cameos from sports figures like LeBron James and John Cena? The main problem with Trainwreck, however, is that it tries to tell a serious rom-com story all the while parodying its own genre. It. Just. Doesn't. Work. You've got a scene where the film mocks its own existence and all of sudden there's an emotional funeral scene. Pick a damn lane, grandpa!Would I recommend this film? Not really. Some of the comedy is good (emphasis on 'some), but too many jokes just fall flat on their asses to really recommend it. The wait for the next really good comedy continues...",Trainwreck

Her sister Kim is married to Tom (Mike Birbiglia)who has a son. enjoyed the scenes and conversations between Kim's stepson(Evan Brinkman as Allistar) and Amy.

Funny scenes especially when Amy is on the subway which stops and she wants to know why train stopped suddenly and gets a whole minute of explanation in perfectly normal tones from an irate passenger. Also the scenes between patient needing left knee surgery and getting right knee marked as Not this knee by a very tired surgeon up all night talking to his girlfriend.

128,Sci-FiHorrorFan,I'm Sorry but this Film was Very UNFunny.,4,20 November 2015,"I thought this film was pretty Boring and the story was not my cup of Tea.This Film is Overrated and I don't understand the praise it gets.Amy Schumers Jokes were very Juvenile and Not Funny and she was Never Funny. I don't understand why so many People Like Amy or her Character because there was Nothing to Like about her. Her character was immature selfish and Rude, she tried so hard to be Funny and it seemed the more she Tried the Less Funny she was. Her character is basically a Bitch who likes to sleep with a different man every day and yet we are all supposed to feel sorry for her for some Reason?.well I didn't Feel sorry for her at all, why should I when all she does is insult people the Entire movie. Most of the characters Sucked and most of the Jokes Sucked, there were more Misses than Hits for me personally. The Acting was good but the characters themselves were Not likable Especially Amy's character, I found her Very Annoying and obnoxious most of the time. This Film tried way to Hard to make you laugh and as a result it becomes Less Funny not More. A lot of the Jokes felt forced and when that happens it does Not Work for Me. I thought Amy was a little Bit Pretentious at times because she always acted like she thought she was better and Smarter than everyone else and she was NOT. Sorry But Amy was Lame and John Cena was also Lame and I found him terrible as usual,He was never Funny or interesting or sympathetic and I never liked his character. The sex scene Between Amy and John was Disgusting and it Was Not Funny at all. During the sex scene John Cena tries to talk dirty but he just makes a Fool of Himself and it was embarrassing. I am Very surprised people found that scene funny, what's so Funny about a guy trying to Talk dirty and Failing?. Some of the Dialogue was pretty Lame especially during that scene,it was very Cheesy and overreacted. That whole scene should have been cut out of the movie because it was embarrassing for John Cena and a Waste of Time too. The Film is also too Long it's 2 Hours and it did Not need to be that Long, The First Hour feels like it drags on Forever and its only when it got to its second hour that it picked up a bit.Towards the end of the Film her character suddenly changes from a Bitch to a (good guy) which felt very forced and out of the blue and then suddenly we're supposed to Like her?; I'm Sorry but it's too little too Late. Amy spent most of the Film being an obnoxious Cow and now we're suddenly supposed to care?. I'm sorry Amy but that's Bad Writing on your part because I didn't Care. Maybe if she had of tried to do the right thing sooner I would have cared But as I said before its too late.I guess I will now mention the few little Things I did like in the film, one of them was Bill Hader I actually Liked his character and found him to be a simple and straight forward guy which made him easy to like, he was also Nice and took Amy out to dinner even though she was a cow to him.I actually Thought Bill Hader Was Funnier than Amy,and I got more Laughs from him and None from her.The Acting was good from everyone and I also thought the film was Shot well. The directing was Okay but I have seen much better. The only characters I liked were Bill Haders Character and one of his friends and the others I couldn't give a Rats Ass about.I Hate to Admit This but I thought the Ending was Okay it Ended Nicely with a crazy Dance scene which I will admit was a little bit funny,but I found that the Majority of the Film was not funny. The Film also has a few Pretentious Characters in it which did not help the Film. The Boss Lady at the work firm was a cow and Never Funny and she was also very annoying and obnoxious,This movie just seems to be filled with obnoxious UnFunny people and that hurts the Film for me.Overall I got about Five Laughs Max in a 2 Hour Film and that's pretty bad considering this is meant to be a ""Great Comedy"" I'm sorry but This was one of the WORST comedies and I got bored while watching it.

While some may say that if you'd seen one, you've seen them all, I disagree. The film, the genre, it is a good constant that almost never fails to bring a smile to my face. And for that, it did well.The only complaint I would've had was that I should have watched this in the ideal environment.

132,bravesfanc,"Cliché, but hilarious",7,20 July 2015,"The plot of Trainwreck is nothing special. It's a pretty basic Judd Apatow comedy with hilarious dialogue and physical comedy. Amy Schumer, is our main character who was taught at a very young age by her cheating father that monogamy isn't realistic. Fast forward to present day and we see that she has taken this mindset and has countless hook ups while ""dating"" one of them played by John Cena who did an awesome job.She's given an assignment at work to do a story on a doctor who is changing the way surgeries are done. Bill Hader is that doctor who also happens to be great friends with Lebron James (who plays himself). Long story short, Amy and Hader fall for each other but then conflict ensues, they fight, both are depressed and so on.Lebron James steals every scene he's in, it was pretty impressive to say the least. The beginning is a bit slow but there is enough comedy to hold your attention. It's a funny movie and if you're a fan of Apatow films, you'll enjoy this one.",Trainwreck

134,vistheindian,Not the complete package,5,2 September 2015,"Quickie Review:Amy (Amy Schumer) in her adulthood has become commitment-phobic strongly influenced by her abandoning father. When she reluctantly takes on a project to interview Aaron (Bill Hader), Amy starts to have strong feelings for him. However, her years of commitment issues might just be too much for their relationship to handle. There is a lot to like about Trainwreck in terms of the comedy and talented cast. At the same time there is a lot to hate, most important of which is the clichéd romantic-comedy story. While the movie starts off strong with some gut-busting laughter, and the promise for something fresh, the predictable story makes an already dragged out film feel like a chore to watch.Full Review:Judd Apatow directed one of my favourite comedies that I was probably too young to have seen when it came out, The 40 Year Old Virgin. With other prominent comedians in the cast of Trainwreck I was curious to see how his latest project turned out. His directorial stamp is still apparent, but it takes huge nose-dive in the latter half of the movie.Full disclosure, I am not a fan of Amy Schumer as a comedian. I think that she relies too much on immature crass shock factor to get the laughs. But even with that opinion, I found that Schumer was actually quite funny in the film. Which surprised me since she wrote the script. Even though it does get a little raunchy at times the jokes really hit their mark especially in the first half of the movie. Bill Hader was great addition to the movie. The relationship between Amy and Hader's character felt realistic, with few extremes for the dramatic tension of course. On top of that the cameos from different athletes and comedians worked really well. It's obvious they are not the greatest actors, but they were used sparingly and wisely. So there were definitely some unexpected laughs from people you don't see in comedies.Then it all changes in the second half. At one point there is total 180 degree flip in the tone, from a comedy to a drama (at times melodrama). It's such a drastic change that it almost feels like you are watching a different movie than the one advertised. Aside from that, the combination of sinfully long runtime and clichéd storyline didn't help either. Think of any, literally any romantic comedy movie and voilà you know all the plot points this film will cover. By almost completely abandoning the comedic tone, it was difficult to bear the mediocre drama.Trainwreck, much like the lead character is not a complete package. You enjoy the ride, the jokes and so on, but as the movie goes on, you start to wonder if you are wasting your time. If you are going to watch this, you have to be fully aware to expect two different movies in one.",Trainwreck
135,jonnytheshirt,A Trainwreck in the opposite direction,2,19 August 2015,"Firstly this is an enjoyable film with a good cast and funny and light hearted so good for when you're in the mood for that. It reminds me a bit on Spy in a way as it's in the opposite direction as Spy starts off with the main character being all nice and pretty boring and progressively gets funnier as Melissa McCartney starts getting her mouth on and confident. Trainwreck is the opposite in that it starts with Amy Schumer in character form, foul mouthed and sassy and progresses to an ending that's pretty at odds with that. Maybe the journeys nice however rather than exploring anything interesting with some of the great characters in the movie it hurtles towards RomCom and ends in a whimper what started with a roar. Not bad, but not Bridesmaids which balanced great left-field laughs with warm cuddley message at the same time. You will know, yes you will know the moment the line was crossed in Trainwreck, into RomDom.",Trainwreck

Showing a woman who treats men the way most men treat women is not only realistic, but eye-opening. I think that's the problem most men have with the movie. No one wants to see the shoe on the other foot--it's uncomfortable, but guess what? It's reality.I thought the movie was funny and touching. LeBron James is hilarious as himself.For whoever says there is no real strong story-line? They obviously missed it. It's about maturing, about figuring out what a person's priorities are in life. It's about the realization that compensation isn't all it's cracked up to be.",Trainwreck

What I got started off gross, although not very funny, but then it slowed down. Before long it became tedious, with some touching scenes with the father, which carried it along for a while.By the 1-hour mark I was willing to stay but waiting for it to end. Then it really started to drag. It's like somebody said, ""Let's make a really, really bad imitation Woody Allen movie without the comedy or the genius.""When I finally just couldn't stand another minute I got up and got out. I knew it must be near the end, but it didn't matter. I did not care what happened to the two protagonists *in the least.* UGH! LEMME OUTTA HERE!***SPOILER*** I don't actually have a spoiler, my whole review is a spoiler. The movie makers seemed to get desperate after the 1/2-way point. They threw in random scenes, apparently trying to spice it up, but oh, my, are they dumb.Lebron James is a big surprise. He is good, and funny, and fresh. Tilda Swinton's prodigious talents are curiously wasted. Marv Albert, Chris Evert and Matthew Broderick must cringe at the very thought of what they had to put on the screen to get their paychecks.Trainwreck is a very surprising huge disappointment.",Trainwreck
139,plex,WTF-Amy?,2,8 December 2015,"There's no bigger fan of A.S. than me. I'll write that again; there's no bigger fan of A.S. than moi! Seven years ago I caught here stand-up routine and was completely impressed, so much so, I boasted to my friends:""keep your eyes out for this one, she's going to be huge"". I was right. So when I heard she had merged her skills with the omnipotent Apetow and SNL vet Hader, I was thrilled, especially on the heels of her success with her solo show "" Inside Amy Schumer"" which IMO is brilliant from top-to-bottom, and has only improved since its debut. Sadly,this is where my admiration pauses, and I do hope its ONLY a pause. It appears that her 1st foray into a tinsel-town backed project was to be guided with a conservative hand, to narrow the margins of Amy's comedic breadth, which as you know, is highly suggestive and sexually charged, as some sort of test to see if she will play ball with the establishment and/or if not, Apetow would be there to pull in the reigns, thats the sense I get of this because even though she is credited as the sole writer, its far too prosaic, conservative for her, and its in the absence of her brand we get cliché'd and perhaps Apetow script(ed) influence. The film starts off closer to Amy's M.O. but as it progresses in run-time, it regresses in edginess and her personality eventually gets lost amongst predictable clichés. Some of the material in the film closely mirrored bits from her erstwhile stand-ups. Amy needs to be Amy. Its as simple as that. The whole package, at least for now, is this innocent cherub-looking blonde who juxtaposes her appearance with dismissively dry explicit sex talk. Good news, is there was a lot of hype and great publicity for her in 2015. Along with the ROI the distributors made with Trainwreck, she will be sitting pretty.for a while.",Trainwreck
140,drawlife,A return to form for Judd Apatow.,7,31 July 2015,"Judd Apatow started off two for two with The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, he then sorta fizzled out, but he's regained some of his magic with Trainwreck. I really enjoyed this film, but if you were expecting a very raunchy in your face comedy, well don't expect it. The raunchiness is still apparent, but it's very sophisticated. Right off the bat LeBron James and John Cena to me stole the film. LeBron's performance feels very natural and very real. I believe he has some of the funniest moments in the film and when he gets animated he doesn't come off too jokey, and his delivery is sharp. John Cena was quite a surprise as well. He wasn't in a role that I originally pictured him in when I first heard of the film, so that was a plus. He comes off as a giant built dude, who has a very soft interior. Cena also provides very funny moments as well. Lets talk about the two leads. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. I know this is overstated a lot, but if the chemistry is not there, then the film doesn't pan out. Thankfully their chemistry is there. I liked Schumer's performance, her character comes off as a bit unlikable, but she eventually grows on you. She obviously has the most prominent story arc but it's done well and it brings some relatablilty. Hader is great, I think this film proves that he can be a male lead and perform well. It was interesting to see him play it a little more straight and his dialog exchanged between LeBron James and Amar'e Stoudemire are sharp and always funny. Brie Larson also has a nice supporting role as Amy's sister. I'm not big on romantic comedies, but there are a few that make me laugh out loud. I wouldn't rank this as high as other Apatow features(directed or produced) like Forgetting Sarah Marshall or The 40 Year Old Virgin, but it's right behind those two. I haven't seen all the comedies released this year, but so far Trainwreck is on the top of the food chain. The only problem with this movie is the last act, it's a little forced down, a little too cheesy and feels rushed. But that being said there's plenty to enjoy. 7.7/10",Trainwreck
141,theemuhammede,Dirty humor,8,26 April 2016,"I really did not know what to expect with this movie prior to watching it. It turned out to be hilarious, but in a dirty and inappropriate manner.This movie took dirty humor to a new level. Amy, played by Amy Schumer, was non-stop with her clever dirty comments. Her boy toy Steven, played by John Cena, was not the role I thought Cena would play. He was a crazy self obsessed protein ego maniac and was highly sensitive. LeBron James, he played himself, was shockingly funny in his role in the movie.The story was not anything that was outstandingly remarkable, but the humor was consistent for the most part and it was engaging. There was a brief part of the movie towards the end where it became serious. That had killed the vibe that was going throughout the whole movie. But after that period of seriousness, it was back to the dirty jokes and moments.",Trainwreck
142,Oberrated,Mehhh...,5,21 April 2016,"Trainwreck was an overall decent comedy film. Personally, I am not a fan of Amy Schumer's as I find a lot of her humor dry and boring. That same crude, sexual, and dry humor was present throughout this film but she did have me laughing on multiple occasions. Bill Hader, however, had me rolling throughout the film. I am a fan of his and thought he did an excellent job portraying the hopeless romantic, rich, and sports loving doctor. Also there were many sports figures in this film whom also did quite a good job at their comedic performances like LeBron James, John Cena, and Amer'e Stoudemire. Overall, I did enjoy the film but I found it boring and dragging at certain points but it definitely had its moments and as I stated before; It's Amy Schumer's humor in the movie. She wrote the script and she is the lead female. Be ready for her style as it is not for everyone but it is surely funny frequently throughout the film.",Trainwreck
143,MdlndeHond,Funny only the 1st 20 min,5,31 July 2015,"Tilda Swinton is phenomenal....and with that I have summarized all the strong points of this movie. Amy Schumer is somewhat funny in the first 20 minutes but that dives steeply when the story becomes a sappy romance movie with 90ies narrative in the second half. Close to the ending this 2+ hours dragon features about 30 minutes too much of schmaltz and clichés. It gets tedious watching it dragging on to the point where embarrassing bad fetish sex scenes and cheerleader performances are killing the last of what could have been good. There is nothing special about this movie and I was rather disappointed, trailer was promising and the general rating of 7.5 on IMDb at the time was pretty good. Not recommending this. Tilda is hilarious though, watch the first half and hour, then just turn it off.",Trainwreck
144,juliendussault,Amy Schumer is disgusting,1,30 June 2020,"This movie was unapologetically written by Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer is not funny, and it really shows in this film. I really don't understand how this woman shot to fame with lame jokes that would have gotten any male comedian booed off of stage oh, but it's okay for Amy Schumer to do it because she's a woman.This movie shows did Amy Schumer is a player, disgusting and that Bill Hader character is a complete and total wimp who would rather be enslaved to somebody rather than in a relationship with him. It's more like indentured servitude than it is a relationship, except there's no way to get out of this indentured servitude. Judd Apatow lost it years ago, and this movie blows.",Trainwreck
145,brutzel,"Funny , at times",5,27 December 2015,"Amy (Schumer) doesn't believe in monogamy, drinks a lot, does drugs and sleeps around a lot. There's a word for this beginning with the letter S. She is a writer for a kinky-sex expose magazine, but is given an assignment to interview Dr Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) a Sports Medicine Doctor who treats celebrity athletes. Amy knows nothing about sports.Hard to believe that this movie is actually funny in many places. That is, it becomes funny when we get past the opening sex scene where uncovered naked Amy and uncovered naked Steven (John Cena) on top of uncovered naked Amy have a sex conversation or they try to. Once this unnecessary scene is gone the movie becomes quite normal except for the Hollywood mandated sex language, of course. To be fair, the sex language doesn't last all that long, is never funny and it's just there to appease those who come to the movies to hear it.When the movie settles down we enjoy seeing Amy fall in love with Aaron. Oh, there are some pitfalls along the way, hence the title Trainwreck which Aaron sees as Amy sabotaging the relationship later on.The pull for me in this movie was seeing LeBron James in the promos. He becomes the breath of fresh air that drew me in. His banter with Aaron is quite good and is very funny when they go one-on-one on the basketball court. Later on we see an intervention for Aaron with Chris Evert, LeBron James, Matthew Broderick and Marv Albert who acted as the Referee giving a play-by-play description of this intervention. This was very clever and quite good.Notables in unnecessary unrelated scenes: Daniel Radcliffe as a Dog Walker and Marisa Tormei as a Dog Owner.Other notables: Tilda Swinton as Dianna, Amy's boss, and she had her moments and was quite good; and Amare Stoudemire as Aaron's patient. Let's not forget the attempts at sex with Amy and the company intern who wants kinky sex when Amy is on the rebound from Aaron. Quite unfunny and total unnecessary as it would have made more sense if she just picked up someone else at a bar and it didn't work out. She is still in deep for Aaron. Oh, and the women at a shower party telling off-color things that happened to them. Amy's tale was the most disgusting as even the women cringed along with you-know-who. (let me guess: You?)Without the sex scenes and sex talks this could have been quite good and later be seen on prime time TV. The dialogues between Amy and her sister, her father, LeBron James and with Aaron were very good and reasonable, but Hollywood has to throw in Raunchy stuff and unnecessary, not funny scenes that don't help anyone.Still funny is funny and there were many instances of pretty good humor. And the funny stuff always happened when there was no sex scene or raunchy sex talk. Will Hollywood learn from this? Quite doubtful (5/10) Violence: No. Sex:Yes. Nudity: Yes, but nothing is seen. Language: Yes.",Trainwreck
146,RileyOnFilm,The Amy Schumer Experience,6,19 July 2015,"Many short comedy sketches by Amy Schumer inserted to a full length movie script. Vulgar, understated, ridiculous, sarcastic, ingenious fun.I confess I look at critic ratings prior to seeing movies, especially ones that aren't out yet. I saw Trainwreck garnered high 90 percents from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes which really surprised me so I was interested. The cover looks like Bridesmaids and the Hangover had a baby and that's somewhat accurate. What I didn't know going in was that the protagonist has starred in her own Comedy Central show for two years. In fact, she's been on Ellen and spurred viral footage of her riffing and making Ellen snort she's so funny. I think it would help for people to know she is an established comedy commodity with a distinctive vulgar and often understated style. Without that knowledge, one could make the mistake of thinking it's just another sex and puke comedy dangled before primal eyes.Maybe that alone will work for most viewers. We've been so inundated with gross films in the last 20 years for which audiences show their love through ticket sales. As for me, I think if I didn't know of Miss Schumer's notoriety and idiosyncratic style, I might has scoffed through most the movie. As is was, I enjoyed watching her brand of humor for a couple hours. Speaking of hours, there were some scenes about 3/4 of the way through when she and her boyfriend, Bill Hader, start fighting like a married couple where the film truly dragged for me. It's for those scenes as well as unnecessary penetration scenes that didn't add to the comedic lines for me. In other words, the writers didn't have to stoop that low to relate with the audience. That a; having been said, I found this film a hoot to be sure. My wife and I were in tears during the sex scene with John Cena. He's the perfect hunk to demonstrate what talking dirty is not.",Trainwreck
147,keithlovesmovies,Trainwreck,9,18 July 2015,"After her parents divorced at a young age, magazine writer Amy Townsend's (Amy Schumer) father tells her and her sister that monogamy just isn't realistic. Since then, she has adopted promiscuity as her credo. Despite living a uninhibited life void of commitment, she gets into a rut. When she is unwillingly assigned to write a profile about a charming sports doctor Aaron Connors (Bill Hader), she starts to fall in love with him, which would be a first for her, and he starts to fall in love with her. With this, she starts to wonder if it's time for her to change.While this film isn't the raunch-fest I expected, it still had its moments and I still enjoyed it. This film is original in that it reverses typical gender roles in romantic comedies where the woman is the pursuer and the man is the pursuee. The script, written by Amy Schumer, is what really puts this film over the top. The two leads are both complex and have some depth to them. Amy's character is smart, funny, outgoing but can also get emotional and dark at times. The dramatic and more emotional parts revolve around the relationship between Amy's sister (Brie Larson) and her father (Colin Quinn). Their chemistry is what sold me and it all works well. Quinn also gets the chance to deliver some of the film's best one liners as well as a speech at the opening which set the tone for the rest of the film. Hader's Aaron is the normal guy among all the outrageousness but he holds his own. The film was also able to get some great, funny performances by those who you may not expect, mostly from some well-known athletes. The film does get a little formulaic at times but it chooses to approach this in a way that is smart, real, and non-cliché in the way that it handles relationships. This is because the characters are real and that's what makes them more relatable. There were many moments in this film that made me laugh out loud including a scene with John Cena in a movie theater which I won't spoil. This brings me to another thing I liked about this film, the ensemble, the other actors in this film, Amy's family and also Tilda Swinton as Diana and Ezra Miller as Donald, also hold their own and are really funny and they take advantage of the great material they have to work with. Just to be clear, this not a family film. There are instances of strong language and adult content but I did not agree with the rating it received (at least here in Canada). The film is a touch too long but you won't notice because you'll be busy coming back down after having laughed so much.

Schumer's extreme sense of humor shines in the beginning but the movie quickly turns into a boy meets girls story and the ups & downs of that new relationship. You've seen that movie 100 times.

I adore her stand-ups, her jokes, her quirky humor and disregard of political correctness. Having said that, I should admit, I enjoy Inside Amy Schumer a lot, but Trainwreck was too much.I have the biggest concern about Amy's character, who is an exact copy of Amy we see on the stage or in Inside Amy Schumer. Even if we consider that this movie is about real Amy herself and somehow resembles her life or ""life-style"", there should be a way to make it work without reminding me every other joke I've heard on her stand-ups or TV shows. I don't mean it wrong, they are funny and painfully true, but I did not spend two hours just to rehearse them.I should also confess that I loved seeing Ezra Miller here. Why this fellow can't make more movies? To conclude, if you have not seen any other acts by Amy Schumer, I bet you will enjoy Trainwreck a lot.

She is unbearable, you do not get why the Doctor loves her, you do not see anything good beneath the bad surface, she is unlikable. So at the end, her ""transformation"" doesn't convince you at all, not that you really care about it.I am not even sure if the writer wants to talk about how people can be bad and selfish and mean and that can change with love (ha!) or if she tries to justify this ""ugliness"".

152,JoshuaDysart,Tame and tedious,6,30 July 2015,"Schumer genuinely makes me laugh. I dig her show. But it turns out creating sustained, feature-length comedy is a different bag altogether. I appreciate Schumer/Apatow's attempts at grounded, human comedy. This doesn't have to be as broad as say, ""Spy"", which was way more funny and, I think, thematically much smarter. But if you're going for grounded comedy then the characters have to be... well, interesting. And every single character in this is a one-dimensional shell. Each one has their role to play in the script and are nothing beyond that. The performances are strong, and the actors work hard to humanize their characters, but no person in this film is expansive or complex or terribly engaging or remotely unpredictable in any way. In fact, absolutely nothing is unpredictable in this film. So, for me, it comes off as not broad enough to be funny, and not genuine enough to be grounded. Combine this overwhelming predictability, flat characterization and the sports-stunt casting with Apatow's habit for long running times, and an uninspired, robot-written third act, and you get a film that's more tedious than fun. But Schumer herself is funny. And more than that, she's important. She's at her best when she's exploding the precious notion of female body imagery in joke after joke about bloody tampons and promiscuity. But the film lacks the courage of its star, which is a complicated criticism, since she actually wrote it. There was the potential to make something outrageous and beautiful here. That potential was pretty much blown.",Trainwreck

161,rcastl2335,"Conventional rom-com, neither train wreck nor triumph",6,22 July 2015,"Except for the casting of the lead actors (Amy Schumer is attractive without being the usual stunning beauty of rom-com, Bill Hader is gawky but appealing) this film is as conventional as any film Katherine Heigl starred in during her heyday. Amy Schumer, who also wrote the script, has a reputation as a transgressive, aggressively sexual comedian. Here that stance is sloughed off pretty quickly, complete with the standard courtship montages from every romance film you've ever seen. Hader does his equally conventional part with some flair but isn't given enough good lines. His scenes with patient/friend, the basketball player Lebron James are actually the comic highlights of the film. James, along with Tilda Swinton, who plays Schumer's magazine editor boss, offer some of the funniest bits in the film. To give her performance chops some due, Schumer does show a flair for dramatic acting in a couple of scenes. Still, this is a very, very traditional film and never comes within shouting distance of the boundary-defying work Schumer's television show is acclaimed for. Given her flowering reputation and the show business might of producer/director Judd Apatow, it's disappointing they didn't push the boundaries. Or themselves.",Trainwreck
162,tgrock,"A Mess, but a Hilarious One (Review for Unrated version)",8,4 December 2015,"Trainwreck tries to do too much. It wants to be a comedy, a drama, and an edgy romantic comedy. It succeeds heavily in the laughter department. The rest is really never earned and feels forced. Each scene plays out like a skit to get the joke out instead of focusing on the drama and romance. So, when dramatic scenes finally do come along, they're difficult to take seriously.The biggest mistake the film makes is attempting to be a romantic comedy at all. Amy Schumer plays a player. Bill Harder is the person that she falls in love with to make her change her ways. The film never gives us a reason for Amy Schumer's character to fall for Bill Nader's character though. There is no initial spark between the two characters. If you've seen the previews, you are aware of the scene where Bill Harder calls Amy Schumer the day after their one night stand to ask her on a date. Amy and her coworker think something must truly be wrong with Bill Harder in this scene. Looking at it plainly, there seriously must have been. All Amy Schumer does is treat Bill Hader like garbage their first date and then decides to just have sex with him to his surprise. What guy would ever be interested in a woman that acted like this? It is all one big warning sign that Anmy Schumer's character is crazy.Another big mistake the movie makes is casting Lebron James as a supporting character. He cannot act. Some good jokes are mined off of him, but he doesn't have the comedic timing to pull his role off. There is another athlete, Amare Stoudmeire , who displays much better comedic and acting chops in a small cameo. He should have been cast in Lebron's place.I still give Trainwreck an 8/10, because it is really funny and sometimes that's enough.",Trainwreck
163,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Trainwreck Review,6,17 July 2015,"My Thoughts: Trainwreck is brought to us by Amy Schumer who wrote and stars in the movie, her first big screen role jumping from the small screen. What this movie basically is a romance/comedy movie with Amy's brand of humor thrown in, so if you are looking for some new take of the romantic comedy you will be disappointed. This movie is pretty by the number movie girl doesn't want a committed relationship, finds a guy that is actually pretty decent and falls for him, has a fight with him and pushes him away, and then has a big make up scene. I am sad to say that a lot of the reviews that I have seen claiming great things for this movie is I think giving Amy Schumer a pass due to either liking her comedy and making the jump to the big screen. The movie is okay and yes some of the jokes are hilarious but some are just either flat or go over the top, but that is Amy's humor. Even outside this movie Amy is a hit or miss for me she likes to push the boundaries and sometimes it just goes to far and no longer becomes funny.Now don't misconstrue that I didn't like the movie, it is a good movie. And I have to say LeBron James and John Cena steal the scene when they are on camera. Like one of my other movie buddies has stated you will never look at John Cena again after watching him in this movie and he performs it great. LeBron James I didn't know what to expect from him and seeing him play this version of himself just had me laughing all the time whenever he was on the screen.When Amy's comedy is on point she is hilarious and you are laughing so hard it hurts but I just can't agree that this is the greatest comedy of the year maybe the summer but that is only cause there have not been a lot of great comedies out this year. On a side note the women should love this movie for the amount of eye candy Amy puts on the screen which is fair in my opinion since Hollywood seems to love using women as eye candy for most of their movies.My Recommendation: See it, if for nothing else than to see John Cena and LeBron James performance.For more reviews check out www.shepfromtamp.com",Trainwreck
164,bartonj2410,Amy Schumer is the new foul-mouthed queen of Hollywood,8,23 August 2015,"A female led comedy without Melissa McCarthy involved is something of a rarity these days. Ever since the success of Bridesmaids, McCarthy has been the biggest female comedic actor in Hollywood. With the release of Trainwreck though, there is a new name on the block and a challenger to McCarthy's reign at the top. That name is Amy Schumer and believe me, it's a name you will hear a lot more of in the near future.Trainwreck stars Schumer as Amy, a fun-loving woman who was taught at a young age by her father that monogamy isn't a realistic way of life. With that in mind, Amy has lived her life having one night stand after one night stand, with her one rule being; never let them or herself stay over for the night.Amy works as a writer at a magazine and when assigned to write an article on sports doctor, Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), she finds herself facing her biggest fears. Living by the lesson her father taught her at a young age, Amy has issues with commitment so when she starts to grow an attraction towards Aaron, she has a bit of a meltdown while trying to settle down with Aaron.What I liked most about Trainwreck was that, like Bridesmaids, it wasn't your usual chick flick full of clichés and unreasonable portrayals of the ideal man. It was vulgar and full of dirty jokes, which is how I like my comedies. I also liked the way the roles in the film didn't follow the typical romantic comedy formula, with Amy being the woman afraid of commitment and Aaron being the clingy male in the relationship instead.Amy Schumer is very good in her first lead role, showing some fine comedic chops and perfect comedy timing. Schumer becomes even more impressive though when realising that she wrote the whole thing herself. It's a very funny script with some genuinely hilarious moments so it is no surprised that Judd Apatow picked it up to direct.Schumer is joined by Bill Hader, who I've always been a fan of, and he doesn't disappoint either. He can do the silly comedy as well as the more serious stuff and in Trainwreck, we see him lean more towards the serious side, while sharing a good chemistry with Schumer.There is also hilarious support in the form of John Cena as Steven, one of Schumer's hook- ups, and LeBron James as himself, Aaron's best friend in the film. LeBron James had almost a natural deadpan delivery which served his character well but John Cena's two scenes had me laughing my head off.Look out for an appearance from Tilda Swinton as Amy's boss. While her character is pretty annoying, Swinton is unrecognisable in this film.The main issue I had with Trainwreck was that, like a few of Apatow's films, it has a pretty lengthy runtime for a comedy. There is a lot packed in, some of it unnecessary, that makes the film sag in the middle, similar to Knocked Up but nowhere near as much as the drab This Is 40. For me, Trainwreck is the funniest film of 2015 so far and will no doubt make a star out of Amy Schumer. Whoever says women can't be funny is quite clearly very wrong indeed.",Trainwreck

This is a movie that thinks it has some kind of 'feminist' philosophy behind it, alas, all there is are the oldest jokes that never were funny to begin with and a story that doesn't exist. There is no wit, there are no thoughts and for sure there is no intelligence. How in heaven can those people who are involved in this thing become 'names' that supposedly stand for something, whatever that is?Is it so liberating to watch more or less ugly people who pretend to be 'actors' say stupid stuff about sex?

It was very obvious that some of the jokes just didn't work. Some of the scenes didn't work well enough. The intervention scene was clunky, contrived and sophomoric. I think Apatow could have done a polish on the screenplay to improve it a little. I love his long films, but this is the first time where I think he should have cut down the length. Lebron James was funny. During his first scene, his acting was pretty wooden and made me uncomfortable, but it got better as the film progressed. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were excellent. I think this is Colin Quinn's best performance ever. I didn't realize that Tilda Swinton was in the film until the credits. She was excellent as well. This was not a train wreck of a film, but it did need some tightening up and extra thought.",Trainwreck

171,fabiolpinheiro1993,"Great film, but the story gets off the rails in the second half and goes in the rom-com cliché direction. Amy Schumer is just breathtakingly talented.",7,9 August 2015,"I didn't have anything against this film, but somehow it was never in my plans to see it in a movie theater. But my friends made me go see it and...I have to say i liked it quite a lot, i might even loved it a lot if not only for the huge feeling of freshness that critics made me believe it was. This is one of the better rom-coms of all time, but thats the problem.I was expecting something really original, and different from everything i've ever seen, and the first hour of the film is exactly this. It has laughs to spare, jokes every minute, genius writing, it was awesome. But then the story goes in the wrong direction (then again, to me) and becomes a unrelentlessly 100% rom-com, with all of its clichés, which i love, really love, but not in this movie that showed so much promise and potential to be so unique.Amy Schumer is a genius, she has perfect writing, i love her humour, like really love, and she's one of the better comedians of all time, and an incredible actress overall. But she chose to became overly sentimental and cliché in the second hour of the film, and i think that the her characters 180º change, goes against her character, and if she chose to continue to be an independent woman, that loves to have sex with whom she wants, to do what she wants, whenever she wants, to continue to be this amazing person that shows that not everyone has to be the same, and have a traditional family with an amazing husband/wife and 2 kids, a white house with a green garden, this would be a much more interesting story and film that would be different from the 300 rom-coms that comes out every year.She basically shows she has to change everything she is so that the man she loves can be with her, and she basically changes everything about her to get the man she wants because of course she has to have a husband by her side for ever. She begins as one character and ends a totally different one.The score and OST are amazing, and add a lot to the film. The cast is incredible, and there's a lot to love here. But the films greatest asset is the breathtakingly talented Amy Schumer. What a shame she didn't choose to accept a different path for her character. But this is a really good film any way, and i dare to say an almost perfect one if you want this kind of direction for your story.",Trainwreck

174,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,Funnier and smarter than the average comedy,8,18 July 2015,"Train Wreck is a movie directed by Judd Apatow and stars Amy Schumer, Bill Halder, Brie Larson, and John Cena and is written by Amy Schumer.This movie follows around a sex crazy,commitment fearing girl, Amy (Amy Schumer), as she receives an assignment from her boss (Tilda Swinton), to cover a sports doctor, Aaron(Bill Halder), who as a surprise to no one, falls head over heels in love with her.This set up has been done numerous times before with a variety and degree of success. I usually don't do this in my reviews but I want to address the negatives first because i only had one problem with the movie. That one problem, that Train Wreck's final act was much less bold and entertaining as the first two. The final act ends the movie on a high but extremely predictable note which sucks because this is one of my favorite comedies of the year and i was hoping to give it an A+.Now on to the positives. Amy Schumer! Amy Schumer! Amy Schumer! She is brilliant in every which way in this movie. As a writer she made the script a perfect about of sharp, lethal and above all hilarious humor and enough dramatic depth to stay afloat. This script foxed me with a twist I saw coming from the beginning but was done with such fineness that made it so sudden when it happened. Amy Schumer excels in her portrayal as Amy, the sex crazy, commitment fearing girl she was raised to be. This top notch performance is matched by Bill Halder's Aaron, sports doctor, with often times hilarious results.Train wreck boasts enough top notch dark and light comedy to please a wide audience and I strongly recommend seeing this movie.

175,sadako11,Disappointing,3,27 July 2015,"I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend and we were expecting a romantic comedy but what we saw did not have much romance or comedy.This movie is about an unappealing and dull surgeon that (for some reason that I never understood) fell in ""love"" with a completely unappealing, dull, dumb free-spirited woman that doesn't seemed to have absolutely nothing in common with. That's the main problem with this movie. Amy Schumer's character is completely unlikeable the whole movie and I keep trying to figure out what the men that went out with her saw in her!! There was absolutely nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about her personality. To make things worse she is not physically attractive. I know her character is supposed to be unlikeable, but dammit not the whole movie!!The second problem with the movie is fails as a romantic one. I did not feel anything for the characters. They did not have anything in common and I am still trying figuring out how the hell they clicked. For this I blame the script. The are not enough situations in the movie showing how their connection grow. They had nothing in common!! They just had dinner and sex and they love each other. Did I mention that there was absolutely nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about Amy's personality and to make things worse she is not physically attractive. When the doctor told Amy ""I love you"" I rolled up my eyes in disbelief.The movie is also way too long and in many parts slow and boring. We laugh about four times during the whole movie. Many people left the cinema half way through.I did enjoy Tilda Swinton's Dianna.While watching this movie I kept thinking about ""When Harry met Sally"" a far superior film.",Trainwreck
176,roguecritic42,Im a bigtime Amy Schumer fan-This movie wasn't funny enough.,5,6 September 2015,"This movie has earned one of the lowest ratings I've ever given to a movie that I went to see in theatres.I am big Amy Schumer fan, I love her comedy, and don't get me wrong, she has a couple classic schumer zingers in this movie. It's just if you are going to compare this movie to something like Hangover, Bridesmaids, There's Something About Mary, Ace Ventura, Most Adam Sandler Movies, etc, etc, this movie just fell flat.I give it a 5, and even though it's a very low rating it still has some merits. There are a couple tear-jerker scenes (because the movie did have some good script writing and an excellent cast). The movie did offer some laugh out loud jokes. It's just there really wasn't enough of them. I laugh a lot harder and more often at a 20 minute episode of Inside Amy Schumer, and if your watching a movie that is an hour an half long, the comedy aspect should have had a bigger impact.If your a big fan of hers like me, support her movie, so Hollywood makes more of them. I think she needs a few more chances in big screen movies and I hope she gets to put more of her comedy in them.But I'm warning you, if you see this movie in theatres, you might fall asleep about half way through.

178,Matt-144-792009,Trainwreck Delivers a Full Force Crushingly Funny Comedy,7,25 June 2015,"In Trainwreck, (2015) Amy Schumer plays Amy (convenient), a 30 something serial dater with a strong opposition to commitment. She works as a writer for a men's magazine S'nuff, a playoff magazines like Stuff or Maxim. Her hard drinking, hard partying lifestyle is interrupted when a writing assignment has her meet Aaron (Bill Hader), a successful sports injury surgeon. We are left to see if true love can make this party girl see the error of her ways, amongst the obstacles of personal and professional misfortune. I am an Amy Schumer fan. I first heard her standup Cutting on Pandora, and have been on board ever since. Her television show, Inside Amy Schumer is in my humble opinion the closest Comedy Central has come to filling the sketch comedy gap left after Dave Chappell stepped away from the spotlight. Live and in person Amy does not disappoint either. I have seen her twice, each time she killed. So when I first saw the trailer for Trainwreck with Judd Apatow at the directing helm, I was giddy with anticipation. Now usually in my heightened anticipation like this, there is a hard or sometimes mediocre let down, not here. Trainwreck delivers a great comedy. Amy wrote the screenplay herself before Apatow was signed on. So Amy's brand of humor is the full driving force of Trainwreck. As a fan of Amy's stand up material, I did notice a stand up bit she does, brought to life in a scene involving a baby shower and a game of skeletons in the closet. Very funny stuff. Several other stand ups and ex SNL cast appear in this film as an added treat. My favorite is comedian Dave Attell as a homeless guy. Wrestler tuned action movie actor John Cena is scene stealer in this film as well. It's hilarious the way he plays fun with his ultra-macho image in this role. This film never ventures outside the painfully predictable conventions of a standard chick flick. It even pokes playful fun at itself as it does its obligatory falling in love montage of Amy and Aaron doing cutesy couple stuff in Central Park. Although in movies like this, the plot is just cheap cardboard packaging for the jokes and gags. It is essentially a reverse gender role version Jerry Maguire (1996), as far as the pacing, format and sport star cameos. Shout out to Tony Romo, LeBron James and Amar'e Stoudemire for better performances than Bret Farve's classic ""I'm in town to play to the Dolphins, you dumb ass"" in Something About Mary (1998). Amy's acting in this film is surprisingly believable in the emotional moments of this film. Nothing Oscar worthy, but for a freshman effort it's passable. This movie has heart, charm and re-watchability. If you own Bridesmaids (2011) you will no doubt want to add Trainwreck to your collection. What Amy and Judd have done is capture the chick flick audience and the guy comedy audience and made a hybrid film. If audiences bite, this could be the monster comedy hit of the summer. Not a film for the entire family by any means, there is sex, drugs and 4 letter words galore, but if you are a fan of sophomoric fun this is a must see.

I wish I had not read that article, because I can see the same plots in every movie or show now! This is your standard, run of the mill romantic comedy like all the others...with extra sexual content. Amy plays a slut who meets a guy who is really a good man that likes her and it makes her consider changing her ways.The movie has some really good, uncomfortable sex humor, as well as a life lesson/good story.

I expected this movie to be a comedy and perhaps that is where I made my first mistake. This movie tried to be funny but it never was for me. All the characters seemed unreal and not likable at all. There was no chemistry between Bill and Amy. I still cannot see how those two characters can be together. Most likable characters were those played by the professional athletes. Not sure how and why this movie made so much money and got nominated for golden globe. I guess marketing can do wonders. Watch it if you have nothing else to do.,Trainwreck

So going into Trainwreck I was hoping that she'd make me laugh my ass off. Also, with Bill Hader by her side I thought this was going to be a laugh out loud good time........I was wrong.The script felt flat and most of the jokes by the main cast (Schumer and Hader) aren't that funny. It's sad because Bill Hader is hilarious and Amy Schumer is a big name in comedian. That being said, Amy Schumer wrote this movie, so maybe she didn't want to steal all the good lines so the supporting cast is funnier than the main cast. The supporting cast includes Colin Quinn, Randall Park, Dave Attell, Jon Glase and John Cena. Cena made me laugh the hardest, he plays a muscle bound, workout obsessed guy who says odd gay threats. I couldn't stand Amy Schumer's character, who believe it or not, is named Amy, lazy writing. Her character is terrible in every way and I couldn't connect with her, but that maybe Schumer's delivery.Trainwreck is another flop for Judd Apatow which is unfortunate. There is nothing that kept me connected to this film, the jokes are weak and the sad scenes are mediocre. I had a hard time getting through this movie.

To be clear, I am not a fan of her in general. Yes, there is some gross humour in here, which is another thing I'm not keen on, but as with I Feel Pretty, this runs a little deeper and there is time spent giving her character background and family interactions. It made her behaviour understandable, if not great. Plus Judd Apatow does have a real talent for these type of movies (I don't love all of his either, but he certainly has some classics). Classic could be a step too far, but I found this a nice movie, despite some icky behaviour. Some funny and touching parts. I will definitely watch this again sometime.",Trainwreck

Plus, the fact that she doesn't look like your ""typical"" actress is a HUGE plus, as I think Amy looks perfect the way she is. Bill Hader was the perfect foil to her crass humor and their relationship was very entertaining to watch unfold. Coming into this movie, I did not care for LeBron James, but I am glad to say that his role was hilarious and a pleasant surprise. And, even though I am definitely NOT a John Cena fan, I felt his role was very good.

188,gtylerpayne,Super funny movie with a great cast,9,9 February 2016,"I'm not usually into romantic comedies, but this movie is freakin hilarious. I have been watching it over and over and just can't get enough. I usually just go back to my favorite scenes, and watch those, but there are a LOT of really funny moments in this film. During the second half, it get's more into the ""story"" and the romance aspects which I think work well also, but I don't really need to see all that multiple times.What makes this movie so great is the writing and the cast. You can tell that Amy spent years thinking about comedy and fine-tuning her stand up, and took a lot of her funny bits to incorporate into this movie. And the cast is so perfect. Even the supporting cast like John Cena, Brie Larson, and Lebron James killed it. I was really surprised how funny Lebron James is.I really think that Amy just has that ""it"" factor that makes her fun to watch. She's just a really funny person and the more times you watch this movie, the more you will notice the little nuances in the performances.It's only so often that a comedy will draw me back over and over and continue to make me laugh and this is one of them.",Trainwreck
189,Songwriter_90210,Not as bad as some would have you believe,7,11 June 2017,"OK. This is just crazy. It seems most people can't seem to review movies in a nonobjective way. I know, it's hard. After all, it's supposed to be all about YOUR opinion. That said, one still must consider the possibility to review a movie regardless of whether one cares for the actors involved. A LOT of people simply don't like Amy Schumer. There are mostly two camps: those that love her, and those that despise her. Sure, there's a smattering of folks in between leaning toward both poles, mostly though, she brings out strong feelings in people.I've yet to really put my finger on exactly why. Sure, she seems racist to some, vulgar, trashy, I've even heard her described as disgusting. She's also talented and fearless. She wrote this screenplay. First time out, and I feel she did a great job. It's well balanced, funny, and has a bit of heart. That was mostly from the mind of Ms. Schumer. Ancillary characters are very well placed and a fine casting job was done. The directing was solid. cinematography was very well done. So what is it? Many give it a 10, and many give it a 1. I believe it was better than average, and that's because I'm focused on the film as a whole. All aspects of it. Bill Hader did a great job. LeBron James was refreshingly natural for a sports star. They're usually quite wooden. Very good cast doing a very good job.Then we get to Amy. For someone who's never acted really, I think she could not have been better. Most of the negative reviews focus on two things: the so called ""vulgarity"" of the movie, and Amy herself. So many people are unable to keep the way they personally feel about this young woman out of the mix. This movie is sharply panned mainly because of Amy haters. And I'm not just saying ""hater"" like the kids say these days. Some people HATE her. I think it's ridiculous. Grow up!People get SO offended by Ms. Schumer that it seems like they're going to have a mental breakdown. And the vulgarity? Really?? So you didn't know what to expect from the trailer, or the movie poster, or any of her stand-up? Yeah, right. Look, it's odd to go to a movie that you should know is going to be offensive, and then act surprised when you're offended by it. You know what that makes you? Weird. It makes you weird.Trainwreck deserves better treatment than it got. She deserves to at least be treated like one would a male comedian. She's a brash, raunchy female comedian who's found her niche and made some money, and some people can't stand that. Well, too bad. Women with personalities, attitudes and opinions are here to stay, so you'd better get used to it. I can't believe I have to express that in 2017. You don't have to give her a break, but it wouldn't kill you to ignore her instead of eviscerate her at every turn.",Trainwreck
190,pfogertyca,"A Raunchy Take on the ""Chick Flick"" that Mostly Succeeds",7,12 November 2015,"Amy Schumer takes the traditional ""bad boy meets good girl"" storyline, turns it around to make the girl the lothario, and for the most part, manages to make it work. It helps that Schumer isn't afraid to go to the comedic places few others dare to. Watching her describe a particularly heavy menstrual cycle or a problem with a condom that gets misplaced internally, for instance, is simultaneously disgusting and hilarious, thanks to her matter-of-fact delivery.Schumer plays ""Amy,"" a Hollywood-ized version of herself. She has a glamorous job as a magazine writer, lives in Manhattan, of course, and enjoys all the spoils that come with it, including lots of sex with lots of men. Because of her damaged upbringing, Amy is perfectly happy hopping from bed to bed without emotional ties; that is, until she meets a successful sports doctor (Bill Hader, in a surprisingly low key leading role) who pursues more than just a one night stand with her. When Amy falls for him, her world begins to both come together and fall apart, and we wait to see if she'll eventually screw it all up or see the light.While thin on actual plot, the movie maintains our interest because of the solid performances from the principle characters and the hysterical lines Schumer has crafted for them. It's true that some of the dialogue comes off like excerpts from an extended Schumer stand-up routine, but overall, Schumer shows a significant amount of depth and heart for the people inhabiting her world.Not everything works, like the incomprehensible ""love intervention"" scene involving LeBron James, Chris Evert, Matthew Broderick, and Marv Albert (though it was fun hearing tennis sweetheart Evert say the words ""cock block""). What does work, however, is the acting, especially from Schumer herself. She's obviously a gifted comedienne, but there are scenes where she takes your breath away with the depth of her dramatic abilities.Schumer also deserves credit for sharing the laughs with her co-stars. There are some outstanding supporting performances, most notably from Tilda Swinton (who you will absolutely not recognize) as Amy's manic and narcissistic magazine editor boss, and from the WWE's John Cena, who turns in arguably the best supporting performance in a comedy this year as Amy's muscle-headed and clueless boyfriend. His dirty sex talk scene with Schumer is worth the ticket price alone. LeBron James does a surprisingly good LeBron James, who's just looking out for the best interests of his buddy Hader. And finally, there's a beautifully tender scene between Schumer and 13-year old Evan Brinkman. This kid's got talent.The movie's ending is silly and stylized, but you won't care, because by the time it's all over, you're on Schumer's side and want her to win. You'll win, too, when you watch the movie.",Trainwreck

192,lwood28,A Film That Amy Schumer Fans Will Enjoy,7,19 July 2015,Trainwreck is a pretty good comedy film but it's not as great as everyone says it is. Some people believe it's the funniest film of all time and some think it's the best comedy of this decade so far but I would have to disagree with them. The film is funny but it's not gut busting laughing. The laughs are more of a chuckle. The acting is great everyone played their part very well. Amy Schumer wrote this film and I think she did a great job for writing this film. The chemistry between her and Bill Hader is great. Also this is probably Judd Apatow's best film since 40 Year Old Virgin. The film is more of a chick flick but there are some chick flicks that I thought were funnier than this film like Bridesmaids. Also this could be a great date film for couples. I do find this film way over-hyped and probably one of the most overrated films so far this year. Overall if your a fan of Amy Schumer or Judd Apatow then you'll enjoy this film.,Trainwreck
193,Markyajv,"WOW! This was brilliant,",10,23 July 2015,"TRAINWRECK! I am rating 10/10. Brilliant!! Amy Schumer​ is a genius. Not only was this one of the funniest movies I have seen in years it was so well written and acted. The casting was incredible, John Cena was unbelievably funny. Lebron James!! can act! Usually sport's stars in movies are a wash ( Remember Brett Favre in Something About Mary? UGH!) The humor was not ""Poop"" humor. It was well thought out funny to a ""T"" BUT it also was sentimental and heartbreaking at the same time. Which is not an easy feat to pull off MAYBE SPOILER - There is a point in which Amy's character just loses it and breaks down in realization that her lifestyle, her judgment's, her complete fear of a loving relationship, is only hiding deeper feelings, fears, and troubles. It was so completely relate-able because I am that kind of person) So many people in it was like a surprise around every corner. They did A great job casting Amy (It wasn't supposed to be her I would like to know who they were considering if anyone else at all. I believe Judd Apatow said it was always Amy after reading the script. Amy say's she was not even thinking she would be playing the role, she just wrote it) and John Heder was really good too. A comedian very well known from SNL playing the completely ""Good head on his shoulder's"" guy doesn't always pan out. 1 actress in the movie we could not figure out and the credits rolled and my jaw dropped 'cause I was like ""No way that was her!"" A+++ (I laughed so hard at the ending I cried and gave myself a headache) My 75 yr old Mother was with me and she absolutely loved it, she was laughing as hard as I was.

Good direction and cinematography and supporting characters who do not fall into the dumb or dumber category are a plus. An unrecognizable Tilda Swinton steals every scene she's in and a group of well-chosen actors who can be funny without being frantic place this film above the trash that passes for contemporary film comedy i.e. virtually anything starring Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Ben Stiller, Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson, Cameron Diaz, Kevin Hart, Will Ferrell, Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn, Kate Hudson, Ashton Kutcher, Zac Efron...

197,erikstuborn,"Don't believe all that negative reviews, it's a funny movie",8,29 April 2016,"I think that we should ignore all those negative reviews to the film because, curiously, there is a pattern common to all these devastating criticism, which can be summarized in the following 3 points: 1 - I'm a big fan of Amy and love her TV show, but this is the worst thing that she has made. 2 - the movie is not funny and jokes are bad. 3 - And probably all the fault is of Apatow (that has also done its worst movie). I spent twenty minutes reading most of the negative reviews and all of them, at least 90% agree on these three points. Such a coincidence, on the basis that I am a suspicious person, makes me think of a malign campaign orchestrated by a group of spectators (probably with conservative profile) who do not want to be produce again a product like this or more specifically Amy Schumer's one. We already know that a low score on IMDb means low profits at the box office, just like for a restaurant a bad score in TripAdvisor... that's the new tyranny of the Internet, which allows only a few very bad votes from malicious people can unbalancing, without much effort, the score of a project that requires a major effort, as is making a film (or open a restaurant). To talk about my experience with this film I will say first that I did not know Amy because in Europe do not have access to their TV shows. Also I'm not habitual viewer of Rom-com because they are usually too predictable and that bored me. However, I started to see this movie, most for curiosity, without heeding the negative reviews, to see for myself how bad it was and I took one of the biggest surprises of recent times: It is a very funny movie that get me out the first laugh of the year (and we're in April!) as few films get done. The script is witty and sharp but the jokes are thick, and many of them racy, but this is not a movie for kids, not for teens who laugh alone with someone saying ass... is a film for people adult who is aware and knows how clumsy we are when something does not go well for us. It's true that in «Trainwreck» several characters are not politically correct, starting with the protagonist, although it has a good job, is a casual drunk, very promiscuous, a pot's smoker which ridicules sports and athletes, and is friend of the tramp who lives on the corner of her street, that when sees Amy arriving in the morning with a hangover and still dressed in evening, asked her how was the Mass today... However, the actors are wonderfully directed and I would say that they do them work with unusual conviction. A highlight among them an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, splendid, playing a character that borders on Dadaism. And finally, the end (even been completely predictable), is absolutely wonderful and funny —up to the level of a good scene of «Bridget Jones» (a comedy which «Trainwreck» shares quite a few things)— plenty of emotion, very well combined with humor, worthy of being directed by Spielberg. You cannot ask for more! OK, it is not a film that will go down in history or will win Cannes Film Festival but gets exactly what it was conceived: Entertaining and make an adult audience laugh. So, for me is an 8/10 and I always recommend it to my (adults) friends.",Trainwreck

Moving to the present day, the movie follows Amy's complicated relationship with her father, her sister, her co- workers, and men. Lots of men.Not for the faint-hearted or for children, and probably not a good first-date movie, it's well worth seeing now.

Amy Schumer and Bill Harder are really talented. Not only does it have great laughs, but it has an in depth storyline about finding the one you want to be with for the rest of your laugh. This film is one that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel would've probably given a thumbs down to. But it doesn't matter, because at the end of the day it is us who have the ultimate say, not the newspaper critics that claim to be. All in all this film has really talented actors and is one that will keep you laughing and wanting another movie by Amy Schumer. You won't want to turn it off until the end credits roll.

204,Challenger2013,"Very Funny, but not Great",8,14 August 2015,"Nowadays, most romantic comedies miss the mark on characterization and plot. Judd Apatow's most recent product hits big on the characterization and almost nails the plot. The film follows Amy (played by Amy Schumer), a woman who has a great job, a nice apartment, and a fine love life in her eyes. This life consists of sleeping with a number of men while never fully committing to any of them specifically. She follows this system very strictly, stemming from her parents divorce when she was a child. Things change when she meets Aaron (Bill Hader), an unattractive sports doctor who she falls for rather quickly. Schumer, who also wrote the film, is quirky and laugh-out-loud funny. It's easy to see she had fun with the role and that a large part of her is injected into the character. If there is anybody who deserves an Oscar nom for a comedy this year, it's going to be her. Her character is so well developed and immediately likable that it quickly becomes easy to love her and her flaws. She is a trainwreck, but that's what makes her so great. This is where the biggest problem arises. I loved Schumer in trainwreck-mode, and that's what the first two acts consist of. However, when the end comes, it's as if the film tells us that it is not acceptable to live the life of a ""trainwreck."" Instead, we should all strive for the conventional, happy, normal romantic comedy endings, right? This is what happens in the third act, unfortunately. After a dynamite, near-perfect beginning, the film fizzles in the end. ""Trainwreck"" has quite a bit going for it and does most things right. Bill Hader hits one out of the park in another good showing of great characterization, giving us a leading man that is not the extremely muscular, overly attractive character we're used to seeing. John Cena fills that void hilariously in a nice supporting role. Even LeBron James handles his own very nicely in the film. This extremely raunchy, yet strangely delightful comedy packs a punch when it comes to the laughs, but isn't necessarily the breakout comedy we've been waiting for.",Trainwreck

If you found this movie offensively sexist, but every other rom-com is OK to you, then it wasn't the film thats bigoted.Acting was middlin' to bad; you expect that when ypou drag athletes into film. But even the regular actors weren't too good. Plot was a re-hash of the same old rom-com garbage. A comedy needs timing, and this one didn't have it; too rushed most of the time, some was just too juvenile. I get that the director like ""raunchy"", but it was getting down-right pervy with how long some of the garbage dragged on. And creepy-pervy, not funny-pervy. But then, the director IS Apatow. If you liked ""40 year old virgin"" you'll probably love this excrement as well.As for laughs, the 18 and under seemed to find it non-stop hilarious.

208,MikeM1984,"Far too long, and far too good for it's plot.",6,1 August 2015,"Judd Apatow has been putting out many films since he began his career. Heavyweights is great, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and 40-Year Old Virgin are his masterpieces, and Dewey Cox and Bridesmaids show his success mimicking the comedy of other films (Anchorman and Hangover). However as he's been making films for a while now a predictable formula has emerged, and his films seem like shells of their former selves.By all rights Trainwreck is a good film, perhaps too good to be made with such a cliché' ridden and formulaic plot. Every beat is telegraphed a mile away, and unfortunately the pacing is slow and the movie far too long to support such a wafer thin plot. The characters are all interesting, and complicated, but they are not given enough to do. The Lebron James friendship with Bill Hader's Aaron is the highlight of the film, yet his friendships with other famous athletes only paid lip service. I understand the film is aimed at women, but even Ted 2 and Entourage managed to have more celebrity cameos. Aaron's job is almost treated as non existent. And furthermore girls are at least somewhat sports literate. Especially in the age of immediate access internet.Many great characters are gone too quick (the boss, the intern), and many linger on too long (the sister is dull as a box of rocks. I'd have even preferred a cliché gay friend to her).Amy Schumer is quite good in this, but feels restrained. Almost as if she's doing the obligatory romantic comedy because she has to, not because she wants to. The film is rarely funny. She only gets to use the comedy that made her famous at rare moments in the film (""I like her""). Bridesmaids at least maintained a solid series of laughs. Judd Apatow's best films (Superbad, 40, Sarah Marshall) are all hilarious. This movie is good, but more like Funny People; a drama with the occasional punchline. More Devil's Wears Prada-esque. And where's the fun in that! I should be throwing up from laughter, not going ""heh heh - yeah, that Amy sure is funny"". It's almost sad she spends half the movie getting out shined by John Cena's closeted homosexuality and Lebron's awkwardness. It's almost as if Amy took the funniest material and wrote it for literally everyone else in the cast, and then cobbled together what little funny was left for herself.I have high hopes for Amy as an actress, but to me this is more of a Judd Apatow-tries- to-convince-everyone- how-deep- and-serious- he's-become-movie than a true showcase of Amy Schumer's talent and comedy.",Trainwreck

Which is ironic since it starts out interesting, but it falls victim to its own desire to ""stand out"" with a crude, borderline unlikable main character, who eventually gives in and tries monogamy. What a twist.Amy's character spends the entire movie whining about monogamy, sleeping around, so i really never felt any connection to her character, plus the jokes fell flat most of the time. I get it, its the 21st century, women can make crude jokes. The difference is Bridesmaids embraced its crudeness and knew what it was. Here, it tries to be ""mature"" in its first half, but then completely gives in to the chick flick syndrome.The love interest was underdeveloped, and its one of those cases where he likes her just because the script says so. Oh and John Cena was funnier than her. I'm not even joking. The resolution the characters have is unbelievable, and their chemistry wasn't that good. Which is a shame since i really liked Apatows work but this is by far his weakest for me. Funny People had darker characters that actually had good acting, character development, and blacker humor that worked for the story. Its also far more realistic and doesn't have a neat fairytale ending like this. The biggest offender for me, is that Trainwreck just isn't that funny.

214,lmitrani,Delightfully entertaining NYC romantic comedy with realistic characters we can identify with.,8,28 October 2015,"Trainwreck Despite an unlikely romance at the center of the movie, Trainwreck is a hugely entertaining blend of comedy and family relationships.Imagine a highly successful, handsome 40-year old sports doctor treating the world's top athletes who is not only unmarried, but without a girlfriend. Now imagine a contemporary magazine writer who takes drugs, drinks excessively, sleeps around with lots of guys, is out of shape, average-looking at best, and displays embarrassing behavior at social events by speaking and dressing inappropriately. Got it? Does this sound like a match made in heaven? Apparently the makers of Trainwreck consider them an irresistible couple to be dating. While I disagreed,I still found this film delightful for many other reasons.There are multiple relationships that work exceedingly well between an ensemble cast of appealing characters. Amy's other interactions are far more realistic: with her empathetic sister Kim (my favorite for her looks and character), her outspoken dad, her hard-driving office boss, her millennial co-workers, the talkative homeless man (comedian Dave Attell), and even her ""one-night stand"" guys. Filmed in NYC, Trainwreck captures iconic landmarks like Central Park, the Village, Madison Square Garden and the skyline. Cameo appearances by LeBron James, Amar'e Stoudemaire, Marv Albert, Chris Evert and the New York Knicks cheerleaders provide ""eye-candy"" and celebrity watching. Poignant and funny moments are smoothly intertwined.Amy confronts issues like job pressure, office politics, sibling rivalry, parental abandonment, romantic breakups, cellphone etiquette and unconventional attitudes about commitment perhaps reflective of her real-life demons. The movie challenges us to confront life issues like nursing home care and its cost, starting a family, monogamy and work/life balance. Has Trainwreck left out anything of importance?The film ends with Amy (Ms. Schumer uses her real first name for her character) and Bill Hader resolving their relationship in a way that may surprise you.",Trainwreck
215,MediaPanther,Funniest Film Of The Year,8,17 July 2015,"Comedian Amy Schumer's debut as a filmmaker is a very good one. If you've seen her TV show Inside Amy Schumer, you know Schumer's already here. As the screenwriter of Trainwreck she infuses her characters with not only humor, but with pathos and depth. Combined with some gems performances by the ensemble of lesser known names and media and sports icons, the film comes close to knocking it out of the park.Amy (Schumer) is on track to move up the ranks of the magazine where she works. The mag is maybe a mix of Cosmopolitan, Maxim, and Paper, with story topics like ""The Best Hockey Porn to Masturbate To"". Amy is assigned by her boss Dianna (the ever amazing Tilda Swinton) to interview the leading sports orthopedic surgeon in the country (Bill Hader). Since she hates sports, Dianna figures Amy would be the perfect fit to write something edgy, smirky,etc. Over the span of a couple weeks, Amy gets to know Dr. Aaron (Hader), who comes off as a sweet, almost naive guy. This is in direct contrast to the many guys she's met and slept with, not to mention herself.It's the inner workings of the character Amy that make Trainwreck stand out. Schumer created a female persona that is multi-layered. She's funny, smart, outgoing, but also a bit dark, bitter and fatalistic. This is shown throughout the film in the way she treats the men she dates and sleeps with. Although Hader is the leading man in the film, the funniest and maybe best interactions are when Amy is opposite WWE superstar Jon Cena. It's clear who is the dominant one in their relationship, especially when he tells her the plans he has for the two of them. His are by far the most cringeworthy/gut busting scenes in Trainwreck. Schumer's chemistry with her on screen sister Kim (Brie Larson) and dad (Colin Quinn) are equally excellent. Kim is the one who settled down and still blames pops for their parents divorce, while Amy sides more with dad. This is all due from the opening scene where dad explains to them as little girls what the situation was. It's also the setup to how Amy turned out the way she is. As their loving yet philandering dad, Quinn is great and gets off some excellent one liners, but his opening speech is what sets the tone for the entire film.Trainwreck is not just Schumer, although it is her film and she shines throughout. She is helped along the way by many folks who turned in performances that will have you pleasantly shaking your head. Along with the hilarious performance of Cena, newcomer Lebron James shows his acting chops as Dr. Aaron's buddy. As his good friend and confidant, James even organizes an intervention to help Aaron get his head together. Vanessa Bayer, Dave Attell , and Ezra Miller also are given great material to work with and they run with it. Miller's scene with Schumer is just another example of what you won't expect coming in Trainwreck.Trainwreck is one of the best films of the year and yet should have been about 20 minutes shorter, as the ending dragged a bit. With that said, it could have been called Blindsided. Since it's a romantic comedy, you might know how it's going to end, but you will not see it coming. The title doesn't matter, but Schumer most definitely does.See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/trainwreck/#sthash.vqJf7G9T.dpuf",Trainwreck
216,mcgregorrowland,An extremely funny comedy with a good message,8,20 July 2015,"At first I did not want to see this movie at all. When I first saw the trailer I thought Amy Schumer was just not funny and that she was trying to be famous. But after I kept watching more and more of her she actually was funny. And then my friend invited me to see the movie so I gave it a chance. When I walked out of the theater I realized I was so wrong about Schumer and that she is actually hilarious.This movie made you laugh out loud and some of the jokes and lines were just hysterical. Almost every scene had a part that would make you laugh. Schumer's writing was great and I hope she writes more films in the future.Like I said the message was also very good in this movie. You felt good for the characters when the movie was over and when the credits came on the screen, you had a smile on your face.The acting was great. Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Colin Quinn, John Cena, Vanessa Bayer, Ezra Miller, Mike Birbiglia, and LeBron James were all hilarious.If you love some good, raunchy, laugh out loud comedy that has a good message to go along with it then I highly recommend this film.",Trainwreck
217,krirks,"OK plot, Some smile happened, Bad casting, Leading actress in particular.",3,16 May 2017,"The story revolved around a messed up girl who gets drunk, high and have sex a lot with different guys which would have been much more suitable if it was a hot actress instead of Spamela Hamderson. But since it's not, it kinda felt wrong for the whole movie. Even the sister, who is supposed to be a much more conservative person, looks hotter. No wonder Hamderson wrote the story herself just to fulfill her dream as a hot bangable girl. Not sure if her performance was so good or it was real her, because she was so annoying all the time. Not a single laugh I had, a few smiles at best. 3 stars I gave go for Bill Hader, John Cena and LeBron James who actually put a smile on my face.",Trainwreck
218,pcernea-1,With a name like Trainwreck...,3,10 August 2015,"Unfunny. The main characters have zero charisma (at least I didn't think so, but I am sure many will agree). There's no chemistry between them. I just wish I hadn't paid money for this in the theater.I can see this film is trying something revolutionary: combine a romantic comedy or Sex-in-the- City-type movie with the gross-out humor you find in a movie like 40-Year-Old Virgin that might be more geared towards guys. But it doesn't work for several reasons, and I think time will ultimately testify to that as the rating declines.Movies like Dumb and Dumber and Forty-Year-Old Virgin which have stood the test of time aren't just a series of gross one liners with no rhyme or reason. There's a comic timing, and consistency in the characters and their motivation. And although Lloyd and Andy are losers, they're likable.For example. In Dumb and Dumber, when Lloyd does the fart jokes at the party in the fantasy, it's spontaneous, and it's funny because he _thinks_ he's being witty. In 40-YOV when Andy makes up his fake sex story, it's expected, but he's pushed into the situation, so it's funny. In this movie, when Amy tells the story about the cervix condom, there's no reason she needs to say it (other than for shock value), and it's totally predictable.Motivation: Why are all these guys so eager to settle down with Amy? Not explained. If that's a pattern, why is Amy afraid that Aaron won't want to settle down with her? In fact, why does she like him more than the others or at all? There's no real consistency, no solid characterization. Even Amy's character is inconsistent: she is unlikeable and often does mean things, but she is not mean-spirited.It's hard to convey what's not compelling about this movie without actually showing it, because there's much that is forgettable, so I don't remember everything. Here's an example of where an opportunity was missed to show rather than tell. Amy talks about different levels of menstrual blood being left in the toilet. This may be gross, yet it's not compelling: it's not shown, nor is it situational--it's only recounted incidentally. (Maybe it's too gross to show?) Wouldn't it be better and funnier if she was having her period when Aaron was coming over and that created some conflict? Even good standup is not a litany of different things that are gross; instead gross situations come up naturally.On the other hand, when LeBron's blood spurts on Aaron, it is indeed shown, and it's repulsive. But it doesn't really lead to any consequences. Does Aaron react to it with disgust? Does Aaron get fired for botching the medical procedure? It's unnecessary. Overall the character of Aaron is wooden and doesn't react with gusto to anything that happens.Another inconsistency: how does the article at the end get published if Amy already got fired?Bottom line: Not laugh-out-loud funny. I only got a few chuckles and those were far between. I paid money for it in the theater because I knew it would be gross and that Apatow was involved, but I wish I had skipped this one and seen something like Pineapple Express when it came out. I'm glad this movie made money, though, because hopefully the next Apatow comedy can be better.",Trainwreck

And in the morning I asked myself ""keep it for another night or return it to Red Box"" and I answered ""return it, return it."" So I didn't watch the whole movie. I may never know. I do know it's bad. Really bad and I liked Amy Schumer. Not enough to watch this mess but I liked Amy Schumer. I expected ""Amy behaving badly"" but I imagined she might be funny. Nope.

221,jim_flowers,Is Amy Shumer supposed to be funny?,3,30 July 2015,"Is Amy Schumer supposed to be funny? She IS sophomoric, juvenile, vulgar, and crass. Seems Schumer's character, ""Amy"", was only interested in the number of anonymous guys she could bed and how many times she could say the F word. At times it tried to be a romantic comedy other times it was just about how raw it could be and wandered aimlessly.Schumer wrote this literal ""Trainwreck"", which was most appropriately named! My wife told me to quit looking at my watch, but all I could think about was the end of the movie and where I could eat afterwards. Maybe it would have been more palatable if I wasn't so hungry, even a large popcorn couldn't help! Bill Hader was the sole light in this very dark tunnel. LeBron needs some acting lessons, he was really stiff, as well as all of the other sports ""cameos"". Colin Quinn was OK, but he's never been one of my favorites. Vanessa Bayer played the good stooge, their male counterparts at S'nuff were just filler and added little. Swinton's character was just a cliché.And John Cena, what the H, he and Schumer's sex scene seemed to just be there for the ""R"" rating, as if this would save this Trainwreck! I mean, a thing the size of a p-nut because of roids, really, would the slut Amy have put up with that? All around, a huge disappointment and waste of time.",Trainwreck

Honestly i was surprised, especially as i was not fully aware of Amy Schumers ability, especially as an actress. I think we have all seen Bill Hader in something comical in the past decade and i would say normally he sticks to his usual comedian sidekick role. However in this role i have see a different side to Hader with the help of schumer and somehow both pulled off this romantic comedy, with an edgy spin on it.In some cases the jokes are crude and obvious and knowing this as a romcom/chick flick I was waiting for the 'Trainwreck' fall in love the whole time. This then made the film close to an awful Adam Sandler movie for me at times, especially with the use of various famous sports and wrestling stars and again obvious jokes.Don't be put off by this though, i really enjoyed this movie and will now go out to find Amy Schumer's other performances, as she really found something different in her complex character, which i am sure she uses continuously in her stand-up performances.",Trainwreck

I found Amy Schumer's character pretty vulgar and crude...and not in a funny way. The first eight minutes of listening to her, really made me want to turn the movie off and it takes a lot for me to feel that way, kind of like nails down a chalkboard. She also portrays her character very superficially, which normally does not bother me too much, however when it's coupled with unnecessary cursing every 2 minutes, along with a vulgar tongue...it doesn't come across well. Vulgar is not funny, especially in women! It's trying too hard to try and be funny. Tilda Swinton's character was even worse, she was obnoxious and also vulgar, two very difficult qualities that make it hard to watch.I did not laugh once (and I laugh at most comedies) and did not enjoy any part of it!!",Trainwreck
225,yougottrumpedshow,A Trainwreck Indeed,1,21 February 2018,"Trainwreck is an absolute train wreck. I don't know why anyone in the world finds Amy Schumer entertaining on any level. Her stand up was awful, her sketch show did have some funny moments but overall was not worth watching. Later it turned out a lot of her stuff was apparently lifted which makes it even more strange that it was not funny at all.Anyway I went into this movie expecting it to be not very good, and even then I was disappointed. Bill Hader was good and a lot of the other bit players were too but Amy Schumer was terrible and a few of the supporting characters were bad too. Judd Apatow can usually do no wrong for me, either great stuff or at least watchable and enjoyable, but this movie is just awful. Terrible movie, terrible script.It's not that the movie is dirty or anything, I am 100% fine with that. Dirty funny is fine, but this movie is dirty with nothing funny, and a terrible actress playing a completely unlikable character.",Trainwreck
226,cblazo,"Funny at moments, but not that great.",4,24 December 2015,"This movie is OK at best. The acting is mediocre with Bill Hader and Brie Larson as the sister doing a good job. The father played by Colin Quinn was a great character. He was who he was and stayed true. I like that! The opening scene was great. It seemed that Amy Schumer was trying way too hard to flip the script (so to say) on men being players and having no couth. Instead of the man it was her who was loose and crass and didn't care about her random partners. I just can't stand forced, gender role reversal in platforms like films. It seems disingenuous and it's becoming trite. Amy also seems to force the acceptance of plus sized women down the viewer's throat. Just watch the cheerleader scenes. The ending of the film is extremely predictable and it's been done way too much. I thought LeBron James did alright with his maiden voyage into film. He seemed a bit stiff and mechanical, but overall, a good job. All in all. Trainwreck is a fine movie to see for free or at a minimum price. There are some very funny areas, but there are some doldrums that seem to override the good spots. The movie's length is a tad too long at just over two hours. With the movie dying in the middle and the ending over done. The funny parts don't bring it above the crest of mediocrity.",Trainwreck

It is very raunchy so if you don't like that type of humor don't go see this. But if you're a Judd Apatow fan then you'll like this. Although a little over the top at times (without giving away too much, the canceled surgery scene comes to mind), I thought the chemistry between Schumer and Hader was great. Very believable and relatable to anyone that's been in a long term relationship. A lot of people didn't like it but I found the end cheer leading scene to be really funny and sweet.

It's so awful I struggled to even give it a 1, as it's the first movie I've seen in quite a while to warrant assigning a negative value on the 1 to 10 scale. So, what's wrong with it? Well, it's lame, crass, vulgar, disjointed, confusing, awkward and in general, founders on several fronts while trying to tell what seemed at the outset like a genuinely, funny story.I was impressed with the acting chops of Lebron James and how he interacted with Bill Hader, a couple of memorable scenes really show what James is capable of. The chemistry between Hader and James was spot on. As for Schumer, well, let's just say we get it. She's an angry, liberal female who's out to call everyone and everything on that very point and doesn't really care whether or not that attitude gets in the way of telling a decent story. Save for the last scene where she attempts redemption with her surgeon beau Aaron, the rest of the movie is a series of train wrecks that the audience cringes at. There was so many better ways of telling her story, Apatow was really asleep at the wheel here. Very disappointing.... her brand of humour needs some refinement before the rest of us get what she's selling as her brand of comedy and it just wasn't that funny.",Trainwreck
232,natrc2003,Wrong Vehicle for a Great Comedian,5,27 November 2015,"I consider Amy Schumer's Comedy Central show one of the best comedy programs in recent times. Love her wit, her sense of humor about herself, and love the way she pushes people to reconsider the position of women in society. She does what comedians are supposed to do: challenge us by holding up a mirror to us -- and the best comedians, like Schumer, use themselves as the mirror.All that said, it's unfortunate this Trainwreck is the vehicle she chose in her move to the big screen. The movie just feels... listless. There's an overall sadness hanging over it, as if none of the participants are really happy to be there, or even to be with each other. Which is so opposite the feeling one gets from watching Schumer's show, it's surprising.Perhaps it's the choice of vehicle -- the romantic comedy format just feels off. Sure, they're trying to turn the format on its head a bit, and I appreciate that they're using ""normal"" looking people instead of the Barbie/Ken configuration most of this type of movie goes for (I actually enjoy rom-coms from time to time) but neither Schumer nor Hader are capable of pulling off the necessary ""irresistible attraction"" the genre requires. There's simply no real chemistry between the two. Hader especially seems asleep the entire time.I do really enjoy the Lebron James character (I'm not a sports fan, but I appreciate the joke).Long story short: I got bored halfway through the movie and turned it off. I tried it again the next day, made another 20 minutes, but turned it off again. I almost tried watching some more yesterday, but the thought of it was so dreary, I didn't bother.The ONLY reason I'm giving the movie 5 stars is because of the goodwill I feel toward Amy Schumer.",Trainwreck
233,peggyatthemovies,"""TRAINWRECK"" - Comedy GOLD",8,16 July 2015,"And your comedy-date movie for the summer is(drum roll please) ""Trainwreck""!!Written by and starring this year's comedic 'it-girl' Amy Schumer as ""Amy"" it chronicles the misadventures of its leading character as she runs through boyfriends, numerous sexual encounters acting all the while as a chronically commitment-challenged career woman, is some serious comedic gold. When her boss ""Dianna"" (an unrecognizable and hilarious Tilda Swinton) assigns her a story to feature a young sports surgeon ""Aaron"" (Bill Hader) something happens to Amy she didn't know was possibleshe falls in love.The film romantic-comedy side solely rests on the perfectly imperfect character of Amy who I think we can all relate to – as either being it at some point in our own lives or in someone we know. I mean let's be truthful here  who of us ladies hasn't walked into a room inappropriately dressed or sat at a baby shower giving a big eye-roll at the ""my life is perfect"" banalities and so wanting to shut it down. Amy is that girl, the friend we love to have around because she isn't afraid to do or say what we wish we had the guts to do or saythough she pretty much goes overboard every time and that goes double here and yes, that's why we love her.Schumer is a force here, knocking every gag out of the park but also displaying some quite impressive dramatic skills that one doesn't expect from a stand-up comedian. Bill Hader is finally given and masters the lead role he deserves perfectly. He is lovable, relatable in every way and is the perfect match for Amy on the big screen. Their chemistry here is undeniable.The supporting cast of the film is absolutely solid. Brie Larson is wonderful as ""Kim"" – Amy's sister, Colin Quinn is ""Gordon"" Amy & Kim's dad, Mike Birbiglia is ""Tom"" Kim's husband, and the little scene- stealer child Evan Brinkman as ""Allister"" rounds off the family. Vanessa Bayer's ""Nikki"" is Amy's co-worker and just as on SNL, she holds her own here. But perhaps the biggest surprise of the film is are the 2 big name athletes of the film in LeBron James playing himself and John Cena as ""Steven"" one of Amy's flings that you just can't help but love while grabbing a scene your eyes won't soon forget. And while I don't know or follow basketball much (just like Amy in the film I might add) I do know who LeBron is and as it turns out the basketball superstar's comedic timing is might just be as good as his game. The plethora of SNL cast, athlete and musician cameos were a welcome bonus to the movie. By now we know that with a Judd Apatow films you'll get a nice blend of raunchy humor and heart. It is a tried and true formula – and it works again here but with something different and that's Amy Schumer. Sure there might be a few uneven moments..but the duo here help create one of the funniest romantic comedies I have seen in a long time with one of the most fun finale scenes I've had the pleasure of seeing all year long. Most of all – I think we can all say a big HELLO to Amy Schumer – 'Moviestar' when this hits theaters..This film is fantastically fun, full of laughs, new one-liners for you to memorize and a sweet story to prove that yes, my friends, there is someone for everyone in this world.Grade: B @pegsatthemovies check out all my reviews at peggyatthemovies.com",Trainwreck

Just watch Amy Schumers stuff on comedy central",3,20 July 2015,"This review may be a little bias as I am not a huge Amy Schumer fan to begin with, but it was more than just her that absolutely killed this movie for me. There were parts where I found myself giving a little chuckle, but for the most part you could easily save your money and catch more than half of these jokes on one of Amy's stand ups, or her show on Comedy central. I am actually certain there are at least 3 or 4 scenes that came straight from ""Inside Amy Schumer"". I thought Bill Hader was going to save it for me, but at the end of the move I almost disliked him more than Amy. John Cenas cameo was pretty painful, and Lebron James proved that he should pretty much just stick to basketball. You had your scattered SNL cast from old and new scattered through out and some known comedians that gave me a smile, but again this did not help. At one point I actually ended up falling asleep because the movie just became so dragged out and boring to me. Maybe its just me being of the male gender and really unable to relate to a majority of Amy's jokes, although I am pretty sure my girlfriend disliked it just as much as me by the tome the movie ended. To make a long story short and to not give away any spoilers, I would either wait for this to come out on DVD, or I would just binge watch a season of ""Inside Amy Schumer"" and that will pretty much give you the gist of this film.",Trainwreck

It's a modern day romantic comedy full of laughs, new one- liners for you to memorize and a sweet story to prove that yes, my friends, there is someone for everyone in this world. You do you... be your own weird self and find that special someone that loves your flavor of strange.I had high expectations for Amy Schumer's first screenplay and role as a leading actress. Her TV show is outstanding. Her live stand up is one of the best around. And she had Judd Apatow by her side ... how can it go wrong? It is what it is -- if you like Schumer and/or Apatow movies you'll like Trainwreck. If you find her comedy a bit offensive or don't think Knocked Up is hilarious, just pass. It's okay... this just isn't for you. I love the twist Schumer takes on the ""romantic comedy"" genre. At the heart of the film is complete chick flick glory ... yes, I teared up at the end! But this journey rests on a perfectly imperfect character who I think we can all relate to a bit more than Harry's Sally or Prostitute-turned-Princess Vivian. Ladies ... who of us hasn't walked into a room inappropriately dressed or sat at a baby shower looking for an opportunity to disrupt a ""my life is perfect"" dissertation. Amy, in both her comedy career and as ""Amy"" in Trainwreck, is that friend we love to have around because she isn't afraid to do or say what we wish we had the guts to do or say ... though she pretty much goes overboard every time. That's why we love her.Bill Hader was the perfect match for Amy on the big screen. They had sweet chemistry that leaves me to believe they had a blast making this movie. You leave the theater hoping they are dating in real life -- a true sign of casting done well! The SNL and athlete cameos were a welcome bonus to the movie.Many thanks to Trainwreck for giving us great laughs for 125 minutes. Maybe it's not saving the world or breaking new ground in the film industry ... but at least it gives us a fresh new story with characters and situations that feel more like ""Home"" than ""Hollywood"" (minus, of course, being best friends with Lebron James ... we still need some magic in our movies).If you enjoyed this review please check out our blog at yourturntopick.com.",Trainwreck
236,CampoReviews,This movie is a Trainwreck so its not just a clever name.,5,4 September 2015,"First of all i don't understand any of the praise for this movie, the first 40% of this movie is hilarious but in no way due to lead actor Amy Schumer who is only funny about 5% of the time in this entire movie. what will i praise? the Hilarious performances by the always funny Bill Hader, Colin Quinn and the two comedy new comers Lebron James and John Cena who had me rolling, but i digress the fact that the supporting cast out shined the main star is what makes this movie fall short for me. Amy Schumer in no way comes off believable as the man eater she plays, not to sound sexist or be a dick but i don't find her attractive almost at all. I just cant see all these guys being desperate enough to night after night hook up with this woman (especially when they look like John Cena that guy could have any girl he wanted). And the way she was dressed in this movie the whole time i was god damn i don't wanna see that, and im not trying to pick on her its the honest truth. I do find her funny on her show and i feel she would be good in a small supporting role but shes the worst part of her own movie. i feel like she just took the typical rom-com formula and switched out the slutty sleeping around party guy who cant settle down and made it a girl. And does anyone else feel like every single movie Judd Apatow Has some say in turns out to be the closest possible thing in style and formula to Knocked Up, he needs to stop trying to re-live his success and make something new and original i get that its what he might be good at but you gotta step outta your shell once and a while. I mean even 40 Year Old Virgin Which i know came out before Knocked Up has the same similar formula about two completely different people who come together and beat there differences to find love one of which who is usually a looser more fun outgoing person and one who is more uptight and strange, who at some point become separated by a fight and then miraculously love conquers all as usual. And also in perfect Apatow fashion the movie is way to long and boring and suffers from terrible pacing with front heavy comedy and back heavy romance. If this movie ended at the 47 minute mark and starred Bill Hader as the front man i would have rated it a 7 easily, but i just cant do it, the fact that the star isn't the star and doesn't come off believably takes away, and the fact that sometimes the jokes went to far for me and felt forced, and also the over use of stereotypical rom-com stuff that was just a small twist on the same old stuff we see every year i rate this movie 5.5 / 10 its watchable and sometimes funny but i promise you there is no way to watch this movie without ending up just playing on your phone and not caring by the end.",Trainwreck
237,nadiasylvia,"Unrealistic, toxic, and boring storyline",2,25 February 2020,"There's very little depth (or humour) to this film unfortunately. Having seen a Netflix standup special from Amy I was very excited going into it. But I really struggled to keep my eyes open. Most of the jokes were just so bait and cringe. there were one or two that actually gave me a good chuckle but overall the comedy (and love story) was disappointing.I also reallyyy take offence to the movies only consistent message which was that the guy shouldn't give up on this girl who was clearly a total dysfunctional wreck and shared ZERO of his values and interests, like why? I'd of rather it ended with them both being single and seeking therapy because literally why suffer.",Trainwreck
238,mad_mike1211,"Boring for the most part, extremely slow for the rest.",4,8 April 2016,"I don't know where to start with this... Can't believe how much of a let down this movie was for me. The trailer gave away 95% of the funny parts to this movie, I was extremely hyped to watch it. I'm not one to dislike many films, I can see enjoyment in any film and it's enough to make it a good film in my eyes. But Trainwreck was nothing but a trainwreck of a film.The only reason I gave this 4stars instead of 1 star was literally because of John Cena. Every single moment he was in a scene, I was laughing from start to finish. The movie theatre scene had me and my mates laughing for ages. After that scene though, it slowly got worse and worse until we were bored out of our skulls.So my verdict is, don't rush to watch this, but give it a go sometime for the scenes with John Cena, because he was the only great part about an otherwise boring movie.",Trainwreck
239,matdog321,Amazingly impressive and never goes dull.,9,18 July 2015,"Heres my problem with Bridesmaids,This is 40, The Five Year Engagement or any other comedy along the lines of those. They run about for 2 hours, and almost drains me. Trainwreck, is not the case. It follows Amy (Schumer), a magazine writer who is assigned an interview for a sports doctor(Hader). As soon as the movie started, i was pretty much sold on the acting. I've seen about one Amy Schumer stand-up and i own an audio show from itunes. Shes not exactly under rated, but i just appeal to her humor more.Bill Hader on the other hand, was my personal favorite of SNL beside Kristin Wiig. He usually played goofy characters so i was pleasantly surprised at his character structure, kind of a serious but not-so-serious attitude which i thought blended well against Amy's personality, who literally seems to make a joke about everything. Now I've never seen her show, so leaving the theater i was shocked at how well she portrayed her role. Well given the fact that her character is Amy, i expected the same sarcastic attitude she does in her comedy. I don't mind that, as a i said before I'm a fan of it. Which i think is a good approach for a breakout role, this was a personal role and she nailed it. It could almost be based on her entire life but i don't know that for sure. i wouldn't be surprised if it was. As for the romance, it just felt so real to me, rather than authentic. All thanks to Bill Hader, his dorky attitude and sense of humor really grew onto me. His whole friendship with Lebron James is side splitting. I also enjoyed John Cenas role, for what he was given he nailed the lines, years of WWE acting experience and he can still pull a punchline. ""You know what i do to *ssholes? i lick em'!"" There's plenty of one liners in this film that me and my friends were repeating as we walked out the theater. As i said before, 2 hour comedies really drag and wear me out but this did not. It has its drama in there, but it was solid. I almost didn't want it to end. Of course there were minor (minor) flaws. Such as the Matthew Broderick cameo along with the other people i didn't know in the intervention scene. But thats nit-picking. Watching Amy's character develop throughout was a pleaser in itself. I'd recommend this to anyone with a joy for smart-asses and romantic comedy.Also! The whole scene where the girls are telling stories at the bridal shower was a bit from her stand up that i watched, it was even more hilarious hearing it the second time.Edit: I went on other reviews to troll but i was surprised at how many people found her humor insane and sinful. One user pointed out that we should all see Paul Blart 2, just because Amy Schumer compliments her dead mothers Breasts and then makes fun of her. I gagged a little, if that isn't your sense of humor please don't recommend a PG comedy full of fart jokes and slapstick humor. From the trailer, you must read Sex comedy? Right?",Trainwreck
240,jryndon,Entertain via real life issues,6,4 August 2015,"that was interesting. A slut is the main characters. she mates with guys like a bitch on the street in heat. She had this view of life. She was brought up by an environment where there is a likely chance a kid could turn out like her. There is a lesson here. This is not just comedy. Sometimes the joke or dialogues seem unreal and I doubt some of them are even possible. In this cases, it was displayed for a comedic relief. I assume the dialogues and scenes are smudged to the culture of today's generation made funny.she had a lot of issues. Brought up by a narcissistic father can do that to you. But in all this things. somehow, someway, her sister wasn't able to be like her. And there is a reason to this. Life lessons can be discovered here. and the hilarity of this movie does not focus on the scripts but on the faint reality and dilemmas that today's generation deals with.The summary details that the slut founds a decent guy, normally for decent girls. Well what would happen? Can a guy be secure with her? There are a lot of things here that every girl in the wild should try to deal with. And in its own way, the movie tries to help them see it and what to do with it.It was funny. Though I kind of get the feeling that this movie is about the gals. To the meek and quiet and to the wild in heat. Through this movie, we are able to see the perspective of her kind. and on the outside, it seems all fun and games and in the reality of it.",Trainwreck

I had read about Amy Schumer being a funny comedian and I must admit that she had her moments in this film. She seemed real, raw and different, which is always welcomed, and this is why I sat throughout the entire film! Also, after learning the following: that this is a romantic film; the male actor chosen to play opposite seemed like your unconventional type guy, yet he made it work with Amy; and the guest stars like Lebron James and Amar'e Stoudemire. Overall, the movie is watchable due to the newness of the actors and semi-decent script and message. The acting seemed to epitomize the raw nature of humans.",Trainwreck

I think the film wants to be a rom com but just isn't. The film is written by Schumer and I thought its name was apt a ""trainwreck"" it is that bad. Throughout the entire film im thinking is it done yet? I feel for Bill Hader, he was the only reason this film didn't get a 1 out of 10, he was by far the stand out actor in the whole film and saved it from total failure in my eyes. Vanessa Bayer wasn't bad. Overall i'd give it a miss.",Trainwreck
243,faster-2,If you like Amy ...,7,5 August 2015,"Amy Schumer is a very likable, cute, funny, impressionable actress. She has written this film which is directed by the great Judd Apatow. Her scenes are replete with comedic undertones and most of the humor is brainy, personal and sweet. Her character - Amy - is at first the Trainwreck of the title. If you are not into seeing scenes of fully nude bodies, like wrestler Jon Cena making love to Amy, this is too gross and vulgar for you. BUT - it sets the film up to show an otherwise likable, successful girl who just wants to get it all in. Live the full NY experience. But a little too full. Amy works and has to come up with stories for a Men's magazine that is nothing but crude. Tilda Swinton is unrecognizable as she is wearing makeup and acts like Anna Wintour on steroids.Amy drinks, screws and pretty much is out of control, wanting no future entanglements with any man. This is all in contrast to her sister, who is ""normal"", married to a nerdy guy, but lovable, decent and happy to be a stepmother to her husband's son, who is a character in himself. Colin Quinn is great as her dad, and although he walked out on the family, both sisters seem to genuinely love him. SNL alum dominate this film, as well as LeBron James and Amare Stoudamire. Marv Albert shows up in a family intervention with Matthew Broderick. All silly, but funny and it fits the story. Bill Hader as the doctor suitor is wonderful and accepting of Amy's shtick. I wouldn't even think of dating her - the Trainwreck - so it must be love.Kudos to LeBron who can act as naturally as any actor I have seen. Well, he is acting as himself. Vanessa Bayer's teeth are a wonder in themselves and Tilda Swinton is hilarious in getting to shut her mouth.Although many actors are one dimensional, the lead stars have personalities, conflicts and are very human. The humor is natural, even though Amy relies on one liners. So what? The audience I saw it with seemed to enjoy the film immensely albeit the opening vulgarity. I believe Amy Schumer has a career going for her as a comedic actress. She certainly does not have to write the whole script as she does here, but she can lend her talents to other comedies.",Trainwreck

But it is hard to find.LeBron James has a small role as a basketball player named ""LeBron James""--how's that for creativity and originality? Fortunately he is spared from having to say the cuss words. He actually proves to be a very good actor. Unfortunately his part is too small.I don't believe it's any kind of spoiler to report that the ending is as sappy as it is predictable. Don't waste your time on this copulating pile of defecation.

Amy is assigned to write an article about sports even though she cares nothing about the subject. She meets a sports doctor who she strikes her first real monogamous relationship with. Despite all her excessive drinking and partying and his nice guy straight laced ways they spark a good start of a relationship. I was pleased to see Colin Quinn as an important character in this.

Being married and sharing the fun of picking movies my other half wanted to go see this. Boy, were we disappointed. It had a moment of chuckles in the beginning and then it fell flat on its face. I was so disappointed in this crapfest. Here are the issues that I had:It was extremely offensive to women. It was offensive. It promoted a very promiscuous and dangerous lifestyle. It pandered to the lowest common denominator of humor.I was disgusted with Ms. Schumer's performance. It was like she was playing herself or even better. What the lead character from Sex in the City would have been like if she had no class, style or discretion.If you have a choice go see something else or rent something else.

The movie seems to drone on and on making me bored out of my mind, and then again some agonizing time later, another exceptional bit of comedy. As this film seemed to drone on and on, with only a rare and brief spats of exceptional comedy, I finally had enough and turned the movie off. I just could not watch anymore, which is extremely rare for me. I can not state enough how boring this film is and the few brief times I laughed was not enough for me to keep watching. This film in my opinion is an absolute train wreck.",Trainwreck
248,ryan-bfd,A film flooded with celebrities to mask the amateur writing,5,7 January 2016,"Amy Schumer is a stand up comedy superstar that has recently gained a lot of serious leverage in the comedy writing world. For the last couple of years, she has been the lead writer on her hit show on Comedy Central, ""Inside Amy Schumer"". She has also reportedly been studying screen writing under the wing of the legendary comedy filmmaker Judd Apatow (""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Funny People"", ""This is 40"", ""Knocked Up""). Hence, Amy Schumer decided to come out with ""Trainwreck"". Amy is still a screen writing novice and she is venturing into new territory by making this film. That is why, thanks to the influence of Judd Apatow, this film is flooded with celebrity appearances. John Cena, Lebron James, Method Man, SNL cast member Leslie Jones, Chris Evert, Mathew Broderick, Tony Romo, and many more. Most of these big celebrities just show up in one scene and those who don't can't act for crap (Lebron James & John Cena). Daniel Radcliff plays a character inside of a movie inside within the actual movie. He is starring in a movie about being a dog walker, which actually seems more interesting than the actual movie I'm watching. I feel like most of Trainwreck's humor comes from 1) fourth wall jokes 2) recycled material that Amy uses in her stand up re-purposed for the screenplay and 3) sex jokes and shock humor. The appearances by all of these celebrities seemingly, was an attempt to mask Amy Schumer's weak script. All of the characters were these parodies but not in the sense of a funny exaggeration but more a cliché, rough sketch of various personality types. While all the characters in this movie seemed to be flimsy stereotypes or comedic tools, the one character that was probably written the best was herself. Which shows that at least she is following the core rule of writing in general: Write what you know. There are scenes were we get a very vulnerable Amy, a self-centered Amy, and a goofy and raunchy Amy. However, any emotional connection you are trying to establish other than laughter can just be left at the door of the theater because this movie solely operates on Amy's sense of humor, her observational comedy, and very stale take on relationships. There are some scenes where Amy does her own narration in an attempt to establish a Woodey Allen-Esq tone to her movie but it really does not connect with its intent, not even as a parody. However, she does showcase a lot of personality in this movie. I think it's because she plays just a fictionalized version of herself rather then come up with a completely new character with a new personality. She tried to be different in this movie by showcasing a new female narrative. In the typical romantic comedy you would have a guy who is a womanizer not looking for any emotional connection what-so- ever. Then one day he meets the perfect girl and he falls in love. He then has to struggle with his womanizing tendencies while the girl starts to change him into a better person. This movie is exactly that except with a woman. Amy is loose, she doesn't want any romantic connection, she just wants to party and sleep around. The thing is it doesn't become any less of a cliché just because you reverse the gender roles. We get it, women can be just as sexually aggressive as men, if not more. The thing is its 2015! Everyone knows. It's not breaking any new ground when she makes these statements and I don't think she is trying to. That's just who she is. That is the personality that she feeds to the media and she's benefiting off it immensely. So as a result we get the perverted and raunchy side of the female characters and some innocent well- intentioned men all throughout this film. Again, the gender roles have now switched. The females are chasing the males rather then what we see in the typical romantic comedy. However, it's still as stale as any Ryan Reynold's cheesy romantic bullshit that I've seen. The comic potential is not used to its full extent. The comedy genius, Dave Attell, is constricted to a few scenes as a comedic element rather than thrown into a more relevant role where he can put his own comedic spin on the dialog. However, the film does a pretty good job of utilizing the comedic potential of Colin Quin, former SNL member, who portrays a pretty convincing ""asshole"" father. I wish she would have more funny people in this movie like Bill Hader but for some reason she decided to cast people like Brie Larson, Tilda Swanson and Erza Miller. Serious actors who can't really give the same funny performances that Seth Rogan, Leslie Mann or Paul Rudd could have (these are Judd's go to actors). Overall, the movie set out what it intended to do which was boost Amy's career but it didn't do it in a very well-constructed or entertaining manner. This film is mildly amusing at best.",Trainwreck

How long is anyone going to continue to pay any money for this stuff. Please, tell Judd baby to do something productive with his life rather than this stuff.

It was realistic, relate-able, and, at times, touching. Definitely not a ""chick flick"" just because the lead is female. The men in the audience seemed to be having a great time. True, this film won't be for everyone, but it will be everything for those it is for. Amy Schumer's writing is on point. The real shock to me was Lebron James.

It tries to make a statement but it never seems to present a discernable plot.I thought it was better than I expected it to be for a first time release and for that bravo! Is it a good movie? I judge on 2 things:
Would I see the movie again? No, not intentionally but if my wife wanted to see it, I could sit next to her and surf on my phone.Would I recommend it? Not on a list I would recommend but Perhaps if you are a Schumer fan and tolerate early works I would be honest and say its not as bad as you have heard.So for me movies are all about expectations.

255,colincec,Trainwreck - A Reel Snippet Review,9,10 August 2015,"Trainwreck was incredibly funny, but I was surprised by how real and raw it was. Admittedly, it felt like it took a bit to find the plot, but once it got going, man, it was one hell of a ride. This movie relishes making you uncomfortable, as it should; a lot of the topics from death to how bad patterns can instill a self-destructive mindset shouldn't be treated as if a sitcom's laughtrack is supposed to play under them. The laughs that they do get are definitely of the darker variety. None of it feels forced, either, not even when the movie finds its way to those romantic comedy staples. It all comes off as natural and the types of intimate talks and fights that people actually have.The script was written by Amy Schumer herself and this could have very well come off as a Mary Sue self-insert fanficition, right down to naming her character Amy. But instead of turning herself into some perfect paragon who's awesome at everything, she writes a flawed human being who is still sympathetic even through the bad decisions she's made. This very well could be her way of working out some of her own issues and it comes out beautifully. Bill Hader also plays a lovable dork of a doctor who falls for Amy and is quite the likable character. But for me, the standout has to be Lebron James, who turns in some of the most hilarious deadpan humor of the movie. Something about the world's most famous basketball player grilling Hader's character for not visiting in Cleveland and trying to get him to pay for lunch just had me in stitches.This being a Judd Apatow film, there are of course a good share of raunchy jokes. Not all of them are laugh-out-loud funny, but the ones that are bust your gut wide open. It certainly helps that all of the actors had good chemistry and can work off of each other really well. Yet underneath all of this is an astounding amount of heart that makes you feel like you came away with something at the end of it all. I'd gladly see it again and would encourage you all to do the same.",Trainwreck

Even though the genre of movie is comedy and romance i didn't find any comedy in it rather poor display of humor and a lack of originality.

She lives by her rules and doesn't give a crap what society says. So far so good. The character is exercising her sexual agency in a way that makes others uncomfortable and drives some of them into slut-shaming. Up to this point it's okay, although I do like her exercising her agency unapologetically. The problem, for me comes towards the end where she does all the regular Rom-Com attributes.

263,katosubzero,Not worth Half Price Admission - Wait for Red Box rental,4,18 July 2015,"Saturday, 18 July 2015I went to see the comedy movie ""Train wreck"" for two reasons. 1. I thought that I would be LMAO and 2. NBA star, Lebron ""King"" James. Although, Lebron is not playing for my Miami Heat team anymore, I still like him as a person and ball player. Lebron, playing himself is one of the best parts in the movie. From the start, the movie was so-so funny. Most of the people with me in the audience was laughing a bit now and then, but not a lot. For me the funniest scene in the movie was when wrestler, John Cena was in bed on top of Amy Schumer and she was telling him to talk sexy.Also just like Melissa McCarthy's Spy, this movie had way to much cursing/profanity. A little profanity is okay, but this was like listening to a porno movie with such dialogue as Amy talking to her sister, Kim about a photo of their mother when she was younger and holding one of them in a white dress. ""Oh mom was Fu---ble then and mom's tits was so nice and much better than mine. Mine's just sort of -----"".. Why does every R rated comedy now days have to have so much harsh crude profanity to be funny. Wake the hell up, Hollywood production companies, a movie is NOT going to be any funnier just because it has a lot of cursing it in. Blart Mall Cop-2 was so funny and had no profanity or very little.I decided Not to see the rest of this foul mouth truck driver type of movie. The theater manager gave me a refund pass to return to see another movie.",Trainwreck
264,alicjaljohnson,Trainwreck!,8,19 July 2015,"Amy Schumer writes and stars in Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow. If you enjoyed Anchorman (2004) or Bridesmaids (2013), this modern and fast-paced comedy is definitely for you. ""Monogamy is unrealistic."" That's the message that Amy Townsend (Amy Schumer) has had drilled into her head by her father, Gordon (Colin Quinn) since she and her sister were young. At the start of the film we see that Amy has fully embraced this sentiment in her late twenties by having numerous one-night stands (but she's ""kinda sorta"" dating Steven (John Cena) – the breakup inevitably happens fast). Amy works at a male humor magazine called S'nuff under Dianna (Tilda Swinton), who is considering Amy for an editorial promotion. To her dismay, Dianna assigns Amy to work on an article about Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), a sports doctor who happens to be besties with LeBron James. Although she hates sports, Aaron and Amy connect during the interview. The interview turns into dinner, dinner turns into drinks, and drinks turn into a cab ride to Aaron's apartment. Despite Amy's best efforts to stop it, a relationship develops between the two. Now treading in unchartered waters, Amy tries to keep her frivolous past and inexperience in exclusivity from putting a damper on the romance. Trainwreck is the first film that Schumer has written, and she does a great job. The plot feels like a flipped romantic comedy. If this were a classic rom-com, it would be the boy who'd struggle with commitment and have a marijuana problem. But no. Amy is the so-named ""trainwreck"" in this film, making it all the more intriguing and – dare I say it – relatable. The dialogue flows well from character to character, and at several parts it even comes off as unscripted. Schumer uses a good mix of comedy, including sarcasm, slap-stick, and toilet humor. To put it simply, Trainwreck is HILARIOUS. One thing that I will say is that towards the end of the film it feels like the plot has less effort put into it; there's a certain contradictory scene that does not flow with the storyline. It feels like a time-filler. Nonetheless, as the writer Schumer definitely has something to be proud of. The cast of the film has great chemistry, particularly Schumer and Hader. I'd never considered Bill Hader dreamy, but I definitely felt some butterflies for him during the movie. Hader pulls off the awkward-but-cute- and-smart doctor character very well. Nowmy unpopular opinion: I did feel that Schumer was a bit out of place for her role. Personality-wise she was great. However, she doesn't have the look of someone who would hook up with a different person every night. As much as I love seeing a woman who isn't a size 2 as the lead in the movie, I think this film is actually the type that is written for a size 2. John Cena has a supporting role in the film, but he manages to make the most of it. It's always funny to see a giant bodybuilder be emotionalCena delivers on this and is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. The best films are the ones that make you laugh and cry. While watching Trainwreck, I found myself laughingand then cryingand then laughing until I cried again. Apatow, Schumer, and Hader are certainly a victorious team; one that I hope to see more of in future productions.",Trainwreck

It was so boring and why was it so darn long? There's no other way to put it - the movie was not funny. I love all comedy and all types of humor. This movie was just not funny. Make it 90 minutes, cut to the chase - in this case, the comedy. No need to do so much character development. We should know your character within the first few minutes. If your movie is a comedy then make it a comedy. This movie tried to get kind of dramatic and realistic. The other thing that was painful about this movie is that Amy Schumar is not very attractive, and the role she plays is a promiscuous girl who has one-night stands with hot dudes. This story had me cringing, and yet I don't think I would have been cringing had it been played by another actress. In general the acting was not good.",Trainwreck

275,bonekeep,Great coming out party for Amy Schumer,8,21 July 2015,"Amy Schumer written and Judd Apatow directed, Trainwreck is a funny and entertaining debut for Schumer. If you're familiar with and like her bawdy stand-up, then you'll definitely enjoy this film. Although there are parts of the film that could have been better written and showed her inexperience as a screenwriter, the complete film is well executed with a satisfying if not somewhat predictable resolution. Schumer is clearly the star here, but this film shines also in part because of strong performances from Bill Hader and the awesome Brie Larson (I love Brie Larson in everything I've seen her in... if you haven't seen Short Term 12, you must!). LeBron James is good in a significant role, certainly better than anyone would have ever predicted, but the runaway performance of this film is John Cena of WWE wrestling fame. His scenes are hilarious, and compete with Dave Attell for funniest in the film (in fact I could have used more of both). SNL alums Colin Quinn and Vanessa Bayer are solid, as is Tilda Swinton who was looking much less pasty than her usual self. The direction is passable, which is how I usually come away from Judd Apatow directed movies, but the man does know funny and this one delivers on that for sure. Of course, this is the coming out party for Amy Schumer and I for one can't wait to see more from her on the big screen.",Trainwreck
276,calvinyeh-72678,Anticipated the disappointment,3,18 March 2020,"This movie is horrendous. End of story. There was no apparent plot and all the story had were awkward jokes and obscene content in attempts to live up to the ""comedy"" portion of the movie.I personally am not familiar with Schumer's work outside of the movie industry, but her performance was simply not funny. Of course it might have been because of the flaws of her character, but her emotionless acting lifeless delivery esaily validates the raging criticism.The story could have been so easily, turned into a ficticious example of women empowerment, hence great philosophy to back up the movie, but they completely blew it. The cheerleading scene at the end is nowhere near sufficient the redemption Schumer's character. She is still a messed up woman who is constantly drunk, high and possibly unfaithful. The end serves no purpose rather than adding one last pull closer towards ""comedy"".It is an aching waste of Hader's talent, and this movie is evidently a massive failure. Personally I only watched the movie because I am a fan of Lebron James, and somehow I found myself regretting the time I wasted on this movie. One point for Hader, one point for James, and one point for Albert, for that they actually made me laugh.Could have been better, Couldn't have been worse.",Trainwreck

278,charlestontracy,Got Hype?,2,1 January 2016,"Trainwreck is just one of those movies that did not match the hype surrounding it. It is simply not that funny, and completely predictable. This movie is not deserving of any sort of award nominations. Amy Shumer plays a writer for a magazine and is given an assignment to do a story regarding sports/athletes, and due to her lack of knowledge and protest regarding sports, her boss gives her the assignment. I don't know what to make of Amy's character ""Amy"" (yep! that's her character's name!) She's supposedly a professional, but her actions state otherwise. She is also portrayed as a man-eater. I have issues with that for many reasons. Anyway, during her research for the article, she meets a sports doctor/surgeon played by Bill Hader. Hader was wonderfully portrayed as a love interest on ""The Mindy Project"", but in this movie he's as entertaining as piece of cardboard. Actually, less so because cardboard can be entertaining at times. His character never jumped out at me and made me swoon, laugh, or feel anything really. This role never gave Hader any justice, he deserves so much more!!! Someone owes him big time! So a relationship builds and of course since we are in the age of feminism, the female lead must take on the stereotypes of a man. She doesn't like commitment, or snuggling, or sleep overs. That has always been an issue for me in regards to feminism. Shouldn't our goal be to get away from stereotypes for both men and women?? Why does a single working girl have to always be opposed to marriage and children. Why aren't we getting a single working girl that loves being around children, but quite frankly doesn't want to a mom herself. Why aren't we getting a single working girl interested in children, but not marriage. There is nothing wrong with these scenarios. Women are usually portrayed as one or the other. According to movies women must either want a career or a relationship. Women are only strong and independent when they chew men up and spit them out. Single strong women don't want children, that's only for uppity suburbanites who gave up on life. Anyway, there really is not much to say after this because it is extremely formulaic as far as romantic comedies go. The only parts I laughed at contained John Cena. That was in the beginning of the movie. Nothing Amy did really stood out to me. I also felt the scene with the intern was ridiculous and what if the roles were reversed? What if a male lead was in bed with an intern, that turned out to be 16? How would the audience react to that? Would we be forgiving and continue to watch? This movie is just full of double standards and that is not paving the way for female roles or females in our society. All they are saying is ""hey look, women can be pigs just like men can be."" I guess that's not really the equality I am looking for as far as genders go. I am being nice with 2 stars. I base this off of how much I laughed, and how much I cared about the two main characters being together. This movie was clearly over-hyped, and Amy Shumer did nothing special do deserve a nomination, it's just for popularity. I am convinced the nomination was given because of the hoopla surrounding the movie and Shumer this year. The awards show must feel that may reflect higher ratings for them.",Trainwreck
279,drewsterwang,"Starts Strong, Ultimately Devolves into Apatow's Lengthy Sentimentality Fests",5,1 August 2015,"Being a big fan of Amy Schumer and Bill Hader, I was extremely eager to see this film. I was expecting it to be full of the main character's drunken antics, but really those have little to do with her problem maintaining a relationship with a nice guy she likes, and supplies only a small (yet funniest) part of the comedy. The upsides: I give good marks for the satirical lad magazine Amy works for. Colin Quinn's befuddled rambling delivery is finally working for him as he starts playing salty old men, so he became my favorite character. Judd Apatow's kids aren't in it. The film's downfall, just like Apatow's previous films, is its length. The hugging and learning bit at the end takes up half an hour, and a million useless cameos have been left in just to avoid hurting anyone's feelings. Apatow's groupie-like casting will prevent him from recreating the success of his tighter, hilarious early comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. I'm happy to see the cast of SNL pop up in a movie, but do we need the intervention scene and the angry subway passenger? Does Method Man have to do another fake Jamaican accent? The scenes are also far too long to sustain any comedic rhythm, so jokes that could have been funny end up falling flat. A minute of awkwardness gets the point across that something awkward is happening, so the next three minutes are tedious. Hopefully Judd Apatow's next outing can take itself less seriously and not be just him showing off his rolodex.",Trainwreck

It does not make any sense for them to appear all the time. The plot and jokes are completely nonsense - probably only 1 or 2 jokes in the beginning of the movie were good enough for a laugh.

But sitting there in the theater with my friend watching scene after scene of Amy just being absurdly insulting and racist (and not in a clever or humorously tactful way), we both just looked at each other and nodded and we left after an hour of the movie. I was so disappointed. The character she plays in this movie is not relatable at all or even positive in terms of anti-slut shaming. Because her character is just a horrible, self-centered c***t. I didn't feel the real Amy in this movie and I don't think her comedy shined through such a big-budget, A-lister. There was little to no plot, revolving around her ill father and her, I assume, love interest (although there was absolutely no chemistry).

Trainwreck is plainly designed as a showcase for her talents and does an admirable job proving why she deserves to have a future on the big screen. Trainwreck does fall prey to some of the common romantic comedy tropes, slipping into predictability a bit in the third act. In addition, Judd Apatow's latest isn't immune from some of the shortcomings that typically befall his films. Nevertheless, Trainwreck puts the spotlight on a growing comedic voice in Schumer. While her style may be off-putting to some and occasionally bordering on blatant shock value, it is certainly one worth exploring, and her partnership with Apatow works well for both parties involved, as Trainwreck is anything but what its title implies.For the full review, visit my site.",Trainwreck

Anyways, the wife and I were flipping through new releases and figured we'd give it a shot. We went back to searching for something to watch about 45 minutes into this epic failure. This movie is terrible. Whatever storyline that may exist is strung along so incoherently that it basically becomes an afterthought. Watching this was more like observing loosely affiliated, wholly unfunny sketches that were cobbled together in an effort to call this frankenstein-ish abomination a comedy movie. Amy Schumer the stand-up act can, at times, be funny. Amy, the character played by Amy Schumer, could not find a way to be accidentally funny in this movie. Apparently, from reading other reviews, Amy Schumer was portraying a character that was narcissistic and a walking human train-wreck, but in my opinion, Schumer is simply portraying a character she truly believes demonstrates her real persona or image. The ridiculous outfits in every scene, the focus on how beautiful, sexy, angelic, sought-after, un-leavable Amy is, the seemingly good career but adding absolutely no value, the unquestioned opinions and attitude...Amy the character is not narcissistic, she is simply unfathomable to most viewers, which is what makes this movie so bad. The situations Amy finds herself are just so exaggerated or self-aggrandizing that within five minutes of the movie I was already done with her as a character, and just stuck around to see if any of the other characters could redeem the movie (a big no in my books). Add to that the complete nonsense that is the relationship with her sister and father (they hate him but love him? the sister is the nice one but wants to keep kicking dad out to the curb? Dad is a complete a$s but Amy is by far the worst in the family? Amy can score (and reject) an unlimited number of good looking men who are reasonable people, but her more attractive sister is stuck with some weird guy who doesn't realize he's constantly the butt of Amy's jokes?). I don't know what we may have missed in the second half of this movie, it sounds like there may have been some semi-comedic moments that might have changed my overall opinion, but this movie is a 1 because it left both my wife and I without any desire to continue forward and suffer through another 45 minutes of garbage to hope for any humor that might have existed. Amy Schumer's face is plastered everywhere as this rockstar of comedy and culture...but if she's going to keep selling her fans these flaming dumpster fires then I have to hope her claim to fame is a short one and that a more worthy comic comes along and steals her thunder.",Trainwreck

It was the same old story of someone used to being single, getting hooked up and falling for someone and then after a bump in the romantic road, getting back together. It felt like it was from 15 years ago. Amy can't act. The rest of the cast was a bunch of SNL-ers, who seem like they signed on because their show was on hiatus or sports celebrities who lumbered through their scenes. WHY oh WHY would this tired story be over 2 hours long? I sat there thinking of all the other things I could be doing. The scene with Matthew Broderick and Chris Everett. Why was that even there? Amy in a too short skirt in way too many scenes to remind the audience her character is sexy, I guess. The dialogue was like from an online screen writing class - University of Phoenix, comes to mind. Hader was a WOODEN LUNK. The boss was nothing else but shrill, like in a bad soap opera. All the sex jokes were the same you hear on Bravo! or USA or any cheesy network with serial reality shows.

I ultimately walked out, partly out of boredom, partly distaste for the film.There are a few funny moments, but way too few, and way not worth it. Wish I had seen Antman, which was the other option this night.",Trainwreck
296,mailstudiostar,Bad,4,26 October 2015,"This movie is like a lot of similar type of movies; meaning movies that aims to challenge preconceived notions of ""what a lady should and should't be like"". It quickly becomes banal, predictable and irritating. There's no depth of character here, because you sort of get the gist of the jokes before they're halfway delivered. Having said that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good performances. Unfortunately Amy Schumer doesn't deliver that. I don't know why scriptwriters and directors hit the same creative pitfalls every time a movie like this is to be made. We get it: here's an urban girl with a modern outlook on life who does what she wants, sleeps with whom she wants and doesn't apologize for it, etc etc.. good, but then what? A movie needs more than just a cliché of a character, predictable jokes and bad acting.",Trainwreck
297,sticks901,Rom-Com Stereotypes Flipped,8,19 July 2015,"I laughed all the way through the movie. Very few jokes in the movie didn't have me or the entire theater rolling. One thing is certain, Amy Schumer can write comedy. If you watch her show, or see her standup, you know she is funny. The movie proves she can also act. This is probably Judd Apatow's best work since Knocked Up. Though to be honest, I never saw Funny People. If you want a great date movie, that both parties can enjoy, pick Trainwreck. It has something for everyone. The premise is standard romantic comedy fair, except the roles are reversed. Instead of the Male character playing the promiscuous womanizer who drinks and does drugs, that role is reserved for Amy Schumer character, Amy She is going to have to eventually branch out and give herself a character name other than her real one. The male lead, Aaron (played by Bill Hader) is settled down and doesn't date all that often. The setup works brilliantly, and Amy pulls off the role with perfection. She is hilarious, and Bill Hader does a spectacular job playing off her. He is an extremely funny guy, but does a great job playing it straight for the movie. After they meet, the movie then falls back on standard romantic comedy tropes, but it feels fresh with the role reversal. I truly didn't know how they would end the movie. I wasn't sure if they would make it a happy ending, or go somewhere different. If you want to find out which way it went, go pony up the dough and see the movie, it is well worth it. Along with Amy and Bill there are some great cameos from a few sports stars. LeBron James plays Dr. Aarons' buddy who wants him to be happy. LeBron does a great job playing a version of himself. The other cameo/role is from John Cena, who plays Amy's boyfriend at the start of the show. He is hilarious. I don't want to spoil anything, but his small role alone is worth the price of admission. He had me cracking up. The other supporting cast members are great, Colin Quin as Amy's dad is funny as hell. Brie Larson does a good job as Amy's somewhat normalized sister. The only one who's jokes didn't hit all the time was Tilda Swinton who played Amy's boss Dianna. I honestly didn't know it was her who played the boss until I looked it up. She did a good job, but her jokes seemed a little forced. They went for awkward situational laughs from her, and they fell flat a few times. The only other issue with the movie is its run time, which seems to be a theme with Apatow flicks. They could have cut a few scenes and it would have moved the movie along. A few times the scenes felt thrown in and interrupted the entire flow of the movie. A couple of times it felt like the scenes where part of a skit show. Granted that's what Amy Schumer usually rights for so that could be expected. One cameo scene in particular could have been left out altogether. This is really the only issue with the movie, and I still laughed through the parts that could have been cut. The movie also had a surprisingly amount of heart. I was expecting more raunchy fun, but got some actual drama. I think they did a good job of showing how damaged Amy character was, and trying to justify some of her actions through these issues. It is what drove the movie forward, instead of just being a hodge-podge of different sketch scenes. It shows Amy Schumer has the potential to be a comedy movie star. We will have to see what she does with follow-up movies, but her first one was a roaring success. I had a great time watching Trainwreck, and would watch it again. Not in theaters, but will definitely watch it again once it comes out on blu-ray. I'm not sure it is one I will pick up the day it comes out. It is one you can wait for the price to drop and it go to the 7.99 sale bin. Still worth owning, but I usually don't shell out for comedies on day one blu-ray releases datesJ. It was a great weekend at the movies. Ant-Man and Trainwreck where both stellar. Hopefully the rest of the summer continues the good trend.My Rating: Own on Blu-RayTop Five Favorite Romantic Comedies 1.

298,joshoreilly24,Really funny for a long time,7,12 September 2015,This movie is significantly better than most romantic comedies.Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are funny and have pretty good chemistry. The supporting cast is fantastic with a stand out performance from John Cena of all people (I'm not even kidding he practically steals the movie).The parts that are good are so good that I still gave it the benefit of the doubt for the last 20 minutes or so when it dove off a cliff. It goes for sentiment in the third act and doesn't recover comedically. The ending is fairly cliché and abrupt.This movie is still worth seeing though.,Trainwreck

I didn't think I was going to like it because I am not a fan of the hook up culture and anything that accepts it, but I lightened up enough to enjoy this movie. It's just really good entertainment. I admit her show on Comedy Central is hit or miss (as all sketch comedy shows are,) but her stand up is hysterical and this movie is exactly like her stand up. Obviously it's very graphic so I can't recommend going with your parents, in-laws or anyone else you might feel uncomfortable being around when people are simulating raunchy stuff on screen if you catch my drift.

301,plc333999,Trainwreck not a train wreck. Entertaining movie.,8,19 July 2015,"After reading some of the reviews here, I was wondering if we all saw the same movie. A lot of angst seems to be on unmet expectations of what viewers were expecting to see. I had no expectations and have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed Trainwreck. Amy's character was flawed, sympathetic, funny and a reflection of a lot of women I know. She also didn't make herself or other women in the film victims. Tilda Swinton was a real highlight. Bill Hader held his own and subdued himself around Amy so she could shine and she did. His fighting to not go to sleep while she rants all night was so spot on. By the end of the movie, I was glad I went to see it because I caught myself laughing several times throughout it. Not every movie has everything we want in it. Some parts could be done different or better in our humble movie going opinion but in the end, its the director's point of view on style, pacing, how they want to tell the story. Not everyone has the same movie going IQ or interest on why they see a movie. I hated Moonstruck the first time I saw it. Now its one my favorites. Trainwreck is a movie I will watch again when it comes out on HBO or whatever. For me, it was entertainment. I enjoyed it.",Trainwreck

""Amy"", the main character (what a surprise!) is unlikeable, does not represent women at her age and acts like a 16 years old rebellious teenager.The monologues are terrible, shallow and stupid. The main man character wasn't that bad, but his best friend was so girly I felt ashamed of being a woman myself. Their ""break-up"" wasn't touching at all, it was childish and idiotic. No comment on the supposed-to-be ""love scenes"".I don't understand how this awful piece of garbage could win any award, not to mention a Comedy of The Year award.

303,gaylord509,"Terrible, tries too hard to make cheap gender-points.",2,29 July 2016,"Let me first say that this film had potential. Both Amy Schumer and Bill Hader plays well. The problem is the script; the film tries way too hard to make points on the fact that there are women out there who do not behave typically lady-like, and who behave more like a stereotypical male.Schumers character is promiscuous, Hader's character is the more emotional one of the two, and Schumers first almost-boyfriend, a bodybuilder, is portrayed as soft and emotional in the presence of the less emotionally available Amy.If done right, this could be a nice film where those points would come across, but it would have to be much more subtle to be convincing. In ""Trainwreck"" the gender juxtapositioning mentioned above unfortunately gets more annoying than anything else due to lack of subtlety.2/10",Trainwreck

How many ways can you make promiscuity funny....well too many. Very few things in this film were funny. It began to become uncomfortable and very repetitive. Ms Schumer is good in small doses, but is no Bullock or McCarthy. Towards the end it picks up just a very small amount but goes back into the toilet. All in all, I could have spent the 2 hours doing something more productive, such as contemplating my navel or cleaning the toilet.

The distance between the punch lines caused the movie to drag on and on and on, etc. A little about the movie characters, they aren't common people, she used a sports medicine doctor, giving the script a chance to include a few star athletic. She is a writer for a major magazine. Maybe she thinks common people like a fast food worker and taxi driver would be boring. Her show on television moves quickly, why she didn't write the script that way is a mystery to me. The overall acting is good, but this movie is what you would wait to show up on HBO or Showtime.

OK, she's a ""trainwreck"", embarrassing things happen, but if we take the sex stuff out, we're left with half of the movie.. like in most cases, recently, with this comedy/romance genre. And if, somehow, before this ""era"" there were some movies that left you wanting to know more about the characters sensuality, now... I just want to know less, and even deleting some scenes/lines from my memory forever.But enough about that. Now, I must say I'm not one of those people who give a whole lot of adjectives review, nor one of those who depict the storyline with an epic presentation. No - just one of those people who want to say/share how I felt after it (and they are all bad categories to be in or.. good - depends if you're an optimist or a pessimist).So I feel... that portraying out-of-balance relationships with fifty-fifty chance of success, is the new trend. Sadly, I guess this has become a universal theme, on which, people like me, can relate to; and why aren't movies trying to sell us anymore that perfect happy- ending? Are we that messed-up?Yes, I think we are. Oops, I meant, I think I am.

The movie quickly accelerates 23 years to Amy's adult life where she maintains that heartless motto with an enthusiasm that torpedoes the foundations of ""moral"" values with vigorous contempt. Amy clearly has some commitment issues. She has no problem going home with men and has no problem taking them home either, but she will not let them sleep over and likewise she will quickly dismount and leave any prospect swiftly. She seems to only be concerned with satisfying her own sexual appetite, but completely fears any type of emotional relationship or intimacy of any kind. She seems to avoid any and all non-sexual contact, completely dreading that she might develop feelings and hence producing the chemicals that bond people together. On the other hand her sister Kim has betrayed Amy and their father by falling in love and marrying. Amy holds her sister Kim in contempt and treats her as if she hated her father for her treacherous decision to fall in love and start a family. Meanwhile, Amy enjoys, boozing, smoking pot, many men, and working for a insipid magazine called Snuff. Snuff is a sensationalist magazine that appeals to the lowest base desires of men by offering them gossip and taboo sexual advice. The work environment is also distorted as the lead editor Dianna (Tilda Swinton) likes to keep the environment apprehensive and cut-throat throughout the duration of the film. However, once Amy is assigned to write about a sports surgeon Dr. Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) who treats several famous athletes this Manhattan girl will finally start to develop feelings for a man. Nonetheless, her sense of separateness and distrust for feelings will make it difficult for her to return any sentiments of love and affection; regardless of how much you love Amy, she will have a difficult time loving you back. Eventually Amy will begin to realize that her life is a train-wreck and that she needs to clean up her act. Several events occur that cause Amy to start down a new path in her life, but I will leave those details out of this analysis so I don't spoil too much of the film. Nevertheless, I should not recommend this movie due to its adult subject material and its mortification of traditional values. However, I suspect that you will want to watch this movie anyways because you will probably find it extremely funny (unless you really are slighted by corrupted real-isms) and because you are not as moral as you tell yourself, you are. The movie also has appearances by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Marisa Tomei, LeBron James as himself, John Cena as Steven one of Amy's many men, Method Man, and a few others. - Enjoy",Trainwreck

This all comes to a head in a scene in which Lebron James, Matthew Broderick, Marv Albert, and Chris Evert, all playing themselves, stage an ""intervention"" for Bill Hader's character in an attempt to convince him to take back his girlfriend, Schumer's character.

Unfortunately, Amy is rather generic, repetitive and not very likable and her behavior played out almost like a sad, mid-life crisis. I think the character Amy is suppose to be ""shocking"" with her use of profanity (oh my), drinking and pot smoking (maybe if she were 15 and not mid-30s?), and the fact that she has a lot of (lousy) sex. She was no more shocking than the boring, goody-good housewives she ridicules in the film. I'm not sure what it says that LeBron James was one of the better characters in this movie, much more likable and charming than the majority of the cast.

Before anyone starts hollering misogynist, I am all for a rise in female comedy. But Amy Schumer is just not funny. And neither really is Bill Hader. Bill Hader did a great job in Superbad with the support of Seth Rogen but on his own you don't really see the appeal of his acting.The plot also tries to pull out the emotional card but at this point you just don't care anymore,and this is about halfway through the film. You still have another gruelling hour to endure.I liked the effort that Judd Apatow went to to make this movie work as the camera angles are all spot on, the set design does the job and using sporting celebrities to help enhance the plot works.

But I loved the chemistry between the main characters (probably because I wasn't expecting it) and I had a good time watching! I hope Amy keeps it up, she's cool.",Trainwreck

However, I loved this movie. The opening was done in a creative way and set the tone perfectly for the rest of the movie, and let us understand why Amy Shcumer's character was doing the things she was. Many would say her behavior was self loathing or self destructive, but I didn't see it that way. She, like many women in the big city, was trying to experience all she could and find her way. It may not have been the 'normal' way, but she had to walk that road. The movie was creative, funny and heartfelt. All the performances were great. There were a few scenes, as when she and her sister were looking at a photo of their mother and reminiscing about her that I could have skipped, but overall this movie shows that Amy Schumer, paired with these good actors and director, has a bright future.",Trainwreck

Then she realizes she loves him. She goes to MSG and dances with the Knicks cheerleader and some acrobatic basketball team. The ending was so stupid and cliché. I was really hoping for something that broke boundaries (like ""Something About Mary""), but ""Train Wreck"" falls way short of anything ground breaking.

Her character is hilarious and flawed.. bitchy yet you feel for her. I don't get why everyone is hating on this movie. So far it's been doing well at the box office and proves Amy's talents for writing and comedy. Yea, it's a rom-com, but there's something different about this movie. It get's dark and is full of emotion as well as raunch and laughs.

Lebron James is the best thing in the movie - he's the only saving grace. Judd Apatow needs to learn how to edit a comedy down to a short, sharp 1hr 30min as well. I shouldn't be sitting in a comedy wondering if I've missed a week of my life because it feels like the movie has gone on forever. I should have learnt my lesson after This is 40!

I've personally only recently discovered Amy Schumer -I live in England and she's not so famous over here yet but I got her Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo on Audiobook when it came out and I laughed so much listening to that so I thought Trainwreck might be worth a shot. But it was great! I'm so glad I watched it, it was a really enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, it deserves all the awards in my opinion.

Then the comedy deals with all the stereotypes of the American culture ! I do not what's wrong with the Hollywood but many people take the subway in cities , not just the Afroamericans and the Mexican immigrants ! Then , in the U.S. there are many immigrants from third world countries who are doctors / engineers etc and moved to the U.S. to pursue a Better life / to escape for the war etc... It doesn't mean the because they are not licensed to work in the U.S. , they are incapable and unskilled to do their professions!! Finally why they always have to create the same classic scenario of how a guy/ girls aged to change because he/she found the other half? There is no innovation , nothing funny or prototypical ! They try to force people to laugh by putting the actors into awkward situations as moments and not by their actions and their actual script ! Disappointing !",Trainwreck

343,stargazer_starrygazer,Raunchy Comedy That's Actually Funny,8,23 April 2015,"Unlike some comedies out there, this one is actually funny. I didn't really know Amy Schumer too well as a comedian - her roles have mainly been with television but let me be the first to say that Amy Schumer, acting as a chronically commitment-challenged career woman, is some serious comedic gold. Throw in some dirty jokes, a solid script (written by Schumer herself) and SNL veteran Bill Hader, and you've got a good movie for a Friday night.What made this movie enjoyable was the script and great comedic acting. Amy wrote herself a good character. She showcases her comedic chops and also subtly subverts the stereotypical Hollywood romantic comedy women leads (instead of pining for Mr. Right, Schumer's Amy Townsend has sworn off the happily-married-with-two- kids phase for a...different source of romance). The script, even while developing the budding connection between the two leads, still maintains gravity by exploring how each person's problems has affected their relationship. By this, I mean that there are no silly love rivals or dramatic altar scenes with sad music in the background, but rather a more realistic look into Amy's entrenched commitment-phobia and Aaron's relative naiveté with deep relationships. Schumer cuts out the clichéd dialogue and relies on well-placed scenes and double entendres, to good effect.And of course, with the main lead (Bill Hader) playing a sports doctor, there were quite a few brilliant cameos from big-name athletes like LeBron James and Amar'e Stoudemire (LeBron in particular plays a penny-pinching, egotistical version of himself to perfection). You may be concerned about the running time (over two hours), but the twists and narrative detours that Schumer writes are, in my opinion, justified. They don't necessarily further the plot, but they contribute to the world that the characters inhabit by fleshing out side characters. In particular, Tilda Swinton, playing the unrecognizably bronzed Anna-Wintour-like editor of Snuff magazine who bosses around Amy and her colleagues (Randall Park from ""Fresh Off The Boat"" and Vanessa Bayer from SNL), was another hilarious addition to the movie.While it's not a deeply emotional movie (and it shouldn't be), it will resonate for anyone who's ever went through troubled times in a relationship. The script is cheeky and the acting was cheekier. Watch the movie. It's good.",Trainwreck

I gave this two stars instead of one because the first part did try to deviate from the chick-flick formula, however heavy handed.

We get it, some modern women prefer alcohol induces one night stands over real relationships. Its an old story line and they try and break it up with a bit of comedy.Unfortunately the charters are not endearing or even that likable and the comedy is flat and predictable.Not a horrible flick, Amy's character is too annoying to be likable (probably the choice of actress).",Trainwreck

It was a chore to sit through the whole thing and personally I'm tired of Hollywood's illogical fascination with Amy Schumer.Where was all this attention for real talent like Tracy Ullman. She didn't get half the attention of Amy and Amy isn't half as talented as Tracy.Amy relies on lowest common denominator humor and it gets old after a while. Sex and toilet humor only go so far and trying to tie that into a real romance plot with attempts at acting just doesn't work that well. Her constant narration was also no needed. I actually found her first boyfriend and Bill Hader to be the funniest characters, but the way she integrated into the movie was just not that funny. Amy needs to expand into being more than just the slightly overweight sex and toilet humor independent woman who can overcome character. I get it.. Hollywood needs more non supermodel actresses, but a basic requirement should also be that they are talented actresses or writers. I'm not seeing that much in Amy, she gets away with it playing a drunk loud mouth sex addict and that's just not innovate in the slightest way.I agree with a previous poster. Pixels was a better comedy than this easily and Spy was easily the best comedy I've seen this year. This movie was a chore to watch. I'm probably being nice giving it a 5 because I would not watch it again.",Trainwreck

This film had so many hidden gems I wish I could tell you but at this point all I can say is rent it but I picked it up because I am single now but once I meet ""the right girl"" she will find this movie to be awesome! It throws the male stereotype of ""all women want is a relationship"" right out the window and backs up the desire of any educated woman to simply throw away moron men. The world has plenty to offer and I think that angry all the male reviews you see on here.The comedy is witty and fresh. Not once did I feel a groan coming on. Drama? You bet! This film featured pretty much everything your life can be about at some point and the honest emotions felt and dealt with.So, single guy, I hate sports and drunks. I hate strip clubs and bimbos.

I understand how hard it is for a stand-up comic to not only star in, but write a comedy that lasts at least 90 minutes. However, with all my understandings I just didn't like this film. Small parts of it were kind of funny, but the rest of it was like a mashup of ideas that were trying hard to come together.Hader was the only redeeming factor of the film. He acted with intent and knew the role he was playing. All the celebrity cameos (especially from some of the sports stars) seemed strained at the best of times. Amy herself is unrelatable. I don't understand why people are going crazy for her?? Is it because she is a female in a highly male dominated industry?

Judd Apatow seems to have both in spades with Trainwreck, whose greatest offense isn't even wasting the formidable creative energies of Amy Schumer, but its successive functioning as a head-up-its-own-ass, feature-length advertisement for the NBA and other pop-culture banalities. No other film in 2015 squandered so much talent and opportunity. The film's worst scene epitomizes this, as LeBron James, Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and Marv Albert (all playing themselves) stage an intervention for Bill Hader's softhearted doctor, whose name might as well be Kindly Kind. Albert evaluates the scenario like he's calling a basketball game, Broderick and Hader exchange in-jokes about Broderick's marriage to ""the star of Sex and the City,"" and Evert calls James ""a cock-blocker,"" all while Apatow haplessly cuts the scene, like the entire film, into smithereens.",Trainwreck

In fact, this film was simply a movie that happened to be on one of the movie networks on cable one day when I turned on the TV, and I immediately started snickering.Schumer delivers awkwardly funny sarcastic humor the whole ride through the movie. Bill Hader, whose roles I don't normally enjoy, actually plays quite well off of Schumer's lines and provides great chemistry, and I found myself really liking his character in this film. The real stars of the show are the scenes including Tilda Swinton, John Cena, and Lebron James, where if you're anything like me you'll be laughing your tail off.Unfortunately, there are a few slow points of the movie. The scenes with Amy's father tend to drag and feel like forced moments of attempted character building. The scenes with her sister also don't feel too enjoyable, and often the two don't come off the screen with very good chemistry. There are a lot of pop culture references in the film, and I have a feeling 10-20 years down the road it won't feel quite as funny to me as it does today.I was able to look past the negatives and enjoy the real comedic value of this piece, and I've already watched it three times (having shown it to friends). I could watch the John Cena scenes over and over again and never stop laughing.Trainwreck is a film whose target audience is 18-40 year-olds that enjoy laughing at raunchy-but-smart, pop-culture-infused humor with a little bit of a story thrown in the mix.",Trainwreck

370,bloodhazel3650,Really was a trainwreck. Not at all what I expected. *spoilers*,3,25 July 2015,I'm not going to say 1/10 because I did laugh at a few parts. I dragged my friends to see this because I had high hopes for Amy. The trailer seemed pretty funny and I love Bill Hader. That is one of my complaints. Bill Hader as the love interest?! I had to literally hide my eyes like I was in a scary movie whenever they made out or had sex. It was so gross. And what was up with all the serious plot lines?? I was expecting this hilarious movie and *spoiler* her dad dies. Honestly I feel like some of the jokes are overused. The whole I'm a woman and I'm a slut! I have sex with a lot of guys! I'm vulgar! I make fun of myself! Can girls come up with anything better? Not to mention the opening scene was cringe worthy. There were a lot of people in the theatre when I saw it and like no one was laughing. She needs to work on her acting or delivery. I was ready to leave literally after 45 minutes. She's not as funny as I expected. Oh and all the funny parts are basically in the trailer. I don't get why there are so many good user reviews. It makes me sad that my fellow Americans gave this a 9 or 10. It really was a trainwreck.,Trainwreck
371,guitarjimb,All men should watch this,8,15 March 2019,My wife suggested we watch this. I reluctantly agreed and I spent the majority of this film rolling my eyes but stuck with it for the sake of my better half. Maybe I'm a bit thick but eventually I came to understand this story from a female perspective and.... boom!! Love it!! Turns the typical male perspective of women on its head. The ending is triumphant in a real world way. Would recommend men watch this film to understand something of the female phyche when relating to (hopefully not) most men.,Trainwreck
372,churchillca,Too raunchy but some very good acting,1,24 July 2015,"Dumb raunchy humor. Only reason to see film is for acting by Tilda Swenton and LeBron James.Tilda deserves an Oscar.LeBron has a second career. Almost walked out within first 5 minutes. With elderly woman who was embarrassed by nudity. R Rating should be stressed. Not a movie for the old gals who have not been exposed to sex lives of younger generation. Simplistic story line held up by celebrity nudity. Didn't recognize Chris Evert until her name was spoken. And I use to watch her play tennis all the time. Wondered ""who is that woman and why is she sitting with LeBron, Marv and Matthew""?Went to see movie because of Amy's appearance on Ellen Show. Prefer Amy's humor on ""Ellen"".

I see now that I have to write something more since this review has to contain at least ten lines. So I'll just hell you how much fun it was to watch this movie and I cried out of laughter at the movie theater!

374,jazz-clark12,Not worth it,3,26 July 2015,"Pretty disappointing. This was a poorly written and averagely acted movie, which was not at all funny. The ending was corny and predictable - and not in a good way. I generally dislike Judd Apatow movies, with the exception of Bridesmaids, so I can't say I'm surprised this was a miss. I hadn't heard much of Amy Schumer's work before, but I don't think this was a good start for her in the movie business. General casting was disappointing; however LeBron James did a good job. Tilda Swinton's character was particularly poor. The only reasons I can score this as high as a three is the cinematography was pretty good, and as I mentioned I liked LeBron James. Overall, I wouldn't say it was awful, but I sure wouldn't sit through it again.",Trainwreck

The eulogy by Amy at her father's funeral was touching.The BAAAAAAAAAD: But AMY! Oh my GOD she was HORRIBLE! Cringing at the thought of the outtakes! The jokes had NOTHING to them.

The other actors work well as they've obviously needed to fill the cast and it's surprisingly enjoyable, the best part of the film actually.

However, ever since I saw trailers for the movie I was so excited to see it. Literally from the very beginning until the end Amy Schumer had my roommate and I laughing. I just found it to be a light-hearted film that is great to watch if you need a good laugh. I would say the only negative thing I could say about it is that it was lengthy. I fell asleep the first time watching it, then realized I missed the whole last hour of the movie, when I thought I just missed like twenty minutes! So, the length was a bit much. Although I really liked going through Amy's relationship. It felt like the audience got a look into all the stages a couple goes through. At the end I was truly emotionally invested in their relationship. I tend to really like movies like that, because it takes my mind off of my own life for a while and lets me get involved in another family or life situations.

381,nellis-208-107449,"This is no ""Bridesmaids""",4,19 July 2015,"""Trainwreck"" is an apt name considering how much of a mess this movie is. There were some genuinely funny parts, and a surprisingly good performance by LeBron James, but a lot of the jokes fell flat due to bad timing, and some of them were just plain not funny. Pacing was way too slow, and the plot kind of meanders around a lot. Her ""best friend"" character at work was kind of promising and then disappears halfway though. Worst was Schumer's character, who starts out as genuinely unlikable and doesn't improve much throughout the story. I was rooting for the romantic interest to drop her and go hook up with one of the cheerleaders. Anything would have been better. I'm a guy and I loved ""Bridesmaids."" The story had a lot of heart and you were invested in the main character Annie. You wanted her to figure her stuff out, fall in love, and be happy. And along the way there were too many laugh-out-loud moments to count. This? I actually disliked the main character enough to feel that she didn't deserve Hader's character. There was so few redeeming qualities that I didn't care if she was happy or not. It's a shame, because I normally find Schumer hilarious, but I got the sense here that she turned in a script and the producers knew that, no matter how flawed it was, people were going to see this movie. So far they're right.",Trainwreck
382,thedivinewingsoftragedy,How this was nominated for a golden globe is beyond me,6,25 March 2016,"This was unoriginal and only saved by the characters that are actually funny people in real life. Written by Amy Schumer, she manages to have the worst character and performance in the film. And herein lies the ultimate irony: the worst performance in this film was also nominated for a golden globe. A collection of clichés and stolen one liners from Sex and the City... a really poor effort that is only worth watching for Bill Hader's performance and the supporting cast. John Cena's and Lebron's performances might be a sort of surprise but anyone who had watched interviews in laid back settings knew they had potential. Adding brilliant comedians to the cast who can ad lib and improvise is a smart move but doesn't add value to Schumer's work. I have been noticing in the last few years an effort to hype Amy and turn her into a sort of new Tina Fey or Amy Poehler, but nominating this disaster for golden globes is a disgrace and steals credibility to the awards.",Trainwreck

386,joeskerrittphs,Trainwreck: Good performances hindered by bland plot line,4,19 July 2015,"Trainwreck, written by and starring Amy Schumer, Directed by Judd Apatow is not nearly as bad as I thought it maybe. Amy Schumer plays a character that is essentially herself, sharing a name with the character and many personality traits.Amy is a sexually promiscuous girl who refuses to settle with one man, as she was taught by her father in the opening scene of the film ""Monogamy isn't realistic"". Bill Hader plays the foil character to Amy's Reckless lifestyle. Where Amy is promiscuous sleeping with hundreds of guys, Bill Hader admits hes only slept with 4 women. One of the largest surprises of this movie was the good performances put on by the actors in this film. Bill Hader put fourth a good performance and showed great chemistry with Amy Schumer who also had a good performance. Where this movie truly shined was the enjoyable performances by the supporting cast. Lebron James, John Cena, Vanessa Bayer and even a surprise cameo by Daniel Radcliffe make the movie enjoyable.Now where this movie suffers is the writing. I don't blame this on Amy Schumer but rather the limitation of the RomCom genre. The plot is very cookie cutter, bland and predictable. Not only is the generic plot a hurdle but Apatow stretches the movie for 125 minutes. Aside from these details the movie is still pretty enjoyable, not the worst but not great. Not really a feel good movie either. 6/10.",Trainwreck
387,davids-05120,"Decent start, predictable ending",5,20 July 2015,"To be honest, I had no intention what-so-ever to watch this movie. After seeing the trailer numerous times in the last month, I was under the impression that it will be a very dry, predictable, and boring movie. The only reason I ended up seeing the film was due to my wife's persuasion.Being a huge sports fan and seeing John Cena, Lebron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire acting in the movie, that was the only reason I rated this film 5/10. Otherwise it would have been much lower.After a strong opening scene with Amy's father explaining why he is getting a divorce in a very creative way, the humor seemed to get more bland as it progressed. I can count on a single hand how many times the movie actually made me laugh (opening scene, John Cena in bed, Cena at the movies, Amy's reaction when 'the doctor' called her the morning after).Perhaps it is my fault for going into the movie with negative expectations, perhaps it was the movie being over 2 hours long, or perhaps it was indeed the film's lack of excitement. You decide.Do not get me wrong, I do like Amy Schumer. I just think she needs to make a movie with Seth Macfarlane. Then it might be hilarious.",Trainwreck

The world has become so desensitized to this garbage that anyone who doesn't enjoy watching a movie where two sisters describing their mothers tits as being f able is a prude.

390,diana_gothic-40221,The title is accurate,2,31 July 2015,"What can I even say. At the time of writing this review I'd freshly seen the movie, minutes ago. I think the title is pretty accurate... ""Trainwreck"": it certainly was a train-wreck movie.I'm giving it 2 stars only because LeBron James saves the movie past its midpoint (more like past the initial quarter, rather) with his fresh acting and on point performance. Kinda like Cena's. Potentially them and the initial 1/4th of the movie are worthy of acknowledgment, in my humble opinion of course.I think there was a mix of styles, and without wishing to spoil too much, I honestly feel bad for the crew/staff that was part of the production team that had to look over the disastrous script and with no power of change had to be like ""Well ****. This is happening."" In fact, I wish to know who the hell looked at the story written by Amy Schumer and went like ""Oh yeah. Totally. This is going on the big screen. $$$ NICE!"" it wasn't even worthy of a sitcom, but perhaps that's the problem.I don't think making a movie is for everyone and even less so making a movie that ends up in theaters worldwide. Some people somewhere are getting pretty desperate, I reckon.The message the movie tries to get across, seemed to me, as disingenuous and self-conflicting by the end of the movie.I wish to see more of LeBron's character in the future.

391,hirako-67284,Mediocre and infuriating,1,2 August 2015,"I rarely write reviews, but this film won't get away without one.I have no idea how this got over 7 out of 10. That's what made me watch it. I so regret it...This movie is pretty much all I hate about today's distorted feminist views on relationships and our society portrayed in cinema, so yes I'm a bit biased, but the script, acting, music, everything is execrable in there. I couldn't stand it to the end, I stopped it after holding it for as long as I could.The character, some emotionally unstable, average to below-average looking girl who got herself a consumerist job at a second grade press firm. That's what she is if one tries to make a parallel to what she would be in real life. Yet she is shown as a fun while elegant, social and successful young professional who get the job, and the men she wants. From that point I guess there was no hope to save the story, but I still had some hope and thought there would be a turning point. After 30 minutes it became clear the author's intention is to pertain this false, naive and immature perspective on a modern woman sexual life.Contradictions keep flooding, one should in fact be warned at the very beginning though, as the first scene is about a Dad explaining to his two pre-teen daughters that Monogamy is impossible, and it would be terrible to have only 1 doll to play with for the rest of an entire life. Making them repeat that monogamy is not realistic again and again... I'm searching how many dads even today who would ever say that even as a lame excuse to explain the reason of a divorce. Brainwashing two poor little girls, I'm sure it exists, but please don't stage it as if everything is OK.23 years later, we get the emotionally unstable I mentioned.. oh no, the writer preferred making it seem awesome to be a liberated woman. With that sort of education it appears that average chubby women get top studs on a regular basis. Not only that, it's shown she can also attract other types of men, the clever kind, the elegant wealthy ones, even a gay apparently fell for her ""charms"". And they even want to see her again... sure.I have been wondering what could be charming in her. I find nothing. Oh yes, she doesn't seem to be missing an arm. She is supposed to be funny, to me that's just being vulgar. It might work on stage for her 1 (wo)man shows, but on a film it just over the board. Making a series of jokes about a man's big penis works only if the single target audience is *not* that man; and not right when getting intimate with him in the bedroom.The twist is supposed to happen when she finally meet Mr Nice. One would think the real her would start to show, that she would realise in retrospect that her love life was terribly shallow that she keeps using men as a result to her dads attitude towards relationships. But no, it get Mr Nice to magically drag her with patience into a lovely relationship. That's just too painful to watch.In real life, this girl would be failing terribly on her ""mission"" to get the sex she seems to think she deserves. She would get an average looking guy from time to time, who would just run away after getting some fun and never call back again. She would quickly burn out and work on her attitude and hit the gym if sex with plenty hot guys is what she likes. This movie is just too far off from reality to be tolerable. It's OK to make fun on the married couples through out, it's a perspective, I respect that. But embellishing so much what one might think is an ideal lifestyle, stretching a woman's luck beyond possible is simply an insult to the audience's common sense. In essence we have a repulsive woman, who get all the sex she wants. A world where only women and gays seem to have a personality. Men being parked to the bedroom as toys, exception to the Mr Right who took over 10 years to appear. You shake this and make a movie out of this. I admire the effort, that deserves the 1 out of 10, because this thing would be a 0 out of 10I can imagine a small portion of people who have little social/sexual experience who might think this girl and a world like that could potentially exist. That kind of movie will reinforce this naive belief, that makes it a very sad movie. I'm sad, sad for the writer and director, sad for people involved with the making of this non-sense. Sad that I watched over half of it.",Trainwreck

So after having a fun dinner my wife and I decided to go to movies. We went to see Trainwreck. We were expecting to see a clean funny movie. But instead there was extreme male nudity (front and back). In the short time that we stayed seeing the movie, there were three love scenes; nothing held back. They showed the guys' buttocks, his front private part when he turns around, and there are many nasty conversations as well. We walked out after the 3rd nude guy appeared on the screen.

The only one laughing is the producer who made a great deal of money on this peace of...nothing. The production has a nice surface but lacks the most important thing in comedy...timing. I like the idea and the casting of the movie but they forgot the screenplay.

395,beccaneidinger,Worth Your Time,10,1 October 2015,"Comedian Amy Schumer never fails to get a laugh out of her audience. She most recently proved this in her starring part, as Amy, in the 2015 movie Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow. Trainwreck is all about Amy and her ""monogamy isn't realistic"" type of lifestyle. She is very carefree; she smokes weed, drinks often, and hooks up with random men. However, when Amy is assigned to interview Aaron Connors (Bill Hader),a sports doctor, for her magazine job, her world flips around. Learning the true meaning of love, Amy shows her experiences throughout the movie. Trainwreck successfully does what it is supposed to do: enthralls the audience and soon has them crying from laughter.By connecting her own life to Trainwreck, Schumer makes the movie relatable. She connects her personal life with her acting life by not changing her name, hairstyle, fashion, and most importantly, her sarcastic ways. Schumer acts like an average woman who sometimes has a bad day, sometimes has a breakup and sometimes wants to have some fun. This brings the audience's attention towards her because she is not like the typical actress who changes their personality, style, cakes on the makeup and is strutting around like a model. She is down to earth and real about this thing we call ""life"".Schumer also plays her role superbly by being realistic. Schumer is real in her relationship with Aaron; they fight, they make up, they break-up, and they take their time. In no way do they have a perfect relationship, which keeps the audience engaged because they might actually be able to relate to the type of love interest.Facial expressions are a huge part of the movie and Schumer excels here as well. She does not hide her emotions; instead, she lets the audience in and really shows her experiences rather than telling them. In the apartment scene, Amy is sleeping next to an ""ice sculpture"" (of a very built man), and her face shows the awkwardness of this moment and this reflects to the audience. In the scene where Aaron and Amy fight all night, Amy cries, further separating this comedy from the rest; the audience can feel the heartbreak that Schumer is feeling. No matter what the scene, Schumer makes sure that her audience feels what she is experiencing.Trainwreck shows that life is not perfect, but laughing may be the only way to overcome it. The acting is real and the jokes are personal. This movie is a must-see if you're into funny, down to earth, cheesy comedies.",Trainwreck

We have already seen a bunch of movies like this; better story, that's what I expected, but disappointed. The only fun and good part in this movie is done by John Cena. I don't know how people like Amy's comedy so much, I never watched and after this movie I'll never watch.

It really promises, but it doesn't deliver eventually! To my opinion, the humor is kind of dry...not smart, not situational, not...whatever! The most hilarious scenes were probably the ones including Lebron! Apart from that, the movie seemed to drag and drag and drag all the way to the ""happy"" (not for the viewer!) conclusion. Not to mention that the duration was...dreadful! I think that a 90-minute cut would be better...it could actually kind of save the movie a bit.

Beginning is fantastic, elaborate characters also. Everything is pretty convincing. There are more celebrity guests, but I was absolutely shocked when I saw who was playing the editor. No way you can guess. The problem, as always in such romantic comedies (although this far from the classic), the director never dare to push trough the initial idea.

There is no substance, a lot of terrible cheesy jokes, the story is all over the place (some bits just keep going on and on and others just end abruptly) and the acting in general, especially for the main characters, leaves a lot to be desired.It isn't a comedy nor a romance as you will hardly see/feel any of it, it is however indeed a 'Trainwreck' of a movie. Save yourself the trouble of wasting 2 hours of your life.",Trainwreck
402,dziadoscrjunk,Worst.Movie.Ever,1,13 December 2015,"This was just awful. Quite possibly the single worst movie I've ever seen. So bad I created this account to tell people how bad it was. I didn't know much about Amy Schumer to start with other than she had a show on Comedy Central, which is either politically poignant or fart humor. Amy is the latter. A one hit wonder fart joke. This poorly written movie targeted at Amy Schumers ""brand"" could not be saved by the endless cameos of actually funny actors and comedians. Save time and money, and quite possibly the human race by not watching this movie. If you do somehow feel the need to experience this, bang your head against the wall for 10 minutes and you'll get the same feeling as sitting through this movies entirety.",Trainwreck
403,bigtimrichard,This movie is unlikeable,1,13 December 2015,"Let me start by saying that I l o v e Amy Schumer. I've been a fan of her stand-up for years, and absolutely love her show. I also love the idea of her being a leading lady in a movie, and think that it's high time for someone other than Melissa McCarthy to get lead comedic roles (although I enjoy most of her stuff too, just would like to see more than one female comedic actress in movies). I also love Bill Hader, and am a fan of most of Judd Apatow's stuff.That said, this is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. It is ugly, mean-spirited, generally unfunny, insipid, cliché at times, boring at others, and just an awful viewing experience in general. I honestly can't think of a time I've liked a movie less.Rather than list all of the problems with it, which I'm sure you can find elsewhere, I'll just say that regardless of all of it's issues, the biggest problem and most important thing to note is that this is supposed to be a Romantic Comedy, and there is no romance, nor any comedy.In fact, the romantic relationship in this movie is so toxic, and so unrealistic (it makes no sense why either of them behave the way they do), that it almost serves as a farce. If that was the intention, then they did a poor job of executing it, but I commend them on the notion. But I also do no believe that was the intention. Rather, I think they intended to make a comedy with a ""modern"" love story, and got too lazy (Apatow) and too busy (Schumer) to see it through.Ultimately, I didn't care about the characters (in fact, I kind of hated them), and more importantly, I rarely laughed.Overall, I would say Trainwreck is thoroughly unlikeable, and painfully unfunny. Huge Disappointment.",Trainwreck
404,steve-73990,Why is post production audio so bad???,5,26 December 2015,"Did the money run out for post or what? It shouldn't sound like an ocean is in the background if they are in a living room, office, etc. In fact, even if the scene is at the beach, it should only sound like an ocean in a relatively level way ;) Why are room tones and ambiance being mixed in and out in such a horribly noticeable way?This is the third big budget film I've seen in the past few months that has had this same issue. Is this a new way to cut costs because ""people won't notice"", because even my friends who don't work in pro audio were wondering what the deal is with the sound in this and the other two movies.",Trainwreck
405,pittorium,"Formulaic, sophomoric schlock",2,26 February 2016,"This must have made its money by attracting those teenagers who will laugh at any lewd , low-brow ,simplistic romp. Some reviews have been given the ""spoiler alert"" warning. I can't see why. This trash is completely predictable. I rated it a two instead of one because Tilda Swinton is worth watching; oh, and Lebron James does have some acting ability. The remaining characters, generally,are unlikeable. The script seems geared to appeal to adolescents, but with added vulgarities and obscenities that,I guess, are supposed to make it appear ""hip"" and urbane. I resisted seeing this movie because I truly felt it would be kind of silly. I gave in to a friend who really wanted to rent it, but the movie didn't even meet my already poor expectations.",Trainwreck
406,jfarnsy-35574,Hilarious and heartwarming - I loved this movie,10,4 January 2016,"I was seriously blown away in reading one extremely negative review after another on this site. The reviews were so one-sided in their trashing of this movie that it seemed really strange. I just saw Trainwreck and loved it.Amy Schumer is so talented. I had no idea she had range beyond stand up but in the scene at the funeral, she had me in tears. More importantly, I laughed more than I've laughed in a long time.I really liked the dynamic between her father, her sister and her.I thought Bill Hader was awesome and someone who I'd watch again in movies.It was a really enjoyable, happy and entertaining movie with great acting and lots of laughs and warmth.",Trainwreck
407,jdeskins,just not that funny,3,23 January 2016,"I decided to watch this because ""somebody"" said it was really funny (I wish I could remember who now so I could tell them it's not) Anyway, not super familiar with Amy Schumer. I'm sure her fans think this movie is funny. If I had read the reviews first I never would have watched it. It was slow and I just kept waiting for it to be funny. It's raunchy, juvenile and sophomoric and there is nothing new here. That being said, I usually like raunchy, juvenile humor but this just isn't funny. The movie dragged on and I found myself wanting it to end. Granted, there were a a few funny scenes, but just funny enough to barely get a chuckle out of me. Maybe I'm just old but a drunk, pot-smoking 30 something girl who sleeps with every guy she meets just isn't that funny. Again, the millennials probably think this was hilarious. The main character isn't likable, until maybe the last scene of the movie. She's narcissistic, relationally challenged and shallow. How that character could get so many guys is beyond me. The movie felt like a comedy sketch that was stretched out and made into a feature movie.",Trainwreck
408,arkofidis,Terrible movie,1,16 April 2016,"I do not understand why people like this movie. The only funny part was her description of the tampon, other comedic elements were just recycled and poorly acted bits from her show or stand-up. LeBron being a big vagina became tedious very quickly.And the worst part is, at the end of the day, there are no redeeming qualities in any of the characters. Schumer's character is a horrible, vapid creature that does not deserve happiness. All her protestations in towards the end of the film about why is he with her were absolutely correct. The little flashback at the beginning of the movie where her father ""traumatizes"" her for life are not a valid excuse. There are thousands of girls like her, and they are all worthless.",Trainwreck
409,Jay_Murphy33,I'm confused by how much hate this movie got on these user reviews,8,16 September 2016,"I have never watched anything by Amy Schemer. I have never seen her stand up or anything. But, this movie was solid. People keep calling it predictable. I don't really understand why people would be rating a comedy by its predictability. If you want something unpredictable, go watch the Shamalan guy movies. This is a comedy. It's supposed to make you laugh. It's not supposed to be like f****** LOST. Jeez. I'd even give this movie a couple bonus points because, not only is it pretty funny, it has a decent message. I just continue to be confused by the general publics' reactions to things. I have to write one more line even though I don't have anything else to say. Actually, I will say one more thing. I'm a little shocked/impressed with lebrun and cena's cameos. they were pretty good",Trainwreck

412,rachael-85288,absolute waste of time,3,17 January 2017,"This film was the most unimaginative cliché rubbish that i could barely stand to watch. Was bored from start to the point where i had to stop watching because it was so predictable, complete misrepresentation of what monogamy means and what it means to not be monogamous. This film essentially creates the impression that people who don't conform to monogamy are slags, which isn't necessarily true. Sloppy and cliché, would not recommend and was a complete waste of time to watch, the plot was confusing to follow and too much going on to actually get to the point of the film, which in turn was equally as awful as it did not realistically reflect real life at all. I fail to comprehend how this film could be seen as funny, when it was dryer than the Sahara.",Trainwreck
413,elineep-33629,so incredibly boring and overall bad,1,1 April 2017,"Didn't even finnish it, because it was so lame - acting was bad, the story was to predictable, seen it all before, just an overall bad movie. Only funny very few places, but the jokes are super unintelligent, and lame, which in my opinion makes them not funny what so ever. The plot is just a rip-off of every rom-com ever made. So if you are looking for wasting your time with something worthless, this is the movie.",Trainwreck
414,SalKott,I really like Amy Schumer...but I DO NOT like this movie,1,25 March 2016,"I don't have a lot of coherent thoughts about this movie.It was long (so long), it doesn't have real characters, it has no structure, no real script, it's not funny. It's tremendously unlikable.Bill Hader's still cool, even though he's playing an ultra generic character. Tilda Swinton is always great. Lebron James was the funniest person in the movie, but the bar is very low.Amy is fine in it too, but she's playing the ugliest (on the inside, not the outside) version of herself, times ten. Just a disgusting character that leaves you with nothing to root for.Judd Apatow has fallen off.",Trainwreck

Despite her unpretty appearance she has a lot of guys to sleep with and a boyfriend to cheat. Seriously? What does this film want to say? It is OK to be a hooker? Maybe this movie could be better if there were gags like in ""Hangover"" or something. But ""Trainwreck"" is not funny at all, it look s like another Amy Schumer's standup - vulgar, low-grade, immoral. The worst is the propaganda in favour of bad habits and uncontrolled sexual behavior.",Trainwreck

Amy's character seems and LOOKS like a normal person. I am so sick of pretending Kate Hudson could ever have a problem with guys. but Amy being a bit of a mess? I believe it! Way better than I FEEL PRETTY. If you like Amy's show, definitely check this out.",Trainwreck
