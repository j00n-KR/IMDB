0,MartinHafer,It's like bits and pieces from three famous sci-fi novels....plus a whole lotta ultra-violence.,7,5 September 2016,"Imagine what it would be like if you took the stories ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Brave New World"" and merged them with a whole lotta violence...the result would be ""Equilibrium"". From ""1984"" it has the totalitarian government, the man who THINKS he's free and the notion of thought police. From ""Fahrenheit 451"" you have firemen whose job it is to burn books. And, from ""Brave New World"" you have a society that is drugged in order to make them more manageable and emotionally stupid. Put them together with TONS of intense martial arts and gun violence, then you kind of have the idea. Christian Bale is a cleric--a man very well-versed in martial arts and killing with guns, swords or his bare hands. His job is simple...enforce the rules of society that no one feels anything and are kept in a perpetual state of nothingness. This means destroying art, books and people....and we are talking about a LOT of people! Inexplicably, after being a top cleric and going his job perfectly, he misses a dose of the emotion-numbing medication and slowly he begins to question...something punishable by death if he is discovered. What's go come of all this? Understand that it will involve TONS of violence...very, very graphic violence.This film is one that many people won't like. The violence is extreme but a bigger problem (and the reason my wife disliked the film and gave up on it) was how incredibly sterile and non-emotional the film was...at least through the first 2/3. That was a bit annoying but not a deal breaker for me. What I didn't like was the violence, as after a while it actually became boring. Additionally, while the combination of story elements was unusual, in and of themselves they were not. Decent...but certainly NOT for everyone.",Equilibrium
1,Leofwine_draca,Criminally underrated dystopian effort,9,7 July 2016,"A strong film with plenty to recommend it, EQUILIBRIUM was released to the noise of ""not another MATRIX rip-off"" and similar sentiments. This instant decision is a little unfair, because – although obviously inspired by the Keanu Reeves blockbuster in places – EQUILIBRIUM is a decent and intelligent science fiction thriller with a pleasing change of pace. Once again we're in an Orwellian style future of grab greys and mundane apartment-block buildings, where emotion is suppressed and evil henchmen in motorbike helmets go around shooting little dogs. In this world we meet Christian Bale, a martial arts superhero who goes around murdering all those emotional and artistic folks.Sure, it's an old story, but it works well here. CGI cityscapes aside, there are no fancy special effects robots or monsters; instead the basis is on good old-fashioned characters, and with a supporting cast that includes Sean Pertwee, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, and Emily Watson; you can't go wrong. Much of the story is predictable and there are a couple of sappy moments, but for the most part this is suspenseful, exciting stuff. A handful of violent, ultra-stylish action sequences (displaying originality, even in this day and age) add to the impact and help make the underlying dreariness rather enjoyable. Very entertaining viewing that deserves to be given a chance. A lot of this works thanks to Bale; once again, he's excellent in the part. I'd go so far as to say that this is actually better than THE MATRIX; whereas that film was all action, this one makes you think in a moral sense, and the action supports the story – rather than the action being the story.",Equilibrium
2,SnoopyStyle,good dystopian concepts,6,8 January 2015,"In the 21st century, there was a massive world war. The Grammaton Clerics were created trained with martial art of gun kata to eliminate war by suppressing feelings. They are tasked to destroy art, literature, music and supporters of the old ways. John Preston (Christian Bale) and Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) destroy a stash of art and a band of rebels in the Nether region. They return to the city state Libria where citizens take daily injections of Prozium to suppress feelings. Vice-Counsel DuPont (Angus Macfadyen) is their superior. Preston is forced to kill Partridge finding him reading a book of poetry. Preston's wife had been executed for Sense Offence. He is given a new partner Brandt (Taye Diggs). He accidentally breaks his dose of Prozium. He arrests Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson) but he starts to regain his feelings. He destroys his Prozium allotment.The ideas are worthy of the various young adult dystopian franchises that is prevalent today. They would have the lead be a young girl training to be a cleric. There are some fun concepts being thrown around. The design could do with more CG work. The action is Matrix inspired but at a lesser level. This feels like an interesting sci-fi idea but is not quite executed well enough.",Equilibrium
3,claudio_carvalho,A Great Collection of Story lines,8,17 October 2004,"In the future, after the Third World War, the world is ruled by a totalitarian and fascist society with the leadership of 'The Father'. Arts, music, books, luxury and feelings are not acceptable, and persons uses a drug called 'Prozium' in a daily basis to repress their feelings and feel happy. The opponents to this new world are called offenders and they form the underground resistance to the system, who are destroyed by very-well trained and powerful agents called 'The Clericks'. John Preston (Christian Bale) is one of this agents, and his life changes when he misses his daily dose of 'Prozium'. 'Equilibrium' is a great sci-fi film. The writer used the same formula used by Quentin Tarantino', blending many story lines to write this tale. He used George Orwell's '1984' and 'Animal Farm'; Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451'; 'Logan's Run'; 'THX-1138'; 'Matrix' and Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World'. Christian Bale has another great performance and although having a commercial ending, I liked this movie. The conclusion of the story would be better off with a dark end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Equilibrium'",Equilibrium
4,gavin6942,Somehow Off,6,30 October 2017,"In a fascist future where all forms of feeling are illegal, a man in charge of enforcing the law rises to overthrow the system.Most of the filming used locations in Berlin, due to its unique mixture of fascist and modern architecture. According to the visual effects supervisor Tim McGovern, who worked alongside Kurt Wimmer, the fascist architecture was chosen ""to make the individual feel small and insignificant so the government seems more powerful"".I think the architecture and everything is spot on, but something still seems off. The film's aesthetic is alright, sort of like a fascist ""Dark City"", but the message remains unclear. What are they considering a ""feeling""? People still obviously get angry here...",Equilibrium
5,jboothmillard,Equilibrium,5,14 September 2009,"It had a good leading actor, it had an interesting sounding futuristic theme, and it had a title I had no idea of the meaning of, so I just tried it. Basically in the future, after World War III, the world has fallen under the control of Father (Sean Pertwee) and the Tetragrammaton, the government that outlaws all art and emotion from humanity, by forcing them to take/inject a developed drug called ""Prozium"". They also have a a law of ""Sense Offenders"", who eliminate the people who do not obey this rule. Cleric (an elite soldier) John Preston (Christian Bale) is known as the best in his field, and after missing an injection, he begins to feel again, e.g. love for a dog, and sympathy for the people offending the law. With his new (or one again) found beauty of feeling, he is determined to change the world that people live in, and eradicate this law. Also starring Emily Watson as Mary O'Brien, Taye Diggs as Brandt, Angus Macfadyen as Dupont, Sean Bean as Partridge, Matthew Harbour as Robbie Preston, William Fichtner as Jurgen, Dominic Purcell as Seamus and David Hemmings as Proctor. The story is quite an intriguing, Bale and the supporting cast are good, and the fight, chase shoot-up sequences may be similar to The Matrix, but they are good to watch, so it is a pretty good action thriller. Worth watching!",Equilibrium
6,Tweekums,Decent dystopian thriller,8,31 May 2011,"When I sat down to watch this I expected to see a sci-fi action thriller; while it does feature plenty of action and there are science fiction elements one shouldn't expect lots of cool futuristic vehicles at weapons. Equilibrium is set in the near future after a third world war; in order to prevent future war a drug has been developed to suppress all human emotion. This has not led to a Utopia however; this future is very much a dystopia; anybody who is suspected of committing 'sense crimes' is executed without trial; this summary justice is carried out by 'clerics' such a John Preston; a man so devoid of emotion that he executed his own partner and barely batted an eyelid when his wife was taken to be incinerated. That is until one day he fails to take the emotion-suppressing drug. As time passes his feelings get deeper and he realises that he must fight against the system; a fight that could mean sacrificing innocent people to get close to Father; the leader of this emotionless world.This was rather better than I had expected; the dystopian world was genuinely chilling, it became clear that anybody could die when John Preston's partner was killed early on; as he was played by Sean Bean I was sure he'd be a major character. Christian Bale put in a fine performance as Preston and Emily Watson was fine as Mary; a woman he arrests. If there was a major flaw it was the ending; I prefer my dystopian dramas to be a bit more downbeat. Instead of such an ending Preston goes on a rampage skilfully slaughtering dozens of police before confronting his Nemesis. While the action was spectacular and well choreographed it was a bit too stylish. Still it was a decent film overall and I'd recommend checking it out.",Equilibrium

8,Quinoa1984,Slick re-tooling of Fahrenheit 451,7,1 May 2001,"While this film may be under writer/director Kurt Wimmer's credit, this work owes more than a little credit to the Bradbury classic, because this film has a lot in common while also not having much in common.Christian Bale, just fantastic as always (he gave the 2nd best performance last year for American Psycho), plays a cop type of guy in a zombified nation where the satirical points in 451 are expressed as thought is forbidden and controlled and anyone else who goes against it is killed. He follows orders as always, until he meets a woman, played by Emily Watson, who in a way changes his thinking and with that starts to grow emotion.Sounds like possibly a cheap rip off, but the film does cool touches in the story and structure to make it nice and as Bale goes through his change, we are sucked in.  But in case some might loose they're attention from this, the film has awesomely packed action sequences involving guns, swords, etc. Only thing that could use some touching up is the visual effects, but still worth seeing.

9,sunwarrior13,An Under-appreciated Science Fiction Film,9,29 March 2013,"Equilibrium is a dystopian science fiction action film follows that John Preston, a warrior-priest and enforcement officer in a future dystopia where both feelings and artistic expression are outlawed and citizens take daily injections of drugs to suppress their emotions. After accidentally missing a dose, Preston begins to experience emotions that make him question his own morality and moderate his actions, while attempting to remain undetected by the suspicious society in which he lives. Ultimately, he aids a resistance movement using advanced martial arts, which he was taught serving the very regime he is to help overthrow. It stars Christian Bale, Emily Watson and Taye Diggs. It is written and directed by Kurt Wimmer.A man who dares to feel finds his life in danger in this cautionary science fiction drama. In the future, after a Third World War has decimated much of the Earth's population, a new nation known as Libria rises up under the unquestioned leadership of Dupont. Believing human emotions and their expression were to blame for the failings of past societies, The Father has decreed that all citizens must take a daily dose of Prozia II, a drug which levels out the emotional landscape, and that all forms of creative expression are against the law; violating either regulation can be punished by death. John Preston is a Grammaton, an elite law enforcement officer who tracks down and punishes ""sense offenders."" One day, Preston accidentally fails to take his Prozia II, and for the first time begins experiencing emotions himself. Preston becomes aware of an underground of rebels who refuse to take their medication and have embraced art and literature, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with one of their number, Mary O'Brian.This inventive, low-budget science-fiction movie stands on its own, from its bracing, ingenious fight sequences to its literate roots in dystopian fiction. You'd probably be pleasantly surprised by this under appreciated movie despite the fact that this is a reheated mishmash of other sci-fi movies. Overall, it is a homage to the classic science fiction touchstones and damn solid in its own right.",Equilibrium
10,hitchcockthelegend,Mankind united with infinitely greater purpose in pursuit of war than he ever did in pursuit of peace.,8,4 September 2010,"Equilibrium is written and directed by Kurt Wimmer and stars Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and Angus Macfadyen. Bale plays John Preston, an enforcement Cleric in Libria, a dystopian future where forms of emotional expression are deemed illegal. All citizens of Libria are required to inject drugs (known as Prozium) to suppress emotions. However, Preston misses one of his doses and starts to become emotionally conflicted about the world he now lives in.Welcome to a dystopian world where art is banned, music destroyed and basic emotions illegal. A world where Christian Bale looks cool in long black coats and ""Gun-Kata"" martial artistry is the order of the day. It's impossible to write a review for Equilibrium without mentioning the film it so dearly wants to be, ""The Matrix"". That it's not nearly as good as that film in terms of story and action is no reason to do it down. What is not in doubt is that the story here is indeed weak, very much so - in fact it appears that Wimmer has merely cribbed elements from notable moments of sci-fi morality works before it - and then cloaked it in a whirling big bang montage of attention grabbing set pieces. But honestly, those set pieces are alone worth spending time with this movie for.It's standard sci-fi shenanigans for the most part. We have the ruling body of the country, all very fascist and with a badge that looks unsurprisingly Swastika like. A cop character finding a conscience and turning into a rebel on the loose. The underground resistance. And of course the twist ending as the reveal, and plot strands, come together for one final (brilliant) bout of carnage. So yes, it's rammed full of clichés. But it is exciting energised fun. Stylish fun, in fact. Even if at the core it's awash with unimaginative writing. Brain checked at the door for this one then, enjoy. 8/10",Equilibrium
11,Theo Robertson,Familiar Plot Let Down By The Emphasis On Action,6,14 September 2008,"Usually a film as unoriginal and derivative as this would deserve great scorn . We see such unlikely bedfellows such as BLAKES 7 , FARENHEIT 451 , 1984 and THE MATRIX all rolled in to one , but for some incredible reason that is difficult to pin down EQUILBRUIM succeeds in working . It's not a massive success and you can understand why it didn't do anything at the American box office since it has a very European look and feel which director Kurt Wimmer deserves some congratulations for Where the film does fall down is when it tries to pander to a prospective American teen audience with its MATRIX inspired shoot outs which are very silly . If you do enough martial arts you'll be able to dodge an avalanche of bullets ? Hardly credible and is even more unconvincing in the time frame which has literally dozens of bad guys blown away . Think about it ? How long does it take an armed bad guy cock and point his weapon at someone ? two seconds ? Three seconds ? For some reason it takes countless seconds for nameless extras to point a gun at Christian Bale's hero . You also feel screenwriter Wimmer should have spent more time coming up with a subtext and more effective ending . I enjoyed the back story of a society not allowed to feel emotion on pain of death but this should have been explored far more than it is on screen Wimmer has cast very well with a largely British cast but if you feel you've been cheated by well known names I'd agree with you . Sean Bean only has something like three scenes , Watson in the region of four while Sean Pertwee doesn't actually appear in the flesh . Once famous actor David Hemmings makes an appearance which is quite literally blink and you'll miss it . At the end of the day I guess the producers probably knew EQUILIBRUIM would find its market on video/DVD rather than the cinema therefore didn't hype up the casting too much",Equilibrium
12,Hey_Sweden,"Not bad, if overly familiar.",6,12 April 2020,"Writer / director Kurt Wimmer attempts here a story along the lines of ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", and ""Fahrenheit 451"". It's set in a ""future"" Earth after WWIII has come and gone. Now, governments are determined to outlaw emotion, since they've determined that that is what causes wars in the first place. A new law agency known as ""Grammaton Clerics"" enforces this idea upon citizens, some of whom naturally don't want to get with the program. A top Cleric named Preston (Christian Bale), who previously had always kept a stiff upper lip, starts to experience significant changes. You see, he misses a scheduled injection of a drug that helps to suppress human emotion.While there is nothing particularly innovative or interesting here, Wimmer walks an amusing line between more provocative ideas and a straightforward, yet over the top, succession of action set pieces wherein a character like Preston can wipe out scores of antagonists without getting shot once himself. The film is stylized to a hilarious extreme, and yet it does show off an effective Dystopian look, thanks to production designer Wolf Kroeger and cinematographer Dion Beebe. It's quite a hoot overall, maintaining enough viewer interest to keep it watchable (even as it's not all that believable). It's accompanied by a thunderous soundtrack composed by Klaus Badelt.Some of the actors pull off acting like automatons better than others. Bale, as usual, is effectively intense. Taye Diggs plays a colleague who becomes something of a nemesis: his new partner, who is himself determined to become top enforcer in the city. Although a handsome and personable guy, Diggs tends to show too much emotion when he's not supposed to. Angus MacFadyen is a tight-lipped superior officer, Sean Pertwee is the enigmatic leader ""Father"", Matthew Harbour plays Prestons' son, William Fichtner is the leader of a resistance movement, and the lovely Emily Watson is a rebel who challenges Prestons' way of thinking. Dominic Purcell and veteran actor David Hemmings appear very briefly.The picture is best if taken purely as a genre piece. It has its moments, but is none too memorable in the end.Six out of 10.",Equilibrium
13,poolandrews,Has it's moments & is an OK Sci-Fi action thriller.,5,15 September 2008,"Equilibrium is set in the 21st Century where after World War III the state of Libira has been formed by it's founder Father (Sean Pertwee), there all emotion has been declared illegal & the population have their emotions blocked with a drug named Prozium. All artwork, culture & feeling is banned & punishable by instant execution by the hard as nails police force The Tetragrammaton Clerics. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a top level cleric who is so hard as nails he stood by while his wife & the mother of his young son was convicted of a 'sense offence' & cremated alive. However John accidentally misses one of his Prozium doses & the human emotion & feeling starts to come back to him, he quickly realises that the society which he works for is wrong & corrupt & humans have the right to feel. John teams up with a gang of underground rebels to bring Father & his emotionless society down...Written & directed by Kurt Wimmer I must admit that I am in two minds over Equilibrium, on the one hand it's quite an engaging Sci-Fi thriller that does occasionally strike a chord & makes you think but on the other hand the whole concept is so poorly thought out & impossible to buy into that I spent the whole film asking questions that were never answered. The idea of a future enclosed society in which a Fascist Government or regime tries to exert total control over it's population & one lone inside rebel sets out to do something about it has been done before in various Sci-Fi films & books like THX 1138 (1971), Demolition Man (1993) & George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eigthy Four (1949) along with ripping-off other Sci-Fi flicks like the empathy test from Blade Runner (1982) & of course The Matrix (1999) inspired action scenes in which the frankly silly sounding concept of someone being able to mathematically work out where someone will fire bullets & therefore avoid them (named 'Gun Kata') is used. In fact there are a lot of clichés in Equilibrium & the basic concept is flawed since Libira seems to be one city but what about the rest of the world? Would they not still have emotion? Who would join such a society anyway? The basic idea that all emotion is suppressed is just hard to swallow as well, it just wouldn't work under the ultra strict conditions in Equilibrium. Having said that if you can get past the shaky concept & writing then the character's are alright, the story moves along & there's some decent action scenes & ideas but the basic concept which I don't think works at all is it's biggest flaw.The action scenes do look like they have come straight out of The Matrix & in fact are inferior, there's certainly not a lot of action so don't expect fights & shoot-outs every few minutes. The depiction of the future is reasonable, it's not that different than it is now apart from the basic morals of the society, the actual technology doesn't seem to advanced as people still drive around in cars & live in apartment blocks. As you would expect from a film set in an emotionless society the production design is deliberately bland yet stylish, people wear blacks & greys, apartments are bare with no colour or carpets or wallpaper & even everyone looks the same.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this was actually fairly low budget & that probably accounts for a not too spectacular vision of the future. Filmed in Germany & Italy before some re-shoots in Canada. The acting is alright although Sean Bean has nothing more than a three minute cameo despite near top billing in the credits.Equilibrium is a film that within itself works quite well & is entertaining enough but for a Sci-Fi film that takes itself extremely seriously the plot & concepts therein don't stand up at all. I liked & disliked it in equal measure.",Equilibrium
14,lastliberal,"You clean, we'll sweep.",8,7 July 2007,"Before Kurt Wimmer gave us Ultraviolet, he wrote and directed this film, which is just a whole lot more exciting that The Matrix, to which it gets compared.In order to prevent war, emotions are outlawed, which means no books, no art, no pets, no movies, you get the point. Everone takes a daily injection of some serum to stay emotionless - kinda like those millions who take their Prozac every day to stay even.Christian Bale did this one right before The Machinist and Batman Begins. He is the top enforcer of the law against art and hunts down the rebel forces. He is a master with a sword, and can definitely out shoot whatshisname- Reeves or something.Taye Diggs (House on Haunted Hill, Rent) works with Bale and is constantly trying to trip him up and take over the top spot. Just when he thinks he has him, he manages to lose face.Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) also has a great part in this film, as does Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings).The action is waaay better than the Matrix.",Equilibrium
15,zardoz-13,Above Average But Formulaic Futuristic Thriller,7,3 July 2011,"""One Tough Bastard"" writer and director Kurt Wimmer has fashioned a predictable but entertaining futuristic thriller influenced more by ""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" and ""Gattica"" than ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Indeed, the garb our government-sanctioned protagonist wears resembles the wardrobe that Keanu Reeves and company sported in ""The Matrix."" The bad guys cavort about in black apparel, but they cruise the streets in white Cadillacs. Furthermore, they are waging a war against an anti-government fraction. The action takes place in real-life rather than cyberspace. Were it not for the believable performances that Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Sean Pertwee, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs, and Angus MacFadyen deliver and Wimmer's orchestrated gunfights, ""Equilibrium"" would amount to little more than derivative drivel. Little happens here that you haven't seen before, but Wimmer keeps the action moving at full tilt and our hero realizes that he is on the wrong side after having believed everything that was fed him by the government. The ""Wizard of Oz"" finale when our hero discovers the truth about the charades played out to fool a society lacks the impact that the filmmakers must have imagined in their own deluded way. Similarly, the idea that the government would interfere to the incredible extent that it does in ""Equilibrium"" in an effort to curb humankind's sadomasochistic urges is something difficult to digest, but Wimmer distracts us with those terrifically staged gunfights and a tactical method of fighting them called 'gunkata' as he would later do in another bullet-riddled epic ""Ultraviolent."" In fact, ""Ultraviolet"" owes more to ""The Matrix"" than ""Equilibrium."" A prologue establishes the situation: ""In the first years of the 21st century, a third world war broke out. Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive the fourth, that our volatile natures could simply no longer be risked. So we have created a new arm of the law: the Grammaton Cleric whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of Man's Inhumanity to Man: his ability to feel."" After World War III ends, the fascist state of Libria assumes power and concludes human emotions forged the devastation of mankind. This society rules with the iron fist of a totalitarian and outlaws anything like art, literature, and music that might arouse the senses of a person. Everybody in the society is required to administer a narcotic called Prozium designed to repress emotions. They carry about a small device that comes with ampules of a urine-colored fluid that they inject into their neck. The fascist types that run this society command a Gestapo-like police force of clerics who tote around automatic pistols up their sleeves and search for an underground movement in a place called 'the Nethers' that still treasures free expression.Grammaton Cleric First Class John Preston (Christian Bale of ""Batman Begins"") serves as a highly-trained enforcer in black. He can enter a room with a dozen or more gunmen blasting away at him and survive because he knows how to dodge bullets. This martial arts-like ability to defy death is called 'gunkata' and he is the best cleric. Preston supervises armed S.W.A.T. teams as they search and destroy renegades. These outlaws indulge their senses with art, literature, and music. The Tetragrammaton Council assigns a rating of EC-10 to all these forbidden materials. One day, Preston's partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean of ""GoldenEye"") confiscates a book of William Butler Yeats poetry on the pretext he will turn it into the authorities. He explains to Preston that he thought the teams sent in to confiscate such items might overlook it. Nevertheless, Partridge has no intention of surrendering it to the authorities. Preston arrests him. Partridge resists Preston, and our protagonist perforates him with a bullet that penetrates the book. It doesn't take long for Preston to have doubts about the government. Similarly, a high-ranking government official,Dupont (Angus MacFayden of ""Braveheart""), suspects that all is not right with Preston. Apparently, Preston possesses a new partner Brandt (Taye Diggs of ""Chicago"")who is assigned to Preston because he wants a promotion. Preston relives the nightmare when his wife, Lisa Preston, was arrested for being a sense offender. As the film unfolds, Preston gets in touch with his emotions and finds the leader of the underground. They recruit him to kill the head of Libria, a man called 'Father' (Sean Pertwee) whose face is televised to everybody by zeppelins and exhorts them to follow the rules.""Equilibrium"" isn't bad, but it is nothing exceptional. Christian Bale lacks charisma, but his character garners our sympathy. One of the most suspenseful scenes involves the discovery of a puppy in the trunk of the car that Preston is driving through the Nethers.",Equilibrium
16,Boba_Fett1138,I agree with the critics on this one.,5,1 August 2005,"For some odd reason IMDb is the only place were this movie is being praised. In most countries this movie didn't even got a theatrical release or was only shown in a very limited amount of theaters and only for a short period. There is a very good reason for this for ""Equilibrium"" simply is not a good movie. It really is nothing more than an average B-science-fiction movie and on top of that it's terrible unoriginal. Especially when you've seen movies like ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""THX 1138"", ""1984"", ""Metropolis"", ""Blade Runner""...must I really go on? Basically there is no movie in the science-fiction genre were this movie didn't 'borrowed' heavily from.The concept itself of the movie isn't that terrible and the movie starts of quite promising but the movie never really becomes interesting after that point and the story gets predictable and doesn't always flow well. It's obvious that director Kurt Wimmer still has some learning to do when it comes to storytelling.Yes the movie does deserve praise for its visual look. It's obvious that the movie didn't had a terribly high budget and I must see that they handled this well and made the best out of it.The fight scene's are fairly good but simply too much over-the-top to find it really entertaining or believable. Also the ending disappoints heavily and overall the movie leaves a bad aftertaste.Christian Bale on the other hand is simply cool and wonderful in his role and he portrays a good main character/hero. Sean Bean also has a quite good role but don't be fooled people, his role is very limited, the same goes for William Fichtner.Quite frankly I don't see what this movie has got to distinct itself from other B-science-fiction movies. It has a unlikely and silly handled story that never flows really well and the action leaves a pointless impression. Yes not a lot of people are going to agree with me on this but in my opinion the critics were absolutely right this time. You're way better of watching a real science-fiction classic and masterpiece such as the movies I mentioned earlier above. This movie isn't even good or entertaining as a science-fiction action movie. In my humble opinion this movie is only still watchable thanks to Christian Bale.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Equilibrium
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Incredibly slick, and plenty of substance",8,13 September 2010,"After a Third World War, it is decided that feeling and expression must be outlawed. It is made punishable by death, and any material deemed to lead to such indulgence is tracked down and torched. To hold it down, everyone routinely uses a drug to suppress it, called Prozium(""our opiate of the masses""). A new force is created to uphold this rule, the Tetragrammaton Clerics. The best of them, John Preston, suddenly realizes that his partner has become one of the so-called sense offenders. He promptly executes him, only to soon after find himself in the same situation. The future presented is as sedated as its citizens, with sterile rooms and architecture. Costumes are stunning. There are clever touches to the great designs, such as the symbol of the dictatorship being a T(similar to a cross, since Christianity has sought to deny its followers the satisfying of actual human needs for many years... some say since Luther started Protestantism) that has a version that is of four T's, resembling a Swastika. This isn't the only allusion to organized religion. The main theme is of emotion and individuality against self-discipline and conformity, chaos against control. It has impeccable observations, including that once you begin going down the path of totalitarianism, it only gets increasingly worse, more rights and freedom are lost, the power becomes completely consolidated. The visuals are breathtaking. This has astonishing, awesome, stylized action, and among the best I've ever seen. In addition to shooting, there is martial arts that uses the bad-ass guns as part of the fighting(called Gun-Kata, and it is explained well; it's taught as statistically figuring where to be and where to fire to maximize accuracy, damage and dodging). It is unbelievably fast and intense without you losing track of what's going on. While it isn't entirely smooth, as that of Ultraviolet(with that said, that one isn't as overly twisty near the end), it is overall better here(don't get me wrong, both are utterly unique, showing you things you have never seen anywhere else), because there isn't as much of it(let's be honest, there is little in the way of danger for the lead of either, they always win... that can't last forever and still keep your attention). No two sequences of it are alike. This has amazing editing and cinematography, with creative use of light and shadows. The build-up is well-done, and this is gripping from start to finish. There is not a second where your eyes aren't glued to the screen. The score is effective and fitting, with instrumental and techno. There are a few scenes that aren't stellar, on account of false tension, plot holes and unnecessary developments. This has been called ""The Matrix meets 1984"", and to an extent, that is accurate. I suppose I understand why there are those that suggest that this is heavy-handed(I'd say it's quite subtle when you stop to think about it); still, I would go so far as to call this beautiful, and it may very well make you cry. The acting is marvelous, and that goes for the children as well(it ain't easy not showing your being affected). Bale has a less bad ""tough voice"" here than his Batman. No, not every idea in this is original; there are concepts from Fahrenheit 451, George Orwell(as I mentioned before; for example, there is an instance of Newspeak in this) and THX 1138. However, this does different things with them, and this is not something that should be allowed to be forgotten. There is plenty of mild violence and disturbing content, as well as a little blood, brutality and moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with two interesting, informative and funny commentary tracks, with writer/director Kurt Wimmer, and in one of them, he's joined by producer Lucas Foster, a featurette(entitled Finding Equilibrium; I will review it on its own page here on the site), 5 TV spots and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine they'd enjoy this. 8/10",Equilibrium
18,view_and_review,A Hidden Gem,8,21 June 2008,"This movie is definitely a hidden gem. This is honestly the best movie I've seen in some time. I'm not a fan of Christian Bale but I admired him in this movie. The story was excellent, it actually reminded me of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with respects to emotions being man's weakness, and even though this preceded ""V for Vendetta"" that also came to mind.The action absolutely deserves mention. The action in this movie was different than anything I've seen before. The clerics, or whatever they were called, mastered gun use and made it almost artistic. Their coordinated shooting along with their elusive movements made them optimal killing vessels. They made killing beautiful.This movie made me think about what could occur in the future and it brought forth conversation. This movie is not incredibly unique, it really is a ""fight the power/the people v. the government"" type movie which you can see in other movies or books (e.g. 1984, The Matrix, Logan's Run, et al). Equilibrium puts its own unique spin on the premise of the ""government knows best"" and it works remarkably.",Equilibrium
19,Uriah43,Some Good Action Sequences but a Bit Predictable,5,11 July 2015,"After a nuclear war has caused widespread destruction those who survive rebuild and institute a tyrannical form of government which subsequently bans all emotion of any kind. Drugs are used assist in that regard. Likewise, deadly enforcers known as ""clerics"" are given authority to kill all those who display the slightest amount of joy or sorrow. As a consequence of these draconian measures an underground group has arisen which seeks to restore the old ways. To combat this radical organization a leading cleric named ""John Preston"" (Christian Bale) is ordered to infiltrate the group and either expose or eliminate those in charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a satisfactory film which contained some good action sequences but ended up being a bit predictable. Although not necessarily a blockbuster film it's certainly worth a watch for those who enjoy movies of this nature. Accordingly, I rate it as about average.",Equilibrium
20,zetes,People seriously think this is a good movie?,7,24 January 2010,"One of the most ridiculous sci-fi flicks in recent memory. I have to admit, I pretty much enjoyed it as a so-bad-it's-good sort of thing. I was absolutely shocked to come to IMDb to find it had a 7.8 rating! Presumably, I'm the only one who liked it ironically. Hey, I can't lie. Ironically or not, I enjoyed it. Christian Bale stars as a supercop in a post-WWIII utopian society that is pretty much run by Nazis. Even their symbol is like a simplified swastika. After the last big war, emotion was outlawed. People take a drug, cleverly called Prozium, that keeps them level-headed. If they do not, the police arrest them for ""sense offenses"". Art is outlawed, and Bale and his fellow police officers have to flame throw the Mona Lisa to prevent WWIV (Huh? When is the last time someone started a war over a painting or poem?). I watched this movie with my mouth open, unable to believe that this wasn't a parody of utopian sci-fi. But no, it moves on, uber-serious. The best part was Bale's abilities as gun ninja, practicing a martial art that's based on shooting at where enemies will statistically be while standing in the same spot, dodging areas where enemy bullets will statistically be. In one scene he decides not to use bullets but instead uses his ninja abilities to pistol whip half a dozen fellow cops. Bale is perfect as the emotionless, robotic protagonist - a little less perfect when he's actually supposed to show emotion after he stops taking Prozium. I giggled at this movie relentlessly. I particularly loved the sequence where Bale kills about a dozen guys with a sword while wearing a white suit and doesn't get a drop of blood on it. The one thing I can't laugh at is the production design. It is truly marvelous. Director Kurt Wimmer went on to direct the even more ludicrous Ultravilot.",Equilibrium

A future that we rather wouldn't like to be a part of, that's exactly how I see the future anyway. It's a good story, maybe not very plausable to happen, but as entertainment it works. It's in the genre of The Matrix, same concept, a future nobody wants. Good acting from the whole cast, Christian Bale was perfect as the main character. Don't expect futuristic looking gadgets and stuff like that, just a solid story with high entertainment value. Definitely worth watching if you like this genre.",Equilibrium
22,Mr-Fusion,Oft-told story with killer gunplay,7,11 March 2012,"Kurt Wimmer's ""Equilibrium"" sets us in a post-WWIII dystopia, where emotion has been outlawed for fear that man's animalistic tendencies will lead to a war man simply cannot survive. Human feelings are severely repressed through regular intervals of Prozium, while anything that will yield an emotional response (books, music, art) is set ablaze. The rules and conventions of society are dictated by a priestly gentleman (appropriately named, ""Father""), while the laws are enforced by both a jockbooted military, and an elite group of pistol-wielding martial artists named ""clerics"" - trenchcoated men who are rigidly disciplined in the art of ""gun kata"", a study that turns gunfights into geometrically calculable skirmishes.Christian Bale stars as John Preston, cleric numero uno who is tasked with uncovering and apprehending the leaders of the Resistance. Due to an unforeseen accident, Preston goes without one of his Prozium intervals and starts to empathize with his victims. Empathy turns to solidarity, and Preston finds himself at odds with the very laws he has sworn to uphold.Cynically speaking, ""Equilibrium"" is a work of science fiction that's derivative of past staples of literature. Take the central themes of ""Fahrenheit 451"", sprinkle in some ""1984"", throw in some ""Brave New World"" and a generous helping of John Woo-esque fight scenes, and you've got ""Equilibrium"". But the brooding uncertainty of Bale's performance as the dead-inside enforcer suddenly coming to grips with human feelings keeps things interesting. Will he be caught? If so, can he succeed in bringing down the oppressive government? Of particular note is Emily Watson as a soon-to-be-executed convict who plays counterpoint to Bale's fatalism. It's a performance that breathes life into a dead world, showcasing a breathtaking sense of humanity.But while the film rests on the attractiveness of the fight scenes - though the gunplay is impressive, it does run a tad silly - what makes this film interesting is the world that Wimmer has created. Specifically, the clerics. They're like a malevolent order of Jedi Knights who hold a special place in societal hierarchy; those men that can kill with the precision of a surgeon, while commanding a lofty level of respect among the people. And some of the fight scenes were pretty sweet. 7/10",Equilibrium

If you like your present world and all the material things it offers every one of us, you can forget about owning them in this story. If you have FEELINGS like LOVE and making love, or just plain PAIN, in this film it is all controlled and everything that you own is watched and don't try to hide things of past generations or you will suffer horrible situations. There is a very romantic scene, where the male and female try to touch each other on the hands and all Hell breaks loose. If you like this sort of film, this is the film for YOU.",Equilibrium
24,siderite,1984 meets Fahrenheit 451 with a twist of Matrix.,8,20 August 2005,"This movie has obvious lapses in plot logic. However the viewer is not bothered by this, even if it does make the film seem older than it is. Maybe because it is basically a remake of Fahrenheit 451. There are some interesting concepts in there, the gun Kata theory I found it to be cool.As in Fahrenheit 451 a law enforcer tries to find works of art and destroy them along with any people that refuse to take the drug that makes them not feel anything. In the end he becomes a ""feeler"" and helps the resistance overthrow the government.I think the fights were awesome, maybe they influenced those in Matrix. The actors played well. The plot was both reminiscent of the Fahrenheit 451 idea and also original in some of the aspects.I hated to see people being motivated by emotional speeches in a world that is supposed to not feel. I hated the way the main character always had his guns on him, even when he was supposed to have been searched and relieved of his weapons.All in all it was a very good movie, but it could have been better with a little more patience and maybe a higher budget. A must see for all Matrix fans :)",Equilibrium
25,MovieAddict2016,I didn't like it,5,23 June 2005,"Someone had highly recommended ""Equilibrium"" to me, claiming it was better than ""The Matrix"" and a forgotten film that slipped under the radar in 2002. Seeing how I never really bought into the whole ""Matrix"" craze, I figured this might be the more intelligent and unpretentious stylized action film I was looking for.Well, I was wrong. The movie opens in the future. A bunch of guys are tracking down criminals who have stolen the Mona Lisa. At first, we think they're trying to save the painting. Then we find out that they are actually trying to take it away so they can burn it.In the future, all art and other things associated with feelings, senses, creativity and emotions are banned. Humans take small pills that restrict that from feeling any emotions whatsoever.One of the law enforcement officers (Christian Bale) decides to stop taking his pill after being convinced not to. He realizes what he's been missing out on, but is afraid the others will find out so he has to keep his cool.Unfortunately a conscience prohibits him from ruthlessly murdering people anymore. Soon other agents realize what has happened and he is put on the next hit list.""Equilibrium"" is all style, no substance. It has a really promising plot, but it doesn't go anywhere with it. It's not based around paranoia and fear; it's based around how much butt you can kick, and how well you can kick it.I admire the effort. The director on the DVD commentary track seems really into his material and loves the movie. He says he's really sad it was misunderstood on release (the critics lambasted it, helping it die a quick death at the box office).However, I have to admit I can see where the critics were coming from. The fight scenes are pretty cool but they aren't entertaining after a while; the ending in particular didn't emotionally affect me in any way, and watching loads of people getting slaughtered loses its novelty after a while.I liked the fact that the whole hero-vs.-villain fight was about untypical as you can get (I won't ruin it, but suffice to say, it wasn't what I was expecting). But other than that, the movie isn't that good.",Equilibrium
26,thesar-2,Equilineo,4,24 May 2009,"I checked the FAQ for 'Equilibrium' and amazingly it appears Keanu Reeves was not the first choice for John Preston (Bale.) All the way through, I could barely see Bale, but Reeves instead. Furthermore, a lot of this was (no surprise) filmed like the much better, original 'Matrix' film. And a few years later, countless similar films were created: 'Aeon Flux,' 'The Island' and the far superior 'V for Vendetta.' Still, 'Equilibrium' was a good enough movie, if extremely unrealistic in fight scenes – not that it matters to fans of 'Matrix' or just basic hand-to-hand combat with a Neo-stand-in. I enjoyed the cinematography and the actually dramatic and heart-crushing scenes while John unwillingly witnesses innocent people and animals being put down – you know what's coming, for John that is, and you almost want to shout to hurry up and save at least 1 person. Sad to think, the human race could easily go this route again, as we have previously – enter the obvious ""Nazi"" culture overtones. 'Equilibrium' starts after WWIII where a higher-up ""Father"" wants all humans to live the life of Star Trek's Vulcans – emotionless, in order to avoid a WWIV or just simple war itself. Unfortunately, for these people, they didn't completely mirror the Vulcans, who not only learned to suppress emotions, but they lived in complete peace. Obviously, as in any ""suppressed people"" real-life or fictional tales, rebellion ensures. Enter Bale, one of the top ranking officials assigned to hunting and slaughtering Christians, er, I mean Jews, er, I mean American Indians, er, I mean people who don't take a feeling-suppression drug and yield like zombies to the government. Again, you know where the story's going, so you might as well sit back and watch him (or think 'Matrix' Neo) fight 17 guys at once.",Equilibrium

28,dromasca,1984 Meets 'The One',7,6 June 2003,"The idea in 'Equilibrium' is far from original. Negative utopias about mind-controlled societies of the future have been brought to screen with success, think about 'Fahrenheit 451' and '1984' - both good films based upon excellent literary works. Whoever lived or lives in a totalitarian society - be it left, right, or religious-based,  knows too well that these stories are not utopian at all, and that free thought and artistic emotion are the real enemies of these systems. So 'Equilibrium' is not an original idea. It is not a large budget film either, thus the effects or settings not only cannot compare with 'Matrix', but they even look sometimes like the painted board they are. It has some good fighting scenes, but I doubt the quantity of fighting on the screen will satisfy action film fans. What makes it an acceptable film is the good acting (Emily Watson of course is great as ever, but Christian Bale is not bad either), the balance of emotion and action, and the logic of the script.
As many such films, 'Equilibrium' started to gather a quantity of fans that see in it a masterpiece. I did not have this feeling. It is above average, smarter than the usual stuff, but I will not enroll in the cult. 7/10 on my personal scale.",Equilibrium
29,g-bodyl,Better Than the Matrix!,8,19 March 2013,"Equilibrium is a really good sci-fi, dystopian film that is even better than any film in the Matrix trilogy. I am not a big fan of that trilogy but even so, I never thought this would come close to those films. This film has some of the cool action stunts the Matrix has, but I feel they are better executed here in this film. These action scenes were intense and were properly done.Kurt Wimmer's film is about how in the future, society is banned from any music and art. There are this special police squad that are trained to eliminate all those who disobey. But when the leading agent forgets to take his special drug, he begins to find out who this police squad really are.Christian Bale, in one of his not-well-known roles, is solid and has some good action scenes. I liked his scene where he breaks down when he hears Beethoven for the first time. Taye Diggs has never been a favorite of mine but while I still wasn't impressed, he did decent in his role. I wished Sean Bean and William Fichtner had more screen time.Overall, this is a criminally underrated movie. I did some research and found this film that one of the bigger disparities between critics and regular audiences. I scratch my head because critics generally like this kind of film. This film took a while to gather momentum but when it did, it went full on until the end. It's a pity this film failed miserably at the box office. I rate this film 8/10.",Equilibrium
30,ericstevenson,Wouldn't quite recommend it,7,25 October 2016,"At first glance, it would be pretty easy to dismiss this as just a lame Matrix wannabe, but it really is more than that. I actually did end up liking this movie for the most part, but I will admit it had a lot of flaws. This movie features a guy named John Preston who lives in a world that takes place after World War III where everyone is forced to use a drug to stop them from having individuality. I admit that this isn't original. The idea of a dystopian future has been done a seemingly infinite number of times before. There was even an episode of ""The Simpsons"" that made a great joke about this.I still ended up enjoying this. I think it's probably because there are some really intense scenes in this. There are parts where it seems like he's just going to save the day, but that doesn't happen at all. I guess this movie took more risks than usual. Yeah, you could argue it's just a dumb action movie with tons of gun fights, but it's still pretty cool. It's at least above average and should please most action fans. There's better movies out there, but there's even more worse movies. The acting's pretty good and even if the concept isn't that original, it mostly entertained me. ***",Equilibrium
31,A_Different_Drummer,I am writing this review from the future...,10,5 January 2014,"... well, technically, I am. I am writing this review from the year 2014, more than a decade after Equilibrium was released. I have accomplished this using the IMDb's ""time portal"" feature which allows users from the far future to comment on productions from the past. (Thanks, IMDb). I have just seen American Hustle. In attempting to put on paper, metaphorically, my thoughts on THAT film, I came to the sudden realization that Equilibrium may well go down in history as Bale's best film. Now, before all the Bale fans get a case of the vapors, let me quickly add that Bale is clearly of the greatest actors of his generation. Problem is, that's no secret. Which means every producer and director wants him in their next picture. Which means that, in my era (remember I am writing this from the future!) he is getting a tad overexposed, and THAT never ends well. So, with hindsight, I am going to add this little review to the database (where I suspect it will be lost, considering it follows over 1,000 other reviews) and say that this film was almost flawless, it engaged the viewer off the top, it delivered both action and emotion, it was never boring, it contains some of the most unique fight scenes ever filmed anywhere, anytime, and Bale (a younger Bale, of course) was nothing less than brilliant.",Equilibrium
32,tabuno,Finally Out On Video - A Stylish Martial Arts - Sci Fi - Big Brother Movie,8,25 January 2019,"16 May 2003. ""Equilibrium"" is a bit of a strange blend of martial arts and 1984/Fahrenheit 451 version of a future where the government bans emotion - though there seems to be a weaker premise only in that the heightened concept of emotionless acting seems incoherent in this movie in that by the very definition of entertaining audience the quality bar is set so high that it's almost impossible to produce and direct a movie such that emotions can be eliminated sufficiently in this movie without boring the audience and destroying its box office chances which apparently it literally did. The martial arts helped to pull in the action oriented sci fi fans but for the rest of the country, the movie distributors only allowed this movie into theatrical release in only the top 20 markets in the country.The martial art sequences are unusally and exciting to watch - and comes in ahead a many similar movie effects coming out in 2003 - Matrix (Reloaded) and Charlies Angels (Full Throttle). The core material substance of ""Equilibrium"" is serious and of sci fi quality (though a tad bit less ambitious and less well carried out than in 1984 (earlier movie version) and Fahrenheit 451. The surprise quality star Emily Watson plays a quiet role in this movie and like many of its genre, the love interest is played carefully and in this movie much more subdued than any other of its like.A much more forward looking movie in the American outlook category, Logan's Run than 1984 or the European Fahrenheit 451 or even ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" - the director intends to carry forth a similar message except with a more flamboyant style and substance in an American hero/post Iraqi era (though the movie was completed before the military action was concluded in 2003).",Equilibrium
33,The-Sarkologist,"What We Try to Suppress, we End Up Becoming",7,29 June 2021,"I guess the main thing that I got out of this film is that the more you try to suppress the urges that lead to violence, the more violent you become. The film is about a society that has decided that emotion is the cause of all of humanity's problems, and that it is the main cause of war and mass destruction so the society invents a drug to suppress emotion, and goes out of its way to destroy anything that could evoke an emotive reaction. This is seen at the start of the film where they raid a rebel hideout, find the Mona Lisa in a hidden compartment, and then proceed to destroy it.In this world we have these soldier's known as clerics who had spot emotional responses in humans, and react accordingly. They are also highly skilled, in that they can walk into a room full of people armed with heavy artillery, and then proceed to pretty much kill all of them. However, the problem with emotion is that it always seems to exist just below the surface, and just because you are able to suppress it does not necessarily mean that it isn't there.Sean Bean is the second billed actor in this film, however you can be assured that because Sean Bean appears in this film you know that he is going to get killed, and you will not be disappointed in that regard, though I have to admit that it isn't as impressive as some of his other feats in some of his other films. Still, Sean Bean dying within the first few minutes of a movie is what we love about the actor.In a way this film really does call to mind Farenheit 451 (451 being the temperature in which paper burns), but then again when you have a story about people going around destroying works of art and literature because they are bad you simply cannot escape that book. Mind you, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad, and there are certainly things about this film that rise beyond that book, but we still need to remember that this is nothing different.Sure, the film reminds us that the whole idea of art and literature, while it might be emotive, and while it might result in some bad things, that there is still some beauty about it, such as keeping an animal as a pet. This is certainly the case in the scene where they find a bunch of dogs, and they start killing them. Once again, owning a pet produces emotions, and emotions are bad, so anything that could produce an emotive response is bad. Yet my heart cringed when they started killing the dogs for this particular reason, especially the squeaks that we hear as they kill the dogs. In a way that tells us that they have begun to step beyond the realms of reason, and the lack of emotions can create just as much evil as emotions can.In fact, we reach a point in the film where it is determined that anybody who shows emotion should be killed summarily, which demonstrates that we have simply come fill circle. We are shown images of Stalin and Hitler as examples of the evil that emotion creates, yet we watch as the police go around summarily killing people because they show emotion. In a way what we see is that they are simply no different to the people whom they are attempting to save society from - they are basically the dictators who killed people on a whim.It is interesting to not the ""Father's"" office at the end of the film, and I suspect that this is deliberate. No doubt this reminds up of where pretty much all institutions end up, namely that they indulge in what they tell others that they shouldn't indulge in. I guess that is why I end up balking at people who tell us not to do something because a part of me feels that what they are telling me isn't necessarily what they are doing.I have to admit that this is actually a pretty good film, even if it has Sean Bean getting killed at the beginning. I've watched it before, and I watched it again recently (which is probably pretty obvious because I'm writing a review of this film). It's actually quite good, and in a way seems to have slipped under the radar. Mind you, the audience rating is pretty high, which is something that I do tend to pay attention to, at times.",Equilibrium

36,Dr_Coulardeau,Kind of delirious nightmare,9,30 December 2010,"A strange remake of many films and many books of science fiction. Brave New World, 1984, Brazil, Total Recall, the Running Man, Terminator, and so many others. The basic crime here is to feel. How can we get rid of feelings in order to guarantee social peace and complete control of everyone and everything? The question is the answer.A drug will do the job everyday and destroying anything that could resemble any feeling or their carriers will do the job every night, and we are covered day and night. But what happens in any society? Some do not like drugs and compulsory acts. So they rebel and they stop taking their drugs. And that is called the resistance.In Brave New World they are tolerated in some human reservation, but in this world they are underground and have to fight against the official society overground. And there will always be one secret agent of the feeling police who will rebel one day and will get in touch with the resistance and will be the instrument of the end of this world. That's part of life and no one can prevent it.So the film is a little bit naïve on the means with which one man, even a cleric of super power and strength, can succeed in killing dozens of trained soldiers in about two minutes without even getting a rip in his coat. It yells impossible but we are a good audience and we suspend our disbelief long enough to know that this rebellion is absolutely possible and that it exists in any totalitarian system.The only passé element is that the power of ""free"" information is not captured in this film which is already old and cannot know the power of the new medium called the Internet and the way even the best kept secrets in the world can be made public tomorrow morning by Wikileaks or any other eaves dropping site.But apart from that it is an entertaining film and I like the dog, the mongrel, the BO of this film that was made even before that famous BO was elected President of the United States who brought a dog named Bo into the White House along with two young girls.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Equilibrium

I know it takes a while the get the story started to develop the plot, but this film took a little too long. There were some moments that seemed to drag on a little in the beginning and towards the middle. Equilibrium would have been better had it been more original and had a different technique and style.Christian Bale plays Cleric John Preston, an officer fully devoted to stamping out human emotion wherever he's sent. Not only do Clerics destroy any 'free-thinkers' and pieces of artwork they come across, but they're also schooled in the slick art of ""Gunkata"". But when Preston's partner Partridge (Sean Bean) comes down with a nasty case of 'humanity', it starts a chain reaction of events that eventually shake Preston from his drug-induced apathy. I also thought Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson were miscast, especially Waston.A good and memorable scene was when Preston is outside at night with his car and he has the dog in his trunk, then the officers search his trunk and find the dog. The action that follows was very good (Matrix type action- around 49:30). The best action sequences are in its final 10 mins, when Bale is killing every guard and officer in his path. It was quite fascinating and entertaining, though it wasn't very long. Overall, Equilibrium is solid but could have been more better had they focused more on an original and developed plot, added with more and better directed action scenes. ==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (03/08/17') many of my views and opinions have changed about this film. It is most definitely a film that requires a close paying attention to detail, and something that gets better on each viewing. Equilibrium's story isn't well boring but slightly slower paced but while the pace is quite drag, the story and overall plot is quite entertaining. Christian Bale is great in his role, as he has mastered his technique brilliantly. This film is underrated in aspect since it did very poorly at the box office, and has not received as great reviews as one expected. The action sequences are far in between but they are delivered with great directing and is entertaining to watch. Rating changed from 5/10 to 8/10.",Equilibrium

40,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Equilibrium"" is really hard to type.",9,23 March 2008,"I bought Equilibrium just because Christian Bale is in it. To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. It takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.The movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. The government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be ""sense offenders"" on the spot (""I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?""). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. For the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.Many people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. It is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in ""counter'-revolutionary activities"" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.The similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.Note: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...",Equilibrium
41,Vartiainen,"Style over substance, but what a style it is",6,15 February 2016,"Like so many other science fiction films created in the early 00s after the success of The Matrix, Equilibrium takes place in a dystopian future, has a decent but not great budget and gets one or two stars to give it some pulling power. In this case Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Emily Watson, placing it at the high end of Matrix copycats. And it's a good movie in its own right.The story is pretty basic and recognizable if you've seen or read, say, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, 1984, or indeed, The Matrix. A government has taken total control of the human population and is keeping them under tight control using emotion-numbing drugs and constant police state surveillance where everyone is encouraged to spy on their neighbours for the good of humanity. All things that could invoke emotions are forbidden, hunted down and destroyed. All literature, all music, all art. Overseeing all this are the Grammaton Clerics, highly trained gun specialists, one of them played by Christian Bale.Yeah, you already know how the story will go. Everyone knows after the first five minutes. That's not why you watch this movie. You watch it for the special effects and the fight scenes. The Clerics utilize a fighting style called Gun Kata, which is essentially what would happen you gave Bruce Lee two semi-automatics. And it is glorious! And to be fair, although the story line is extremely clichéd and predictable, they did get good enough actors that it feels believable and is enjoyable to watch. Could it have been better with a bit more originality? Absolutely. But the fact still remains that it's good enough as it is that it won't detract from your viewing experience.Equilibrium is a great guilty pleasure action film. Its story line is rubbish, but it has so many good things in it that you cannot help but like it despite its flaws. If you like your testosterone levels spiking off the charts, that is.",Equilibrium
42,robert-temple-1,In a Fascist Future,9,18 October 2009,"This eerie, gloomy, dystopian tale deals with a time late in the 21st century after a third world war has taken place. On the pretext of preventing another war, a fascist regime has been set up which dispenses a mandatory chemical called Prozium (any connection to any Prozac living or dead is purely coincidental) which kills all feeling. Death squads reminiscent of Hitler's Einsatzgruppen roam the city killing all who refuse to take Prozium. In this vision of hell, the art director, costume and set designers have had fun creating a Mussoliniesque architectural nightmare ambiance. The chief enforcers are known as 'clerics', and the lead character in the film is Cleric John Preston, played by a sleek-haired Christian Bale with cheekbones as sharp as razors. He 'enforces'. People who are caught feeling are condemned to instant incineration, and we see Emily Watson being incinerated, which is a pity because good actresses shouldn't be allowed to go up in flames like that. Well, one day Bale drops his Prozium and misses his dose. When he goes for a replacement, the dispensary is closed. He thus has a whole day off the drug and begins to feel. Horror of horrors! But he has to disguise this because if anyone catches him feeling, he will get the chop. There are many highly stylized aspects to this film, with kung fu and samurai elements to the fight scenes, which are totally non-realistic fantasy episodes. The head of the fascist regime is called 'Father', but he never receives visitors and no one ever sees him. It turns out that he died years before and, like Osama bin Laden, was retained as a convenient pretext, with the top men pretending he is still alive because they dare not admit he is dead. There is an active 'underground' of people who feel, who keep trying to free themselves from the fascist yoke. Bale eventually sides with them to try to overthrow the System. Will he or won't he succeed? Can it be done? My lips are sealed because, after all, it is unsafe to speak, and the CCTV cameras are everywhere, and you really shouldn't be reading this because they will know. And I'm not joking.",Equilibrium
43,BeneCumb,1984 meets The Matrix... briskly,7,5 November 2012,"The idea beyond is scheming, but not fully implemented, as some feelings or emotions seemed to preserve, e.g contempt, comradeship, care for children, and comparing all this with fascist regimes was also off the point as those regimes did not want to suppress all the emotions, just to use them for their own sake, and conducting wars has been always on their list. Moreover, I am sure that victims of rape, passion crimes or ethnic cleansing would prefer use of such medication, when at least some members of society would be deprived of the right/privilege/ability etc. to feel.The sporadically hectic and numb (especially gun kata fights, and raids against sense offenders) film is saved by architectural background and decent performances, with Christian Bale and Emily Watson, above all. Luckily, the film is 1,5 hours only and thus does not become boring, but e.g. The Matrix is noticeably better.",Equilibrium
44,freemantle_uk,Action-based dyspotian film,4,23 April 2010,"Dystopian futures have always been a popular sub-genre of sci-fi. They are many novels that look at this idea of a future that is worst and often been used as a commentary of the society at the time. George Orwell did it with 1984, as a fear of totalitarian regimes like the Nazis and Stalinist Russia, to Aldous Huxley fear of society being controlled by the government and a fears capitalism and Marxism when he wrote Brave New World, and Yevgeny Zamyatin used We to criticise Bolshevikism, Anthony Burgess' used A Clockwork Orange has a number of themes from moral arguments, crime and law and order to small things like Alex listening to classical music as a comment about the Nazis and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradley was a commentary about censorship, the media and keeping society ignorant. But Kurt Wimmer turns great ideas in these novels into a silly, MTV style action film.The world had gone through a devastating war, World War III. A new system of government has risen in a city state. Emotions are regulated through drugs and all books, art and music are banned. Giant TV screen keep running propaganda why this system of government and society exists. A resistance movement exists hiding all this contraband. They hide in the outer limits of city and the police often raid them, having bloody shoots out with them. The government have created a special order of men, the Grammaton Clerics who enforce the law and the best fighters available. One of the best is John Preston (Christian Bale), a man who is a skilled fighter and gunman and brutally enforces the law. But his eyes are opened after an number of events, his wife's arrest, his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) had been secretly started to feel emotions and he arrested Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson) who questions Preston's belief system. Preston starts to have doubts and dreams, and he stops taking his emotion-blocking drugs. Preston starts to feel emotions for the first time. His emotional awaking including falling in love and hiding evidence. He tries to contact the resistance, but his new partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) is hot on his trial.This film basically copy good ideas from dystopian fiction. Burning books and other cultural artifacts was used in Fahrenheit 451 which itself was influenced by Nazi actions, plus the wider assault of culture was a theme in 1984. The use of drugs to numb emotions and a wider assault on emotions are themes from Brave New World and We and was used in George Lucas' debut THX 1138. 1984 was raided for ideas, mainly the idea of constant surveillance used by a big TV screen spouting propaganda and use the fear of children turning against their parents. Equilibrium also shares a common theme with We, 1984 and Fahrenheit 451, an inner of the system (usually mid-ranking) turning against the government but don't know how to go about it. Some of these ideas can work in the film (they obviously work in those books), but Wimmer wanted to focus more on the action aspect of the film. Wimmer did have a good visual eye for some key scenes and did have some stylist moments. They were some good action sequences, the best one being when Preston first fights the polices after his emotional realisation. But other scenes (mainly at the end) were so over edited that it completely ruined the illusion. His script suffers from weak dialogue and clichés. Some themes are under used like Preston's son acting as a check against his father.Bale is of course an excellent actor, but the problem here was his character was meant to be emotionless, so make it hard to make a connection to him. There are moments where Bale gives his character some range, but for the most part Preston was a robot and Bale couldn't do much about it. Watson was in a pretty good in her small as the pseudo-love interest. But her role was limited to about 10 minutes of screen time. The best performer was William Fichtner as the leader of the resistance and Matthew Harbour could have been very creepy as Bale's son if done right. But Taye Diggs was a poor action in Equilibrium, not even playing ambitious or emotionless well. Angus Macfadyen simply got to ham up his performance.There was some interest images and ideas in the film, like the government symbol and flag being similar to Swastika. But on the other side of the coin surely ideas of rituals would not exist in an emotionless society?But despite the problems of Equilibrium there are some interesting ideas and Wimmer did have some ambition. There are some good action scenes which mixes hand-to-hand combat with gun fights. But it was a B-Movie which actors at a certain stage have to do before getting bigger and better roles, i.e. Bale is now Batman.",Equilibrium

It's the future, and we're living in a totalitarian regime thanks to a government-mandated drug that saps humanity of its ability to feel. Bale plays the cold, emotionless head of the gestapo, responsible for tracking and exterminating the few remaining shreds of liberal thought in the wild. Curiously, after incinerating every shred of artwork, poetry and literature he can find, this super-cop then retires to his ornately decorated office where a big show is made of the beautiful architecture and lavish sculptural decorations. The story's failure to comply with its own focal point doesn't end there, as Bale's coworkers and bosses are surprisingly animated and emotive for men supposedly removed from their own feelings. The plot offers no revelations, with the protagonist stomping through a shallow character arc and an overly simple, black-and-white evaluation of the grand scheme. There's fruit to be harvested here, but Equilibrium is either too short or too lazy to reach for it. A few very good action scenes (leading to an unusually high body count) are its only saving grace.",Equilibrium
47,MBunge,"This thing had potential, but needed a much lighter hand that didn't try to hammer its meaning into viewers' foreheads",5,15 September 2010,"Have you ever watched a dumb movie and wondered if the people who made it were dumb or if they just thought the audience was dumb? Equilibrium is that sort of film.The story is about a future society where emotion has been outlawed. Everyone is required to take regular doses of Prozium, an emotion-suppressing drug. Anyone who doesn't is considered an enemy of the state and any item of art, music, color or even any physical sensation that might inspire human feeling has been banned. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton Cleric, a supercop in charge of hunting down ""sense-offenders"" and destroying their hidden caches of contraband.As you might guess, the film is about Preston rediscovering his own emotions and joining with an underground resistance to challenge the police state that enforces the ban on emotions. If that sounds like Fahrenheit 451, you're right. It's a really dumbed down version of that story, though. In fact ,it's hard to exaggerate how dumb the film isor how dumb the filmmakers think the audience is.Unlike the Matrix, where some deep philosophical concepts of the self and reality inform the story but mainly bubble underneath the surface, Equilibrium wears every single message and idea it has on its sleeve. Characters are constantly telling us what the movie is about and then telling us again, just in case we missed it. There is never a moment when you ever have to wonder exactly what you're supposed to be thinking or how you're supposed to feel about this stuff.It is a fairly fast moving film until it realizes that it's run out of plot. It takes John Preston to the point where he's ready to rebel against the society he serves, but then it's like someone realized the movie was only going to be an hour long, so a bunch of unnecessary scenes were thrown in to keep the characters running in place for another 35 minutes. There is a neat, little twist at the end, something a lot smarter than the rest of the film and so surprising you probably won't realize right away they ripped it off from a Schwarzenegger flick. But that one, brief moment of brains is followed by one of the stupidest, most ham-handed endings in movie history. It's worse than any climax from any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.Equilibrium is visually striking. Much of the CGI-less action scenes revolve around this gun-fu martial art that allows Preston and other clerics to perform superhuman feats of violence.Christian Bale does everything he can with the role of Preston, but he's terribly limited by what the story does to the character. Preston either commits or allows so many terrible, murderous things to happen that it is extremely hard to care about or root for the character to succeed.Equilibrium aspires to be a sci-fi morality tale, but can't manage to be more than a pretentious, B-level action film with some interesting fight scenes. And there's not much wrong with that, but you wonder if the filmmakers really thought they were making something better.",Equilibrium
48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Operatic dystopian intensity. Very well done.,8,24 March 2016,"Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium is an operatic dystopian fantasy that contains an absurd amount of Matrix esque action to go along with its thought provoking concept. Maybe not quite enough thoughts are provoked, and a bit too much time is spent on buckets of bullets whizzing around in hyper kinetic delirium, but nevertheless one can't ignore the pure class and style in which the film is executed in. It's undiluted energy, with a flow that feels almost comic book - esque, and a grandiose score that sets the soundscape ablaze with stirring chords that push the film's momentum forward furiously. In a barren future, all expressions of emotion are extinguished by a drug that supresses human qualities. Art, music and literature is forbidden, anyone who rebels is labeled a 'sense offender' and promptly executed. This decree is watched over by supreme leader Father (Sean Pertwee), who believes that this way of life will do away with war, conflict and complications which make lives so hard. Christian Bale is Cleric John Preston, a kind of gun toting ninja cop who eforces these rules with detached lethality along with his partner Partridge (Sean Bean). One day he loses his dose, and sees the light. His soul is flooded with emotion, color and he begins to see how wrong society has become. He becomes a sort of outlaw, joining an underground resistance led by William Fichtner and waging all out war against the oppressive, hypocritical government, including his boss (a hammy Angus Macfayden) and another slick colleague (Taye Diggs). It's one highly expressionistic action set piece after another with scarcely a moment in between for the viewer to really delve into the implications of the film's story and build their own philosophy upon. Fpr what it is though, it's a total blast that operates from the adrenal glands and fires away with sheer abandon and visual audacity. Bale is so intense he looks like he may implode, even after his transformation. Bean steals his scenes as usual as the best written and only complex character, his final confrontation scene gives goosebumps. Emily Watson is warm fire to the film's cold chill, briefly playing a sense offender who elicits prophetic change in Bale. This one will rock your socks, and your surround sound system. Just go easy on it for not dipping far below the tip of the iceberg in terms of the material. It what it is.",Equilibrium

And indeed the result is a society without crime, without wars. All this is directed by the omnipresent Father, who is constantly in the lives of the citizens- on screens, on radio. The elimination of emotions has been achieved via a medication called Prozium which has to be injected daily into the jugular.Father has a highly armed army to ensure society stays peaceful, and an elite force known as clerics. They have the power to sense if someone is starting to feel, sometimes even before the person knows it. When someone fails to take the medication they quickly get a visit from a team of clerics. The clerics also intervene outside the city when rebels are caught holding on to vintage objects that may inspire emotions, like paintings, literature, perfume, music, and so on. These are immediately destroyed, as well as the resistance fighters.We witness this world from the perspective of Preston, the highest ranking cleric, whose partner suddenly develops feelings and who is killed by the cold and meticulous Preston. But when he accidentally fails to take his own medication his world changes. He himself, seeing the example of his former partner starts avoiding the medication, starts thinking outside of the box, adopts a puppy (animals are banned), develops feelings for a female resistance member sentenced for execution. He starts helping the resistance and plots with them the fall of Father. But his new partner is also powerful like him and quickly becomes suspicious of Preston's behavior as well as the main acting politician- Dupont.Equilibrium offers a story that has been told often before, but here it's worked out carefully and packed with some excellent visuals and superb fight sequences.

Taking place in a dark, dystopian and repressive future, Equilibrium as a sci fi action film checks a lot of boxes. The film looks great and was tightly directed. The cast is fantastic with some really great and talented British actors like Christian Bale, Sean Pertwee and Sean Bean. Equilibrium brings to mind classic dystopian science fiction like 1984 and Farenheit 451 and mixes it up with crazy Hong Kong/John Woo styled action scenes.

The idea has been done in many well regarded movies and books, some classic others with varying degrees including outright failures. Pitfalls abound. So, how does Equilibrium end up in the plus column? In a word, Christian Bale. For the viewer that stays the course you end up invested in his character. Mr. Bales performance is much better than serviceable and on that the entire story hangs. This in no way diminishes feats such as a striking view of a futuristic post WW III set obviously done well within a meager budget or clever metaphors such as the reference to Pink Floyd when Cleric feels some emotion even when touching ""a cold steel rail"". I've seen sharply divided views of this movie, and, it would seem, you're either ""on board"" or you're not. In the end it is as simple as that. Early on, I felt it was, perhaps, verging on too silly and coldly claustrophobic to be sensible entertainment. That was before I allowed Bale to open up his character. I'll say once more the relative success of the movie hangs on him. In the end, I enjoyed the story as I was past comparing it to anything similar. As such, I recommend it to avid fans of the genre (post apocalyptic sci-fiction) with reservations of, quite possibly, no recommendation for others. In the end it is fairly solid and a testament of what can be achieved with the right actor and almost amazing budget-stretching in production.",Equilibrium
54,guisreis,An entertaining but incoherent distopic movie,7,21 November 2015,"This is an entertaining distopic movie with some very good actors and well filmed. Though, it has some serious problems which will be focused in this review. It is clearly inspired by Orwell's ""1984"" (and also probably makes some deserved homages to it, like the crystal ball with a Tour Eiffel inside and the family name O'Brien for one of the important characters) and by ""Matrix"" (clothes and action scenes). However, some gadgets remind more ""Mission: Impossible"" or ""007"", and that reduces a lot the distopic impact of the film. Bale's character makes excessively unrealistic athletic feats and the explanation for it is the martial arts Gun Kata in which the highest ranking law enforcers called Grammaton Clerics are trained. OK, there is an explanation, but that is not convincing enough, and perhaps only the last fighting scene is not more unrealistic that it could be expected. Anyway, that is not the worst problem of the film, as its assumptions are contradictory. In 2072, after World War 3, there is a totalitarian country, Libria, which forbids emotion. To make it possible, it obliges everybody to take emotion-suppressing drugs and not taking them is a crime punished with death. The need not to have emotions is justified by blaming these for all crimes and violence. It is not very precise to call that totalitarian regime as Fascist, as European Fascisms were not rational at all, as tradition and passionate feelings (hatred, fear) were the fuel for obedience, not reason. Therefore, we could expect a full rational society, completely organized according utilitarian criteria, right? However, the ""big brother"" of Libria, who is called ""The Father"", has the final word, and any order of him may be obeyed by faith even if it does not follow the rules and laws rationally implemented. Though, having a religious leadership and obedience by faith contradicts the idea of suppressing emotion. To resume, the film brings us a nice adventure, but it would need much more rigor and coherence to be one of the great distopies on screen, like ""Brazil"", ""1984"", ""Wall-E"", ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Metropolis"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"".",Equilibrium
55,onepotato2,shoot the whole creative team,1,31 March 2005,"A design-y movie that has nothing but regurgitation and posturing at it's center. 20 years ago self-impressed high-school nerds used to dream up crap like this. That't the last time it was age-appropriate. Consider it a sign of the cultures slide into bile that they you can get one made now. This is not high-concept. This is simpy, prissy, fussy, crappy film-making. It' sheer garbage from the get-go, but inexplicably Emily Watson shows up as someone who feels. Oh Hooray, emotion will save us from a future full of idiocy.

56,Seraphion,Good bas and initial development but gets very wobbly towards the end,6,3 January 2015,"Despite ignoring one major piece of the puzzle in its assumptions of the future, the story itself have a good base in creating the fully controlled dystopia society devoid of emotions which is deemed the precursor of war and all other negativity. But soon after The main character starts to change his principles and cross to the other side the story begins to get very wobbly, It is very strange that he can go through those moments of brush-in with the authority and almost getting caught just to end up being framed at the very end. The action tries to present another illogical thing about close ranged gun combat. There is no such thing as a safe point in a gun combat besides behind covers because guns rattle while shooting, disorienting their aim and bullet trajectory to pretty much everywhere of the target area. The acting is a breeze for Christian Bale since his role here doesn't really need that much of expression. Sean Bean is really underestimated here since he only get the role where the character dies so very quickly at the start.",Equilibrium
57,lemon_magic,"Doesn't hold up to close examination, but great fun with lots of inspired touches",8,18 June 2005,"In the hands of a less talented and inspired production team, this movie would have sucked. The plot is derivative of 'Fahrenheit 451' and 'Brave New World', there are holes in the narrative that you could drive a truck through, and the art direction, set design and fight choreography are obviously modeled after the recent success of 'The Matrix'.However, through some miracle of sheer energy, acting charisma, and inspired use of hundreds of little details through the film, 'Equilibrium' manages to be much, much better than it ought to be as a thriller, an action vehicle,and a moral parable. It won't revolutionize the film industry,and we won't see many fanboys dressing up as Tetragrammaton Clerics at conventions, but the open minded viewer will find much to enjoy about this film. I am very glad that I gave it a chance.Here's what won me over into being a fan of this movie: At the climax of the film, when the hero (Christian Bale) has been captured and all seems hopeless, ""Father"" goes on at some length about how clever his scheme was, and how the underground has been captured and its greatest potential enemy has been taken 'without incident'.And Christian Bale looks up at him and says, with just the right combination of deadly anger and humorous contempt: ""Oh, there'll be an incident."" Following which he produces two automatics from seemingly nowhere and all hell breaks loose.It's a wonderful moment, and it won me over big time.So if you are at all in the mood for dystopian sci-fi fiction with action elements and inspired acting, direction and design, give 'Equilibrium' a chance. I think you will find much to like.7.5 out of 10",Equilibrium
58,Rob_Taylor,The first movie since The Matrix to really get it on.,9,10 June 2003,"Wow! That's about all I can say having just watched this movie. After the disappointments of The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk all I can say is this is one heck of a good movie. Some spoilers ahead.It is reminiscent of The Matrix in terms of the fight scenes, but gets on with things much more handily than the pseudo-philosophical Matrix Reloaded. I knew little about it when I sat down to watch it. At first, it seemed like a cheap 1984/Brave New World clone but, whilst those elements are there, along with a goodly dose of Nazi-like propagandism and symbolism, the story rises above that.The main character Preston (Bale) builds subtly from inhuman tool of the state into a caring individual.There are some grin moments which have you rolling your eyes, such as the scene where the authoritarian militia shoot a yard full of dogs and the only one that escapes to jump into the hero's arms is, of course, the cutest puppy there is, not some mangey cur. But these leave you smiling rather than tutting in annoyance.There are some rather obvious plagiarisms (no doubt intended) such as the pillared hallway at the end which bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain lobby in The Matrix. But it's all well-intentioned and the rip-offs are obvious enough that I'm sure they were intended to be seen as what they are - an affectionate nod to the genre.Now to the action. There's plenty of it. Plenty of bullets and plenty of blood. And plenty of martial arts mayhem and crazy acrobatics. Watch it carefully or you'll miss some of the more imaginative bits. And it has to be said that the scenes are imaginatively done and very well choreographed. Again, reminiscent of the Matrix, but with a different enough twist that it never gets boring. And, just when you think you've seen everything the man (Preston) can do with a gun (its called gun kata in the movie - a martial arts routine involving firearms)......he pulls out a sword and goes to work with that! Fantastic stuff!There are some minor plot twists towards the end, but nothing to worry about. A simple action flick which delivers the goods admirably and leaves you disappointed that the movie is over.",Equilibrium
59,PredragReviews,Christian Bale is magnificent!,8,21 March 2016,"This movie is beautifully made. It's dark and largely lacks color, but the setting fits the tone and subject of the movie well. The filming also serves to distinguish the lack of emotion expressed by a majority of the characters and the colorful world of the ""sense offenders."" Although it's nigh impossible for any actor to pull off a complete and total lack of emotion (though if anyone can do it well, it's Christian Bale), I was thoroughly impressed by the skill of the actors.I also loved the story. The subject matter is appealing to me in general, but I was particularly impressed by the specific plot of this movie. I loved the idea that people chose to suppress emotions, have propaganda spewed at them incessently, and kill their family members and neighbors when they didn't conform. It's much like what's happened in the US recently or in the USSR 50 years ago - people giving up their freedoms for the illusion that they are safe and protected from harm. The fall of Bale's character, the elite member of the policing agency enforcing the emotionless state, is particularly moving. The scene where Bale discovers the basement full of sentimental objects and breaks down upon hearing Beethoven will stick with me forever. I was so blown away by the display of emotion Bale managed in that scene.One can easily assume that Equilibrium is just another action movie, but this hybrid of marital art styles, refined weaponry and stunning fight scenes reached deeper than many movies I've seen of serious topics and non frills entertainment. This movie reminded me of movies such as Kill Bill, V for Vendetta, Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet, yet the story and theme touched on the rawest foundations of humanity.There were many twists and turns to the story, secret traitors and hidden agendas and I loved solving it with Preston. The icing on the cake was the fighting, especially when he used his guns as swords, I real treat to watch! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Equilibrium
60,moviewizguy,In a future where freedom is outlawed outlaws will become heroes.,8,28 July 2007,"In a futuristic world, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.When I was watching this film, I expected a chase movie (if you had read the plot, you would know why). But it wasn't. I wasn't disappointed, though, because the movie was fantastic! I know people will think I'm crazy when I say this but this movie is better than ""The Matrix"".The whole plot of the movie is original and well thought out. I never thought I would say this but the gun battles are spectacular! I have never thought that a gun battle sequence will blow me away because they are just gunsbut the ones in here are so much different and original.Unlike the gun scenes in ""The Matrix"", which were mostly in the last 30 minutes or so, the gun scenes in here are so much better. It's quite fresh since it has the great camera movements plus the great choreography. The action sequences are also really well done.Okay, no out of the way from the action, I thought the whole look on the film is fantastic. It doesn't have to show every new technology made in the future to ""woo"" you. It's just shown in a simple way, without a lot of CGI. I also liked the plot twists in the film, although some are obvious.The performance by Christian Bale is fantastic, turning into an emotionless person into a two dimensional character. The whole dramatic scenes were shot beautifully. I was bummed out that Emily Watson wasn't in it as much but she did a fair share. And Taye Diggs was also really well.With spectacular action sequences and gun battles that will blow you away, this is a fantastic film. The script is intelligent and the whole look fantastic. The cinematography is great and the performances top notch. Hey, what more do you want in a well-crafted action film?",Equilibrium

62,Maciste_Brother,Painfully bad,1,20 April 2005,"Bad movies, like good ones, come in different categories: some are just bad bad (any Steven Seagal flick or disaster flicks from the 70s); some are fun bad (any Ed Wood movies); some are just over-the-top beyond everything bad (like VAN HELSING...); some are actually brilliantly bad (THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE, for example). But then there are some movies that are just so bad and stupid and ill-conceived that they're just too painful to watch. Like EQUILIBRIUM, which is one of the most painfully bad movies I've seen in a while (and I've seen a lot of bad movies recently, including COLD CREEK MANOR and JUNIOR...).The whole concept is so ludicrous that I had a hard time watching the film. The idea that because the last world war was so devastating the PTB have decided that all human emotions are the cause of all problems and numbing these emotions with drugs is the only way for society to exist is so silly and stupidly executed that it's almost a thing of beauty in itself. I mean, COME ON!!! There's so much I can suspend in disbelief but this is too much. Paintings, any art-form, or anything that rouses any emotions is illegal? Oy! Who came up with this storyline? A five year old? EQUILIBRIUM feels like a five year old's idea of a Big Brother/totalitarian state. Subtle it's not. And that's the major problem with this film: totalitarian states are not just black and white things, they are as complex, if not more so than so-called free societies.The other problem with EQUILIBRIUM is that the filmmakers actually tried to make the killing techniques look cool and edgy, even if these fighting techniques are basically evil. On one hand, the filmmakers tried to make the totalitarian world look ridiculously awful and yet they were also in love with the police and their fighting style by making it look as cool as possible. Now how confused is that? The whole thing is so confused that it's bizarre. What were Christian Bale and Emily Watson doing in this movie?",Equilibrium
63,BrandtSponseller,Put down the Valium and watch this film,10,9 March 2005,"Set in a future, post-World War III society where emotions have been outlawed, Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing.Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically high-concept combination of Fahrenheit 451 (1966), George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (original published in 1949, film versions appeared in 1954, 1956 and 1984), The Matrix (1999) and a bit of The Wizard of Oz (1939) thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are (assuming it's not a case of plagiarism), as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning, but how well the material is handled. The high-concept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly.On its surface, after a brief action-oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a ""gun fu""-styled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writer/director Kurt Wimmer (who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him, including Sphere (1998) and The Recruit (2003)), with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth.The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost ""out-Matrixes"" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat.Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogue-heavy, and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this (one of two) primary theme(s). Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior, but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion, and emotions are so wrapped-up with being sentient beings, it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them, and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through.Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's self-medication epidemic--even the title of the film seems to be a stab at the common claim that drugs like Prozac and Xanax are taken to help one ""smooth out"", or ""equalize"", extremes of mood, or extreme dispositions. The Equilibrium government extends this agenda into the tangible material realm as they also attempt to ""smooth out"" mood swings by eliminating any cultural artifacts that might promote varied moods/emotions. Wimmer seems to see it as a not-too-exaggerated extension of the modus operandi behind Prozac-like drugs.The other primary theme is one of institutional control. Wimmer has a lot to say about unquestioningly following authorities, and he's careful to show that it's not just governmental authorities that can be a problem. He does this by tightly wrapping religious allegory with his depiction of Equilibrium's government. The leader is known as ""Father"", and the government secret service members are ""clerics"". Those outside of this control are shown as authentic, free, individualistic and happy despite the hardships involved with their embrace of forbidden thought/items.More subtly, Wimmer employs the now overused washed out blue-gray cinematography of late 1990s/early 2000s genre films towards an unusual end. It's not just a stylistic device here, but represents a particular kind of reality. Under the purview of the fascistic government, blue-gray predominates. When glimpses of freedom/authenticity enter the film, the blue-gray look is gone, replaced with strongly saturated warm colors, and occasionally a more nostalgic subdued tone. This is one of the film's similarities to The Wizard of Oz, although maybe not the most significant one.If you're someone who cherishes originality for its own sake, you might not like Equilibrium as much, but you have much more serious epistemological problems to sort out. Otherwise, this is a film worth watching and thinking about.",Equilibrium
64,Sirus_the_Virus,This is a real mind blower.,10,2 January 2010,"There are a couple of futuristic Sci-fi films that I haven't written for yet. Equilibrium being one of them. This is a great film. It has an unexpected feeling to it. It's a surprisingly deep film. This film was originally in limited release. That's a shame cause nobody probably saw it.The film is futuristic. It's about a law enforcer named John Preston(played by the always great Christian Bale). Him and everyone else lives in a world where you have to take pills to take away emotions. Cause they believe that emotions cause wars. And if you do start to feel, you will be murdered. So John stops taking the pills. and he begins to feel again.He has to keep his feelings a secret though. From his partner or something(played by Taye Diggs) and everyone else. He soon meets a woman(played by Emily Watson) who is also feeling and he wishes that he could help her. I think. And he soon starts to fight back because the world is pure madness.Equilibrium has a brilliant plot outline. It has a great way of expressing emotions too. It has spectacular action sequences. This is probably a better film than 1999's The Matrix. That film was groundbreaking for special effects. Well, if you thought that The Matrix was groundbreaking, then you are bound to enjoy Equilibrium.Equilibrium: A+",Equilibrium
65,Prashast_Singh,"Thought-provoking, unforgettable action movie!",10,10 March 2020,"Equilibrium is among the movies that left a deep impact on my mind. It's such an underrated film that puts the viewer straight into the protagonist's shoes and when he emotes, so does the viewer. Christian Bale's performance was so stunning that I felt like it was my own story being told on screen. It's quite relatable in ways more than one. This is a fresh sci-fi action film with emotion that hits you hard and action that blows your mind.The film is a stunning combination of action spectacle and a deeper character commentary. Emotions are presented with subtlety and the amount of tension with every growing second only makes this film more and more entertaining. And the action sequences are one of the biggest highlights of this gem. There's an impressive blend of martial arts with gunfights, and the best example is the final fight sequence that has been choreographed so well that it left me breathless. Visual effects and camerawork too are top-notch.In short, if you like sci-fi action movies that also offer a good amount of thought-provoking ideas, this one's definitely for you.",Equilibrium

Truth to be told Equilibrium was a pretty good movie. Christan Bale in another great performance carries the movie very well and is a likeable action hero. The second male lead in the form of Taye Diggs who makes a good sidekick and bad guy also give a great performance.  But really what makes the shyt is the amazing action sequences. Give this one a chance.,Equilibrium
67,film-critic,I'm not feeling! He is the one who's feeling!,7,10 February 2005,"This film was a combination between The Matrix, Fight Club, Fahrenheit 451, and Blade Runner. There are heavy symbolic messages being thrown at you concerning religion, dictatorships, and the power of the human spirit. Equilibrium was a sci-fi film to the utmost degree. I say this because most of the time you can only cover these topics with a futuristic approach. This allows the director to give us, the viewer, a warning that unless we contain ourselves as humans, this may be the future that we will have to endure. I thought that the actors very well played it out, the direction was steady, and the action was powerful.The only complaint that I have about this film is the story. I felt at times it was rushed and a bit difficult to follow. The basis of this film was to not show emotion, which I felt the actors did very well, but there were times when I thought they were showing emotion and guards were going to come and take them away, but never did. When Bale did break down, why were the other pedestrians of the city not surprised (again, was it because they couldn't show emotion). This is where I started grappling with the overall feel of the film. There should have been a must stricter balance between emotion and non-emotion. I felt that anyone could get away with anything, and with as many spies as they ""claimed"" being around the city, why were more people not picking up on this? If Prozium was issued to everyone, why were there some in the city not taking the drug. Take Watson's character. She could have been utilized in a much deeper way, helping to bring not only Bale's character to the surface, but also others around them. I just felt that with this story, there were issues not being addressed and topics not brought out until a very suspenseful moment. I despised, dare I say hated, the scenes between Bale and his son. Sometimes he was calling Bale ""Dad"" while other time he was using the name ""John"", then there was the fact that there was a painting in ""father's"" office, making us question if they had to take the drugs as well  hum  there was just not enough consistency.Out of what I disliked and onto what made this film work. First, our actors. I have never seen actors give so much to a small film as I did with this movie. Bale was superb, ranking close to Keanu in his ""Neo"" role, as the gun-toting officer of the government. Even Sean Bean brought a human feel to this story about emotion. I especially loved Emily Watson. She picks the oddest roles to add to her resume, but simply put  they work. The acting was only the tip of the iceberg, I loved the action sequences. They were fantastic. I am a sucker for the ""bullet-time"" style of fighting that was issued in The Matrix and I am always impressed when films use it better or add their own spin to it. Equilibrium was one of those films. The Kata style gun fighting was slowed down when needed, or kept the same pace to show the power of the human wielding those powers. It was flashy, but not too flashy. Bale pulled these sequences off with the greatest of ease, only proving that he could be the next Hollywood action hero. The battle between Preston and Brandt was exactly what I was hoping for. While there were a couple of clichés that riddled this film, there were scenes of power and originality that gave me more delight than I can wave a stick at. The battle between two of the strongest lasted just as long as I wanted. Bale was the best, and this film never strayed from that idea.The final topic I would like to discuss goes over the symbolic references in this film. Please, look closely and see if you can see the Holocaust references staring you in the face. The most blatant is shown whenever somebody is accused of showing emotion they are burnt in the incinerator. This is a direct reference to what Hitler did to the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps. Then there was the supreme ruler that just happened to be everywhere people were. He was unavoidable. It reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 in the sense that ""Big Brother"" was watching those that would not obey. Toss in a pinch of the Salem Witch Trials and you have a little film I like to call Equilibrium. I think I liked this film due to the numerous amounts of references to our culture, yet that was what Bale and his government were trying to destroy. While they thought that our culture was being repressed, it was actually seeping through the seems. They would try to crush it in one section, but it would only cause more distress in another. The never won battle against the culture that helps make us the people that we are today. It was interesting to see a world that was scared of repeating the horrible deeds of their past actually create a carbon copy of the horrific deeds of the Holocaust. Their attempts at a utopia failed because the rulers and the people were afraid of whom they were.Overall, I felt that this film was not without flaws, but it did make a good impression on my mind. It dealt with an issue that is not explored enough in cinema because we embrace the theme in every movie created. What would a film be like without creating any sort of emotion from the audience? A film full of emotional void being enjoyed by a couple that embraces it. Strange, weird, world that we live in! Grade: *** out of *****",Equilibrium
68,mentalcritic,A rare dose of originality,8,6 November 2004,"If there is one complaint about the Hollywood system that rings true, it is that Hollywood seems quite bereft of ideas. Then films like Equilibrium come out and remind us that it's not that we're out of ideas so much as we're just not trying hard enough. Not that Equilibrium is inherently new - it borrows a fair few plot concepts from Farenheit 451 and Nineteen Eighty-Four, to name the most prominent examples. It is the way in which the old ideas are combined with the new that makes Equilibrium a fun and underrated experience.The premise is simple enough. In a kneejerk reaction to the horrors of World War Three, the survivors outlaw what they blame the chaos upon. Their own emotions, in other words. As the lead character has a series of revelations, we begin to understand that in so doing, they have also outlawed much of what gives our existence a point. In the bland, lifeless world that the law-abiding citizens inhabit, everything that the audience takes for granted to make their lives worthwhile is being systematically destroyed. Shades of the America of today, the whole principle of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, are shown in a stark horror show.I've read people comparing this film to The Matrix or its sequels. Where The Matrix series' fights were overlong, and often with no payoff, Equilibrium's fights are short and to the point. The difference this makes is, needless to say, as uplifting as Preston's fight to regain the humanity he stripped so many others of. Instead of having fights with no emotional connection to the characters, the story is given sufficient development to make the audience care what happens.The film is not entirely without flaws. The Prozium element seems to have been written with no regard for the facts about psychiatric medicines. Their purpose is not to suppress emotion at all, but to balance the chemical system of the brain in order to give the patient better control of them. Sure, they're not without problems of their own, but exaggerating them like this does not do the portion of the community that needs them any favours. That aside, however, the on-camera struggle is one of the most intriguing I've viewed for some time. Ergo, this minor plot problem is made up for. The only other real complaint I have is that the film could have done with a little more footage to give some characters more of a chance to develop.I gave Equilibrium an eight out of ten. It's not the best negative science fiction you'll ever see, but it is enough of a breath of fresh air that this won't entirely matter. If the MPAA made more films like this, it wouldn't be suffering the constant financial dire straits that it so loves to blame everyone else for.",Equilibrium
69,Joxerlives,A much overlooked gem,9,9 February 2013,"Like many people I made the mistake of dismissing this when it came out as a Matrix rip-off. Boy was I wrong! Instead it's a pretty brilliant combination of 1984, Hard Boiled and Farenheit 451. Really, really good, great performances all around, some terrific action sequences AND it makes you think (the sign of really good sci-fi like The Thing, Blade Runner etc entertains and educates). Christian Bale gives a marvellous performance as a man who is entirely emotionless and gradually develops them as he goes along. The scenes where he looks out on a rainbow (because even the most repressive regime in the world can't stop nature), feels the simple sensation running his hand along the banister and rescuing the puppy are a bit clichéd but ultimately irresistible. An amazing depiction of the most pervasive tyranny imaginable but at its' heart it is rotten to the core and easily destroyed (as William Fichtner's character says, take away the propaganda and drugs for one day and human nature will simply take its' course). There's no point being alive if we can't feel.If I was to have a favourite moment it would be when he's hooked to the lie detector at the end and all seems lost only for his emotions to flat-line, the technician's reaction being all we need to know!Great stuff!",Equilibrium
70,mattymatt4ever,An overlooked gem that is DEFINITELY worth a look,9,30 May 2003,"I won't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece!  First of all, the premise is very original and brings up some interesting concepts.  It's the 21st century, and all emotions have been outlawed.  It sounds strange on the surface, but the society feels that emotions lead to conflict, which can lead to war and destruction.  And having just finished World War 3, the society is fighting to make sure another war won't break out. 
Now, THIS is a sci-fi plot I can relate to.  This actually sounds like something that may happen in the future.  This is none of your ""Matrix"" or ""Star Wars Episode 1"" mumbo-jumbo.  I don't mind sci-fi as a genre, but for me to really be connected to a film, it has to be based in reality.  And just because a movie stretches the truth, doesn't mean it shouldn't contain any truth.  The ""Matrix"" films aren't based in reality; they're based in some crackhead alternate universe where a whole bunch of wacky things happen and the movie tries to make sense of it with a lot of pretentious sci-fi jargon that only geeks of the genre will fully absorb.  I don't have to be a sci-fi geek to understand ""Equilibrium.""  Christian Bale gives one of the best performances in his career, and I really felt for his character and his struggle.  There's also a great tension between his character and that of Taye Diggs, who envies his status as an officer.  My favorite moment, which actually sent me to tears, was when the squad was sent to murder a large group of canines, and Bale becomes hesitant as he picks up one of the cute little puppies, and feels incredibly sympathetic towards it since he just started to feel emotion.  And there's also a touching flashback, where his wife is arrested, yet he doesn't have any feelings about the event.  And I didn't even get to the spectacular action sequences, which are bound to give the Wachowski Brothers a run for their money!  The film was made on a low budget, so the effects aren't as high-tech as in ""The Matrix,"" but who said expensive effects make better action scenes?  They're even better, since they don't depend highly on CGI.  The scenes are so beautifully choreographed that I felt like I was watching a great John Woo film.  But part of what made the scenes work was the fact that I fully sympathized with Bale's character and his goal to rebel against the society that's trying to put him and everyone else down.  I also love the wonderful score, which at times sounds like the one from ""Broken Arrow""--which also worked wonderfully.  Good films come more often than you assume, but great films don't.  So I'm always proud to see a great film like this come along, and it's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and probably made peanuts at the box office.

71,KnightsofNi11,"So many flaws to wade through, but it's still awesome",6,11 August 2011,"Some science fiction is here to be deep. Some sci-fi is here to be intellectual. Some sci-fi is here to have a deep message. And some sci-fi is here just to be freaking awesome. Equilibrium falls under the latter category. The film is set in a futuristic dystopian society where the government has banned feeling, as they say it is the cause of all war and turmoil. One man who is in charge of enforcing this law decides to rebel one day and put a stop to this tyrannical regime.A premise like this is admittedly tricky to pull off. No one is allowed to show emotion of any kind, under penalty of death. However, the film breaks this rule often. Maybe I'm just cynical but I was constantly on the lookout for moments when this rule was broken, and these moments aren't hard to find. This script doesn't hold up very well against it's own rules and with some careful revision it would have stuck to the premise much better. Of course, with a premise like that you sort of corner yourself. Feeling is the basis of every human action, and so removing it from humans doesn't give you much wiggle room as to what you can and can't do. Thus, this film has some pretty big plot holes that stem from a premise that is so rigidly structured. Without these plot holes I don't know that the film would have gotten anywhere, but with a little less laziness from the writers it probably would have been a lot more interesting. A little more thought into this film could have gone a long way.But, in spite of these issues, I really enjoyed Equilibrium. The shootouts and fight scenes are just plain awesome. There's no two ways about it. There are some incredibly exciting moments with fantastic choreography, turning the fights into some of the slickest action you will ever see. The film as a whole is shot very well and has a great look to it, but the director's talent really shines during the fight scenes where we are handed some deliciously enticing shootouts mixed with wicked martial arts, all glazed over with a sweet soundtrack that makes you cackle with devilish pleasure. If you can stomach the weak script and get past the plot holes there are some things worth cheering about in this film.If the filmmakers had paid a little more attention to detail then Equilibrium would be an astonishingly brilliant film. It displays some seriously brilliant visual talent and every fight scene is better than the last. There are some incredible things about this film and then there are some not so incredible things. I don't know that one outweighs the other because I still had a lot of fun with this film. It is very disappointing to see a film with this much potential miss the mark, but it is by no means a disaster of a film. It's not a long film either, so I would say it is overall a worthwhile watch.",Equilibrium
72,gilgongo1980,I did not like the movie very much...,5,17 November 2019,"Because simply quality is missing.
It seems like a copy of the story of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" (1984) with the plot of ""The Matrix"" (1999).
The many fight and shooting scenes were unnatural, artificial and almost ridiculous.
For that there is a happy ending, I give 5/10.",Equilibrium
73,rainking_es,Fahrenheit 451 + Matrix,5,14 March 2007,"In a future time the human beings have forbidden the feelings and anything that can make people feel (books, music, dogs...), everyone's required to take some kind of drug that makes them stay perfectly numb. Of course, there's a group of rebels that will fight the power.Kurt Wimmer took some elements from ""1984"", ""A brand new world"" or even from ""Fahrenheit 451"" and put them at the service of a series of sequences that look a lot like ""Matrix"". Those who like movies that deal with martial arts may enjoy those karate-with-guns techniques.In short: it's an entertaining movie that does not contribute much to the futuristic-science-fiction genre. What's more remarkable about it is the cast, 'cause is full of reputed actors such as Emily Watson, or Christian Bale himself.*My rate: 5/10",Equilibrium
74,itamarscomix,"Well made, but predictable",6,24 May 2005,"Given the very poor overall quality of sci-fi movies released every year, maybe I don't have the right to complain about Equilibrium. After all, it's a well-made, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi movie in the finest tradition of the 'highest' prototype of the genre, with some great design ideas and highly impressive action scenes. And, to tell the truth. I quite enjoyed it. It sure was better than the Matrix Revolutions. It strikes me as peculiar, though, that with so many great sci-fi novels lying around just waiting to be adapted, this movie ever needed to be made. The plot of Equilibrium is so incredibly trite and predictable, I can practically spot which novel each aspect of it was taken from. Most of all it owes incredible amounts to 1984, while the fight scenes are inspired directly by The Matrix. The plot twists are predictable, and the ending immensely disappointing. There were more than a few 1984 rip-offs made before; check out Terry Gilliam's Brazil for one that managed to stay fresh and original. Equilibrium, on the other hand, makes no new statement and thus fails to justify its existence.A few words of praise, though, should go to the lead actors. Christian Bale is great in the main part, but I was more impressed with supporting actors Emily Watson and Sean Bean - Sean delivered a short performance, but nevertheless it was the best part of the movie. It can be safely said the story becomes more boring and more predictable as the story goes on, the deterioration beginning with the death of Bean's character, and hitting rock bottom with that of Watson's. The ending in particular is rushed, unconvincing and unimpressive. Matthew Harbour as Bale's son is especially wasted, as are all the lead villain characters. The final showdown is far too short and the happy ending too strained; it almost seems as if the last twenty minutes were glued on, like the fabricated happy ending Brazil got in its US version. Still, good acting, good photography, good pace (for the first hour and a half) and terrific fighting choreography make Equilibrium a nice watch. If you're a fan of the genre it's worth renting, but don't expect too much of it.",Equilibrium
75,MihaiSorinToma,A superb execution of a great idea,10,30 September 2018,"In a world which barely survived world war three, a new method of protection is forced to the population, that of denying every possible human emotion. Without any feelings, humans act like robots, having a linear and senseless life, this way excluding the threat of a new conflict. All of this is possible with a medicine which has to be administrated periodically. To ensure the execution of this ""law"", a group of clerics has been formed: human weapons which impose the Father's will at any cost and without any remorse. Things are about to change when the leader of the clerics stops taking the compulsory medicine and begins to have feelings about everything and everyone surrounding him, making it difficult to continue his beastly job. It's a movie which presents an dystopian post-apocalyptic world in which the clerics fight of the resistance which believe in feelings and do whatever they can in order to keep them. We follow Christian Bale's character, a cleric of the highest order as he starts experimenting with feelings, making him become a completely different person, for better or worse. The plot featured in this movie is one which I personally like very much. Complex, well described while put into picture with great scenery; it definitely is a great achievement. The whole world it presents and the ""evolution"" of the main character, described in detail, along with the actions he undergoes simply impressed me. From the characters' most basic actions to the incredible fight scenes, this one is a wonderful example of how to make such a movie.With plenty of complex characters, this film manages to create an incredible atmosphere, full of emotion, drama and suspense, made for every viewer to enjoy. From very well thought aspects regarding the plot to its breath-taking action sequences, it's clearly that this movie was made to impress. And boy, how it does it! This is one of those movies which left me breathless with every view, aging pretty well in my opinion, thus there isn't much to say about it, except praises of course. Thus, I'm going to stop here and let you see this masterpiece, one of Bale's greatest movies. Enjoy!",Equilibrium
76,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Terrifically awesome,10,30 August 2005,"A shame that this great film was given a limited release and was bashed for copy-catting 'The Matrix."" However, it has since been propelled to a much deserved cult status.The only real resemblance to 'The Matrix' here are the trench-coats, and in that movie the characters only wear them at the end. Flashy gun fights have been around for a long, long time and so has bullet dodging. I can remember bullet dodging back to the early 90s in 'Remo Williams.' So this film is an independent new idea in its own right. AND IT ROCKS! The sets, costumes, and action all show talent and make this look like a huge big budget epic. The central idea of regaining emotions is presented well with Christian Bale giving a very good performance. Also despite the lack of extensive CGI some of the gunfights and action scenes blow other movies right out of the water, most notably an awesome hallway battle towards the end. Each fight scene has cool camera tricks that make CGI totally unnecessary and as a result the action looks and feels much more real. However, probably much more importantly, the story is among the most interesting in recent sci-fi films. While some argue its originality this sure doesn't rip off any recent sci-fi movie and while the idea has been dealt with before, the superior realization here is more than enough to see this film.So if your in for a good visionary action thriller watch this. You won't be disappointed. I rate it 10/10 Rated R: intense violence",Equilibrium
77,FilmOtaku,Mine was definitely off after seeing this load,2,6 November 2004,"*Spoilers*'Equilibrium', written and directed by Kurt Wimmer is a bad movie. A bad, BAD movie. Borrowing a little from Lucas, a little from Bradbury & Orwell and a lot from the 'The Matrix', (unfortunately, none of the good parts) it tells the story of society in a fascist future that looks pretty similar to the Cultural Revolution, only with cooler weapons and lots of chrome. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a guy who walks around in priest's robes (I think he's actually called a priest, but I don't remember and honestly don't care to) kicking the asses of people who exhibit emotion and listen to Leo Sayer albums. Well, any albums, really. Culture is not welcome in this society thankyouverymuch, and Preston is the man to sniff it out and take care of the perpetrators. Unfortunately, in a life-altering epiphany (he was listening to an album that a woman he's hot for was hoarding) he decides that he can't do this anymore, so he joins the omnipresent Underground Movement who basically sees him for the sucker he is and enlist him to kill the big cheese so that society will then be free. Meanwhile, Preston is dogged by Brandt (Taye Diggs), another priest guy who wants to expose him for the turncoat he is.I almost don't have the energy to go into why 'Equilibrium' is so bad. Perhaps it is the 'Matrix'-esque action sequences, only these are closer to the third 'Matrix' film in terms of laughability and execution. I tried to explain it away logically; it's low budget. Nope, it had a budget of $20 million, there's no excuse. It was made by a 10 year old. Nope, Wimmer is past his teens. I can't excuse this one. The special effects sucked, the continuity was ridiculous (as tuned in to films as I am, I generally don't catch gaffes and continuity issues on my own, but I counted at least three glaring examples) and the story was bogus. It also had the most ineffective 'villains' I have seen this side of a Disney flick. Taye Diggs proves to be the MOST ineffective when the swords are drawn, and Dupont, (nice name) the big cheese played by Angus Macfadyen, literally made me laugh out loud with his slap-fight technique of combat. I'm not even going to talk about Emily Watson as the love interest (with about five minutes of aggregate film time) because I respect her enough to give her a pass this one time.It's been awhile since I saw a movie as crappy as this one, so I'm actually kind of glad I saw it; it reiterated how much better 98% of films are. Poor shiny-faced Christian Bale. I have a feeling that Christopher Nolan saw this and said, 'We need to save this guy's career' and cast him as Bruce Wayne. I hated this movie. 2/10 (Because I just feel so sorry for Emily Watson)Shelly",Equilibrium
78,Maziun,Hideously awful movie,2,26 August 2014,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS""Equilibrium"" is obviously not an original movie. It borrows elements from books and movies like ""Fahrenheit 451"" , ""1984"", ""Metropolis"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Brazil"", ""The Matrix"", ""Dark city"" , ""Brave new world"" , ""THX 1138"" , and probably few more. Lack of originality isn't a sin that destroys the movie for me. The whole pop culture takes already used ideas and very often transforms them into something new and exciting. For example Batman was inspired by Zorro , vampire and detective stories , yet it stands today as a very powerful and original symbol. ""Equilibrium"" however doesn't add NOTHING that you haven't seen before and feels like a emotionless (oh , the irony ) copy of copy of copy. The lack of originality is the least problem of this movie. ""Equilibrium"" is a incredibly stupid movie that thinks it's intellectual , while only someone with a mindset of 8 year old will find it artistic , deep or thought provoking. Common sense , logic or plausibility gets thrown out of the window from the very beginning.  The basic premise is simply unbelievable. A futuristic society which is dumb enough to believe that the mere existence of paintings, poems and sculptures can somehow lead to WW4 ?  The headquarters of the government which bans artwork has a statue and stylish architecture. There is even a library full of books about the governments ideology !  If the drugs prevent the people from feeling, why the need to destroy art, since it's not going to make anyone feel anything?  A culture based on taking a drug every morning is not a very plausible idea either  The drug kills peoples emotions so basically they should be cold , emotionless robots , right ? It makes no sense for a culture with no emotions to still be able to fall in love, choose a spouse and desire sex to create children.  The emotionless characters express emotions and crack facial expressions  The main hero displays his emotions so obviously that it's just impossible for nobody from the government to not notice that .  Why would a squad surround someone to shoot them? They would end up wiping themselves out in the cross-fire.  The twist with main hero's kids was obvious and unconvincing  Half the people that our main hero attacks are just standing there , waiting to be killed.  There is no entertainment in this world. People are listening to speeches of the big boss who tells them everything they already know for years.  The police doesn't have shatter-proof helmet glass . If somebody breaks the helmet glass they seem to die  It seems that the rebels are sitting in rooms with paintings and LP records and poetry books all day.  Gun kata doesn't make sense. Statistics CAN'T make you dodge bullets. It also doesn't explain superhuman strength and agility . The superpowers made sense in the cyberworld of ""Matrix"" , but this is REAL WORLD.  The ""Underground"", where most of the rebels lay hidden, is right beneath the glass pathways on the streets of the mega metropolisThe direction is also pure CRAP . If you want to show how main hero is discovering humanity give him Beethoven , snowball and cute puppy. Oh , please The action scenes are completely forgettable , too flashy and devoted of any excitement. The acting is the strongest point of the movie. Christian Bale gives a great performance , while Sean Bean , Emily Watson and Taye Diggs give solid support. The costumes and sets are OK. Those are the only redeeming qualities of this movie.Why this movie has such good rating (7.6) on IMDb is beyond me , especially considering the low rating at Rotten tomatoes (26%). It's MTV version of far better movies. Kurt Wimmer later made EVEN MORE (impossible , I know) horrible movies – ""Ultraviolet"" and ""Law abiding citizen"". In normal world he would be cleaning the streets by now.I give it 2/10.",Equilibrium
79,witster18,made for 1 million$ masterpiece,8,21 November 2006,"This is obviously a work of passion for first time director Kurt Wimmer. The film is full of good ideas and excellent action scenes. Christian Bale and Taye Diggs are excellent as adversaries. There are some production short-comings...you can tell they were running low on cash. The fight choreography and the cinematography are very good. Wimmer was meticulous with the details and did a fantastic job considering the budget. This film is about even with Matrix...both are very good and just shy of excellent.....but the ending of Equilibrium pays off better than the Matrix. Highly Recommended! If you like sci-fi you WILL NOT BE Disappointed! Good subplots and story development! My favorite sleeper for 2002! I realize the estimated budget listed here, but in the director's commentary he says it fell BELOW 1 million! That's AMAZING to me. Usually Sci-fi with similar budget constraints are some of the worst movies you could watch. 84/100 In the director's commentary he mentions a budget just under 1 million, around the moment when he was talking about using the barely modified '02 Cadillac, and fire-truck..",Equilibrium
80,Superunknovvn,Mixture of some good movies,7,31 May 2003,"Finally I got to see this movie which I was so looking forward to. ""Equilibrium"" is solid, considering the low budget it is even more than that: top actors (except for Cleric's boss, he's annoying as hell), insane martial arts and convincing scenery. However, all in all the movie borrows too heavily from ""1984"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"" in my opinion. There is also some ""Gattaca"" in there.  The story is sometimes illogical and not too surprising. The ending isn't too hard to figure out (although it's pretty well made) and after all I had the feeling that I'd seen this before. Sounds pretty negative but I did enjoy the movie. I just didn't think it's anything special. 7/10",Equilibrium
81,PersianPlaya408,A good sci-fi type thriller about the future,8,8 August 2005,"Kurt Wimmer's Sci-fi thriller, was surprisingly good. The story takes place in the future, world is heading in a bad direction. No art, no music, etc they believe all these things are responsible for war therefore anybody who owns art, music, etc is betraying the government, and is to be killed by special police lead by clerics. The story becomes interesting when one cleric (bale) begins to question the system. The film has very good direction, story and premise. The acting is first-rate, except for Taye Diggs who I din't like much, Bale, bean and Watson shined though. The script is good, and direction is solid by Wimmer who had directed nothing notable before this. His script is good, better than The Recruit which is the only other film written by Wimmer that I have seen. Equilibrium had some very good gun and action sequences as well, only problem I had with it was the fact that it borrowed from so many other movies or pieces of literature. However I guess with this kind of plot you can't be completely original, however I did enjoy this film, despite it being a bit too long. 8/10",Equilibrium
82,ThurstonHunger,Prozac Nation - The Action-Packed Version,5,16 July 2007,"Watching this on a Sunday night seemed the right approach... especially after having a week off. Better take a double dose of human suppressant before returning to work tomorrow in order to maximize efficiency, and forget this film.Nah, it wasn't that bad, Christian Bale saves the film *and* the underground. It is however a bullet ballet. While those rounds miraculously never strike Bale, they do get in the way of his acting. I didn't listen to the commentary tracks, but on the three-minute blurbette feature, the director did seem rather giddy talking about Gun-Kata.Sigh...So really, I should have hated this film. But your honor, the defendant was caught red-handed showing feelings. The film doesn't break any walls, Pink Floyd's or otherwise. Also the film steers pretty much clear of any religious persecution, well there is a comment about faith and the ol' ""opiates for the masses"" line gets trotted out...well, and the fascist force is named the Tetragrammaton. But it's not YHWH, but apparently TTTT?Somewhere around the 100th faceless stormtrooper gunned down, I quietly surrendered. At first I wondered if they had families (in the film, kids in general were the interesting angle that this film just grazed...teenagers and the burgeoning psych drug industrial complex would be interesting.) Then I wondered if actors who played the stormtroopers would rent the film and slow-mo it for their friends and family...""that's me...the third on the left...no, wait...on the right"") Hell at least the puppies were conscientiously killed off-screen. I'm not sure if violence in a film desensitizes me to violence in real life, but it does tend to desensitize me to said film.I guess a battle cry of ""Death to Death Squads,"" I can sympathize with it to a degree but it is a bit of a bitter pill to take over and over again. Maybe I'll skip mine tomorrow...and maybe you'll pass on this film.5/10 Soylent Green Lantern aka Thurston Hunger",Equilibrium

84,jlthornb51,Fine Science Fiction and A Stunning Emily Watson Performance,10,17 June 2015,"A fascinating science fiction film written and directed by the gifted Kurt Wimmer. A bit reminiscent of 1984 but still quite original and intensely creative film that basically examines the nature of human freedom through an existential lens. At times this is an action movie but it is also deeply thoughtful and even emotionally moving. Christian Bale is excellent as an enforcer of the status quo who comes to question the new dogma in which he has been indoctrinated since childhood. The ultimate question arises, ""what must we sacrifice to be completely safe and secure?"" One character, Mary O'Brien, is an example of those who believe the sacrifice is simply more than they are willing to make. It's a role played to perfection by the wonderful Emily Watson and she has never been more powerful or glowingly lovely. Her simple beauty accentuates the character's beliefs, her sensuality, and her eyes express more feeling than 50 pages of dialog. It is indeed a performance that didn't receive the recognition it deserved at the time of the film's release but which will stay with audiences forever. Her final scene in the film is one of the most memorable ever filmed and a haunting image that will remain etched bold in the history of cinema.",Equilibrium
85,Antagonisten,Entertaining,8,18 November 2004,"Ever since The Matrix arrived it seems everybody is trying to make ""the thinking man's action movie"" (even though i think that the ""thinking"" in The Matrix is somewhat overrated). Mixing a more or less plausible plot with stylish action scenes, Equilibrium borrows heavily from many different sources. But mainly from the novel ""1984"".We are in the future, society is some sort of Nazi/Communist-inspired vision of the perfect existence. Emotions are outlawed, everything is built in massive gray concrete (complete with huge banners and epic symbols) and the police is ruthlessly enforcing law and order. Walking in a straight line and chanting is everybodys favorite pastime. Also, all kinds of emotions are outlawed. Everybody uses a drug called ""Prozium"" which dampens emotions, and special police that can ""sense"" when someone is feeling are constantly trying to root out ""sense-offenders"" as those who feel emotions are called.Of course the idea of emotions being outlawed is rather silly, and of course completely unbelievable. How would society progress (in fact: how would babies be made?) without love or arousal for instance? Also people in this movie are married and have children which would make the concept even more questionable. Not to mention that even the leaders in this film manages to display emotion most of the time, even when telling the main character the importance of NOT feeling. But if you can swallow and digest this particular piece of plot this movie is not a bad take on the ""1984"" big brother-idea.The effects look somewhat artificial at times (showing that this is indeed not a high-budget movie), but the action scenes are mostly well made. I would have to say that the action-scenes are easily above most of the action movies made today, even the more expensive ones. Also the acting is what i would rate as above-par for an action-film. Christian Bale does a good job looking like the torn-inside supercop that he is. Also Angus McFadyen and Taye Diggs perform well in their sinister roles.Silly parts of the plot aside, this is surely an entertaining ride. It reminds me of Asian cinema. The way the plot is clearly secondary to the action, and where you can expect to be served pulse-raising action that is enjoyable. At least as long as you can turn off the part of your brain that demands coherence and plausibility.I rate this 6/10.",Equilibrium
86,verbusen,Don't You Kill My Puppy! Stupid Film Ripoff For Today's Masses That Don't Know Better,5,22 April 2006,"This is by far one of the stupidest films I have ever seen. I guess I'm taking its point too literally but these ""clerics"" are arresting people for ""sense offense""? I mean c'mon, this is a liberals delight I guess, the plot line on IMDb says a futuristic ""fascist"" society, I think the more appropriate description would have been totalitarian or theocratic society, but I guess this movie is geared for people who fear the big brother factor and those are mostly the paranoid left (although there are the tin foil hat right wingers out there also). The sense cops come from a building with a big cross on it (oh gee is that a Christian slam? Lefties delight there bash religion). I'm sorry but the people are just showing way to much emotion for me to get into this flick, isn't a smile showing emotion? Well, why didn't they arrest the leads new partner because that guy is smiling with delight at kicking people's asses. They also took out the only known actor I saw, Sean Bean in the first 20 minutes, he should have stayed alive and helped overturn this society. But what really jerked my chain was are we really supposed to suspend all belief that a white dominated totalitarian society that kills people that have senses would tolerate people of another color? I mean if you are trying to avoid all confrontation you are going to make your sick society homogeneous and all the people will be the same race, thats pretty obvious to me. Movie has awfully high marks here from THOUSANDS of reviewers, I sense they are younger viewers who have not seen the original THX 1138 or Blade Runner, if they had they would probably turn this off as I just did 45 minutes into it, very stupid movie (although it is better than Farenheight 411, probably due to the effects we can do cheap now). 5 of 10 just to be generous and at least they tried to make a mindless action flick with a message.",Equilibrium
87,PyroSikTh,Awesome and Awful All at Once,8,21 May 2021,"Equilibrium is a philosophical dystopian sci-fi kung-fu movie in the same vein as The Matrix. Both deal with thought-provoking themes and are desperate to be deeper than just your average action movie. Both centre around a dystopian future where humanity is stripped of its freedoms. Both blend gunfights and martial arts to create their own fight scenes 100% full of style and considerably lacking in realism. That's just about where the comparisons end though. Equilibrium follows John Preston, a Cleric of the police state of Libria. Clerics are charged with dealing with the disobedient masses who refuse to have their emotions suppressed by the mandatory drug Prozium. Key to this role in society is getting rid of all art and expressions of individuality, and for some reason this also requires the relentless training in a new martial art called Gun-kata, which utilises various martial arts poses in order to create ""maximum efficiency"" with ranged weaponry. However, John Preston, as the most rewarded and highest-ranking cleric, goes through a bit of a breakdown when he decides to try life without Prozium, and feel emotions for the first time.This movie is equal parts silly and absolutely amazing, sometimes at the same time, sometimes intentionally, and sometimes surprisingly for a movie of its calibre. Obviously I find the most enjoyment in its more fascinating scenes and ideas, and for me they more than make up for its ridiculous moments that require you to leave your brain at the door. That a movie could be so awful and so great at the same time is beyond my comprehension.For all intents and purposes, Equilibrium is a straight-to-DVD B-movie. Everything in this movie looks cheap, from the painted-white Cadillacs, the blank stone walls that line almost every scene, the questionable CGI, and even the dialogue that barely feels refined or touched up at all. And yet there's something oddly quite charming about it all. It manages to offset the cheesy one-liners with often too-on-the-nose, but no less insightful, philosophical musings over what it's like to be human, and while the visual quality is cheap, there's something about it that oozes cool from its simplicity. The emotionless state is bathed in greys and whites which looks dull and cheap, but that's kind of the point. Art and colour is prohibited through fear of the emotions they may incite.The emotionless state is what makes Equilibrium such an intriguing watch from a plot perspective. While it can feel a little Matrix-y and stereotypically dystopian at times, it manages to remain wholly unique. It's an effortless pastiche of different dystopian societies we've all seen before. The police state is run by a semi-religious sect of clerics who enact the law of Father, the dictatorial leader of Libria, who gives impassioned (ironic, right?) Hitleresque speeches to people with no emotions to feel roused by. But the Grammaton Clerics are more like warrior monks with their own unique fighting style and superior gunplay to their adversaries, looking effortlessly cool while they do it in long white trenchcoats buttoned all the way down (opposed to the Matrix style of having them flowing about).On that note, the action sequences in this movie are ridiculous. Ridiculously awesome. There's no sense of realism at all. Preston slides into a dark room, everything goes black, and then he eliminates every single hostile by only moving his arms. It looks stupid, but it also really tickles my preteen brain with all kinds of awe. He's surrounded by armoured police in too-close range to shoot, so he pistol-whips them all to death at the same time using the same gun-kata techniques he would normally. At one point he even uses gun-kata with freaking shotguns, blowing the faces of two guys at point blank range. Even when the scene in the corridor where every adversary had worse accuracy than stormtroopers, it didn't matter, because watching John Preston go absolutely ham with ""maximum efficiency"" tickles every action bone in your body. And don't even get me started on the final fight of the movie that's just Preston and Dupont trying and failing to shoot each other in the head for five minutes. It stupid, but it just looks so cool. Every fight scene just oozes with style.The soundtrack is also awesome, reinforcing the religious subtext with monumental choirs that build and wail over moments of intense emotion, and turning Preston into an almost Jesus-like figure. The strings and guitars unashamedly rip-off Hans Zimmer's score for Mission: Impossible 2, while the electronic percussion is exactly the kind of sample library you'd find in any modern-set gothic action movie of that time period (looking at you Underworld). The way I describe it makes it sound derivative and awful, but it's applied so perfectly, and I'm certainly not one to hate on tracks and motifs being reused and repurposed from movie-to-movie.But honestly, the entire success of the film lies on the shoulders of Christian Bale. This was maybe the second movie I'd ever seen him in, but between this and Reign of Fire he'd made a fan of me. Equilibrium wouldn't have been half as good without his sheer talent carrying the entire movie. The way he transitions from unfeeling cleric, top of his class, to emotional mess is fantastic. While the script and dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, he chews it up and spits it back out with such conviction that it's easy to root for him and get carried along on Preston's path of self rediscovery. The moment he first truly experiences art to Beethoven's 9th Symphony is an emotionally charged watch, and his complete breakdown in public; curled on the floor in grief, is filled with such tension. Sean Bean comes up close behind as fellow emotionally compromised cleric Partridge, as well as Emily Watson as Mary O'Brien facing incineration for her feelings, but there's a lot to be desired from Taye Diggs and Angus Macfadyen. Sean Pertwee and William Fichtner are also pretty great in their small roles, but they're honestly not given all that much to work with. Fichtner barely even appears until the end of the second act.Yes, Gun-kata is silly, but my god is it really cool to watch. Yes, the idea of an emotionless society is ridiculous when you break it down (how would a society without love procreate?), and it's not particularly executed very well (just look at Taye Diggs' arrogant smirk throughout half the movie), but without it we wouldn't have Bale's brilliant performance as he descends out of darkness and sees the light. The score is unoriginal but rousing and brimming with religious tints. The production design and CGI is questionable at best, but makes the most of its simplicity. Equilibrium is not a great movie by any means, but I can't help but love it nonetheless. It knows exactly what it is and is unashamed of its ridiculousness, while also injecting legitimate philosophical musings that makes it a dichotomy of serious and tongue-in-cheek. I just love it, warts and all. I give Equilibrium a ridiculously over-the-top 8/10.",Equilibrium
88,CinematicInceptions,Fairly interesting with acute similarities to other dystopian future films. Worth a watch for the action or plot basis.,7,6 November 2014,"Equilibrium will always be compared to the Matrix because of their similar style of action, use of of a nearly mono-hue color scheme, a dystopian future plot, and an overall feel that is reminiscent of the other when you watch one of them. I rate them both at an 8.5/10, which is actually kind of coincidental since I appreciated different elements in each of them. However, I will end the comparisons here by stating simply that I felt the Matrix was done better mostly due to its budget, but that it sits as equal to Equilibrium due to the rather disorienting beginning. Anyway, enough with the Matrix, I'll review that later. We have seen the scenarios displayed in this film many times in movies and literature. To any fan of dystopian future stories that is considering viewing this, I would say that it is a blend of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, The Matrix, and Divergent. We see elements of the four other works in Equilibrium in a balanced blend, though of course Divergent didn't come out until this movie's 10th anniversary. There is censorship to reduce feeling like in Fahrenheit, the use of sedative drugs like in Divergent (though it is more pronounced here), and the use of the idea of an enemy whose existence is unknown like in 1984. The ""character"" of Father is also similar to Big Brother from 1984. So it certainly fits the dystopian/communist bill. The main goal of the government is naturally to make a perfect society, and their means are a drug that theoretically strips the subject of emotion. The government also destroys all feeling inducing things of past societies like in Fahrenheit 451. This practice works in accord with the killing of anyone who is suspected of ""sense offense"". This is another parallel to 1984, in which ""thought criminals"" are erased from society. This brings us to our main character, John Preston, who carries out the governments orders by terminating all items and people who threaten the system. He turns against the his government when he forgets, whether intentionally or not, to take his daily dose. He continues to do this and begins to embrace the wonderful, well, feelings that come from it. This may have been inspired by his former partner, Partridge, played by Sean Bean. I'll spoil it now for prospective viewers and tell you that Sean Bean's character dies very early due to suspected sense offense, which is what may have inspired Preston. Preston, in turn, is suspected by his new partner Brandt, who is an interesting character. It is hard to tell whether or not he conforms to the system throughout, and as a viewer, you don't know whether to trust or like him. For me it was a little sad when Preston cuts his face clean off at the end. That lovely image is a great lead in to the action element. I found the sequences to be pretty cool and exciting and once again reminiscent of The Matrix. There is nothing supernatural about the action, but there are lots of machine guns along with a contact fights (though none that should have given it the R rating that it holds). The style of action is rather unconventional and has the feel of strobe lights to it, but is nonetheless cool and intense. Preston is the epitome of the communist police force that he works for and has mastered all of their combative poses so well that it almost looks like second nature. There is enough action to please anyone looking for a strictly action movie, but it is not a battle driven plot, so I will give you fair warning that there are long segments where only the story progresses and the action scenes take the backseat for a time. Mostly the story is driven by Preston's progression of feeling. He goes from destroying those who feel, to empathizing for them, to openly assisting them. We as the audience see his feelings clearly, but I found it hard to grasp what the society defined as feeling. Preston talks about how he can figure out if somebody is committing a sense offense, but that can be betrayed in something as small as a twitch of the eye or a change in tone. This goes back to Brandt's character enigma. His words portray him as a law abiding citizen that does his job as a cleric well. However, his mannerisms speak with a personality that is essentially forbidden in the dystopian society. This plot point make it difficult to ridicule the acting, rather like with the ""bewitched"" girls in the Crucible. In both cases, the characters are acting themselves, so there is no real way of telling when it is the character or the actor that is giving an unconvincing performance. The execution otherwise had a distinct style that sort of matched the stone-like feel of the whole picture. everything was almost grayscale apart from the scenes showing the hideouts of the resistance. Now I know that literary analysts probably went nuts over the symbolism of that, but I won't be joining them here. I can't really articulate any specific critiques of the rest of the execution, but I suppose they filmmakers did a good job, because the overall effect of the movie on me was to spark interesting thoughts. Besides, there are plenty of opinions about execution in other people's reviews. No movie is perfect, and the more people say good or bad things about a movie, the more they will be contradicted with equally convincing arguments. So watch Equilibrium for a cinematic adrenaline rush or for fresh ideas, but expect the unexpected in terms of style.",Equilibrium

The choreography in cinematography are indeed superb, including and especially inventive hand-to-hand gunfight toward the end of the film.But really, Equilibrium is essentially Fahrenheit 451 with loads more violence. In fact, thematically it seems there might be an unintended message accompanying the theme that emotion is vital to humanity, given that it is violent emotions which are ultimately the dominant ones in this movie. It just seems unbefitting that salvation in this movie ultimately comes through excessive violence.",Equilibrium

I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, since there are some things that aren't very logical and the whole ""gun kata"" sometimes looks cool and sometimes very stupid and not believable, even for a form of ""gun fu"". Still, the movie manages to entertain and plays around with interesting ideas while having great performances of actors and for that, I will give it 8.5/10! I recommend it!",Equilibrium
91,moviemanMA,One spark...,7,7 August 2005,"For many years, novels have been written about futuristic worlds with certain elements of daily life taken away. Fahrenheit 451 dealt with brainwashing and literature outlawed. THX 1138 is about a society where all personal freedoms are taken away and everyone is under surveillance. This eerie view of the future makes for a great story and many of these have been turned into movies.Equilibrium is about one of those societies. Here we have a society that enforces strict rules about certain items that people cannot possess. These items might invoke feelings of any kind. Art, literature, music, or anything of this nature is collected and destroyed. The 'Father' has demanded that no one have emotions. This is done thanks to the breakthrough drug called Prozium II, a small capsule injected into the neck at certain times of the day. It is here that the government has a task force out to capture and ""process"" any offenders of the law. Special agents known as Cleric's eliminate these people with swift, agile moves...and the help of some powerful handguns. The agency's top Cleric is John Preston (Christian Bale), the most lethal of all the Clerics. He has just discovered that his partner Partidge (Sean Bean) has been sneaking out into the ruins outside the city walls referred as the ""nether"". Partridge has ceased taking his Prozium and has developed feelings and a taste for reading, an offense punishable by death. Preston must carry out the order to ""process"" his partner.After breaking one of his Prozium capsules, Preston goes to get another replacement so he can't feel. But delays inhibit this and he and his new partner Cleric Brandt (Taya Diggs) go out on another bust. This time, Preston doesn't know how to react due to his temporary drug free state of mind. He begins to realize why Partridge stopped injecting the drug...emotions were a key element to the human state of being. After finding and arresting an offender named Mary (Emily Watson), he realizes that she isn't a bad person. The thought of killing her makes him think of his own wife's execution due to her being off her drugs. At the time he couldn't feel anything, now he can.What follows is an intense battle against right vs. wrong. The struggle between Preston and the government. He must keep his emotions secret or he too will be terminated. Bale is very believable as the tormented Cleric. He gives the character no emotions at first followed by a realization of what he has missed; sadness, happiness, and anger, which may work with his unbelievable killing abilities. Much like other works of this kind, Equilibrium shows us when a government has total control, the people are helpless. All it needs is one spark...aka John Preston. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer (wrote The Recruit) invites us on a wild ride through a new world full of lies, death, and struggle in a society that seems perfect...to some. To others this is inhumane. To the resistance this is a time to rise up and take back their lives and win their freedom.Equilibrium is a great addition to any science fiction lover's collection. It has a great storyline that stays true to its genre. A good cast makes this world come to life. It's hard to think of a society with no emotions. A society ruled by one man...one drug. With one look you can be executed. A force rises up from underground...all it needs is one spark...",Equilibrium
92,Flagrant-Baronessa,Brainless and show-offy,2,28 June 2006,"Equilibrium follows a government agent (Christian Bale) in a totalitarian future in which all forms of feeling is outlawed and punishable by death (!). The conflict is that this agent gradually finds himself torn between obeying the strict orders to eliminate criminals and free will and feeling. This film is a big disappointment on almost every level and fails all that it attempts to be (a totalitarian story) and convey (a totalitarian tone).It borrowsno, stealsits key ideas and literary devices from the most well-known dystopian novels. The use of socially prescribed drugs to keep people sedated is from Brave New World. The use of a kind of 'thought-police' (what Bale is) is from Nineteen-Eighty-Four. Bale's relationship with a woman (Emily Watson) who tempts him to deviate from cold conformity is also from Nineteen-Eighty-Four. The banning and burning of books and art is from Fahrenheit 451. Even totally trivial things like fight-scenes are stolen from The Matrix, as well as all other stylistic things that end up being inappropriate and over-the-top for the story it tells. In short, Equilibrium does not have one ounce of originality to save itself. It is simply a poor mish-mash of great literature.The icing on the cake of a terrible film is the cheesy Hollywood approach to everything. When faced with totalitarian danger, Bale simply goes around blazing his guns and acting like he's the baddest mofo on the planet in doing so. That completely discards any bleak and totalitarian tone it was aiming for, because, who would ever worry if we had a hero like Bale to save us at the end of the day? Lame.Not even serious eye-candy in the form of Sean Bean, Christian Bale, Taye Diggs and Dominic Purcell can save this utterly dire film. I know I said it was a disappointment on ""almost"" every level, meaning it must have had some redeeming parts to itand I am desperately trying to think of some to support my statement. But seriously, I can't think of any. Sean Bean, maybe. Is that enough?",Equilibrium

Ruining any kind of a story.Actually the acting from Christian Bale is not too bad, and Sean Bean at the start, the rest are a bit bland , the music is average, but with all the gun action, it doesn't matter, it could be well made or not, but the content just ruins any chance of it being good, the shooting scenes are ridiculous.Its just a film for idiots and retards and psychos who go into school with a semi-automatic and kill several students. I don't recommend this to anyone under 24 and anyone over 24 with a normal personality will not like it.I'll probably get dissed by the retards who like this stuff, I give it a 2 for Christian Bale and Sean Bean.

94,TheEmulator23,An excellent film and our lack of control of ones self.,9,10 September 2007,"This is a film that hasn't been seen by many, but should be seen by all. This film starred a then sparsely known Christian Bale. I imagine a big part of the reason he got the role of Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" and the upcoming sequel ""The Dark Knight,"" was because of his excellent portrayal of someone struggling w/ his emerging emotions. This film has a lot to offer for everyone. There is some deep thinking about how most Wars and other horrible events are because of our lack or loss of control of our emotions and feelings. At first you see why we might want to just do away with all things in order to live peaceful lives. But throughout the film you see that even though our feelings are the reason we kill and hurt one another, it is also the reason we are what we are as the human race. There is a lot of things that are definitely thought provoking, but for those that don't care about that, there is also some excellent fighting and gun battles. I don't think that you will really appreciate this film if you are under the age of 21, as your thought process and your experience in life is pretty much non-existent. I don't mean that coldly, but unless you have lived outside the easiness that is High School, this film won't really make a lot of sense to you. If you are under that age and can get the message, I say congratulations because you are more mature than most your age. Please watch this completely and preferably in one sitting, and don't just skip to the gun-Kata sequences, in order to fully appreciate the message/warning of this excellent film. Even though this is written and directed by the same man who did the god-awful ""UltraViolet,"" please don't let that stop you from watching this.",Equilibrium
95,Scars_Remain,Better Than The Matrix? I Think So,10,15 May 2008,"This film is very similar to 1999's The Matrix with the spectacular visual effects, awesome action sequences and mind-blowing gun fights. However, I liked Equilibrium even better than The Matrix. I don't know what it was about it but I just simply loved everything about it and I think it truly deserves a space on IMDb's top 250.Christian Bale gives a perfect performance as the man in a government where it is illegal to feel so he decides to overturn the system. All the other actors/actresses are wonderful in this film. I loved the story, it's almost like A Clockwork Orange in that this neo-fascist government is controlling everyone to prevent anything bad from happening.

96,PeterRoeder,Interesting but logically flawed,8,25 February 2006,"I didn't see all of this movie but I'd like to comment on what I saw. It looked like an awesome martial arts movie. Christian Bale, who was good as Patrick Bateman and phenomenal as Batman, plays this awesome Bruce Lee guy who is a martial arts expert. Compared to ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit"" which are the stories this movie is inspired by I found it logically incoherent that martial ARTs isn't outlawed in that society. If Beethoven, love and animals and all art is outlawed why isn't martial arts outlawed as well? This is quite ridiculous. Anyway, it still looked like a pretty awesome movie. I just had to go to bed so I couldn't finish it. Christian Bale is an amazing physical actor. In this review I just wanted to point to the logical flaw of martial arts being allowed in a Nazi-Marxist dystopia. Take my word for it: Martial arts WOULD NOT be allowed in such a society.",Equilibrium
97,Meven_Stoffat,"Great action, awesome visuals, bad characters, unoriginal/nonexistent story, rushed movie",5,7 September 2009,"Since this movie had so many rave reviews and quite a few friends of mine were telling me about how awesome it is, I decided to rent this movie because, for one, I love Christian Bale. I became a fan after seeing him in Newsies, which, while being a so-so movie at best, was worth it for Bale alone. Who thought he could sing very well? He was also in American Psycho, and a few other movies that I love. ALso, I love action movies, I'm a huge fan of dystopian stories and It seemed very Matrix-ish.Let's get right down to the good: The action scenes are incredible. Some of the best I've seen in any movie. In fact, they alone save the movie from being downright awful. The action at the end was awesome too, and it was well shot and edited. No shaky camera, no rapid edits, the viewer can tell what's going on in the scenes. Also, no speed ups or slow motion, it's raw and down to earth. As for the visuals- the movie was shot on a very low budget, but even then they look great. The dystopian look really enhances the dark tones of the movie. Bale gives a great performance here, this is one of his better performances.However, that can't save the movie from being confusing and disjointed. The plot is really hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on, and at times it tried to echo The Matrix. Part of the reason The Matrix kicks serious ass is because the way it was done was incredible- when I watched the Matrix for the first time I was blown away, and I had not seen a movie like it. In fact, maybe had I not seen The Matrix before seeing Equilibrium, I might have liked Equilibrium more. Also, as much as I love the action scenes, at the same time I was wondering how it was possible that Bale's character had God like powers. The Matrix's scenes were more realistic in the sense that you knew why Neo had these godlike powers. Equilibrium offers no explanation, instead we're left wondering what the reasoning behind all of this is.Another negative point is the characters. None of the characters seemed to catch my attention at all. I personally couldn't care less if Bale died or not, and are we really supposed to feel sorry for Watson's character? I was just glad I didn't have to watch her anymore. As for Bale's character's kids, they were pointless and were out of place with the plot. Especially the son. In fact, when I saw that he was dressed like Bale, I laughed out loud. As for his acting, he sounded like he was reading off a teleprompter. Most of his dialogue was just him giving plot points away.In short, this movie is really a mixed bag. When it's good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's downright awful.",Equilibrium

In the future man is not allowed to feel as the feelings lie at the bottom of every evil which mankind has witnessed. Christian Bale is a ""cleric"", the highest order in the hierarchy of fighters who are destroying all the sense offending substances like books,music,movies and posters. The inspiration for this is clearly the seminal book Fahrenheit 451. The movie takes a turn when Bale stops taking the substance which suppresses his feelings. The action scenes are superb and will stay with you for a long time after the movie has finished. Bale is top notch as the hunter who becomes the sympathizer. Sean Bean is effective in a small but meaningful role. the script is good and the movie moves at a breakneck pace. 4 out of 5 for this. deserves to be rated as one of the best futuristic movies.",Equilibrium
99,Silverzero,"Eloquent, voluble sci-fi with stunning fight sequences.",6,8 August 2003,"`Gattaca' meets `Logan's Run' in what can hardly be described as a rip-off of `The Matrix'. On the surface, this bares resemblance- cold, sterile future with Keanu Reeves lookalikes in huge overcoats. But the plot itself contains none of the rag-tag gung-ho plot points present in `The Matrix' movies. An intriguing science fiction movie, `Equilibrium' is an entertaining B movie with the credentials of an A-list blockbuster.
Pretty much ignored upon initial release, average fare at the box-office and hit-and-miss reviews from the critics certainly didn't help, but said film has found favour here on the IMDb, receiving an eye-raising score of 7.8. `Equilibrium' (great title by the way) is best when not taken seriously. The emotional hokum is surprisingly convincing, but the fight sequences are where the film really hits a home run. Made sporadic enough to value, instead of thrown in at every possible turn, the carefully choreographed manoeuvring is snappily executed. The movie has been compared to `The Matrix Reloaded' on many occasions. I can honestly say that `Equilibrium' is, by far, the better picture. `Reloaded' was just so vapid and superficial- clunky dialogue, painstakingly boring fight scenes, distressingly fallacious love sub-plots and over-length were just some of the flaws. This, however, has an intelligent core that is hidden under the cold, sterile surrounding surface; but doesn't go un-noticed. I'm not saying that the film is flawless in any sense. Supporting characters are undeveloped and the `past the gloss' effect is a bit slow to get going. But the implausibility of it all is a huge factor that pushes things down. The mere thought that the authorities would leave us void of our five senses is too unlikely to contemplate. But as a popcorn sci-fi, this isn't to be taken seriously. Technical credits are top notch with authentic costumes, cinematography and art direction, though they shouldn't have used a fictitious city. The directing techniques are appropriately artificial and un-stylised. Daring is the fact that it doesn't rely heavily on visual and sound effects in exchange for intellect. The script is well created standard fare.
As far as acting goes, this is Christian Bale's show. He delivers a good performance as the un-charismatic hero (or cleric) of the bunch. As the un-trustworthy `by the books' counterpart, Taye Diggs is upstaged by Bale in every possible way. You'd think that Emily Watson had gone past the `flat female lead' role by now. Think again. She does a good job of her part, but is capable of a better (that is more challenging) part. As I said, support is under-developed and those characters played by Sean Bean, Sean Pertwee, William Fichtner and Angus MacFadyen simply aren't used enough.
All in all, this is a glossy, purposeful and enjoyable sci-fi flick. The intelligent narrative makes for a welcome change from `brainless' action movies in every sense of the word. It probably won't light up box-office records or go down in history for any particular reason, but if you want a good futuristic drama/ thriller, you won't go far wrong with `Equilibrium'. My IMDb rating: 6.4/10.",Equilibrium
100,curtis-8,Really Lame Big Budget Ripoff of Much Better Stories,2,10 December 2009,"""Equilibrium"" is a mashup of several major dystopian science fiction stories and films from recent history told with all the logic, subtlety, and skill of a 15 year old boy. I think that a lot of the people impressed by this film must have very low standards. I mean, the ideas involved are good ones (because they are all lifted from ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""1984,"" THX-1138"" and other, better, sources), and the visuals are nice. But the dialog and story, both presented with the most serious portent, is comically idiotic. For instance the main character tells his partner that the work they're doing to eliminate emotion ""makes it all worth it."" The partner first replies incredulously ""It does?"" Then he gives himself his emotion-dulling injection and declares flatly, ""It does."" I mean, take away the dreary music and you have a comedy bit right out of ""Austin Powers."" So amateurish! Nothing is dumber that something really, really dumb that thinks it's smart.""Equilibium"" is a failure on all levels except the CG set design and the good efforts of good actors suffering a ridiculous screenplay. The blame here falls on the writer-director of this abortion. The greatest flaw is that he sets up his dystopian world's rules (in the clumsiest way possible—just by literally spelling them out in a prologue) and then fails to follow any of that world's precepts through to any logical conclusions. For instance, why would a totalitarian government that depends upon its populace being drugged leave it to each individual to ""self medicate""? Why not just drug the water and/or food? Why does the main character have a standard nuclear family if all emotional ties have been done away with? For that matter why would he have a wife in the first place? Wouldn't the government take control of all that, given that emotions are not a factor? Did they date? If so, why? And even if so, why would they then live together in a nuclear family? And are so many characters allowed to actually show so much emotion (especially the always-intense Bale), if they're all supposed to be doped up and ""leveled off""? Shouldn't they all be rather zombified? On top of that, the character's actions rarely make any sense. They just do what the writer needs them to do to get from plot point a to plot point b—whether it's anything close to what a real person (drugged or no) would do or not. The whole thing is like a bad comic book cranked out by the worst hacks in the business. No wonder this juvenile hunk of pretentious junk got dumped on the DTV market!",Equilibrium
101,ExpendableMan,A somewhat underrated action thriller,6,2 April 2006,"Charging out of the starting blocks at full steam, 'Equilibrium' is like a cross between the dystopic future fiction of Orwell or Huxley and the turbo-charged world of action cinema in the post-Matrix world. It tells of the aftermath of a third world war where a society called Libria has arisen under the guidance of 'father' (Sean Pertwee), a visionary who maintains a constant barrage of propaganda on the populace from vast screens dotted throughout the capital. Emotions have become blamed as the cause of man's inhumanity to man, so they are suppressed regularly by a drug called Prozium. All works of art, literature or anything else that could potentially stimulate individual thought have been made illegal and should anyone disagree or refuse to take the drug, they must answer to the black suited and oppressive police force, headed up by the elite Grammaton Cleric.Enter John Preston (Christian Bale), a stone faced man who goes about his duty of suppressing rebellion with maximum force. However, this fascist poster-child finds himself questioning the order he serves after he is made to kill fellow Cleric and friend Errol Partridge (England's favourite hard man himself Sean Bean). Soon, he is sympathising with those he once executed without a second thought and becomes drawn to the rebellion itself...The resulting story is not perfect and much has been made of the highly stylised gun fights ripping off those seen in The Matrix. This is somewhat unfair as Equilibrium never resorts to tired bullet-time style overplay and instead makes quite an innovative approach with the introduction of Gun-Kata; a martial art revolving around gun handling. The numerous battles that ensue during the running time are never less than satisfying and there is a certain perverse pleasure to be gained knowing that no wires were used in their performance.If one complaint could be levelled at the movie it's that it has a few ideas above its station. The depiction of this future dystopia couldn't be any more stereotypical as black suited stormtroopers parade the streets, children report on their parents and a subjugated nation spends it's time being brainwashed by never-ending sermons on their 'destiny.' Furthermore, given the emotional sterility of practically everyone who isn't a gun-totting revolutionary, it's incredibly surprising that Preston's turmoil isn't noticed sooner as at times, it could only be more obvious if he was walking around with a giant neon sign pointing at him with ""I AM EXPERIENCING FEELINGS"" written on it. On closer inspection though, perhaps not as Taye Diggs rival cleric frequently displays flashes of jealousy and rage yet this is never called into question, it's simply a convenient lapse on the script writer's behalf.Nevertheless, Equilibrium is still an enjoyable romp with more intelligence to it than is first evident (watch Preston's son closely at the beginning) and Bale puts in yet another top notch performance. It may not cement his position as one of the finest of his generation like The Machinist or Batman Begins, but it certainly doesn't hinder it in any way. And while the movie doesn't have the same undeniable impact that the Wachowski's future-shocker did, it does have more depth than the usual run-of-the-mill action fare and a body-count that John Woo would be proud of to boot.",Equilibrium

It is interesting and thought-provoking, with a talented but not over-bearing cast that actually allows the story to take precedence.Amongst a strong multi-national cast, there are no real stars (or if you prefer, egos) on show here, though Christian Bale is simply superb as the Cleric, and young Matthew Harbour plays a small but impressive role as his son. The real star is the movie itself (which is probably why it was never a huge, block-buster hit) and the writer/director Kurt Wimmer. Without preaching to or patronizing the audience, it questions what we are, and what makes us. Entertaining and thought-provoking - veering more towards the former, but with enough substance to satisfy the more discerning film fan.",Equilibrium
105,thenolanfan,Interesting,6,10 January 2020,"This movie is quite interesting even if you can easily recognize that the studio wanted to make it a response to The Matrix, this is where that movie fail, it doesn't achieve to be as classic or as entertaining as its predecessor, which is kind of disappointing. It is still worth a watch because you can see the efforts that all the crews put in it even if like me you found that the scenario was lacking of substance and drama.",Equilibrium
106,basrutten,Decent science fiction/action movie,7,1 January 2004,"Like many others have already noted, ""Equilibrium"" liberally steals a lot of ideas from dozens of action and sci-fi movies: the ideas from ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"", the look from ""Gattaca"", the action scenes from ""the Matrix"" etc. Of course you could call that cheap, but it's still better to copy something good than to come up with poor new material, and I think that somehow ""Equilibrium"" manages to blend all the stolen elements into a reasonably interesting movie.If you're looking for a movie with a really deep message, look elsewhere. The whole idea of a society where emotion is not allowed (yet even the people in charge regularly show it) is too absurd to allow for a really thougtful movie. The story also leaves something to be desired, being hopelessly predictable in the beginning, although it does somewhat redeem itself with a couple of nice twists at the end. This is primarily an action movie, and as such the setting and story are certainly above average. It's no ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner"", but it's still good enough to keep your attention.  Finally, the action sequences, clearly influenced by ""the Matrix"", are surprisingly good. There aren't too much of them, but they are done with lots of style and don't go over the top nearly as much as in some other Matrix clones. Also, fortunately, ""Equilibrium"" isn't afraid to shock from time to time: things can get pretty gruesome/gory/disturbing from time to time. ""Equilibrium"" won't win any award for depth or originality, but it's an above average action/sci-fi movie with very stylish action sequences, a plot that starts predictable but has a couple of tricks up its sleeve, and overall a reasonable execution.**1/2 out of **** stars",Equilibrium
107,gabriel_sanchez,A difficult key-concept might be the reason...,5,17 October 2020,"The concept has potential. After the ""Third World War"", some of the survivors grasped the idea that feelings are behind every bad thing in a society, which makes sense. So they shoved down the throat of everyone this Prozium drug that suppresses emotions; they set down some dictatorship-like society and instantiated a ""Tetra-something"" Cleric that takes care of eliminating people that feel emotions, any emotions.I think most things are left to the viewer's interpretation. Is the drug effective enough? Are most people really taking it? I mean, clearly, most scenes show that most people are feeling at least something: Brandt is clearly ambitious and, most times, enjoys his doings; some agents are legit surprised and fear for their lifes, even at some of the final momments, people ran in fear of being killed. I'd expect that, someone who does not feel anything would be pretty much like a robot or a zombie. This is what makes most of the movie uneasy for me.It also makes you feel anxious most of the time. Since you know Preston is off his drugs, you are always expecting that someone will notice.The plot-twists are, I don't know, weird. Some o them feel uninspired and rather silly.It's hard not to compare this movie to The Matrix (1999), specially considering the prime character's outfit and the overall dystopian design. I guess Equilibrium had it rough because the key concept is so hard to use in a storyline.",Equilibrium
108,masercot,I'm Not Sure,7,10 July 2016,"This movie is a mixture of 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and a little V is for Vendetta thrown in for good measure.But, after seeing Christian Bale, yet again, as an attractive dead-eyed sociopath, I have to ask: Is the man a really good actor? Or, is he a dead-eyed sociopath playing himself? The movie is pretty compact and doesn't really make many mistakes. The action is the real draw. It is well done despite the inanity of ""gun kata"", which is ridiculous on the face of it.There are better dystopias out there in movie land; but, with slick action and some great supporting actors, this movie is definitely worth a peek.",Equilibrium
109,harrylosborne,A striking example of critics versus audience,6,24 June 2019,"Whilst built on a premise I would normally buy into immediately and with a strong acting core, Equilibrium never really gets where it's trying to go. To make a film that truly reflects a dystopian future, everything must be immaculate in its execution; it's an excruciatingly difficult process, and I never felt this was fully achieved when watching through this highly regarded picture. Moreover, the entire concept of ""high ranking stalwart turns rogue in oppressive regime"" has been unnecessarily saturated in recent years, further contributing to Equilibrium's failure to hold up as well as it may have done around the turn of the century.Centred around John Preston (Christian Bale), an elite law enforcement agent in a society where feelings are illegal, Preston aims to overthrow the tyrannical regime in conflict with his every teaching. Bale is somewhat stuck in a catch-22 situation: he can't demonstrate any acting range as his character is required to show no emotion - however, since he isn't showing emotion, he actually is using his acting skill, but it is impossible to appreciate. This film further suffers when noticing the striking stylistic resemblances to The Matrix, which may evoke similar memories in some, but also draw damaging comparisons for others. Further to this, the fight scenes do feel like a homage to those of the aforementioned franchise, dooming it to blend into its ever-populated market.The fighting still holds its own (even with its obvious similarities), and other notable actors such as Sean Bean and Emily Watson also feature heavily. Arguably the most interesting relationship is between Bale and his son - the archetypal prodigy following his father's footsteps, who has also noticed his father's gnawing emotional tendencies. Equilibrium might be a seriously enjoyable film for some (indeed it does have a devout following), but didn't tick enough boxes for me to really consider this worth remembering.",Equilibrium
110,simon_booth,Gun Whata?,6,7 December 2002,"I was intrigued but a little apprehensive after seeing the trailer for Equlibrium. It looked like the movie at least promised some stylish action, even if it looked otherwise rather cheesy.Well, turns out the trailer does not mislead too much. There is some stylish action, and the movie is *immensely* cheesy, pretentious and predictable with its story of rehashed 'Big Brother' paranoia and its muscled,chiselled and utterly wooden star. The style of the movie (costumes, sets etc) is also similarly derivative and generic... a vision of the future seen through well used and worn spectacles. It does present some impressive views through the lens though.The movie seems almost keen to be a b-movie, with the all round cliché and borrowed philosophy. Definitely a movie to leave your brain at home for.So the movie's mostly a bust on the script/character/acting front, but what about the action? After all, that's probably all people *really* care about, and it's clearly where most of the love and attention has been focused. The 'Gun Kata' style (a fictional martial art based around guns) is quite a new concept in action cinema, and looks pretty cool... when you can tell what's actually going on at least. It's not often you see a new style of action, so the movie deserves commendation for that. It looks totally impractical and unconvincing, of course, and is not in the same league as the Hong Kong style gunplay it presumably wishes to compete with.And there's not *nearly* enough of it for a 110 minute movie. Basically you get 2 minutes of action at the start, a couple of bursts of about a minute each throughout the movie then a 5 minute finale. Now the finale is quite jaw dropping - very well choreographed and filmed, but it's a bit of a short climax to justify sitting through the rest of the film.The Gun Kata was a nice idea, but needed to be explored and developed a lot more if it was to support the entire movie on its back. And since the movie is weak in pretty much every other respect, it seems like the action was the only thing that could have taken on that burden. In other words, Equilibrium is pretty much a bust. It was pretty clear that everybody in the theatre was pretty disappointed when the credits started to roll.Sure there are many worse movies out there, and Equilibrium is one of the few movies in 2002 to contain *anything* new, but ultimately I can't say that it's terribly successful as a movie.",Equilibrium
111,kooleshwar,Few steps away from brilliant!!,7,3 January 2006,I must warn you that i saw the film with a lot of expectations and like most people must have realized there are hardly any films that meet your expectations. I have even come out of some very good films feeling that hell it just met my expectations just because they were so high in the first place. And i had very high expectations from this film to i expected at least an 8 and save for 1 or 2 flaws i think this movie was one of the rare films to have met my expectations. ill only tell you the bad parts as the good are to many. Firstly the villain was one dimensional and un-inspirational. Even besides that i felt the ending could have been better. Other than these two things i think for a seemingly low budget film this movie was great the fight scenes and acting was top notch. This is a film you should not miss.,Equilibrium
112,dormesher-21565,Underrated and one of bales best,9,17 March 2019,"Equilibrium. One of my favourite movies and one of Christian Bales best and by far is most underrated movie and one many people forget about and tend to overlook.The story follows John Preston (Bale), an enforcement officer in a future in which both feelings and artistic expression are outlawed and citizens take daily injections of drugs to suppress their emotions. After accidentally missing a dose, Preston begins to experience emotions, which makes him question his own morality and moderate his actions while attempting to remain undetected by the suspicious society in which he lives. Ultimately, he aids a resistance movement using advanced martial arts which he was taught by the very regime he is helping to overthrow.The story is really well done and the action scenes in the film and Gun Kata is a really interesting idea and In my opinion the fight scenes Rival some of them in Matrix.Story itself has a Fahrenheit 451 vibe to it and both deal with certain cultures being outlawed in the near future and you can tell this story was influenced by it in some way and I love it.Christian Bales acting In the film In this film is really well good and he manages to match his acting with context of the story one time being emotionless when taking the drug and then showing all the emotion when he's of it it really shows the depth of Bales acting and its one of his best in my opinion.Verdict 9/10 a criminaly underrated film and one that rivals Matrix in my opinion.",Equilibrium

114,JaydoDre,This is a good example of a bad 2000s action movie,3,10 January 2014,"I cannot for the life of me understand that this movie has been positively received by both critics and the general public. Wha...What?!Either I saw a different film or I missed something important while watching it because what I saw was the very essence of a bad modern action movie.Let us start with the plot: In the future feelings are illegal. ....................... Turn this s**t off. Right now, you can just turn it off right there. What else do you need? How can anyone in their right mind still proceed to watch something when the main idea for the plot is so insultingly stupid and unreal? Here is a better one I just came up with: in the future all people only have one leg and must touch a pickle every 24 hours with their left index finger in order to survive. Who keeps coming up with this stuff? Does someone get paid for it? Can I join in on the scam? How can you believe a single thing shown on the screen with that as the back story?If you managed to get passed this then what you get is a cheap rip-off of the Matrix, mostly stylistic rip-off but the story is not that different either if you think about it. The protagonists are wearing the bloody Matrix Reloaded jackets! Their weapons - giant Desert Eagles with a pointy end. We just entered a Pamela Anderson action movie territory.I bet the actors were happy with the stupid plot though, because it means they can all be emotionless, you know, because that is why we the public pay them large amounts of money, to watch the same kind of performance that your random uncle could give if he taped himself.There is not much more to be told about the plot or the characters because...honestly because I can hardly remember anything and I fear that if I try hard enough then I will just remember more painfully dumb and plot points that I so successfully repressed. Visually the movie is style over substance and simplistic style at that. The sets looks cheap, minimalistic and dark. At other times, we are treated to the your-10-year-old-son-made-these computer effects. First the characters are wearing black, but then this guy will have a change of heart and start wearing white. Oh, what is this complicated symbolism you are trying to give me?! Oh, the artistic visuals!But wait, the most priceless is the action itself. The characters are fightingwith guns...no no no, I don't mean ""fighting"" as in ""wage war"", I mean they are physically dancing around in hand to hand combat while shooting their pistols, making 180 degree turns like they are doing ballet. And when they stop doing that, they will take out their katana swords....because that is cool...in a mind of an 8 year old. If you like the idea of pistol fighting and katanas in a futuristic setting you are 8. In that case this movie is fine for you. If you liked this movie while you were intoxicated that is also acceptable.This film is very typical of this decade's bad action movies. It is like an 80s action flick but with none of the charm to compensate for the poor quality.",Equilibrium

The lack of emotions and emotion as the enemy of all people and the way in which it is pursued in this film are fantastic. this is a thought provoking film and brings many things to mind regarding the things that happen in society as a hole. The mindless belief in a political party for instance, the way people follow trends, fashion and ""needs"" of daily life. The prosecution and persecution of people that follow a different path in life is a problem that has been faced for the entire existence of humankind. This film takes a dark and disturbing look at this aspect of human nature.",Equilibrium
116,mr_popcorn,underrated gem,9,24 November 2008,"Great concept, unique storyline, excellent acting and perfect execution, Equilibrium gives the Matrix trilogy a run for its money. The movie is excellent in several regards, from the interesting and unique story, mind blowing action choreography and breathtaking cinematography, one can only wonder why this movie didn't get the recognition and applause it deserves. Another factor that piqued my interest is the display of an innovative form of martial arts called Gun-Kata. Never have I seen a gun put into creative use with a slight mix of hand to hand fighting skills and close range gun battles. Very impressive indeed.Christian Bale, the man of the hour, gives yet another perfect performance as Cleric enforcer John Preston. Support cast Sean Bean, Angus McFadyen, Taye Diggs and Emily Watson gives off some good support acting too which makes it a powerhouse cast and excellent showcase of acting. If you fancy movies like The Matrix, A Clockwork Orange and Logan's Run, then this movie is right up your alley. Highly recommended.",Equilibrium

The action was a different style and was portrayed well.  The story even had some good twists I was not completely ready for.The acting was also done well.

118,huh_oh_i_c,"Great lack of too much special effects, great art direction.",8,23 April 2007,"I kinda see the point that some make that it is not original, though. It sure looks like a lot of other films, or at least is reminiscent of them. However...... the fight scenes are WAY better than in the Matrix Reloaded, which were completely ridiculous!!! Why were there so many Smiths??? It made the whole film lose serious credibility!!! So if anything it IMPROVED on the Matrix 1, and maybe was an example to Matrix 2 and 3.And the Matrix clothes ... yah I see that Wimmer kinda stole that, at least the long coats. The governements uniforms were like those from Star Wars, but those were based on WW2 Germany Army uniforms ... Wimmers is German. I have never seen black motor helmets used as an Army uniform before.What was maybe not so much unoriginal, but kinda suspect was Preston's very quick change of heart. He went from Poster Boy for The System, to Good Guy Rebel in 10 seconds flat! It took all of two scenes for Preston to become EXACTLY like Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) and Brandt (Diggs) to become the new Preston!!! What was impressive, was the lavish scenery, the cool backgrounds and all that with the absence of CGI unless it was impossible not to have it. Nice Euro realism in a blockbuster movie! It's nice to see some restraint here.",Equilibrium
119,datorsiers2,Wrong on many levels.,4,13 August 2015,"The movie itself is OK, yes, just OK. I didn't want to rate this movie this low, but come on, when you piece everything together it just looks dumb. The society makes no sense, the regime is completely non-sensical, just the movie makes it wrong on so many ways it is not possible to rate this movie very high.I get the idea, that they want to show that, people always have different opinions on music, art, politics, religions, etc. And because of people having different opinions it always leads to arguments and wars, so to make everything peaceful they decided to make every person the same. But it just doesn't work like that, the people in the movie appear to do nothing in their lives, their society seems to have no goal, just to sustain themselves and destroy everything that is different. To begin with, it wouldn't even be possible to reproduce without feelings, that is a major flaw, that wasn't addressed in any way, unfortunately that is not the biggest flaw of the movie. The movie just portrays the people who can feel as dumb hippies, who sit around all day and look at paintings and old books. John Preston is just an invincible war machine, who kills everyone and nobody can even scratch him, he goes against 50 fully armed soldiers wearing his suit and wielding 2 pistols, plus all of that in an open field, where he would have been shot in less than a second, if it was somewhat realistic. At least they could have made it seem that Preston needs to really put up a fight to get to killing ''the father', he just effortlessly strode passed all the guards, killing them instantly, that is not some quality action.I really, really didn't want to give this movie a bad review, but this is seriously extremely flawed on so many levels, that i just couldn't cope with that. Christian bale is an awesome actor, can't say his performance was awful, but the plot was so dull that even he looked kind of bad.",Equilibrium
120,honorhorror,"Surprisingly good, but rewritable",8,30 September 2007,"If you focus on the main character, who's played by the very brilliant Christian Bale, you will understand all the intentions of the director to make this movie looks unique and remarkable. The actions scenes are imaginative as it can be, reminding me of Devel May Cry, in which the blades-and-guns actions are equally satisfying.Christian Bale is shining in every scene. He successfully delivered a believable troubled and conflicting character, and the transformation from a cool-hand fascist to a dedicated freedom-fighter. Focus on him and you will not be let down.However i have to speak honestly, I was a bit let down by the end and the straight-forward conclusion, or else I could have given it a big 10. It is flawed because of many reasons, including the poor special effects implemented(the explosion scene at the end was awful, compared to the whole movie); the easy-going conclusion and less-than-expected involvement of the underground rebellions. It could have been a masterpiece if rewrite in many places. For example, the comparation between a sensible man and a man without feeling is not explicit enough to present the message--that human being should be human being because if you take the feeling from them they could be dysfunctional. Therefore I would concentrate on the difference of viewing things happening around between Preston and Brandt, making up a few dialogues to show how dull a ""robocop"" can be compare to a real man. Moreover, the very difference between the Fascist Governors and the rebellion politically presented was merely the latter sacrifice themselves for hope, not convincing enough to me. So I would focus on the use of ultimate weapon--Preston. To show the difference, there should be more care for Preston by the rebellion, and more convincing belongingness implemented. However all these are not showed in the movie. And what I have found interesting about the end was that, it is like an alternative end of V for Vendetta, which is a movie just like Equilibrium in many ways. Preston was a cold-blood weapon before, and later he deeply realized that feeling is not simply 1+1=2, or smell plus taste is eating. He realized that feeling can be a powerful weapon itself, but what a pity that was not showed in the movie,too. In V for Vendetta the hero died for freedom, and powerfully delivered the message""behind this mask there is more than flesh, there is a idea, and an idea is bullet-proof."" So now you may realize what Equilibrium lacks of.Overall it is already out of my expectation. I'd like to recommend it to friends who like Matrix, who like John Woo, who like Devil May Cry, who like the idea of freedom and especially who like Ludwig Van Beethovan. 8/10",Equilibrium

123,lagriff05,Overrated,6,31 May 2009,"This movie left me with no feelings whatsoever.The basic premise is that of a dystopian society where feeling is prohibited, and it is done reasonably well, but not exceptionally well, at that. The world feels a tad underdeveloped, getting right down to the nitty gritty action scenes from the start. The action scenes are cool, but the real flaw here is that they find EVERY CONSIDERABLE EXCUSE for Bale to be surrounded by like ten guys so that he can dispatch them all easily.The other thing wrong with this is just that it has the STUPIDEST climax ever; more like an anti-climax really. And if these people can't feel at all, then why do we see them smiling with obvious satisfaction, or shouting with this obvious irritation at something? That's a plothole I think we need to clear up.So really this movie didn't evoke many feelings out of me, but if you dare to let it, you will probably be detained and shot on sight.

124,blacklist-1,"Fascinating, original and terrifically entertaining.",10,29 June 2010,"My friend recommended this film to me, which starred Christian Bale and it looked interesting so I thought I would give it go. It turns out for me Equilibrium is one of the most stunning films to be made.The basic story is set in the future after a third world war, human society changes. It becomes the catalyst for what the person in charge called Seamus (Dominic Purcell) calls ""Our Great Society"" where humans are banned by law to not feel emotion of any kind like love, anger and hate because he believes emotions are the key to human destruction. Anything like music or art associated with emotions is also banned. If any human is caught ""feeling"", they are executed. Seamus appoints head cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) to keep order in society as everyone has to daily inject themselves with a drug Prozium that suppresses the human emotions. But Preston decides to forgo the injections and begins to experience emotion as he rises to overthrow the system by allying himself with a human resistance movement that feel emotion and embrace it.This movie is only an hour and thirty five minutes long, but it is a captivating and entertaining one. The story for me (whether this sort of idea has been done before I do not know) is highly original. I found it fascinating as this idea of emotions and society is explored well. By restricting humans to feel any sort of emotions even positive ones like love and if they do they are executed, Seamus and the person who in overall charge is the Father, become like a totalitarianism regime like Hilter, which is ironic given the fact that the people are shown world war II and the rise of Hilter in Germany as the source of the destruction that is accompanied by emotions. Is the new society just as bad by slaughtering those that they feel? Are Seamus and the Father exactly like Hitler? These are questions that are well explored.This is helped by excellent performances by Christian Bale who is the principal villain at the start particularly when he had eradicate his first partner Partridge, a small part played superbly by Sean Bean. Bale is cold and uncomprehending but he starts to change when he fails to take his Prozium injection. It's a wonder and sadness to see him save a little puppy and touch walls and a woman's hand as he strokes it. Bale captures the part beautifully and I felt deeply for him. The cinematography is amazing with natural grey lighting to convey the falseness of the ""great society"" and the action, though similar to The Matrix is absolutely incredibly choreographed making it entertainment of the highest grade. There are also a couple of good twists later on in the movie that I liked, which kept me guessing. Equilibrium is a fascinating, original and superbly made and acted sci-fi and Bale owns the part. He was even better in this than he was in the terrific The Machinist, which I saw on DVD a month ago.Film critics hated this, but the majority of audience reviews on this website, judging by the 7.7 out of 10 of the IMDb rating loved this and I agree. This was a surprising hit for me but I loved every minute of it and will certainly be purchasing this as part of my DVD collection. If you haven't seen this yet.

125,BrickNash,Brilliant film which came out at the wrong time.,9,6 November 2016,"I don't get people sometimes. This film got panned for having the 'silly' gun kata and the boards are flooded with negative posts about just how daft it all is.All I can say is that if you are so uptight and so boring that you can't accept a little silliness in not just your life, but in a movie then there is something wrong with you.Equilibrium is a tremendous film. Stylish, gripping and with a concept that not only borrows of of George Orwell's 1984 but does completely it's own thing with it. The cast is great, the action is super slick and the visuals are sumptuous.If the film had one flaw I'd say that it was maybe a little too familiar with The Matrix which was an extremely hot property back in 2002 and the obvious comparisons were probably drawn which led to it's poor critical reception.Don't be fooled though, this is FAR better then both Matrix sequels and is a rip roaring standalone film in it's own right which is both interesting and highly entertaining.Thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking film!",Equilibrium
126,iago-6,Interesting sci-fi ideas with no place to go,5,17 March 2006,"Equilibrium is the result of putting 1984, Brave New World, The Matrix, Logan's Run, THX-1138 and Blade Runner in the cinematic blender and hitting ""puree."" Bale plays a Cleric, kind of a policeman/killing machine who exists in a world where emotion has been outlawed. Instead, everyone takes ""Prozium"" (sounds like?), a drug that suppresses mood. When Bale finds himself experiencing emotion, I mean true, genuine human emotion for God's sake, he just can't get enough.Bale gives more than this film deserves, and does a nice job with a tricky part he has to act as though he is experiencing emotion for the first time, which means doing things like staring at a sunrise with awe, not to mention sniffing flowers as though transported by their sweet simple aroma, which is hard to pull of convincingly. He also has to express the anxiety of trying to pass in an emotionless society constantly on the lookout for ""sense offenders;"" those who feel.Which leads to one of the aspects of the movie I liked; that it takes time to include little set pieces that delineate the future society or Bale's experiences. One of the most effective shows Bale, who hasn't taken his prozium dose for a day, walking in a crowd and looking at the other people with a newfound curiosity. During this sequence the sound goes down to only include the sound of the crowd's synchronized feet marching. There is a graceful moment as Bale feels a railing where a woman he was watching had just touched. There were also moments of well-handled exposition describing the future society, and I always like movies that stop everything to include a little set sequence.The problem is that there's too many ideas to fit into one little 107-minuite movie, especially when you need to cram a final battle and a triumphant destruction of the repressive society into there. This is one movie I thought they could have successfully used as the beginning of a trilogy, by just slowing it down and taking the time to explore a lot of the intriguing and convincing paranoia of the story, as well as the impact learning to feel has on Bale, and what he's going to do about that. As it is, this is a film that proves the ""First 2/3rds"" rule, though in this case it's really only the first third that's interesting, as that's where all the ideas and exposition about the future is. The second third is rather empty drawing-out of the drama, and the last third is the overblown/underrealized climax.That second third becomes a problem, as you begin to feel like scenes are just being extended pointlessly, and not only that, but that you've seen the same scene beforein this movie. How many more times can we watch Bale marvel at the true emotion that he's feeling, then have to conceal it and pretend that he's still supporting the Party? How many times can we think that he's finally been caught THIS time, only to have him wriggle out? And by the way, how blind does the ruling party have to be not to see that Bale is a bonafide sense-offending whackathon? And how realistically brazen can Bale be, knowing what he knows about how sense offenders are treated? I was making deft use of my fast-forward button a lot during the middle. This film has the odd distinction of having too many ideas to deal with properly and yet using large portions of the film to senselessly repeat the same scenes again and again.One thing you have to admire about this film is that it makes an honest attempt to create a new style of fighting, which is that the Clerics have been trained to anticipate the most common bullet trajectories and avoid them (though how standing in one place and not moving helps, I'm unclear on), and also where their adversaries most commonly are. This works as long as you don't think about it too much, but even that begins to show strain when the government knows that Bale is a baddie, and is a trained killing machine, yet don't bring out any equally-trained Clerics to fight him, just more bullet fodder.Then, at the end, it turns out that Big Brother, er, I mean Father, is an ass-kicking future ninja in his own right. Can you imagine if you made it into the White House only to find that Bush and Rumsfeld have mad Kung Fu chops? Bale and Father engage in a unique brand of fighting with blazing guns in hand, which, the longer it lasts, begins to look like some new kind of aggressive combo vogueing.Events grow more ridiculous toward the end, until all viewer interest is gone and you're just waiting for it to end. But please note the shot of the cute puppy licking the girl's hand at the end. I was wondering where they were going to insert the shot reassuring the audience that the adorable puppy we saw earlier was in fact NOT shot. You can kill all the people you want, but kill a puppy, that's crossing the line. You've got to have some moral values.In retrospect, I think the movie would have been stronger had it left Bale at the halfway point and started to follow the puppy, turning into ""Beethoven's Dystopian Adventure!""",Equilibrium
127,arthera09,"Now I enjoy this movie, but it is not all there",6,15 April 2007,"I feel as if the movie studio had more faith in this movie and gave Kurt more money this movie would have been a lot better. I could also tell that this was a directorial debut and it took a little away from the movie. I really like Christian Bale and he totally nailed the role. The rest of the cast was whatever, except for Sean Bean. I think he had the hardest role and he had to resonate throughout the entire movie. The music was nothing special and the special effects were nothing special, but good for the movie. Of course the action was my favorite part and I loved the final fight scene when Preston is fighting the vice-council man with where they both have one pistol. I really liked how Kurt approached the movie as a good guy kicking ass and that was that. I also like how we mixed up the different fight scenes so each one felt unique in their own way. The little things in the fight scenes were the best. Like when Preston spins around the two shotguns and shoots the guys in their faces. Also when he kicks up the M16 in the hall of mirrors. Those really helped with the movie, but did not save it. The idea was all there, but the execution was not all there. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this movie a lot and I recommend other people watch it, but I can as a movie lover give it 6.",Equilibrium
128,Jakealope,"Matrix meets Rambo, 1984 and Brave New World, Derivative & Weak",4,25 October 2013,"First off, it had really good production values & sfx, and a good roster of actors. So it was competently made, But not only was the concept derivative, not a crime for sure, but it was just plain weak. It was like some movie guys got all coked and said, ""What if Winston Smith & Julia in 1984 had a ton of firepower & they went out and blasted the Ministry of Love & O'Brien instead of becoming another victim?"" Well they had this concept called Gunkata, which takes the old concept that the good guys can walk though a storm of lead, not even get nicked then take the bad guys out with single pistol shots acting all calm as a cucumber to the ultimate silly extreme.Okay this was supposed to be a totalitarian updated version of 1984. Yet the rebels had access to all sorts of guns, books etc. The good citizens were all supposed to be drugged against emotion, hence the name Equilibrium, the main drug. The good guy, Bale, is one of the chief enforcers, a cleric. But do these totalitarian bad guys bother to check up on their enforcers, no. They don't even have a simple way to check if someone stopped taking the required calming drugs, which should be easy since their whole system was based on the drug being used by all. Then there is this one scene with all these dogs the dead rebels owned. Our hero sneaks one of those cute beagles out so he can bond with it, OMG, I overdosed on saccharine at this point.Then the finale, where one massive fight consisting of The One vs the center bunch of baddies, which results in the whole system being crashed in one hour. The Matrix had a lot of overkill and over-firepower, but it was utterly original in its theme, style and special effects and Nero didn't crash the whole Matrix in an afternoon of shooting it out with the cops and the Agent Smiths. It took two pallid sequels to right the world after the first Matrix big hit. This one fixes the earth in one hour.",Equilibrium
129,Benjamin_Cox,Hugely derivative but still great fun - 75%,7,13 March 2012,"Such was the power and influence of ""The Matrix"" when it was released that film companies were rushing to capitalise on its success with their own effects-laden, bullet-ridden blockbusters. And perhaps few films mimic their inspirations quite as closely as this one, although you can add ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Blade Runner"" and others to the mix as well. It is derivative, almost to the point of parody, but the action and story more than make up for the lack of any depth or original ideas.Welcome to the near future where humanity has recovered from the devastation of World War 3 using an emotion-suppressing drug called Prozium. The result of everyone taking this drug is that all human feeling - love, rage, anger, etc. - has been eradicated and society is operating under a totalitarian organisation led by Father (Sean Pertwee) where extremely violent Clerics have orders to hunt and kill anybody who expressed a sense of anything. One such Cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale), accidentally misses a dose of Prozium and slowly finds himself rediscovering his humanity and siding with the rebels underground and especially the condemned Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), a Sense Offender that John brought in. But as John begins to realise what he must do, his zealous partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) begins to suspect the traitor to their cause...Although this movie may have some good ideas at the core, ""Equilibrium"" concentrates on burying them beneath a wave of ""Matrix""-style action which is called Gun-Kata in the film. No doubt about it, the film looks amazing and especially when Bale begins to fight the system, leaping about all over the place like Daffy Duck with a couple of Berettas. It is undeniably cool but it does detract from the story which is not only intelligent but worthy of your attention, despite some simply massive plot holes. Bale is a natural at suppressing emotion - which is what makes him so good as Batman - so is perfect in the role of Preston but Watson also does well, despite a limited amount of screen time. Diggs, however, felt a little out of place. I realise he's just another pretty-boy model who can recite lines when needed but why exactly is he flashing his perfectly white teeth in a grin when he's supposed to be suppressing all emotion? Just a thought.Like another all-action blast (namely ""Desperado""), ""Equilibrium"" might not be big or clever but it is a whole lot of fun although not as tongue-in-cheek as Robert Rodriguez's film. It's a strange cross between something like ""The Matrix"" and some older, more serious sci-fi like ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""Soylent Green"". It's just a pity that more thought wasn't put into the script because it strives to be something like ""Blade Runner"" but ends up more like ""The Island"", another sci-fi film that had a promising set-up but decided to go down the route of excessive cinematic action scenes. However, ""Equilibrium"" is more entertaining than ""The Island"" - not only is the action more impressive but this film has a quality to it that belies its fairly modest budget. So long as you don't yearn for the sight of Carrie-Anne Moss in a leather catsuit, this is a solidly entertaining slice of sci-fi action but one that, with a bit more smarts to it, might have been right up there with its classic inspirations instead.",Equilibrium
130,priyantha-bandara,The best action next to Matrix,7,11 June 2011,"Feels like a ride in the Matrix train but it feels fun! Packed with smoking gun swinging action and bone breaking hand to hand combat 'Equilibrium' is not a disappointment.In the future most of the world population is wiped out after the end of world war iii. And in the newly formed nation of Libria a dictator rules. Believing that human emotions lead to wars and destruction a serum is injected to each citizen of Libria that blocks all human emotions. All forms of creativity including writing and drawing are banned. Whoever possessed such material is punished by death. An elite group of soldiers watch over the nation and John Preston (Christian Bale) is one of the top ranking officers who never fail at his job with pin point accuracy. But things change for him when he deliberately skips to take the serum one morning. He starts to find out the wonderful feeling of being able to have emotions and feelings.This is not a perfect science fiction. But it's a movie with a heavy heart in places where you will never expect. You will forget how to feel when you watch this for a while and then the movie itself will bring you back to light. In a small miracle moments of Preston cries after hearing a sonata and being licked by a puppy are just amazing flashes of truth for him and for the audience equal.Christian Bale who I always trust in does not fail in the role of Preston. He is strong, quick and kick ass perfect. Though the movie is quite low budget there are some scenes which that embed right in the core of your entertainment brain. And the set creation is wonderful. The whole movie is metallic and neat looking with crisp architecture and black leather outfits.Maybe you will be happy about all your emotions after you watch it.

A world where supposedly 'feeling' - which is never very well defined here - is eradicated, yet almost all the characters keep doing quite emotional things: * Rabble rousing * Experiencing a sense of 'duty' * Using terms like 'pleased' * Practicing martial-art forms that are steeped in spiritual understanding * Displaying *ambition*??The fact is, sentience cannot be removed from emotions - for emotions are side-effects of sentience. In fact they are crude, symbolic labels for the deeper eddies within sentience.Ah, what a pity, Christian Bale and Sean Bean in the same film and it's a complete waste of time and effort. I'm now going to hunt around and see if they were together in anything good.",Equilibrium
132,jrfranklin01,Explosive Creativity But With Made-For-TV Feel,7,12 November 2004,"This is definitely one of the more creative sci-fi films I've seen in some time. The concept behind the film - a society where emotion is outlawed - is fascinating. A group called ""The Cleric"" represent the future police specially trained to find and destroy any resistance to the societal order. Anything that might arouse emotion - art, love, sex, music, pets, etc. - are stringently banned. Each community member takes a drug each day, known as Equilibrium, that regulates the flow of emotion, leaving the individual a stoic.Christian Bale (Reign of Fire) stars in the martial sci-fi as one of The Cleric, John Preston. He undergoes a character metamorphosis when he misses taking Equilibrium one day. He then decides for fight for the very things he was destroying.Some ""Matrix"" comparisons can be made with the martial arts footage and character composition. What makes this film unique is in introducing an idea that I'd never seen before - gun katas. Instead of just training the body in a martial arts fashion, society teaches The Cleric how to use guns into martial arts. There are some pretty cool scenes displaying this.Where this film lacks though is in giving a better reason for society's taking of an emotion-deprivation drug. It cites murder and any other type of violence, but this seems to stand on a weak leg. Also, how Preston happens to psychically know where contraband is seems far-fetched. So does the obviousness of his emotional change and his fantasy affair with Emily Watson. The ending has a bit of plot flaws in Preston's emotional turbulence and sudden callousness. This see-saw teeters at a few points in the film. Photography, cheap CGI, overboard gun fights, and a TV ending, give Equilibrium a made-for-TV feel. Maybe originating somewhere on the Sci-Fi channel...? All in all, very creative but could use a little tweaking. 7/10",Equilibrium
133,Barky44,Self-serving Art House Tripe,4,10 October 2005,"Equilibrium is basically a film version of an art student's masters thesis.Set in the future, Equilibrium revolves around an official assassin (Christian Bale). This assassin's job: remove all art from the world. Art is supposedly the root of all evil and the reason for past wars. The result of these actions? A peaceful yet soulless society where children can be executed for crying. Bale's character then has his doubts ...What tripe.This is a high-budget rendering of the art set's wine-and-cheese discussions in art gallery lounges worldwide. ""Oh, if all the art is gone, the world will be a horrible place,"" blah blah blah. It's a horrible stereotype. ""Oh, the world censors us so horribly."" Yawn.This film is far too obvious. It layers on the point so thick, and so heavy-handed, it's almost repugnant. I despise preachy movies such as this. It's one thing to make a point, but points (as the name implies) are fine. These filmmakers tried to make a point with a sledgehammer, something physically (and metaphorically) impossible.4 out of 10. It has some interesting cinematography, and isn't the worst thing I've ever seen. But it's not good, and not worthy of the praise it has received in some (art) circles.Barky",Equilibrium
134,extravaluejotter,Matrix Lite,5,27 July 2006,"Clearly a ""Matrix"" clone, ""Equilibrium"" is nonetheless a watchable and (if you put your brain in neutral) entertaining film. The movie derives a lot from other dystopian future stories like ""1984"", ""THX1138"", ""Farenheit 451"" and ""Metropolis"" as well as taking a lot of style cues from ""The Matrix"". Try to ignore what has been copied or re-hashed from other tales and ""Equilibrium"" works reasonably well. This is mainly due to an excellent cast, who make their characters believable.Sean Pertwee's measured delivery provides an Orwellian audio backdrop to every scene set in totalitarian 'Libria', a suitably plausible mouthpiece for the society of emotional control. Christian Bale manages to convey the inner conflict of his Cleric character, as he realises that Libria's version of peace and harmony comes at too high a price. Angus MacFadyen also convinces as a real sleeper of a villain. Emily Watson and Sean Bean also do well in their small roles as ""Sense Offenders"".There's a feeling of low budget in some of the production design but this doesn't detract from the film too much.My only problem with the ending was that Bale's character was allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the regime and deal with a limited number of bodyguards before tackling the villain. Despite an impressive display of the movie's own ""Gun Kata"" martial art, I was left feeling that I had just watched the final Boss level of some hackneyed video game.""Equilibrium"" does succeed in rising above its borrowed-ideas concept as well as provoking an emotional response and is only spoiled by its rushed, by-the-numbers ending.

The second viewing made me notice a lot more issues with the film, such as dodgy CGI, some cheesy moments and a lot of elements taken from other films and books and whatnot. But by the end of the film, I just found that I had fun with it. I guess it just could have been a more solid film that it was, but it works.I must say I really enjoyed the last 15 minutes or so. The action is great and I like the way the story wraps up. It's like the really good cherry on an okay bowl of ice cream.This film might be more impressive the first time you watch it than the second, based on my experience with it.

136,craig-hopton,Disappointing,5,28 March 2016,"This was a disappointment.I was looking forward to a good thought- provoking Sci-Fi. Equilibrium seemed to have the right ingredients - a solid plot line (a future in which emotions have been made illegal) and a top class lead actor (Christian Bale).Sadly, the execution was poor. They didn't do much with the plot, save a series of predictable clichés - Sean Bean reading Yeats in secret, Bale smelling a ribbon from his wife's hair, Bale showing mercy for a dog. The fact the actors literally couldn't show emotion didn't help with the standard of the performances either.I also found the sets a bit weird. I understand the use of grey stone and metal for an emotion-free civilisation, but the rebel-held areas weren't any more colourful. Slightly untidy with a few books strewn about was as exciting as it got. Neither were there any interesting rebel characters.In fact, the best bits of Equilibrium were, oddly enough, the set-piece fight scenes. Bale's character is a ultra- trained killer and he showcases his ability in a series of Matrix-like sequences in which he overpowers groups of adversaries. It's kind of irrelevant to the story, but these scenes make decent viewing.",Equilibrium

Christian Bale does an incredible job as John Preston which made me incredibly happy when I found out he was going to play Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. I really liked Emily Watson's performance also. She did a great job as the rebellious but innocent girl that she portrayed. I really enjoy the plot also.

What it does, it does in an excelent way. The story is very interesting and compeling to watch, wich is more than we can say from all the so called sci-fi movies that come out of Hollywood this days. The whole scenario and sets are trully great and filled with atmosphere. It may look like Matrix but it isn´t. Thank all gods for that, because the overall result is a much better movie. It has the perfect balance between a crapy stylized action movie for pimpled faced teens and good old adult sci-fi wich despite stealing ideas from everywhere in its plot still makes us think and have fun at the same time. Above all this is good sci-fi without being pretencious. Much more interesting than for example Minority Report wich was a totaly boring and predictable hollywood star vehicle disguised as a sci-fi piece.As for the action scenes i think they look great and at least there was a big effort in trying to create something diferent and we don´t see more of that nowadays. Even the final fight is original, fast and unexpected, so you Van-Damme fans who love to see those 20 minute final combats filled with pyrotecnics, can go see other movie instead.To me Equilibrium reminds me of Dark City. I think it´s another of those excelent movies that have a trully awfull marketing campaign, nobody goes to see it and then years later it becomes a highly praised cult film.
I loved it. I saw it twice on dvd (this one didn´t even opened in the theaters here in Portugal), and i´m going to buy it as soon as i can get my hands on it. Excelent movie and a great cross between Gattaca and Matrix. 10 out of 10",Equilibrium

He then allies himself with the rebels, eventually taking down the Government.I don't know why this movie even so highly rated, isn't so popular. The special effects are mind blowing. Christian Bale it so seems has taken up these roles as a specialty. One hell of a movie, he acts god, Sean Bean gives a solid performance in his miniature part. But, by God... I still am in a state of shock... People go watch this movie, if you want to some real kick ass action, trust me, you'll love it...9/10 for me...",Equilibrium
152,MrVibrating,"Very cool, very stylish",9,22 February 2006,"How can a movie which loans/steals from every sci-fi book and movie never made still be this good? It's truly a mystery.1984, Brave New World, Blade Runner, the list goes on. The difference between those and Equilbrium is that those stories are all very epic, very important, and not that easy to access. You need to be in a certain state to appreciate them. Equilbrium, however, does not require anything from you. Just kick back and enjoy the sci-fi classics condensed to pure awesomeness.For a movie with a budget so small, the visuals and the action is truly remarkable. It's better than many big-budget productions today. Innovative use of present-day clothes and scenery creates a cool, dystopic future which is both unique and lasting.Christian Bale is great in his role, and Emily Watson is good in her role. Sean Bean appears too in a small but as usually cool role. The rest of the cast is good too.Sure, there are flaws, but some of them have explanations and if you re-watch the movie you'll see more clearly.For all of those who thinks this movie stole from Matrix, I have to disagree. Wimmer's action style is more to the point, intenser and there's no wire-work involved(might please some people). The Gun-Kata thing is cool and works well, a lot thanks to Bale's execution.If you want to watch a cool and actually thought-provoking sci-fi movie and still have a good time then this is your choice.",Equilibrium
153,nzswanny,Incredibly flawed...but also incredibly entertaining.,8,6 September 2017,"Equilibrium is one of those movies that is undeniably flawed; a film that replicates the storyline of the book 1984, a film that replicates the action scenes from The Matrix, a film that sometimes tries too hard to be dramatic and a film that commonly feels downright cheesy. But Equilibrium is also one of those movies that is undeniably entertaining; a film that holds a slick atmosphere, a film that holds characters developing throughout, a film that displays brilliantly exciting visuals and a film that proudly boasts a fitting soundtrack. Although the flaws were there, I found that the redeeming, quality values of this film stood out a lot more than the flaws of this film which were, although obvious, not too difficult to cope with if you don't pay too much attention to the flaws. Equilibrium is one of those movies where you have to switch off your cynical side (although that's the worst nightmare for us film critics!) and instead listen to your positive side in order to enjoy it, and if you listen to your positive side you will find that there is a lot of enjoyable moments in this film to appreciate. Although there are some dramatic moments that try too hard, there are also a lot of dramatic moments that actually work in this film which captivate your attention and toy around with your emotions. The dramatic moments that work in this movie aren't as good as the scenes you'll watch in Citizen Kane, Schindler's List or Taxi Driver but they are a good effort nonetheless if you take into account the work Kurt Wimmer put into this film. Along with the other redeeming values is a bit of a misunderstood quality to this film called editing: a nice flow is created in this film because of the editing. Overall I found this film to be entertaining and if you adjust your expectations to the right level I think you may even be enthralled.",Equilibrium
154,Sfpsycho415,Overlooked Sci-Fi Classic---8/10,8,22 September 2004,"I saw the commercial for Equilibrium only twice before it's release in the US and thought it looked great. But when i tried to find a theater it was playing at they were all really far from where i live. And i live in San Francisco! A few months later i finally found a copy at a video store, rented it, and was completely blown away. I bought it only days later. It is a real shame this movie didn't get a better release because it is one of the best science-fiction movies i have ever seen. It has kickass gunplay (thanks to a new weapon-based martial art created just for the movie called Gun-kata) and swordfights, some stunning visuals, great acting from Christian Bale, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean, and a solid story. There is always a lot of comparison to the Matrix, but i think Equilibrium stands on it's own as a new sci-fi classic. If you can find it, definitely check it out. 8/10",Equilibrium

156,mwendel,1984 Meets Fahrenheit 451 Meets the Matrix (Possible Spoilers),8,18 December 2002,"It's a slick, well-choreographed chess match between the good and the bad with a nice twist right at the very end.  In a post nuclear war world, the citizens in society exist in a drug induced physical sensory slumber as a kind of final solution.  In addition they are constantly subjected to propaganda over loud speakers, large video screens and even floating blimps.  It has the feel of 1984, but set in a much more technologically sophisticated society.Moreover, all art, books and relics of the 'senses' society are sought out and destroyed, just like in Fahrenheit 451, with flamethrowers.  Even the Mona Lisa is burned to a crisp, early on, to give scope to the level of destruction and loss that is truly occurring.Lastly, I feel the Matrix did have an effect on this production.  Bale with his hair slicked back in a black overcoat, as Neo did in the Matrix, throughout most of the movie and in the final scene wearing a white martial arts type costume, very similar to the one Neo wore when training in the simulator.  While I feel Bale's character and Neo are two distinctly different characters, in some ways they are alike. Both have just been 'released' and have incredible skill and abilities that they use to free their societies.Still, even with all the parallels I feel that Equilibrium still is original enough to stand on its own as an excellent Sci-Fi flick.",Equilibrium

Supposedly the masses are taking drugs that suppress all emotion. So why does the government feel the need to destroy art and literature? People will no emotion would be unable to enjoy the arts, and therefore would have no inducement.  Yet, marriage and children are still allowed. Are we to believe that a painting, or a poem, is more likely to induce feeling than one's spouse or child?  Either the drug also suppresses logic, or people would see that the whole concept of no emotion preventing murder and war is false, for there are executions, an army and a resistance.  Then there is the cleric who shows obvious ambition, and glee at the capture of another ""feeling"" cleric, and last time I checked, those were emotions. But, given all that, I still rated this file a '7'.  Why?  Quite simply because I enjoyed watching it.  It's illogical and even stupid at times, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.",Equilibrium
159,gpadillo,Matrix? What Matrix? Great Libertarian Action Flick!!!,9,15 August 2005,"Silly, predictable, seriously flawed, with moments that are outright laughable, Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark, stylistic Orwellian drama.In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to ""Big Brother""), emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime, punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art, music, literature, friendship, love and everything else that makes life worth living. Wisely, there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to ""live."" Among them, Emily Watson's saintly, emotional Mary O'Brien. These folk are, naturally, hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics, that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study. One witnesses in anticipation as, throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as, for the first time, Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma. Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him, but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.Director, Kurt Wimmer, in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job, has created an entire new, faux martial arts: ""Gun-Kata."" Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on ""a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range"" combined with mathematics, etc. At first, it is almost painfully hilarious to watch, but give in and it achieves a type of anime, hyper realistic that can only be described as ""wicked cool!"" Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after ""Father"" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering.Like a great conductor, Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless, choral based soundtrack, jumps every hurdle and flaw, delivering a terrific movie full of action, meaning and emotion",Equilibrium
160,garyvanhorn,George Orwell meets The Matrix,9,11 January 2011,"Equilibrium is a combination of George Orwell's 1984 and The Matrix. The action scenes are phenomenal and the ""gun-ka"", a martial art centered around firearms, is absolutely brilliant. I really wish I had seen this film in the theater as I have no doubt it would have been even more stunning.Not only does the film have plenty of action, it also has a solid plot, characters, and acting. In the future the world is destroyed by war and the survivors deem emotion was the cause. They rebuild a society devoid of emotion with the help of an emotion suppressing drug that must be taken daily. Christian Bale plays a cleric, an enforcer for the state, that ruthlessly and efficiently carries out his duties until one day he fails to take his daily dose of the emotion suppressing drug. Bale is terrified after experiencing his first emotions and rushes to take his next dose, but one look in the mirror at himself prevents him from doing so. Bale slowly begins his transformation from ruthless state killer to rebel savior, and kicks all kinds of ass along the way.Make some space in your Netflix queues for this film, or just pick it up on Amazon, it's worth the investment for any fan of quality action movies.",Equilibrium
161,Stibbert,A sci-fi gem,9,22 October 2005,"Someone once said that ""he who forget history shall have to relive it"". The plot of this movie seems inspired by that quote and a whole lot of other movies. It's one of those movies that takes elements from many movies and throw it into a mix. In this case the result is gun powder!After three world wars humans have found their flaw. Feelings. In order to prevent a fourth world war a drug is being administered. It takes away peoples ability to feel. This non-feeling society is led by a dictator called Father and controlled by a police-force called The Grammaton Cleric. Then one day one of this force highest ranking officers misses his daily dose.I had not heard much about the movie when I first saw it. I didn't know what to expect. What first met my eye was a beautiful cinematography. Nothing less than delicate shots. Great use of light and angles and nice composition. Add nice editing of these shots and you have a great looking movie.The plot is good. It's a classic sci-fi free-the-world-plot, yet it's not a cliché. On the contrary it's a plot with potential. A potential that is being used. The story is well written and the characters are good. Yes, the script has it's flaws and errors, but you don't pay attention to them since the story is strong and actors good.Talking about actors, let me say they deliver. Christian Bale does a good job as John Preston. He's got the strait face like Neo in The Matrix and adds the humanity to it in a good way. One of the most impressing performances, however, is given by Matthew Harbour as Robbie Preston. He gives a simply creepy performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The sound work on this movie is excellent. The sound design and the way it's mixed is just high class. They also make use of silence witch turns out pretty powerful. When you then add a nice futuristic score you end up with a movie that sounds really good. The score is mostly electronic, best described as a mix between Vangelis and Zimmer. It builds up the mood and action very well.The production design, locations and sets are looking good. They has a nice futuristic feel and look. Everything is very impersonal and minimalistic and it fits very good to the story. Some of it is kind of simple done, like the car that don't look all to good, but it works because they don't put any focus on it.It's a sci-fi, but there are not too many effects. At least none advanced so those you see are good. When it comes to fights, on the other hand, you'll see more. And what you'll see are great choreography and nice clipping. The fights are really impressive and really cool. Someone spent time at this and it payed off.The only negative thing about this movie is that neither Sean Bean or Dominic Purcell get very much screen time. Apart from that Equilibrium is a movie with a good story, dialog and action. To put it this way, I would rather have seen a trilogy of this than The Matrix. It's a sci-fi gem that should be seen.",Equilibrium

You might even say the end justifies the means. There was audience cheering several times when the dissident side won out in some plot twists, but I couldn't help thinking of the Don Marquis quote, ""If you make people think they're thinking, they've love you; if you *really* make them think, they'll hate you.A very well-done film; people in the audience I was in really seemed to love it.",Equilibrium
164,Exiled_Archangel,First class Hollywood rubbish!,6,23 April 2004,"I don't get the hype about this movie.. It's at least as bad as Terminator3, if not worse. One thing people should understand: A sci-fi flick mustn't be a medley of impossible things put together. It needs some depth to it. But look at Equilibrium.. The plot outline is simple as pie: Feelings are forbidden, so let's shoot each other! Cheap effects, one guy beating up 80 armed men, a little boy ordering his father around.. Give me a break!The dog was cute, and the acting wasn't that bad. But all in all, this movie is hardly any better than the infamous Turkish Star Wars. Basing a sci-fi flick upon zero realism is not the way to make a film to remember. But with such a below-par screenplay, it's possible for everyone to remember this movie by how crappy it was. And the ending was appalling. Should I laugh or should I cry? It reminded me of the ending of Independence Day.. Something to excite 14 year olds, and to be laughed at by anyone older.
Equilibrium is a typical Hollywood flick that has absolutely NOTHING to offer that you haven't seen before. The director is a good observer for sure. Apparently, he's seen every crappy Hollywood sci-fi there is, and copied a mixture of them onto his original idea. If you want to see something that will feel like it was ""manufactured in the same factory"" as the ones you've seen before, then go ahead and see Equilibrium. Otherwise, don't waste your time and money on this lame bore.Poor Americans, they're taught and almost forced to enjoy such trash.. :-( I'm starting to feel that the moviemakers' ulterior motive is to accustom the people to tasteless movies like this, so that it'll be easier for them to attract viewers when they make a movie that's alright.

In a senseless world where all sorts of emotions are illegal, a law enforcer rises above the system in order to redeem the extinguished society from the totalitarian government. Christian Bale with that cold look is as convincing as all the settlings and actings of the film. However, dialogues are a bit poor in some scenes.

Why haven't I heard about this movie before???  I ranked it with 8 out of 10 and now I wished I had ranked it higher.  It was very well done in all areas of production (acting, direction, lighting, and cinematography).  The ONLY reason that I didn't rank higher... I think... is because it's a story that isn't too original in its goal and quite frankly not needed in our society today.  I will say that we are all aware of the importance of art, love, and emotions to exsist as a human race.  This movie pointed that out wonderfully, but I think it just all goes without saying.  STILL, for the wonderful art involved in making this film; all should see it and ""feel"" its heart.Christian Bale was perfect for this role.  On the one hand, he can just make the temperature of the room go down several degress with his expressions or lack of them.  He's like a cold, calculating machine - possibly should be a Terminator series model of some kind in a future production of The Terminator.  Then, later you can see the feelings in his eyes.  Enough said, there.  He's damn good.His later partner is equally talented in his role.

Enforcing the rule, arresting 'sense offenders' and burning anything that may stimulate emotion is the task faced by the Tetragrammaton (what?) clerics and Preston (Bale) is the stone cold top dog who eliminates with no thought.

There is a message to be heard and the director does an excellent job in allowing it to be subtle and not interfering with the real show of the movie, the gun-kata (unlike the Matrix, but I enjoyed that to a degree). The fight sequences in the movie are pretty unique, and plenty of style. I left the theater remembering how cool Christian Bale was with his assortment of weapons but not remembering a single good line he said. Is that a good thing? I suppose it depends on the movie and the context.There's a reason why I kept the review short. If you're coming to see Equilibrium, expect a million rounds of ammunition fired ""creatively"" on the screen and little else.By the way, I find it humorous and ridiculous that some people claim that a movie is the best ever, yet in other reviews that say the exact same thing. Funny stuff.6/10",Equilibrium

Excellent action - fight with the guns and swords - Bale really put in a great performance!!

The storyline just lacked something - that Je ne sais quoi - I guess it was a little slow at times, and you didn't get enough time with the refugees to understand their world. I feel they could have done more to connect the audience to some of these characters - I really felt nothing for them as I didn't understand their pleight!Bottom Line: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!

I didn't care to read the review (I can't trust many nowadays), but I found the rating surprising,especially with great actors like Christian Bale and Emily Watson. Then I saw the relatively good reviews it got on IMDb and decided to have a look. All I can say is I loved it. The theme is very reminiscent of ""THX-1138"" or ""1984"", but the underlying theme of ""Animal Farm"" eventually prevales. I actually liked the simplicity of the sets and the acting as well. Some would consider it bad acting, but remember that we are dealing with people who are not supposed to feel, and as a result, the acting would look like a bunch of Keanu Reeves, but I could get over it. Some would also complain about the martial-art/gun hybrid, and yes, it's way over the top and unbelievable, but heck, it just looks awesome and it is the film's guilty pleasure. Only thing that I'm still trying to figure out is why the Taye Diggs character showed so much emotion at times when feelings are banned (it makes sense in the end, but it's surprising he doesn't get arrested at times). So in conclusion, yeah, it may have its flaws, but still a great flick to watch.8/10",Equilibrium

Still the story is an amazing one, and it is highly enjoyable to anyone who has never seen it.Or if you liked reading Fahrenheit 451. I showed this move back then to a book club group that loved the book, and we all agreed this is the best movie that tries to capture the 'feel' of the book.The effects are just sub par, but they were incredibly ambitious for their day. I never realized it back then, because I didn't know so much of the movies sets were done in complete CG. I think this is a major reason the white car felt so 'off' to me.

That said, Equilibrium stands boldly on it's own. There are holes in the idea of not feeling anything (how are they reproducing with lust being a key element in sex?), but ultimately it doesn't matter that much, because everything is in place here. Christian Bale is perfectly cast in the lead and Emily Watson surprises by choosing a project (along with Red Dragon) that isn't her usual art house fare. And who had ever heard of Kurt Wimmer prior to this? I don't know, but he manages to deliver the goods with such invention as the ""gun-kata"", which is a samurai based fighting technique (although seen here with guns instead of swords). What is shameful here though, is the under use of Sean Bean. Why enlist a talent like his and then waste him after the first 15 minutes? It's Ronin all over again. As sad as that is, it doesn't lower the quality of this one. I urge you to see Equilibrium. It brings a nice balance to your day!***** / *****",Equilibrium

174,benjamin_lappin,A Balancing Act Of The In And Un Credible,6,7 July 2007,"Proving there is a glimmer of hope in the post-first Matrix instalment world, Equilibrium provides a tantalising mixture of well crafted action segments and 1984-esque philosophy debating the nature of human emotion and its consequences. However, as with many films of this genre it tends to tread that fine line between the original and the incredibly generic and mundane. This is not the say the film is a failure as it is severely absorbing, especially on the premiere viewing, as it appeals to the need for ""coolness"" that resides within all of us, but there is something which prevents it from attaining not necessarily respectability but credibility as a ""great"" film.Set in a not entirely unimaginable future, Equilibrium shows us a society which has collectively suppressed its emotions via the use of a drug 'prozeum'. Lending itself heavily in a philosophical way to George Orwells' 1984 it questions whether sacrificing our emotive nature to prevent the violence and attitudes which stem from the negative part of our pscyhe is beneficial and whether or not if we do we are still human.Inevitably comparisons to The Matrix are going to be drawn as Equilibrium does not rely but implies a heavily stylised means of photography and the fore-mentioned human philosophy, but is the comparison truly warranted? Well to an extent, yes. It is somewhat successful in its implementation, managing never to feel forced in its poignancy. Its stylised action sequences are exceptionally gripping but do not drive the film, and there is a greater narrative than many are willing to credit it with. However it lacks the necessary 'punch' which made The Matrix and instant science fiction classic. It's not because of the bigger budget or the increased input of household names which is reason, but that Equilibrium falls victim of nit-picking. On multiple viewings it never loses its watch-ability and the gravitas as a cool film, but plot holes become much more apparent, and the more they are discussed the more they irritate. Why do they irritate so much? Because Equilibriums' potential is there for all to see. It has a construct which is plausible, tackles a notion of humanity which is easily identifiable and easily to relate to, but lacks a spark, lacks a flawless plot and while unoriginality is not a claim which can be thrown at it (seeing as most films, plays, stories etc are 'adaptations' or have used aspects of those that have gone before it) there are too many ifs and buts which prevent this film from attaining anything more than the score granted.Equilibrium is a balancing act which lands on the side of success, Christian Bale is completely engaging as the films lead (and provides easy viewing for the female of the species, just ask my girlfriend) and the supporting cast fulfil their obligations to contribute with above par performances. Also it would be not a complete review without a nod and light round of applause to a director who has a notable ability to shoot his film in a manner which lends itself well, with good compositions in the narrative and good cuts in the action sequences. However despite its many positives which give this film credibility in the science fiction genre post 1999 it never manages to punch above its weight sufficiently to warrant a sustained comparison to the film which redefined so much. It's a shame that Equilibrium must so readily be compared to The Matrix (I know, I know), it is not unique and it is not original, but it is clever, it is entertaining and more importantly, for the most part, works, suffice to say there is enough going for this film to tip the scales in its favour.",Equilibrium

I cannot believe studios waste time and money promoting such tripe as ""America's Sweethearts"", ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""Just Married"", and they forget about fantastic movies such as this one.  I had never heard of this movie before I rented it, I had never seen a promo for it, nor had I read any industry press on it. Instead, they waste my time promoting horrible Hollywood trash at the expense of good films (Daddy Day-Care????????).  I will never understand it.The gun-play in this film is breath-taking, on a caliber with The Matrix without the need for Matrix-time.  The action sequences are crisp, exciting, and virtually without equal.  Christian Bale, up to now best known as the ""America Psycho"" gives an unbelievable performance, I had no idea he was such a refined martial artist.  He makes the moves seen effortless, yet believable.  ************* POTENTIAL SPOILERS ***********************The story is intriguing, a take on the Orwelian tale of Big Brother. Emotions have been outlawed by the logic that hatred and rage led mankind to 3 World Wars (the film takes place after WW3).  Citizens are forced to take a drug which creates automatons out of them, robots with no feelings, who question no rule.  Society is controlled by a violent and ruthless Father-figure, showing no mercy to Sense Criminals.  The allusions to Nazi Germany are many and overpowering.This is the best film I have seen this year.  It is a definite DVD must-have.  The futuristic post-apocalyptic world is very well done, combining CGI with realistic sets.  The viewer is entirely immersed in this harrowing 21st century Hades.  The film also pulls no punches, the damsel in distress is not rescued at the last second.  The hero must literally divest himself of all humanity to have any hope of winning, butchering all who step in his way.  The action sequences are not interrupted by the heavily Terminator-influenced one-liners which only ever diminish the role (except in Arnie's case), the mood remains black throughout.A thoroughly satisfying film, I loved it. 10/10",Equilibrium
176,lakings97,B Rated Matrix style movie,4,24 December 2020,"Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world sometime after the Third World War where the only way humanity has a fighting chance to survive is to eliminate emotions all together. Christian Bale is a law abiding enforcer who acts as the judge and jury to eliminate those who don't take a drug to control emotions. Those who don't comply are killed on the spot. Literature and artwork are all destroyed so that all forms of feelings don't come back into society. When Bale misses a dose he realizes the truth and that life is empty without culture and art. He then tends to overthrow the government run by Angus Macfadyen. Sean Bean, Taye Diggs and Dominic Purcell all have small and important roles in this flick. The story was very convoluted and at times boring. I felt like I was watching a B rated matrix movie. I would not watch it again,",Equilibrium
177,film_ophile,Been There; Done That,5,29 September 2006,"I have admired Christian Bale since first seeing his amazing performance in Empire of the Sun.I watched this because I recently re- enjoyed Christian Bale in Batman Begins and I wanted to see him in something else. I think he is a very talented fellow but I bet he regrets having made this film. Too bad. Such a hackneyed story and treatment.I must say I am really surprised that Miramax put their might behind this boring Matrix/1984/Farenheit 451 etc etc wannabe/rehash. Too much men in black and scowling and empty battling. not enough relief, romance, depth.Its just too much of a snippets/patch job that doesn't go anywhere in any meaningful way.

178,Gjay2,a tough one,6,24 March 2003,"with all this ""ooo it's just trying to be the matrix"" talk, it's hard to watch it without comparing. But personally, i think it stands on it's own rather well. The fight scenes are rare, but they are just as good, if not even better than the ones the matrix had to offer. And Christian Bale is just as cool as keanu. But like i said, there isn't enough of the fight scenes, which means the story takes center stage. and yes, the story is very good, in theory, but put over two hours, it starts to feel forced. Luckily though, they don't try and sentimentalize the story too much. It slackens a little after the first hour, but kicks in again towards the end. What makes this film good but not amazing is that it looks too polished and contrived. The settings, and some of the actors are far from great. And the fact the some of the 'suprises' are really nonsensical, don't do it any favours either. But, for a timewasting film, you could do a lot worse. But it needed more guns.",Equilibrium
179,moviefan2003va,Wow,7,23 January 2005,"This is definitely a cool movie. I don't want to take anything away from Keanu Reeves in The Matrix but Bale is the ultimate cool in his action sequences. This movie though is not purely action. It is a fairly cerebral movie. The people have survived a third world war and have decided to prevent people from feeling emotion. They point to emotion and feeling as the reasons for the past three wars. Works of arts like paintings, books, and music are forbidden. Bale misses a dose of his meds to inhibit the prohibited feeling and his life turns upside down. He remembers his dead wife, discovers the passion he has missed out on in the form of Beethoven, a woman he is drawn to (Watson), and a puppy. Good thinking person's action movie. This was a nice find.",Equilibrium
180,Nigel St. Buggering,An unfairly buried gem,10,9 December 2002,"Many people are calling this film derivative, but when a film takes the best elements of several great stories, is that such a bad thing?  Yes, ""Equilibrium"" owes heavy debts to such works as ""1984"", ""Farenheit 451"", and ""Logan's Run"", as well as the hyper-stylized action of Hong Kong cinema (or, for those film geeks who can't see past the local multiplex, ""The Matrix""). But it blends these elements so well, and in such an entertaining fashion, that it doesn't suffer by comparison. Like ""Gattaca"", this film achieves its premise by taking a modern phenomenon, in this case, the rise in the use of mood-stabilizing drugs, and exaggerates it to epic proportions.  Unlike that film, however, this one has no compunctions about sweetening the deal for those with lesser attention spans.  The action sequences here are nothing less than dazzling; this is the best action choreography of the year, and in a year that boasts ""The Transporter"", that's saying something.  Christian Bale is an unorthodox choice as an action hero, and as it turns out, an inspired one.  The cold, merciless quality he first displayed in ""American Psycho"" is put to very different and equally effective use here. Alright, the conclusion seems a bit rushed, the plot twists are not always subtle or natural, and the budget limitations allow seems to show from time to time, but I'd rather see a film whose ambition over-reaches its budget than a forty-million-dollar all-star w*******n. Now, for whatever reason, the Weinstein Brain Brigade at Miramax has declared that this film should be pushed out with minimal fanfare and very little of the ad support that they would give to, oh, say, a teen slasher flick.  Therefore, I urge anyone with even moderate interest in science fiction and/or action, to seek this film out.",Equilibrium
181,Surecure,A well above average sci-fi/action flick,8,24 February 2006,"Equilibrium is a unique take on themes of authoritarian utopias explored in other science fiction mediums such as Fahrenheit 451. In a future where emotion has been deemed the source of humanity's darker side and thus banned by way of medication, an enforcement officer (dubbed a ""cleric"") discovers that not all is as it seems after he is forced to execute his partner. He soon uncovers his partner's connection with an underground resistance and specifically a woman who is found with banned substances such as art, literature and music. When he falls off his medication and begins to experience emotions for the first time -- such as love for the woman he is investigating -- he is forced to face choices he never realized were possible, and could ultimately doom him.Writer/director Kurt Wimmer's talent is evident from the very first frame. He has a magnificent eye for detail and his visualization is like candy for the senses. The film itself begins as a dull, grey tone that conveys the mortality of emotion in the story effectively. And just as the protagonist's emotions build, so too does the colour and light of the cinematography. In this sense, Wimmer understands that the audience must be immersed into the reality of the story itself, and the effect is complete.The performances themselves are unfortunately a hit-and-miss scenario. Christian Bale, Sean Bean and William Fichtner are convincing in their performances. Bale's awakening and both Bean and Fichtner's deceptive emotionless are picture perfect and effectively ground the film in its reality.Unfortunately, Taye Diggs' performance in 'Go' would be better translated to this role than the choices he makes. Whereas in ""Go"" he seemed to be emotionless and cool, in 'Equilibrium' he is an emotional roller-coaster, thus becoming wholly unbelievable in the role of the emotionless ""cleric"" he is supposed to be portraying. Thus, his smiling, shouting performance becomes more of a distraction than anything else, a shortcoming also noticeable in Angus Macfadyen's performance. Emily Watson's performance is somewhat borderline in that she too is emotional from the beginning, though it would make more sense if she tried to hide it at first.The action sequences are stunning, and the idea of the ""gun kata"" -- a training system for gunfire devised by the thorough analysis of gun battles -- is a refreshing development that makes the seemingly invincible ""clerics"" believable. One might be disappointed that the ""gun kata"" isn't used more frequently in the film, but its sparsity also gives a viewer a good reason to watch the film again.Overall, 'Equilibrium' is a smart, entertaining film made with equal parts directing, writing and acting talent. Falling just short of brilliant, it is an easy recommendation to anybody wanting an intelligent action film.",Equilibrium
182,jimhtl,Cheesy Beyond Belief,4,9 June 2021,"This movie is just too dumb and cheesy for my taste... If it wasn't for Bale, it would only get 1 star.",Equilibrium
183,HaveWisdomWillTravel,Nobody Told Director Kurt Wimmer Anger and Hatred ARE Emotions (that happen to cause wars),4,19 August 2014,"This narrative attempts to convey the idea that emotion has value, but fails to value emotion enough to give the movie emotional depth. Emotional intelligence score: 14 years old (male).Unsurprisingly, since music IS emotion, the soundtrack is glaringly bad: emotionally-inappropriate, plain awful scores, cringe-worthy especially during dramatic fight scenes, worsen by amateur audio mixing and compression. I like dramatic neoclassical-electro-pop, a la Batman or Blade Runner, not shallow grandeur electro-melodramatica that drown out dialog and smother to death the rare signs of authentic human emotions. The visual effect is either very good or exceptionally bad. Cinematic composition and especially close-ups and indoor scenes are very well done and original in visualization, given the relatively low budget. CGIs of city long shots and animations are simply pre-2000, full of glaring errors, even typical machinima cut scenes will fetch greater realism...Casting choices highly inconsistent. Christian Bale is in a lonely class of his own. Sean Bean and William Fichner were underused. Emily Watson is supposed to represent emotion, but her botox-frozen eyes and stiff too-groomed-for-prison lips failed to convey sorrow or fear. Dupont the leader is badly cast (or directed), no muscle tone no authority no weighty dramatic presence - a mere annoying chubby puppy barking unintelligibly at the sharp impeccable Christian Bale. At his most threatening moments, Dupont manages to act the soft flabby-cheek lawyer mumbling some pretentious overly-wordy threats. His idea of conveying authority is throwing a lame saliva-flying table-banging temper tantrum.Which brings us to... THE MEANING OF EMOTION (according to Kurt Wimmer) Apparently there're only a few women left in the city. But of course - the convention is women are ""emotional"", men are...cool? In the brave new world of mid 21st century, it seems women will still being scapegoated as ""the more emotional"" sex, because they just like to hoard pretty antique stuff so they will more likely to be exterminated. Most men are less into frilly stuff, so they will obediently inject themselves with emotional botox and go around efficiently killing those unrepentant feminine-minded music-appreciating losers who hoard books and vinyls. Yep...The writer director failed to understand entry-level human psychology vocab: Emotions and feelings, technically, aren't the same. Sensation is an even more distinct thing. To Kurt Wimmer, emotions, feelings, sensations mean the same thing - BUT - anger, paranoia, fear, competitiveness, domineering and controlling impulse, killing thirst, are not emotions or feelings. So what is feelings to Kurt? SENTIMENT. Sentimental attachment to family photos, little personal objects, art, domesticated animals, paintings. Yep...you know, chick stuff. HATRED (of anything including people with unacceptable behaviors) are apparently not an emotion, nor war-inducing, by the law of Equilibrium society. THE NEED TO KILL OFF A PERCEIVED THREAT (a.k.a. paranoia) is apparently not an emotion also. Equilibrium's masters, including the protagonist, are THAT stupid.This is a classic case of the typical aggressive males feeling shame for feeling anything at all - hence failing to classify their own most frequent emotional experience as emotions. No wonder war and mass killing happen. Accordingly to this classic-fallacy: school children shooting psychopaths are just being ""unemotional"" as they fire on at innocent victims, you know. Anger doesn't count as emotion. Blinding hatred, meh, is not emotion. Mass shooters are not being emotional. They are so not hysterical (like women). They are ""just being efficient"". Statistically economical, a cold calculating math genius. So cool. So unemotional.And Kurt Wimmer wanted to comment on the emotion that causes war. LOL. I really wish he was being ironic. But unfortunately the story tone is dead serious.Summary: art-appreciation is emotional and causes war. Emotional-repression and systematic killing (a.k.a. WAR) don't cause war. (???!!!) Mommies and softy men are war criminals so mostly dead. A human race as hysterical and ridiculously dumb as this will last more than one generation. Right...The movie is a fail for me, in spite of Christian Bale's performance. Bale's emotional range and control, his near-perfect physique and martial art mastery, and the gungfu choreography, are the things worth watching in this movie. Everything else can be summed up as another Nolan-wannabe's emotionally-shallow, philosophically-lame technically-uneven piece of egoistical product.Recommended only for bored weekday evenings.",Equilibrium
184,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Equilibrium',6,25 September 2007,"'Equilibrium' is a 107-minute guilty pleasure with some stellar lead performances from Christian Bale and Emily Watson. Honestly, if the film had been as good as it was in the beginning, all the way through, it would have a earned a 10/10 in my book. But ending, although happy, is so stupid, so unrealistic and corny, I couldn't help but laugh. I mean, you've got a bunch of rebels, and then you have thousands upon thousands of soldiers--probably more.I just can't accept that the rebels would ultimately win out. I think I would have liked it better if it had a more 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' ending, where the good guys DON'T win. Or even better, a happy ending that didn't replace intelligence with idiotic happiness.As I said, Watson and Bale give some Grade-A performances.

186,xiaoli7377,"Flawed, Unoriginal, and the Last Half Hour Really Ruins It",6,30 August 2020,"""Equilibrium"" was a box office bomb when it came out in 2002, making back only about $5 million of its $20 million budget. It also drew negative comparisons with both classical dystopian literature such as ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"", as well as the hugely popular and successful ""The Matrix"", a movie with very similar fight choreography and overall story premise of a near future where the protagonist ""wakes up"" from his slumber and fights to free a resistance force from an oppressive regime. And the plot is as simple and generic as that sentence makes it out to be.Don't get me wrong, it can be entertaining at times. Christian Bale gives a good performance as John Preston, a Cleric, whose job it is to seek out and destroy priceless works of art that evoke emotional response, and to ruthlessly massacre any and all who are accused of committing ""sense crimes."" Set in a post-World War III future where humans have decided to purge themselves of feeling, ""Equilibrium"" follows the same plot structure of other, better dystopian fiction. Although initially a devout follower of the cause, Preston is slowly exposed to his feelings and eventually ends up in contact with ""the resistance"" itself. Cookie-cutter.What I will say is that Bale puts on a pretty good performance as the dry and calculating Preston, and the other actors are adequate as well. Sean Bean even makes an appearance in the first twenty minutes and adds another to his long death count in movies, which is probably just a running joke in the Hollywood community. ""Equilibrium"" is well shot, and the production quality is all there. There's nothing really wrong with it on a technical level.Artistically though, it's just not very compelling or interesting. The gun fu, or ""gun kata"", along with the long black trench coats just can't help but draw comparisons with ""The Matrix."" Defenders of the movie will point to the plot in order to argue against that point, but deep down it just regurgitates its influences and never takes the time to contribute any new revelatory contributions or spins to the tired plot structure of better dystopian science fiction. Part of what made the action sequences in ""The Matrix"" so memorable and unique was their dramatic weight. They were over the top, yes, but Neo never felt completely bullet proof and indestructible like Preston does in this one. It's just absurd to see a man in a trench coat and armed with a semi-automatic pistol take down a whole room of guards wearing riot gear with M16s.The ending knocks off an entire point from me. I would have given it a 7 as generic science fiction action, but the finale is filled with about as many holes and inconsistencies as the walls are left with after one of Preston's room-clearing gun ballet shows. The final fights are also terrible, and I just couldn't help but role my eyes at a few points due to poorly aged special effects. If you've seen the movie before then you probably know what I'm talking about.As flawed as it is, I'd say that it's probably more enjoyable than either of ""The Matrix"" sequels. Although that isn't saying much, it might compel you to give this one a try rather than one of those disappointments whenever you're in the mood for some gun fu action.",Equilibrium
187,dorotka24,Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure,9,25 October 2007,"I rented this expecting a Matrix clone, but instead was pleasantly surprised by what unfolded.Equilibrium has a premise that is not terribly original - we get a totalitarian, fascist-like future society that has decided after a devastating world war that human emotions are the root of all worldly problems. The solution? Suppress emotions with an inhibiting drug and provide mandatory daily dosages, missing even one of which is punishable by death. The law is enforced by a cadre of agents known as ""Clerics"" - masters of hand-to-hand combat and firearms. It's a dismal vision of the future that has been mirrored by numerous authors, filmmakers, and people in general throughout the years.What makes the movie interesting is that the themes are explored through the eyes of one of the ""Clerics"", and his gradual awakening as he himself misses several doses of the emotion suppressing drug. The performances are excellent, and the action often takes a backseat as the characters develop and interact. This will turn off many Matrix fans, as there are a few extended portions of the film where action and tension are absent. When the action does hit, however, the impact is greater. I love The Matrix and I loved Equilibrium. They are not really even the same type of movie. Something that I definitely had never seen before was ""Gunkata,"" a fictitious method of self defense that includes handguns as the primary weapon. That was to me an interesting concept and made for some very exciting scenes.The flaws I noted were relatively few. For a society with suppressed emotions, I felt some of the characters smiled or otherwise expressed themselves a bit too much. I also felt that Angus MacFayden was definitely miscast (though Christian Bale was perfectly cast). I've read many of the negative reviews about the movie and can't understand them. How can one hate a movie so much? And if this is the worst movie that someone has ever seen, then they haven't seen very many pictures.I highly recommend this excellent movie.",Equilibrium
188,asphyxion_,One of the most overrated films of all time,4,24 December 2019,"Yeah, I said it, and yeah, I know I'm going to get a new orifice ripped because of it.I used to love this movie as a young teenager when it first came out. I thought it was just as bad-a$$ as The Matrix and thought it to be a philosophically 'deep' exploration of the human condition (LOL don't spit ur milk out through ur nose). It wasn't until I gained some salt in my beard and some wisdom after two decades of watching practically every film under the sun that I came to realize just how bad Equilibrium is when I watched it for the first time in nearly 10 years last night.The film itself doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a complete rip off of INGSOC and 1984. From the way Libria is designed and portrayed (gray formlessness, muted blues and dark matted colors), to the sheer laziness of the plagiarism in the narrative device of 'Sense Offense'/'Sense Offenders' (ripped straight from 1984's 'Thought Crime'/'Thought Criminals' plot mechanism), down to the freakin' citizenry's dresscode (Libria's denizens just happen to look less homeless than Eastasia's allies). Even certain scenes are copied to a near-T, like when Winston is brought to an emotional reckoning at the image of a snowglobe, just like John Preston in Equilibrium collapsing in tears when he hears Beethoven for the first time whilst simultaneously chancing upon a snowglobe.Even the climactic moments are entirely unoriginal, like the reveal of who Libria's Father truly is and what Brandt has done out of unfettered servitude to the State -- 1984's Winston suffers an identical betrayal when he learns the truth about O'Brien and the innkeeper who was hiding him and Julia from prying eyes.Unfortunately, blatant shoddy plagiarism isn't Equilibrium's most glaring fault.Equilibrium's behemoth SNAFU is in the utter incoherence of the movie's primary plot device: feeling is illegal and punishable only by summary execution. If you actually remotely think about this idea, it becomes impossible to ignore the glaring absurdity of it. Characters, Grammaton Cleric or not, are all driven by emotion constantly throughout the film, utterly undermining the central idea that Prozia keeps Librians in a zombie-like, emotionless state. Several times we catch Brandt with a Cheshire smile as he relentlessly attempts to catch John Preston in an act of Sense Offense. Well, the idea that Brandt would even be preoccupied with the thought of catching John in an illegal act to further his rank in the Grammaton Clergy is in itself a Sense Offense crime, because it clearly displays a selfish desire for egotistical approval and ambitious reinforcement. To avoid drifting into some incoherent, philosophical rambling tangent, I'll encapsulate my idea thusly: it is impossible to NOT be driven by emotion as a human being. Every action is driven by some form of feeling: a selfish desire or a selfless desire. By Equilibrium's standards, all humans would be executed the day they become cognizant or self-aware. It's pseudo-intellectual garbage masquerading as anything but.I'm also going to gripe about most of the action scenes. When I was younger, I thought the Grammaton Cleric was one of the coolest cinematic characters ever made. After rewatching these fight scenes, it's comically idiotic how bad most of these fight sequences are: guys literally STAND AND DO NOTHING in a circle while letting Preston wail on their heads/helmets in slow motion with almost no resistance. If you don't believe me, go to the part of the movie when he tries to help the group of men escape from Brandt's raid and then uses the butt of his pistols to clobber an encircling group of enemy combatants. It's utterly cringeworthy.But all the action isn't so horrible. If I'm being honest, the only saving grace for Equilibrium is the movie's final act. The action in the final act is actually worthy of its praise because we get real fighting and genuine martial arts, not some guy standing in the middle of 20 men swinging a rubber dildo at their padded helmets as they stand still, drool, and take their beatdown in proud stride.Despite Equilibrium's crippling idiocy, it still remains a very entertaining movie to watch. I know you probably wouldn't get that sense about the movie after reading my condescending rant about the movie, but I can't knock it for its entertainment value. It's highly watchable even though you have to practically suspend all plausible belief to watch it, and I think this is largely due to the great casting decisions of Bale, Diggs and Bean as Grammaton Clerics battling over their own humanity. The kid who plays John Preston's son also does a great job as an undercover sense offender.Equilibrium deserves to be seen at least once, and chances are you'll more than likely really enjoy the film (i mean, a quarter million votes at 7.6 stars proves as much). But after seeing 1984, the movie was forever ruined for me when I came to the epiphany of what a blatant piece of plagiarism this movie is.",Equilibrium

197,Wwmbrd,Brave New Fahrenheit 1984 Matrix Giver,6,20 September 2021,"Equilibrium is a film that wears its influences on its sleeve- If I were to retitle the film, I'd call it Brave New Fahrenheit 1984 Matrix Giver. It heavily borrows from each of these books/films in both theme and presentation. I mean, look at the movie poster; I don't think you could copy the matrix any harder if you had an industrial bed scanner. Let it not be said that I think that borrowing influences and themes from Brave New World, 1984, The Giver, and Fahrenheit 451 is a bad thing, anything but. Equilibrium is a movie with lofty ambitions for its moral of resisting authoritarian regimes and the evils of censorship, though it can be heavy handed at times. (Did they really need a closeup on the Mona Lisa on fire for the audience to understand?)The protagonist is Christian Bale as ""the Cleric"", a man much like Guy Montag crossed with Tom Cruise's character in Minority Report (which premiered the same year, and also dealt with thought crimes... an interesting coincidence), a cop who hunts down ""thought criminals"" who resist taking medicine that causes you to be unfeeling. The purpose of this medicine is to prevent World War 4, and within this universe, propaganda is played constantly on screens and speakers seen throughout the city, and even within the home, 1984 and 451 style. Also much like 451, the protagonist's wife falls into ""sense crime"" (this universe's term for thought crime- anyone who begins to feel emotion) and she is summarily executed. Later in the film, Bale's character stops taking the medicine after an encounter with a woman he's supposed to have killed (The Giver) and begins feeling himself... which leads him to mount an improbable assault on the very government of which he is a high ranking member of in order to free the population from the surveillance state and oppressive government that ironically believe they've freed the population from war and oppression through suppression of emotion and feeling (also Giver). Again, a bit hamfisted in presentation of theme, but I think knowledge of these classic novels aids in the understanding of the story, rather than undermining it.If there's anything that Equilibrium does right, it's action. While the guards all wear black vinyl Matrix trenchcoats and black motorcycle helmets (the budget was only $20m and I'm sure most of it went to Bale and Sean Bean), Bale dishes out death via Gun-Fu in Jedi robes. Cue the Matrix scenes. Through some clever camera placement and use of darkness, there's a very effective scene early in the movie where Bale is in an entirely dark room and illuminates the rushing enemies only by muzzle flash from his guns, and their faces and body movements are briefly shown in split second flashes as the camera cuts at the pace of the gun being fired. It's better to be seen than heard described in text, but it's excellently done. The same goes for the later sword and Gun-Fu fights. John Woo would be proud.Had it come out just 3 or 4 years earlier, Equilibrium might have been the hit that the Matrix was, appearing to thunderous applause of its grandiose themes and classic dystopian themes. Instead, it premiered just a few years late to a dull clatter as it hit the floor, was a box office flop, and then promptly forgotten because of the cheap production value by 2002 standards, and a worn out welcome of gun-fu and slow motion camera trickery that the aforementioned Matrix had collectively fatigued us of in the 90s. A watchable movie, but not one I could consider great. 6/10.",Equilibrium
198,trevor-mcinsley,"Good Concept, Poor Execution",4,1 March 2014,"This film is written by someone with no concept of what emotion truly is. They seem to think it is simply a compulsive urge to collect knick-knacks. I get the impression that they might have collated their notes on the condition of the human psyche from wandering idly around car boot sales.I'm not saying the script required the hands of a sociopath to be correctly portrayed but as it stands the film is riddled with unnecessary emotion which is contrary to the plot.For instance when Neo Mark II begins feeling emotion he suddenly starts to enjoy the feel, sight and smell of things. Yet he thinks absolutely nothing to his daughter eating chocolate flavoured cereal? Not to sound overly petty but in a society which has dosed themselves senseless there would be no chocolate flavoured anything. What a fantastic sentence that was.Likewise the dialogue throughout is indicative of a society which actually feels emotion. All the 'good night', 'good morning' and 'hello' nonsense. They are pointless social niceties which would only exist in an emotional society. Yes when people say them in the real world it is more out of compulsion or conformity and they don't necessarily genuinely care if you do have a 'good night' but saying it shows that they care enough to appear as if they do. Or in other (less convoluted) words: if you have no emotion you wouldn't bother saying it at all.Couple this with the actions of the ones who refuse medication and the film comes off as overly ridiculous. It makes sense that when everyone is dosing themselves up with emotional inhibitors that they would see no reason for stopping that behaviour and feeling emotion. It also makes sense that they would outcast or kill anyone who did. You can draw parallels to narcotic addiction there if you like but even without that aspect it makes sense.What doesn't make sense is the behaviour of the ones they are mercilessly wiping out. You see rather than wanting to free everyone and overthrow the drug pushing regime it seems that they simply have an overwhelming desire to collect desk toys and small statues of international landmarks.I understood hoarding the forbidden artwork, keeping books and music but is floral wallpaper really worth a death sentence? The rebels or whatever they call them therefore come off more like a combination between heavily armed art dealers and compulsive hoarders.I guess though if they were actually trying to put up some kind of fight or attempting to fulfil a more pertinent plot point the film would just be too much like the Matrix. With the over the top kung-fu gun fighting and Goth/Nazi inspired outfits that is what it is obviously trying to emulate anyway so I suppose crossing the line into a solid plot would be too far. I'm already pretty sure you could selectively juxtapose the lead character's dialogue over Neo's scenes from the Matrix and no one would be any the wiser.EDIT: I spoke too soon. White Morpheus has just shown up and crowbarred in a plot in the last half hour.I'd have probably rated this film higher were it not for the completely contrived and ridiculous ending. The finale has just the most manufactured and pointless action sequences I have ever seen in any film. They basically come out of nowhere and serve little or no purpose. First he takes out two dozen guards whose > 600rpm rifles are completely unable to deal with a man just because he jumps about a bit. Then he takes out a bunch more people armed with swords who for some inexplicable reason decide to close in on him without so much as drawing their weapons. I mean there might as well have just been a rampant unicorn who rode into the office, snapped off his own horn and handed it to Neo Mk 2 to use as a weapon after saying ""may all your wishes come true""... that would actually have made more sense.Ultimately he defeats the sword wielding guys so quickly and with so little effort that the scene just feels pointless. Sword fighting is a little overdone in action films but Kill Bill and even the second Matrix film succeed in having well choreographed and dramatic battles. This one is just silly. Then he slices a man's face off and starts trying to punch a man in the head with a pistol.A ridiculous ending for a ridiculous film.",Equilibrium

After he kills a friend, however, something in him breaks and he starts to fight the tyrannical rulers of the unemotional society. The actors in the film are surprisingly good, especially Sean Bean in the beginning of the movie. The fights in the film are also very good, even if too gory sometimes. That said, the action is a bit slow-moving and the end is quite stupid. The main character is also frustrating from time to time. The visual effects are OK, but nothing stunning really.

200,diztorted,The perfect recipe for modern sci-fi action flicks,9,10 June 2003,"Well to begin with, I must say this film is about a rigid society controlled by a person who is only sought through screens (no, it's not the Big Brother from 1984), this society is supposed to take a drug in order to be controlled and peace kept (no, it's not A brave new world by Huxley), and in which sensations and feelings are illegal as well as anything that would awake feelings in people such as paintings, perfumes, music, etc (no it's not Fahrenheit 451)...and, if this is not enough, like in these three classics, a man awakes to reality and fights the oppressive system to bring it down and give people back their so called freedom....Alleluya!!!I know, the premise does not promise much, and it only seems like Kurt Wimer, the director has been reading a lot of classic science fiction lately. But being realistic...How many people have read these unforgettable classics nowadays? Isn't this a good way to introduce new generations to such stories? I mean, take all the good elements from any of these novels, add over the top actions scenes, then add cheesy special fx and horrible cgi that reminded me of captain power back in the early 90, and lastly add a great and awesome post-American psycho Christian Bale as well as the always good Emily Watson. What do we have? One of the most exhilarating cheap sci-fi flicks in years, just as simple as that.Really, this movie is so great that you are almost able to forgive its plot holes and cheesy fx. Is so great that you will get angry by not having seen it in the theaters when it was playing. Why is this film so good? two words...GUN KATA, a martial art develop for the Clerics to fulfill their duties, the ultimate weapon and system of defense, of course the former bad guy converted into good guy, will use it to bring the entire empire down...is that good.Don't just read this stupid review and nod, just see it, as in right now.",Equilibrium
201,Mr.Uxo,To Feel Again,8,13 October 2003,"Christian Bale is fantastic in this sci-fi look at a post-war period ruled by a Government that enforces a society without feeling. Bale plays the top government enforcer of a group called the Clerics that seek out and condemn any person(s) who are feeling. Feeling is supposed to be surpressed by a drug called Prozium which everybody is required by law to self-inject at certain timed intervals. It's the transformation of Bale's character as an emotionless Gov enforcer into a person who is feeling for the first time that makes the film so enjoyable to watch.

202,sonofhades,Poor Man's Matrix,4,2 March 2015,"I had high hopes for this film after seeing the rating it had got at IMDb. The disappointment was quite bitter for a couple of reasons:1) Sean Bean dies (surprise) early in the movie. 2) Christian Bale does one of his weakest performances as an actor. 3) The film is actually a poor matrix clone, but with somewhat poorer special effects, stupid dialogs and well, characters whose survival was of no interest to the viewer. Actually, if the main character had been killed in the movie, it would have improved the story a lot. 4) All combat scenes are so unrealistic that i was expecting for the main character to awake from sleep at some point. Commando or Rambo III had more realistic firefight scenes than this movie. 5) This was supposed to be placed in a future where everyone took their doze of Prozac that made them forget all about feelings. Weapon tech and cars were pretty much the same as those in the late 90s. 6) People were supposed to have no feelings. The different characters in the movie showed facial expressions such as smiling, anger and even fear. 7) The neo-Nazi government had to use latex and leather for their uniforms with Biker helmets. I know the movie is now a decade old or so, but even sci-fi movies in the 70s had better costumes for their characters. Sadly.",Equilibrium
203,filmfan92,"""EQ"" lacks IQ",4,23 July 2006,"Don't get me wrong. I love brainless action flicks. I lapped up Ultraviolet and Stealth. But what those two films had was a sense of grandeur, an understanding of the fact that the plot was simply fuel driving the next action sequence. Equilibrium takes a good (albeit unoriginal) idea, and tries to wrap a brainless action film around it. In trying to be a thinking movie and a dumb pleasure at the same time, it falls flat on its face. The story begins with a prologue, with the narrator sounding bored enough to keel over; the world is one without emotion. Without emotion, there is no war. The defenders of this cold drone world are the Grammaton Cleric. But when one of the Cleric's greatest warriors misses a dose of an emotion-blocking drug, he must choose a side in the war between the Cleric and the Resistance. The faux-smart banter between characters takes on a dullness akin to the later ""Blade"" movies. Even the action scenes seem insipid and pointless. Taye Diggs hams it up as the villain, and the whole thing is shot in that MTV-esquire style of jump cuts, camera whirls, and flashes. Occasionally, the filmakkers toss out a brilliant idea (a machine gun fight in the dark exudes style), but those come too rarely to save this clunker. Even Christian Bale, Sean Bean, and Emily Watson cannot drag this up from the depths of boredom.",Equilibrium
204,TensersFloatingDisk,Turn off brain. Insert movie.,6,14 April 2006,"My review is directed to those of you who've heard some of the buzz about this flick from its more rabid fanbase, or who've been intrigued by its Matrix-esquire visuals, and are considering a rental. Here's the deal: yes, the visuals, the pacing, the choreography, the theme, and at least two of the set-pieces are ripped directly from the original Matrix. And yes, the hero is a bargain-basement Keanu Reeves, and yes, that's as bad as it sounds.And yes, it's got plot holes and inconsistencies a-plenty, some of them big enough to drive whole fleets of tanks through. The worst of these undercuts the entire premise of the movie: a society dependent on each and every citizen, every single day, voluntarily administering an emotion-controlling drug...in a universe where we can't even get people to cross with crosswalk light? Yeah, right.HOWEVER This is still a worthwhile popcorn flick. The theme, treated with a *very* heavy hand here, is a worthy enough statement. The cast are generally pretty to look at (with the bizarre choice of primary villain, who's about as charismatic as cottage cheese). The action sequences are pretty good. And there are a few genuine moments that shine through - bits of self-sacrifice which don't ring quite so false as the rest of the hammy script.My advice: treat it not as a realistic science-fiction story at all. Treat it as an allegory, like a Coleridge poem with fireworks. You'll enjoy it well enough then.",Equilibrium
205,sedativchunk,"Equilibrium, a 2013 Review",8,30 August 2013,"I've always been a fan of ""The Matrix"" films for many years now. With that being said, I was only a teen when ""Equilibrium"" came out (which was supposedly stacked up against the Matrix films), and to be honest, I never heard of this movie or remember it being released until a few days ago when I ran across it on Amazon Prime. Coming from a post Batman era of Christian Bale (and his other great movies), I decided to give this movie a shot. Equilibrium is an action packed, ""gun kata"" movie starring Christian Bale. I'll leave the storyline to those who actually want to watch it. But moving on, in 2013, Equilibrium still holds up. Over 10 years after the release, I can say this is a fantastic movie to watch. The story is good, the action is excellent, and Christian Bale sells us another fantastic AAA movie. I'm sad that I did not realize this movie existed all of these years now, but it's definitely one I want to add to the blu ray collection.Good story, good premise, excellent visuals that stood the test of time, great soundtrack, and a wide array of great actors. This movie has a lot of good things about it that make it a Sci Fi classic. The bad sides - yes, it is a blatant knock-off of the Matrix aesthetically. Some of the action sequences are down right ridiculous and over the top. Also, the ending of the movie seemed kind of rush. I was kind of hoping for more. Still, all in all, good film. I would recommend it if you haven't seen it yet! Sad to see it never had any sequels/spin offs but in some ways, that's a good thing (look at the Matrix sequels, sometimes I think they would have been best off just having the original).",Equilibrium

Regardless of my respect and admiration for Christian Bale, ""Equilibrium"" almost got me fallen asleep after 30 minutes of watching.

You will be entertained (unlike with Christian Bale's last futuristic sci-fi B-movie ""Reign of Fire"").There's a plot (stolen, thereby good), not as one-dimensional as you might expect characters, and plenty of cool action sequences. It's not even completely predictable; there are plenty of surprises to hold your interest.Honestly, I was more entertained by this film than some more critic-friendly films such as ""The Matrix"" or ""Minority Report.""

Near the end, fans of Total Recall are certain to find a reference to the 'I'm Houser video scene', as well as references in Equilibrium to 'the Agency'. I'd even go as far to say there is some resemblance to The Wall.This movie does have some good action scenes. It takes to the end to get to the good stuff though, with what is a rather un-engaging ""hand to hand gun battle"" climax with the mastermind of the civilization.The story is very clear and shallow, and I found it hard to connect with any of the characters. I'm not sure which to blame, but basically the characters seem to be very predictable. You know who the good guys are, as well as the bad guys. The movie has good production values, but in the end just isn't very interesting. For an action flick, there's not enough. For a story there's not enough detail. For something about character depth, they aren't developed. Overall this is a movie, and that's about it. It's a shame too, probably done a little differently this could've been as good as The Matrix.Personally I would recommend Dark City, Total Recall, 1984, and The Matrix over this movie.Equilibrium: 4/10",Equilibrium
209,Jakethemuss,slick and very watchable,8,11 August 2007,"Welcome to the world of Libria, a high tech world of spotless streets, tall grey buildings, high walls, black clad armed guards with motorbike helmets covering their faces. It is a bleak vision of the future, one where emotion is seen as 'dangerous', and is thus outlawed in society.It bears similarity to the dystopian future in Orwell's 1984, where government has total control and citizens are kept in order. In Equilibrium, human emotion is repressed by a drug, prozium, which must be taken without fail everyday....or does it? The hero of the film is Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale), actually hes a Grammaton Cleric, and is one of the top law enforcers in the city, the elite so to speak. But when he fails to take his prozium, he starts to feel and in turn starts to see.I've seen this several times now, and feel it has serious re-watch value. Despite its obvious Matrix influence, it is still a solid film in its own right. Luckily it doesn't take itself too seriously, and this is apparent in the pumped up and frequent actions scenes, which are executed in a slick direct style. The only bad about the fight scenes is that they tend to be one sided, its almost as if the storm trooper type enemies can't quite locate the trigger.Outside the fight scenes it still keeps the viewer watching as John Preston slowly but surely starts to turn against the ruthless government he used to serve with such zeal. Boosts good performances, primarily Christian Bale as the stern, humourless gun wielding hard ass, Emily Watson as Mary, a ""sense offender"" who warms Preston's once icey heart. One of the not so good performances would have to come from Taye Diggs as Preston's sidekick, who shows an awful lot of public aggression for someone who's supposed to be emotionless.",Equilibrium

When I first saw its explanation in the movie, I laughed out loud. I actually thought it must be a broad parody on Japanese Martial Arts, a deliberate joke. Yes, the Japanese are way too serious about their ""disciplines,"" but nothing they do deserves this kind of joke-taken-way-too-deadly-seriously.Kurt Wimmer also marvels in his commentary about critics panning this flick. I believe he used the word ""vitriolic,"" as if the criticism were undeservedly over the top.

213,konover,Equilibrium: A Matrix wannabe?,7,1 March 2005,"Well, that's what I thought of when my friend gave me a belated Christmas gift in the form of a few DVDs, one of them being Equilibrium.Prior to seeing the film, I had seen a couple of pictures of Equilibrium somewhere and I remember Christian Bale and Taye Diggs wearing some decidedly Matrix type clothes, carrying two guns at the same time and then there were people who I heard talk about the fight scenes being as good as those in Matrix or something to that effect.So I put this DVD in my DVD player, thinking this is probably one of those Matrix ripoffs, but that it will be worth watching for the cast and that it'll be good popcorn fare...but not much else.But I was surprised that there was a very good sci-fi story in this movie that had me hooked early on. If there were any Matrix similarities to Equilbrium, story-wise, I was not aware of them as I watched the movie. There was a really good story, and very good performances. I thought Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Sean Bean and Emily Watson were all good. I don't recall seeing Angus Macfadyen before, but I thought he was quite good. I feel like I discovered a new, talented actor, not to mention a new director in Kurt Wimmer.Unfortunately, the movie DOES have some glaring faults. In a society with no emotion, a few of the actors DO smile. So I thought to myself, huh? One character even has an angry, loud outburst. So I wish there was more consistency here. Do they express emotion or don't they? Fortunately, it happens only a few times and you can let it slide, but ultimately, it still feels sloppy.The ending also had me quite befuddled on one issue, which I won't go into in case anyone wants to see the film and hasn't. (In fairness, maybe it's one of those ""You have to see the movie twice"" type deals.)Anyway, it's an entertaining film with a good story about emotions vs. no emotions, but its faults are notable enough to keep the movie from becoming a true classic. And if you're wondering whether to rent it or not, definitely rent it. Despite its flaws, I'm glad it's in my collection...and I *am* picky when it comes to sci-fi.",Equilibrium

The premise itself is kind of funny - asking us to believe that people in this dystopian society are not allowed to express emotions. this rule proves to be impossible to fulfill simply because acting in itself is an emotional action. And each time a character goes on to enforce the ""rule"" he is usually expressing either anger or content; It's a screaming paradox.The other problem is the comparison with ""The Matrix"" film. This is not a comparison you *could* make but one you WILL make and cannot escape from because the director leaves you no choice. The clothes, the music during the fights, the fights in slow motion, the whole ""Underground"" resistance and the plot itself. It's just too similar. And too bad, because when compared to ""The Matrix"" this movie looks even worse, like a awful copycat.While the story is silly, I am sure it could have been written better.

The nearest one can come to describing this Frankenstein monster of a travesty is ""1984"" crossed with ""The Matrix"", and the latter wasn't exactly blindingly original to begin with.As if this isn't bad enough, the film is loaded with inconsistencies and plot holes, all shoddily papered over in the name of convenience as well as scenes and dialogue so hackneyed you can see them coming a mile off (and if you can't, you should really see more films. Preferably good ones). I actually uttered one line seconds before the character did, and had to stifle risible laughter when Preston came face to face with the itty bitty, cutesy-wutesy puppy. (In this scene, please note that the budget  having probably been spent all on bullets  didn't seem to stretch to any sort of animal training, as it relies on actors pointing off-camera and saying, ""Stop it! It's getting away!"" and reaching down, most unconvincingly).Laughter, in fact, is the only realistic response to the majority of this farrago, if only to stave off the angry realisation that your time is being wasted. You want laughs? AND HERE BE SPOILERS (although it's kind of hard to spoil something that's already this rank, IMHO)In the lead up to the ""climactic"" fight, one character warns Preston that, should he get too close to""Father"" (highly original name for a ""Big Brother"" figure, eh?

When the spit hits the fan, however, there are no snipers, not a one: only an endless parade of policemen, doing what they do best throughout: dying. Honest, these guys, despite their fierce get-up, turn out to be the most useless, butter-fingered cannon-fodder since the Imperial Stormtroopers in the original ""Star Wars"" (and countless other Z-grade imitations). Once you realise that they couldn't hit a barn door at ten feet and that their tactics seem to consist of merely lining up to get gunned down, you're left with no tension, nothing at stake and only the tedious sight of moronic sitting ducks being blown away, noisily, time and time and time and time again.It doesn't help that, having walked Preston into a trap and taken his weapon, they don't think to search him for anything else, leaving him free to conceal guns and an abundance of spare ammo, as well as a complicated reloading mechanism...all up his sleeves. Good thing nobody shook his hand.This is the film's idea of a ""twist"": a development so implausible, so gobsmackingly unlikely that it's an insult to any intelligent film-goer.""Equilibrium"" is the kind of film so shoddily made and yet so pretentious, it just cries out for a parody, or to be taken apart on any of the countless ""Bad Film"" sites that are on the net. It meets all the criteria for a Bad Film, that's for damned sure. It's one thing to be unoriginal only a certain number of plots in the world, yada yada  but it's another thing to be quite so offensively cack-handed about it.",Equilibrium

He raved about it, and I thought-- OK, I'll give it a shot. I couldn't have been happier. Christian Bale gives a terrific performance. Elements of 1984 are here, that being a dystopian post-World War 3 future. Emotions have been suppressed, as well as any art form that might inspire man to feel. The most important thing to know about this film is that it combines fantastic action (a new martial arts style based on mathematics and using handguns - you really have to see it) and great dramatic scenes. And all on a fairly small budget! By the way-- ignore the references and/or comparisons to the Matrix. There really is little to no similarity here, unless you count long black trenchcoats.

It also has a good portion of irony about modern civilization, which really resembles a collectivist society in the movie, with the difference that the Prozium II is replaced by media. Yet, it lacks originality in the way in ends. You can easily predict a victory of ""good guys"", although I doubt they are actually good, and the fact that they understand what they fight for.

Just watch other movies he's done: Newsies, Little Women, Shaft, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and American Psycho. He's awesome.The movie reminded me a lot of Star Wars, which had an Original Trilogy that wasn't not dependent on special effects. Not the the effects were bad, but they weren't up to par, but it didn't matter, really. The characters shone through, as they do in this movie. Equilibrium is intelligent, thought-provoking, and entertaining. I'd watch it for Christian, his scenes with Emily Watson, and the message behind it!

Christian Bale's character Grammaton Cleric Preston, is responsible for enforcing the laws of Libria; and this is done by distributing a mind control drug, suppressing emotions, and destroying personal effects. Nevertheless, Grammaton Cleric Preston, has an epiphany and he realizes that the he can no longer enforce the draconian laws of Libria. After siding with the resistance, Preston decides to eliminate Libria's grand figure called, ""Father"". To cut the story short, Preston helps the Resistance to take down the draconian government of Libria.On the surface, Equilibrium may seem to to be a far stretch, but there are many authoritative regimes throughout the world, who will do anything to maintain control. What I like about this movie, it gives me a sense of what it is like to live in a country such as North Korea or Singapore. Meanwhile in western countries, there is a crack down on terrorists and sex offenders. The reality is, many governments throughout the world will use the power of nightmares to control their citizens.If you liked Equilibrium, you should check out Fahrenheit 451.",Equilibrium

I personally wasn't thrilled about the ""gun kata"" fighting, which I think got too much attention. It felt to me as a failure to try and re-invent something as cool as the ""bullet-time"" in The Matrix. Also the dialog was a bit off from time to time and it got in the way of fluent story-telling.

228,NolanSorrento,what a disappointment,1,6 January 2006,"Equilibrium This is a movie that lacks any and all sense of creativity. All it does is swipe from much better movies that use the Dichotomy theme, but in return, robs the audience by adding nothing new to the genre. Instead we get a movie that tries to take itself so serious it doesn't realize what a joke it is.The basic plot of the movie is that society figured out emotions is what causes crime & war, so they create a drug that squashes emotions, therefore eliminating war. Of course they have to deal with those that are against it and refuse to take the suppressant drug are eliminated by ""Clerics"", basically, really chic cops in leather trench coats that use Gun-Kata.This leads into the most annoying flaw of this movie for me, the 'lack of emotion' crock, for a society that lacks emotion; there sure is a lot of it. You see it in the architecture, clothes, sculptures and in the screaming & greedy people. It's not just the leaders who show emotion, which would be a fine example of hypocrisy, no; it's the folks working the menial jobs that get to run around and wet their pants in fear.The movie also tries to cash in on popular Hollywood-Fu by creating it's own martial arts called Gun-Kata, the name itself already brings back horrible memories of Gymkata and the Gun gimmick isn't any better then the Gymnast on a concrete horse fighting 'crazies'. No, the concept behind Gun-Kata is that a well trained student of the art can jump into a room of armed assassins and not get hit by hundreds of rounds flying all around them, especially when they are dead center in the room. Then on the offense side, the Gun-Kata expert will be able to figure out exactly where his enemies are at and nail them dead with stunning accuracy with out even looking in their direction or needing them to be in his line of site.Honestly, I rented this movie because it kept getting referenced by people as being one of the best over looked movies ever, sometimes I check back at those posting to see if I misread them saying ""swiped from some of the best movies ever"".",Equilibrium
229,Curtis G.,Good stuff. But why didn't Dimension promote it?,9,9 December 2002,"The biggest question I have about this movie is: Why didn't Dimension promote it? I saw not one commercial; in fact, I'd never heard of ""Equilibrium"" until today, on a gun-related Web forum. I figured that unless there was some really good word of mouth, it wouldn't be in theatres long, so I rushed out tonight to see it. I wasn't disappointed.Sure, there's a lot that's familiar (the whole ""1984"" milieu), but that's not necessarily bad. Kurt Wimmer has taken a lot of influences (""The Matrix"" is an obvious one, ""Metropolis"" less so) and molded them into a movie that's both familiar and refreshing, with some nifty twists. It's not perfect, but it's very, very good, and eminently watchable. Although the pacing could have been tightened up, it was shot extremely well and looks as if it cost much more than it did ($20 mil). The ""gun-kata"" scenes were suitably over the top (there were more than a few ""Oh, yeaahhhh!"" moments), while still managing to skirt the edges of possibility. Take note that it's no more a ""gun fu"" movie than it is a samurai-sword movie; instead, the weapons are part of who John Preston (Bale)  is and what he does. The story itself follows Preston's journey from unfeeling tool of the State to fully human (and flawed) savior.What's funny is that viewers are giving the movie rave reviews, while the ""mainstream"" media critics are panning it. I suspect it's because the movie's conservative bent offends their delicate statist sensibilities (the State is supposed to be good and benevolent, not evil).
I suspect ""Equilibrium"" is a sleeper: It won't do huge business in theatres, but it's destined to become a cult classic when it hits DVD. Still, I plan to see it a few more times before then.",Equilibrium

This movie isn't perfect, but it is good. It isn't incredibly deep and philosophical, but it is more than most movies. I liked ""The Matrix"" but found the philosophy to be rather shallow and eclectic. This movie had a specific philosophical point to make, and it nearly effectively made that point. The acting was pretty strong. On the DVD the director (I believe it was the director) noted they had to allow the characters to have minimal emotion. The actors were able to keep their emotions at a level. The action sequences were entertaining, completely over the top, yet entertaining. It is a fine line between exaggeration and absurdity.

233,vyperman7,"The Action rivals ""The Matrix""!!!!",8,8 December 2002,"Equilibrium blew me away. The action in this film is simply amazing. The gun play, martial arts action, and overall violence was mind blowing. It is fast paced, realistic, and extremely gory. Christian Bale, Emily Watson,  and Taye Diggs were the film's main stars, and they were all great. The film's only MAJOR flaw is that the film starts out very slow. But once the action starts, you are glued to the screen for the remainder of the film. Now a lot of people would say that if you want mind blowing action, you should see ""The Matrix"". But the action in Equilibrium was truely unique. Some of the action sequences were original and have never been done before. Also, the film was set in a futuristic society.

The basic premise of ""no emotions"" is flawed (especially when so many characters seemed to be expressing them). If you're enforcing a law prohibiting emotion, you don't leave the adminstration of suppressants to the people you're trying to prohibit. In our world we've had IUDs for decades as a form of birth control, so why not implant people with such a thing, so they won't have to think about it. And if you've grown up in this society without knowing emotions, just because you are off your drug doesn't mean you'll suddenly understand the feelings you get. Basically it's just bad sci fi writing, which is unfortunately the rule and not the exception. I'd go on, but there's no point. I liked seeing Emily Watson, just because she's always nice to see. Every time I see Christian Bale speak, he looks like he has a speech impediment. That's nothing against his acting, I just find it distracting.",Equilibrium

Cops raiding a building, but from than on it just goes down hill. The cops hit all their targets while the bad guys miss by the truckloads. Now I'm willing to suspend my sense of realism to a certain degree, but this movie is stretching it way beyond what is forgivable. The cops constantly go on raid after contraband, yet you never get to know how they got the information, which would be interesting considering they always kill everyone they come across. Not to mention that all the places they raid never seem to have a look out, and keep all their contraband merchandise out in the open. The whole gun-kata is just ridicules, and looks even sillier.Don't waste your time on this one, go watch They Live by john carpenter instead or even 1984.Or perhaps Drive with Marc Dacascos This one obviously spent all their money on ammunition, cause the story line is paper thin, and the acting is wooden.

If you've lived any amount of time in Singapore - you'll know that the premise is not that far from reality (strange as it may seem to viewers in the West).  It's no surprise that movies of a similar genre like ""1984"" and ""Brazil"" cannot be obtained in Singapore.If you want to know how good the movie's actions scenes are, they were good enough to wow the censors in Singapore enough that they forgot to check and block the underlying themes of the movie.",Equilibrium

The spin here is that the 'clerics' use an advanced gun fighting technique called 'Gun Taka' - think of the video game Devil May Cry crossed with The Matrix. It's very silly and ultimately if enough people fire automatic weapons at you no amount of kung-fu vogueing is going to save your hide. It is, however, a bit of a delight to watch and is choreographed beautifully so what might have been a gimmick ends up being rather impressive.What also pulls this film through is tone. The whole ensemble manages to play this whole thing through as straight as can be and that needs some kind of recognition.

This movie came out 14 years ago though, so I can only assume it was pretty new back then.Still, having that in mind, it was not very entertaining. Some plot twists made no sense while others were predictable, and there were situations where the main character put himself that there is absolutely no chance he could not get caught in such a society. He was allowed to do those things for much too long, for the sake of the narrative evolving to where it did. Even the new sort of martial art of fighting/shooting was quite beautiful and yet there is no way trained soldiers would just wait in line to be shot like that.Equilibrium presents itself as a blend of Fahrenheit 451 and The Matrix and if you are big on action movies you will probably enjoy it. As I mentioned, some scenes really are capable of dazzling you. However, I do felt the plot could have been polished much, much more and in the end it was just another cool sci-fi, action movie.

241,motezart,"totally underrated, misinterpreted film",9,19 December 2013,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, yet I have a hard time defending it now as a serious piece of cinema, and I'm not sure why. It gets low ratings on all the major film sites despite tons of great actions scenes, a huge overarching story line, great attention to detail, and a terrific performance by Christian Bale.The Story: The dictator ruled state of Libria force-feeds its citizens drugs to suppress their emotions, and in fact, feeling emotion is entirely illegal. Punishment is death.Overactive emotions have been known to cause many of humanity's previous atrocities and wars, so to vanquish emotion is to therefore benefit humankind. There is a method to the madness; this film is set right after world war III, and emotion suppression is modern humanity's solution for preventing world war IV.Of course there are those that do not see this repression as a benefit and so an underground resistance forms. Although the plot is excellently executed, the dystopian theme comes across as just a little bit too close (for some, not for me) to an exact replica of an Orwellian model. Equilibrium has been accused of being unoriginal, a mere mishmash of well-known various Sci- Fi stories.I was never bothered by this mishmash. Examining the film shows there are more than enough original features, features that people must be overlooking when judging, because the originality more than counter balances the borrowed material.The top ranking law enforcement officials are (I think very cleverly) called Clerics. They employ the use a fictitious fighting style called the Gun Kata. The Gun Kata a major part of the film and makes for some amazing scenes. The details about the world are so specific that it really is an amazing accomplishment on writer/director Kurt Whimmer's part. Whimmer makes a living mainly as a writer, Equilibrium being one of only two major features he's directed.As I said earlier, Christian Bale gives a great performance, handling almost all the fight scenes himself, and due to budget constraints, only being allowed a handful of takes to get each set of complex choreography right. Director Whimmer makes excellent use of light and space, pleading his case for humanity's right to ""feel"" as light peeks through the drab gray tones of the photography, rarely, but just enough.Equilibrium is the biggest box office flop of a film I can think of. For how epic it is, the 20 million dollar budget seems minuscule, but its total to-date gross is $1.2 million, a totally pathetic ratio. Equilibrium appeared around the same time as the Matrix was doing its thing and so Equilibrium got very little press. The two films share a similar vibe and since Equilibrium came out second, it loses points for originality, and even though The Matrix is undoubtedly a great achievement, Christina Bale is hands-down the better lead (I'm not too fond of Keanu Reeves). Just based on that fact alone Equilibrium is worth checking out.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",Equilibrium

243,Jack_Acid,"More borrowed elements than I can name, but still a decent action flick",7,25 February 2008,"I enjoyed this film, but make no mistake - it is a popcorn film, so take it for what it's worth.Not even being an avid film or literary buff, I could name half a dozen other films or books this movie borrows from - the action (the Matrix), premise of thought police (Orwell's ""1984""), mood control (Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"") and even the final scene (Fight Club).The biggest problem for me is the premise itself as I found it somewhat difficult to believe - the idea that to eliminate the threat of war, society has been reduced to the point where they all consciously (though under law) sedate themselves, lest they ""feel"", which is punishable by death with no due process or trial. I had a difficult time taking scenes seriously where cops are raiding warehouses where stereotypical thugs are moving illegal goods such as...paintings? Lamps? Trinkets? I guess Wimmer needed some physical representation for people being guilty of ""feeling"", but these types of notions just seemed like reaching for straws.Being such a far-fetched reality is problematic is more ways than just the suspension of disbelief of the viewer - it also makes it nearly impossible for the actors to remain true to the premise. There are times when the authoritative figures themselves show emotions of happiness, satisfaction, or anger. It really seems more like a drug that eliminates all GOOD feelings, not ALL feelings. This is also consistent with how the law is upheld.I felt the above problems could be solved in one of two ways: 1. Set in an obviously DISTANT future. This is how the Matrix sells the idea of us being ""batteries"" in a completely dystopia earth. Yes, Equilibrium is clearly set in the future, but there is little to suggest that it isn't near future. There's really no futuristic technology, so again, the idea of ""feeling"" being illegal (something that makes up our very essence) is just too far fetched for most viewers.2. The other means of fixing it would be to have set the entire thing on an alien planet with an alien race. In my opinion, this would have been the best setting as it takes away from our innate rejection of such a premise and ultimately, a more original idea.Even given the above complaints, the film has great production value. Wimmer does a nice job of putting you in this world. I felt the pacing was good and it was as well acted as one could hope under the film's premise. There were moments that did their job, such as several ""crossroads"" scenes, where Bale's character is put on the spot, between a rock and a hard place and you hold your breath wondering what he'll do.In the end, if you're looking for a decent sci-fi futuristic action flick, this is certainly worth a viewing. If you're a film stickler and bent on original content, or something overly cerebral, it's probably a pass.",Equilibrium

Honestly, I'm struggling to find the words.We went to see the film because it looked a prime candidate to make us laugh.   However, since my companion fell asleep within about 10 minutes, I had no-one to snigger with.  Which didn't matter, because I was simply open-mouthed at the awfulness of it.  It went beyond, oh so far beyond, the so bad its good' genre.   If you manage to stay awake (and believe me, I tried not to) there was an interesting moment about 90 minutes or so in, when there were some plot twists. But that soon flickered and died.Things also started to look up when Bale began to beat up Brian it's a puppet' Conley, but that didn't last either.I will admit the acting was excellent  Bale somehow managed convincingly to portray a man without, or struggling to conceal, emotion.  But his success meant that at no point did I care about his, or indeed any other character in the entire film.But the plot? - you could drive a bus through the holes.  The subtext'? - more overt than a wet kipper in the face.  The script  oh god, don't make me think about it.  The fight scenes  I'm no expert, but those which didn't strike me as unoriginal simply made me giggle.

It was good to see a different story. David Wimmer wrote a brilliant script and directed brilliantly. Also the cinematography was brilliant as well. Christian Bale put in a stunning performance as all ways. Since the poor Reign of Fire, all the films he chooses after that seem to be huge successors and very good. Taye Diggs was good as well and played a very good villain. The gun fights they produced in it were amazing. Especially the end one.The only thing that annoyed me a bit was the fight between Christian Bale and Taye Diggs at the end. I was looking forward to it thinking i would be brilliant but it only lasted like 10 seconds which was disappointing. They could of made it much better and longer. It's a shame there aren't other films that produce such brilliant gun fights like this. Most films these days go over the top an make gun fights last for ages but this film just made them just the right length and made them thoroughly enjoyable to watch.This film is a must see. Not just amazing gun fights but has a good story towards it. For people that loved the Matrix you will love this. If you thought the gun fights in the Matrix were good check this one out. They will blow you away.",Equilibrium
248,Cacus7,This gem of a movie will likely remain unnoticed,10,5 April 2003,"I went to the only theater in my city of over a million people showing the movie and drove 25 miles to see ""Equilibrium.""  It was on a hunch.  I am so glad that I ended up making the trip.  Sure, it shares similarities to ""The Matrix"" and may borrow elements from other classic and recent sci-fi flicks (""Minority Report"" comes to mind), but this film stands on its own as a tribute to the fact that lower-budget, limited-release sci-fi can still beat the James Camerons and Geroger Lucases at their own gameI did not particularly like him in ""American Psycho"", but Christian Bale, who plays the lead in this movie, was a near perfect choice.  The rest of the cast, while little known for the most part, was also excellent.  While there were some special effects that Lucas wouldn't have been caught dead using (some particularly fake-looking mattes come to memory), overall I was very impressed with the visual style.The action/fighting sequences rival those of the coolest Asian movies.  I am a fan of Jet Li and Chow Yun-Fat movies, but ""Equilibrium"" busted out some stuff that I've never seen on an import movie.  The innovative fighting style of swords, firearms and hand-to-hand combat had to have been invented just for this movie.To sum it up, ""Equilibrium"" was a visual feast, and the plot was actually quite intriguing, even if similar matters have already been addressed in previous films and literature.",Equilibrium
249,thrix,'1984' a la Matrix-style,9,30 July 2004,"First of all, I'd like to say that I like this movie and it has a lot of qualities- great actors and acting, strong plot and many scenes made me very emotional. Christian Bale is brilliant, absolutely brilliant, as the 100% strict cleric Preston who, after getting the ability to feel once again, rapidly switches from crying his eyes out to cold strict temper.
'Equilibrium' doesn't really add anything that we haven't seen before - martial-arts style gun-fighting, shooting cute innocent dogs, tension between good and evil and 'Big Brother' here called 'Father'. Though so it is still a very entertaining film that awakens a lot of thoughts and reminds us that '1984'-scenario may yet happen, just look at Iraq and Romania up to recent days. Overall, Equilibrium is a good movie to see for any intellectual action-freak.9/10",Equilibrium
250,shalabodov-32997,Underrated dystopian action thriller,7,11 July 2018,"Kurt Wimmer isn't exactly a brilliant mastermind behind the camera. Most of the movies directed by him are either bad or disasters. However, in this rare instant, he directed a damned good film, especially considering the unusually low budget for a sci-fi action flick. This picture was erased by critics and bombed at the box office, grossing one-fourth of its budget and it's such a shame, because this movie deserves way more. Christian Bale gives one of his better performances, the way he portrays his character's change of attitude is truly entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast is are all great as well. This movie features a fighting technique called ""Gun Kata"". It was invented by the director and is spectacular to look at. The action and the choreography are fantastically shot and executed. Wimmer clearly borrowed from The Matrix, but it doesn't hurt the film in the slightest.Unfortunately, I have one big problem with it, and that's the script. It is overall written acceptably, but there's a twist at the end that only makes sense if you try to come up with some excuse for it.

If one views it as an action film with a bit of sophisticated backstory then it might actually provide some entertainment. The main flaw of this movie is that it contradicts itself. Throughout the film people show emotion when they are not supposed to, thus making everything hard to believe. Of course all human emotions can not be totally neutralised but an anger outburst such as the one the head of the clerics displays at some point would not be tolerated according to what we see in the film.And, of course, some scenes being almost identical to some of the Matrix scenes don't help make this film better.

Its emotional, and i hold a lot of its message for truth. Emotions are one of the reasons that humanity exists.The movie is also somewhat prophetic of our society today. I live in the EU and here over we are increasingly living in a totalitarian society which demands that people to think in only one way namely agreeing to ""multiculutural diversity"" and ""egilatarianism"", implementing dictatorship instead of democracy. If an individual does not agree to these code words, one is ostracized on many levels, individual, social, work related etc.Christian Bale really performs outstandingly in this movie, brutal yet sensitive, but his role is convincing.

256,larson.72,Derivative and illogical,4,12 April 2007,"I borrowed this movie from the local library with fairly high expectations, considering it was 7.7 here on IMDb. Unfortunately those expectations were let down.The first problem I had with this movie was the absurd premise: In the future, it is illegal to feel, because feeling causes war (apparently), so people take a special drug which suppresses feeling. One small problem: it doesn't make any sense. Obviously the characters feel. There's situations throughout the movie where supposedly 'unfeeling' characters grin, express surprise, anger, etc. Not to mention the fact that, if people were truly without feeling, then they presumably would not care whether or not someone else died in order to achieve some mundane goal. So right off the bat, the movie makes no sense. Perhaps it would have made more sense if, instead of eliminating ALL feeling, the goal of the government was simply to eliminate STRONG feelings. That I could have bought into...but unfortunately the movie makes it clear that ANY feeling is a 'sense crime'.The second problem I had with this movie was how blatantly derivative it is. From the opening gun battle, it's pretty obvious that the filmmakers are trying to emulate The Matrix, from the way the 'clerics' are dressed, to the scripted gun and sword battles, to the ragtag underground of rebels, to the overall theme of the movie of one man trying to overthrow a repressive authoritarian regime. It's really somewhat nauseating how much this movie wants so desperately to be The Matrix.If you want to watch a good sci-fi film about a future where emotion is repressed, rent THX-1138. If you want to watch the Matrix, then rent the Matrix. If you want to watch an illogical, second-rate, derivative movie inspired by those movies, then by all means go out and rent this movie...",Equilibrium

Super lame plot twists, heavy derivative sci-fi, and plenty of crappy dialogue - which wasn't even crappy enough to be awesome.  But I'll tell you one thing, it's still the best fu#*ing movie of all time.Gun Katta is the super shiznitch. It rocks the caznock to such a degree that I am now personally offended by every movie that doesn't feature some kind of Gun ninja.  Still, shame about all that crappy stuff in between the Gun Ninja antics.My recommendation: they should remake this movie as ""Future Gun-Ninja Squad""  in which new Gun Ninjas would have to fight a giant evil Robot with a Hitler mustache and a crown.  These new gun ninjas should travel by rocket powered hang-gliders and have special evolved training monkeys who help them perfect their art.But the monkeys are sort of like Yoda, cuz they don't take part physically most of the time, they just impart age old (in the future) monkey wisdom on the Gun Ninjas.  And they wear glasses and have funny accents.  On weekends the Gun Ninjas like to listen to disco music and do crazy ninja dances.  Then when the Gun Ninjas go on a mission they say stuff like ""Time to Run'n'Gun"" or ""Gunners Ho"" or ""Let's go shoot these mutherf*%#ers""In the sequel ""Super Gun-Ninja Squad 2: Cold Steel""  (and remember I've only had time to roughly outline this one so far)  the Gun Ninjas find themselves stranded on a planet with no bullets and have to fend for themselves against Christian Missionaries gone bad, or ""Mishies"" as they are called by the locals.  Also they totally 'do it' with alien girls, which is a double mind blower cuz Gun Ninjas aren't normally allowed to have sex even with human girls - who are referred to in the future as LadyPeople.Part III coming soon.  I can't tell you much other than there's new threat that's more powerful than anything in history and the Gun Ninjas have to wear Robo-Armor to fight it.Don't nobody steal my ideas else ya'll'll be sorry that ya did.Copyright 2003 Freebasedog EnterprisesAnyone interested in optioning the ""Gun Ninja"" Film Franchise may send a cheque for $50,000 Rights still available for action figures, Gun Ninja Saturday morning cartoon, Gun Ninja Chocolate Bar, and actual Gun Ninja guns.",Equilibrium

You know I have never heard of this movie until I saw it at my school just like 15 minutes ago and was so utterly impressed by it, wow. I definetely recommend this movie for all sci-fi/action fans. I still cant believe that I never heard of this movie until today. Did this movie even come out in theatres?? It would've made a ton of money, In my opinion it has a more sound story than the Matrix and the visual effects are the same if not better than The Matrix (And I was a huge Matrix Fan B4 I saw this movie). The premise of the movie,a no emotion utopia, is very original, actually it reminded me of 1984 and Farenheight 451 with an original twist. Thats all I can I say without spoiling it, the whole story of Equlibrium is actually most similar to 1984, except the hero wins at the end after getting betrayed, unlike 1984 where Winston learns how to love Big Brother after being betrayed. 1984 is my favorite novel and Equlibrium is probabaly my new favorite movie. Like the tagline says FORGET THE MATRIX, DAMN I STILL CANT BELIVE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE UNTIL TODAY!!! EVERYBODY SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE!! ITS THE BEST SCI-FI MOVIE EVER!!

259,pschwebe,"Swordfights, only with guns. Except for when they're swords. Plot? Naaaah!",2,21 September 2007,"This is a movie that repeats what has already been done by earlier, better films, and tries to pass itself off as having something to say.First of all, the movie starts with a voice over narration to set the scene. I always consider this a bad sign. Any director or screenwriter that feels compelled to just tell me a bunch of stuff at the beginning either has no idea of how to tell a story visually, or is too lazy to do so.Secondly, the premise, while interesting, is simply not done in any believable way. The drugged out population is reminiscent of THX1138, and the police that go after violators are an echo of Farenheit 451, and the dress code has a hint of Matrix to it. But the filmmakers haven't really given much thought as to how a society set up like this could work in any plausible fashion. In other words, they don't make the world consistent enough for me to suspend my disbelief.And, I'm sorry, but I don't care how much training the anti-emotion patrol has. Christian Bale standing still and mowing down a roomful of heavily armed opponents? I just had to laugh. That's just one of those scenes where the hero doesn't die because the script says so.Visual smoke and mirrors are no substitute for substance. The plot plods on in fairly predictable fashion, the bad guys have much worse aim than the hero, etc.I like Christian Bale and Emily Watson, but they're wasted here.

262,mrda1981,"What would've happened, had 1984 taken a different turn?",8,2 May 2012,"What would happen if 1984 turned out differently? If Winston Smith possessed enough power not only to break free of the system but to also to bring it to its knees? Find out in this rather pleasing post-apocalypse dystopia flick which pits Christian Bale (as John Preston) against the tyrannical government he was bred to serve. When Preston, a Cleric entrusted with the duty of eliminating 'sense-offenders' - those who exhibit emotion and/or possess creative works from the pre-WWIII era - forgets to take his dose of the emotional-nullifier Prozium, he gains access to an essential aspect of his existence long anaesthetized. From there proceeds a gradual unravelling from the societal fabric, leading to a head on collision with those who turn the gears of control.This is certainly one of those films I can watch several times over - however it is not without fault. What's with the emotionality going unnoticed in some of the Clerics (i.e: Brandt (Taye Diggs) discovers Preston's emotional deviance)? How exactly did Du Pont (Angus MacFayden) orchestrate the chain of events to snare Preston? I'm sure I missed a few other plot gapes.That said the performances in the film generally well-done, with Bale's Preston, MacFayden's Du Pont and Emily Watson's Mary standing out as high points. The inventive use of Gun Kata - the martial art created by the director - works a treat, contributing to some impressive action sequences. Also, the basic premise, whilst hardly original, always proves compelling - that of the autonomous individual fighting the tyranny of government. It helps that it's dramatized in a punchy manner as well.There's no doubt this could have been done much better; nonetheless,despite the aforementioned flaws (and the odd ropey dash of CGI) this remains an excellent, if not quite brilliant, dystopia flick.",Equilibrium

It's not that there aren't any good movies in the genre. V for Vendetta is a good example, and closer to the fibre of Equilibrium there's the better movie Gattaca. Of course Sean Bean and Christian Bale act great, as does Emily Watson. Stylization is also sharp and well done. But despite all that, this is in essence a dressed up C-movie in the same league as, for instance, Jupiter Ascending. The movie mainly feels geared to be somewhat of a decrepit action movie which might make adolescent viewers feel tough.

265,mmarianne,Love to endure,5,14 September 2016,"Firstly, in Netflix, this movie is called Cubic, for some reason, which makes it harder to find anywhere but in Netflix. I watched the movie last night, and it didn't really stick inside my head, so I had to scroll through it a bit this morning to be able to write anything about it. That says a lot, doesn't it? Well,what is it about? It's set in a city where they have developed a drug which removes all human feelings in people. If they show the slightest bit emotion they will be processed, which means death. The stats is that ""the Father"" is highest on the rank, and then comes his trusted person, and after that, comes the clerics, these are men who are killing-animals, trained in all sorts of marshal arts and combat. They're also the smartest and yes, they're all handsome as hell. (which is rather okay, if you like looking at handsome men on the screen...) From the beginning, there are two men in the center John and Partridge, who are working together, and I got the feeling that they also were some sort of friends, as much as you can have friends if you don't feel a thing. Not a thing yeah. So when John, our trusted main character, realizes that Partridge is feeling something, he himself shoots him. It's not as dramatic as it sounds, because John does it without a second thought on right or wrong, so it becomes an anti- emotional process. We get to find out, in bits, about the processing of Johns wife and mother two their two children, she was taken in their home, accused of feeling, and of course, death came fast through a burning chamber. (later on, actually in the last five minutes of the movie, we find out that the children actually stopped taking their drug already just after their mothers death, but they never brake of from being robots at home or in school. For four years. Now that's two determined little ones!! ) This review seem to have a life on its own, because it gets very fragmented, but the movie is also like that. There are a lot of hunting for people who harbor contraband, things like the painting Mona-Lisa for example. Or books or records or paintings or perfume or anything which isn't just functional and gray, white or black. In the movie they keep burning the contraband and it's very hard to believe that they haven't burned it all down already as they are busy busy bees. They pick up one of the women for processing and possibly to get some more information. Then one day, Johns morning injection breaks (they come in little bottles that you put in to your injection box with a needle that you put in your throat) After a day of having no treatments, he starts to feel, see colors and feel surfaces with his hands. He also see this female prisoner in a whole new light. She is beautiful and full of emotions, played gorgously by Emely Watson. John now has a real hard time killing the people they find who are feeling, and have all this contraband. It's hard for him to not break apart and he can't hide his feelings, although he is trying to mask them the best that he can. This is a little bit disappointing, he should know how it all works and he should know how to control himself, and he most certainly should know what will happen to him if he shows any feeling. The feeling John appears weak. But, he still go through the motion and he get together with a group of feeling people, who tell him to kill the Father. So he goes ahead and try his best. There are some really beautifully choreographed fighting routines, that reminds me a whole lot of Matrix, the first movie. But then they all get free and we don't get to see anymore than that. It's just over and the Father had died years ago anyway, so he just had to kill the second in command and a LOT of other clerics and soldiers. But because he was so well trained he never got hurt but just braved any situation. My hero. And then... who knows! Marianne",Equilibrium

A couple times I almost shut it off... there are lots of movies to watch, I would not want to waste any time on movies that are going to start and end on a yawn.Fortunately, I stuck it out. You'll recognize the plot without effort, it is how we get to the climax and conclusion that we hope will surprise us. Ray Bradbury would be proud of this outing of one of his notable plots.I think too much I suppose. The whole emotion thing brought back John Hurt in the movie of George Orwell's 1984. Perhaps we even have a hint of Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland pointing and screeching at the end of the movie at those who are different. In this movie, ""the different"" are people who feel. Sensors, Sensers... Whatever they're called. You get the idea. The bad people who feel and cause wars and conflict and need extermination.Enter Prozac Nation, and the 3rd Reich complete with an Adolf Hitler substitute to make sure everyone is on drugs to kill all sensations?

Kind of cool, the idea... I mean, ""cleric"" is the super SS trooper killing machine. It has a spiritual overtone and I think that is a nice creative twist.Then you're in for some some jaw dropping super special effects eye candy.

269,motorfocus82,"Not horrible, but not up to the standards of the genre.",6,24 January 2012,"I'm giving this rating with the understanding that the film was made on a low budget, as in using stylized Cadillac DTS's for a look into futuristic transportation. Yes, it feels cheap by 21st century standards. Also, it is derivative of many other movies in the same dystopian style, which was expected. I bought it at Wal-Mart for five bucks, and didn't expect much, just basic entertainment. Basically, I got what I expected. There's a touch of philosophical thought to it, but not much. It certainly isn't revolutionary or sophisticated. It simply throws the theme out there, and you can accept it and watch, or not. The general topics of social control and the importance of emotions have been done so much better elsewhere, that there's little point in hashing it to death here.The gunfight moves are interesting enough, but most of the fight scenes are, exactly as everyone else wrote, straight from the school of ""let one guy kick the crap out of a bunch of guys who wait their turn, and put in some neat tricks and tools for him to use"".Christian Bale is, well, Bale. He's dry, and connects on occasion, but mostly just does the job and that's it. Given the theme of the movie, this could be seen as his character being as unemotional as necessary. Other actors do a respectable job, but nothing special. I liked Taye Diggs and Sean Bean in this one, but I usually do.The scene with the dog... ugh. I like this genre generally (my area of historical study is the Soviet Union) and since it went through the motions conventionally and was paced reasonably well, I didn't mind it. There's enough action to break up the slowness of the other parts, and a couple of moments where you can watch it and see little things taken for granted in your own life with fresh eyes, and that's good. There are a few moments where there's some genuinely interesting tension as well.

271,kingderella,a reasonably enjoyable film for fans of the genre,5,22 March 2008,"every idea in equilibrium is stolen from better films (THX 1138, blade runner, the matrix...) and the one original idea it has (""gunkata"") doesn't make any sense. the story is awfully predictable and has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. the twisting plot is more ridiculous than suspenseful. the love story doesn't ring true. the production design is cyber-punk at its most generic. the soundtrack is annoyingly overblown. everybody in this movie seems to be at least a little stupid. the guys were supposed to be rooting for (the ""resistance"") look like a bunch of junkies. the world the filmmakers show us doesn't really work if you think about it (characters that are supposed to be completely without emotions keep displaying emotions... the dictators who are out to destroy all art have artwork in their headquarters... the citizens just sit around in front of huge screens that explain the plot... the list goes on).but for its many, many flaws, equilibrium still feels more like an admirable effort rather than a cheap rip-off. easily the best thing about the movie are the carefully choreographed gunfights; as stupid a concept ""gunkata"" may be, it at least looks pretty. Christian bale gets the most out of a role thats practically identical to keanu reeves' in matrix (also, we see him shirtless). there is an artistic vision behind all this, even if its one that relies heavily on borrowed ideas, and thats what makes equilibrium a reasonably enjoyable film for fans of the genre.",Equilibrium

All was forgiven, though, as it is fantastically well done. If you've read 1984 you will recognize almost all the characters, Fahrenheit 471, the Matrix et al supply their own contributions, but this film takes all those cliches and makes them its own.The action sequences are stupendous while the tragic love story is touching. Even the appearance of a cute puppy didn't strike me as too far-fetched. Strongly recommended.(British viewers will be happy to see comedian Brian Conley's film career taking off, too)",Equilibrium
273,LadySailor1975,Very Interesting and Unique! Love it.,9,1 February 2017,"So many movies that depict different versions of what the future may hold. This one depicts what fascism and oppression truly is, even better than most documentaries do! I have always enjoyed films and TV where a hero emerges to free oppressed people and this one did exactly that. This movie turned me into a fan of Christian Bale. I had never really had an opinion on him before, neither positive nor negative. But he was superb in this. This film should have been a blockbuster. Why it was not is beyond me.After a World War 3, all forms of emotion, entertainment, and religion are banned and people are executed if they allow themselves to feel. Even pets are illegal since they make people happy. A drug is used every few hours that suppresses human emotion and leads to complete submission to the will of ""Father""-- a dictator in full control. After he executes his own partner for reading a book of poetry, Preston (Bale) eventually succumbs to emotion himself. He realizes how important emotion and liberty are and joins the resistance to free the people. He is pleased to learn that his own children have not been using the emotion-suppressing drugs themselves since losing their mother. He eventually kills the dictator and destroys his tools of indoctrination and the people will now be free.You want to see a world under control of a fascist would look like? Watch this one.There are a few disturbing scenes, such as the extermination of some dogs (which one is rescued by Bale). People are mercilessly show down for simply desiring freedom. Preston's wife is arrested in front of the two young children.The action sequences, especially by Christian Bale, are exciting and thrilling. Though a few scenes are slightly slow, it is altogether a great film. This movie should have outdone many movies I have seen in the past 15 years.What are you waiting for? See it now.",Equilibrium
274,NickDeckard,Its good but its not The Matrix or Brazil or Blade Runner!,7,9 October 2009,"I saw this one ages ago and thought it was pretty good, saw it again on TV last night.There's a lot of holes. Its best not to think too much about them and just watch the action. I cant buy the no-emotions thing at all, for instance the black guy who is Christian Bale's nemesis seems to smile quite a lot and, for me, shows a lot of emotion - more than Christian Bale's character does anyway! Having said all that, its a good bit of fun. The gun-kata bits seem a bit sped up to me, watch closely and you can see it which spoiled it a bit. And whatever anyone says about it being better than the Matrix...sorry its not in the same league! There's elements of Brazil and my personal favourite, Blade Runner in there too.To sum up - definitely worth a rental, perhaps a buy. Don't expect too much and it might surprise you!",Equilibrium
275,forehead1,Equilibrium falls at the first hurdle,5,27 March 2003,"Sadly, no matter how good Equilibrium could have been it was always going to fail due to it's plot shortcomings: namely the premise that every 'controlled' member of the state is unable to experience any feelings.  If this were the case then there should have been no evidence of any sort of joy, anger, frustration, panic, and all of the other ""sense offences"" we see conveyed by almost everyone (drugged or not) throughout the film.  The theory doesn't hold any water either: with no feelings nobody would be responsible for their actions and therefore would go about doing anything they please (which, strictly, would be nothing as they would have no desire to do anything and therefore would just rot away, which wouldn't bother them either as they wouldn't be scared of death - but that's a whole new can of worms in itself).  The result would be anarchy.  Even the forced-repetition of everything in their lives could not stifle this.The movie is also brought down by the ludicrous ALL ACTION last 10-20 minutes.  It seems as if the writers couldn't be bothered spending the time writing out a decent finale, so they decided just to fill it with special effects and stunts and hope nobody would notice.  Too many films are guilty of this and if we don't start making a fuss about it this will continue to happen.It was always going to command comparisons with The Matrix but that is not surprising given it was produced mere months afterwards and doesn't even try to hide it's attempts at 'emulating' the aforementioned picture.  No wonder then why the producers thought it best to shelve it for a couple of years rather than grant it the 'rip-off' tag it would have rightly received back in 2000.Nevertheless this is a watchable flick which - given better writing - could have been a lot better.  Bit of a shame really.5/10",Equilibrium
276,froboz,Stylish ripoff,3,3 May 2003,"Ever since Yvegeny Zamyatin's book VI (1924), the same dystopy has been ripped-off and replayed. The big war ends in dictatorship, which controls people into their very minds, inhibiting feelings and displaying a vulgar superset of rationalism, fascism and futurism. A good citizen gets feelings, falls in love, joins the resistance and eventually meets the Boss. The first big ripoff by Orwell wasn't that bad, and had something to add. But after that it's been all downhill. It's sad, because it would be possible to make a dystopy that had some relevance.Equilibrium has absolutely nothing to add to this genre. But then, maybe it can be redeemed by being stylish? Well, if you like kitsch. If you're not bored by Matrix type action scenes. Personally, I think they were the boring part of Matrix. If you like picking out references, there's a game for you when the movie get's boring. When it resembles - unintentionally, I am sure - Brazil, it might give you a laugh. You'll stop laughing when you loose count on the Matrix-like foyer fighting scenes.Good futuristic movies *have* been made after Lang's Metropolis. In recent years we've had Dark City and Minority Report, for instance.

I tried hard.I failed.However, I should note that there are lots of good things about this film... just not enough to save it.The lead performances are excellent. Christian Bale, Taye Diggs and Emily Watson were all sterling. Sean Bean is as watchable as ever, in a pivotal but sadly brief role.The action scenes are pretty cool, too. An interesting blend of wuxia and gunplay in a very Eupropean style which is fun and refreshing after a lot of HK and US-trying-to-be-HK fights. And I love the Gun Kata.Perhaps the best thing about the film is the production design. The sets, costumes, textures and light in Equilibrium are all beautiful.Unfortunately, the premise is unbelievably stupid.Not only that, the plot is too.And the ending would have been laughable if I hadn't been groaning out loud.Basically, it's an inept ripoff of Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451, only instead of books being illegal, emotions are.WHAT?! How the hell did that government get in? I mean, please.I accept that totalitarian governments with strange ideas have existed and will exist, but the idea of running on a platform of ""We will medicate you to remove all your emotions!"" is just plain stupid.The film's references to Librium and Prozac are duly noted.

When I finally saw a theater playing it on a Sunday, I promised myself to come back the weekend after and buy tix when I had more time. The next weekend, back at the theater...EQUILIBRIUM was already GONE! There was ZERO advertising and what was the shortest theater run I'd seen in recent memory. What a shame - after watching it on PPV, this movie was very enjoyable!Beautiful set design, cinematography, and costumes, I was instantly reminded of that other small SF picture, GATTACA. But there are definite MATRIX overtones in this movie as well as bits of ""Brave New World."" This is a martial arts/SF movie with a philosophical point, not quite as good as the original MATRIX but infinitely less heavy-handed and more exciting than MATRIX RELOADED. There are no dull speeches here, only a well-woven message in a very tight script, full of plot twists and acted by an excellent cast.
I think this movie will do well for itself in the long run, as positive word of mouth spreads and people start passing along copies of the DVD (before it becomes EC-10). I look forward to seeing more work from this director, and Christian Bale too, because he really adds a special touch to his every role.",Equilibrium

Equilibrium is set in the future where everyone has to take a drug call equilibrium (it makes you have no feelings) so no one can be violent, happy, sad, mad etc. The person/people who don't take the drug are executed. The movie follows John Preston (Bale) as the bad guy turned good .The movie is slow to start but once it gets into it, it is pretty good.

280,jhalcollege,Deserves more praise and respect.,8,4 June 2018,"For some reason or another, Equilibrium has been wrongfully left out of the conversation of the best science fiction movies. Perhaps it was the timing of it's release, or the overall criticism for borrowing too many aspects from other works of the genre. But Equilibrium combines tried and true ideas in a fresh, exciting way, and leaves the audience asking for more.The highlight of the movie is Preston (played by Bale), who is an extremely likable main character. All of his choices are rational and believable, and he genuinely does want you want him do to (something that is becoming increasingly rare in today's motion pictures). People will always remember him the most from The Dark Knight, but Bale delivers on every note. Also, the fight scenes are verrrry good. Along with excellent use of sound, each action sequence is a treat to the eyes and ears. And better yet, every one of these encounters has a meaningful ending. In other words, there are no pointless fights that concludes with one party fleeing, and the audience left hanging. Still, the movie isn't flawless. A few characters remain underdeveloped, and it's somewhat predictable. And this is also one of the few films that could actually benefit from an extra fifteen or so minutes. But on the positive side, the movie keeps you captivated for the entire 100 minutes.If you think you'll like Equilibrium, then you definitely will.

This was a fun, visually-entertaining film with some significant weakness in the storyline (how does one get married & have kids w/out emotion?).
The best way for me to describe this movie is as follows:
10% Fahrenheit 451;  10% THX-1138;  25% Matrix 45% LA Grade B Sci-Fi;  8%  Nazi Germany; 2%  Demolition Man

I remember seeing the ""1984"" movie adaption just a few months ago, and in the beginning of this movie I had to wonder whether ""Equilibrium"" was a remake of some kind... the difference is that ""1984"" made sense.

289,plotlessviolence,Greatest Gun Movie of All Time,10,20 March 2006,"I watch a lot of action movies and have seen more or less every good shootout ever filmed, and most of the scenes in Equilibrium are better than any other filmed. Yes, better than the lobby scene of the Matrix, better than the Steadicam hospital scene in John Woo's Hard Boiled, better than the church shootout from The Killer, better than the final fight sequence of Art of War.PLOT) Equilibrium has a serviceable translation of George Orwell's 1984 where the thoughtcrime sought to be prohibited is any expression of emotion. Mankind is mandated the regulating drug Equilibrium, and a warrior caste of Grammaton Clerics (named after the Tetragrammaton, the 4-letter name of our Deity) hunt down those who traffic in art. The idea is that society's overemphasis on Reason had become its religion. The plot here does the job and is somewhat interesting at one point, and there's a nice little symbolic use of Yeat's poem ""You tread on my dreams."" I doubt the movie could stand on its own without the action sequences, but frankly kung fu movies aren't supposed to be judged on Story or Characters, so the fact that it isn't cringe-worthy is just bonus.COMEDY) Not really a comedy.ACTION) The director Kurt Wimmer invented a fictional style of martial arts called Gun Kata which all the Grammaton Clerics use, supposedly based on thousands of simulations of recorded gunfights. We see clerics in training performing a form at one point in the movie. Basically, the martial art consists of: 1) (presumably) General firearms training with fully automatic pistols and rifles. 2) Stances and movements (mostly ""Zenkutsodachi"" front stance) designed to avoid incoming fire. 3) Arm positions, including behind-the-back movements, allowing the user to accurately return fire with two guns simultaneously. 4) Grappling/disarm techniques attacking generally the elbow/shoulder joints, or using the trigger guard to wrench the finger joints. 5) Armed sticky hands, meaning (from wrist-to-wrist contact)maneuvering the opponent's gun out of your harm's way while obtaining your own line of sight. 6) Holding each of two pistols by the barrel/slide and using the handle as a hammer/sickle. 7) Kenjutsu Katanna swordfighting training There's even a special ""bow,"" with the wrists pressed together, one gun/2 finger salute pointing up, the other down.There's a little bit of realistic, feasible technology in the movie, too. The clerics use heavily modified fully-automatic berrettas with a special button setting that makes 4 nail studs protrude out of the grip (see #6 above), while their stormtroopers mainly carry fully automatic M-16's (I think). Inside the hero's sleeves are spring-loaded extra magazines. He also makes/uses two magazines that have bottom-heavy hemispheres on them so that he can toss them in the middle of the room, empty his pistols and eject the clips, then jam them both down on the ones on the floor. Here and there there are some cool moves like two flips and an awesome kickflip-rifle-across-his-back-into-hands. The hero holds his katanas blade-down in reverse grip (traditionally better for defense) to distinguish himself from everyone else, who hold it normally, blade-up.The result is beautiful. There's a sequence where our hero jumps in the middle of a circle of 6 and is able to whip his hands back and forth around his torso fast enough to blast all 6 until they collapse among the heavy gunsmoke. There are two training sequences (gotta have them to justify the moves in any kung fu movie, but especially one where you invent the new style). There are bits where he mows down stormtroopers, swordfights six clerics, and then that final showdown which is this awesome 1-on-1 Tai Chi/Wing Chun sticky hands (armed!) sequence.The filming is great, just fast enough to be exciting, not so fast or violent that you miss moves (although you will be tempted upon second viewings to frame-by-frame many of the fights, especially the final showdown).The director Kurt Wimmer once complained that in Equilibrium he was saddled with a choreographer who leaned into hard-style Karate when he wanted to go with more soft-style Wushu, but let me tell you there's really no difference. When Wimmer got to go his own way in Ultraviolet, the only new moves were a) a crouched spin and b) a low Chien Style Tai Chi weight shift transfer, neither of which moves made sense in context. (Also, Ultraviolet had blades attached on the bottom of two uzis instead of the nail studs.) In fact, Ultraviolet lacked many of Equilibrium's cooler moves, most notably the stick hands thing.Equilibrium is not a totally flawless movie. The story is average, and the fight scenes only make up 15 minutes total of a 2 hour movie. But if you love gunfights, it simply does not get any better than this, and I do hope Wimmer will get a real budget and will do a movie with a solid hour of fighting and only 20 minutes of dialog or plot.",Equilibrium
290,danfeit,"A ""Plan 9"" amalgam of familiar Sci-fi",1,2 July 2003,"As ""Equilibrium"" drew to a close, I realized I was all wrong about the film. I had thought it was an illogical sci-fi mess with all the major story elements borrowed (some might say stolen) from very well known movies/stories/books. The list of works from which ""Equilibrium"" has borrowed is gigantic; I'll only mention ""Harrison Bergeron"" because I didn't see anyone write that yet.Of course, ""borrowing"" ideas is not unusual in film at all. ""The Matrix,"" a movie I (and many, many other people) love, compiled different pieces from countless stories/films/myths around the world. The difference between ""Equilibrium"" and ""Matrix"" is variety. ""Matrix"" featured concepts from different movies in different genres, most of which were unknown to mainstream audiences. The result was an original creation. ""Equilibrium,"" on the other hand, only regurgitates familiar science-fiction ideas, including ""Matrix."" The result feels like a copy of a copy of a copy: dull and painfully predictable.But I digress, I realized late in the picture I had it all wrong. This is not a serious movie! The premise is ridiculous, the action is way over the top, and the script is full of absurd buzz words like ""Grammaton"" and ""Gunkata."" After borrowing themes from so many other pictures, ""Equilibrium"" is best enjoyed as a big budget ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" as the finished product is so terrible it is actually hilarious.",Equilibrium
291,humpback,style over hype,9,17 June 2003,"This movie was/is much underrated - for one it gets a bunch of gripe for ""stealing"" ideas and concepts from other ( easily identified, making everyone feel like a very literate critic, oh my ) sources, mostly Orwell's ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" and some ideas from both ""Matrix"" and some ""Kurosawa"" movies - a nice mixture to my mind....... Of course, one has to realize/accept that most stories and plots have already been told in one way or another - even Shakespear copied his contemporaries, still he is a genius ! What matters is HOW a story is told - not the amount of hype !Basically ""Equilbrium"" narrates the story of a rigid, post WW-3 Society, which keeps itself emotionally detached to prevent crime, trauma and above all _war_, both through heavy sedation ( Prozac for everyone...) and mandatory elimination of all individuality - which includes art, books, music and even simple things like colours, pets and plants..... Life is the same for everyone - deviation is punishable by execution through incineration...! These rules are enforced by the ""Clerics"", and elite police-unit, of which the protagonist John Preston ( Christian Bale) is among the best and stringent - until his detached dedication develops fine cracks, both through the ""treason"" of his erstwhile partner Partridge (kudos to a great Sean Bean ) and accidentally missing on his sedatives... From there to the final, society shaking fight it's a straight, if interestingly told development. Director Kurt Wimmer makes good use of religious motives, Orwellian paranoia and ""language-distortion"", allusions and some unexpected twists to both keep the movie interesting and to make his point.
And then there is the fighting..... ! The few fight-scenes (like four or five ?) are simply incredible, both in their utter simplicity and ""Gun-Kata"" choreography, their quick, yet viscious violence and stunning use of illumination and point of view. They are also incredible, in that, while making perfect sense in the context of the movie, they do not glorify violence in and of itself - they are cool, without actively angling to be cool, like the Matrix's action sequences. No ""bullet-time"" here. No flashy SFX for SFX's sake. Very japanese, Kurosawa-esque. Very un-Warchawski-brothers...... Ah ! Did I mention there is no pseudo-mystical clap-trap ? Yummy !""Equilibrium""s style, one of its strengths IMHO, is a strong mixture of Japanese art, catholic imagery and history, ""brave new world meets bright future"" scenery and some apocalyptic dark-future settings. None of this is original on its own - but this particular mixture is and through its almost monochromatic style, it underscores the few important moments where light, colour and anachronistic forms enter the picture, point out a change or transition. Of course, you do notice that the movie's budget was less than that of ""the Matrix"" - but only if you actually watch out for it. And SFX alone do _not_ a great movie, even an action-oriented one, make.In the end, what sets this movie apart, at least for me, and makes it worth watching again, is the simple fact, that here, besides the amazing fights, somber mood and imagery, mankind's and humanity's ""great enemy"" is mankind itself, meaning only too well ! No apocalyptic rise of the traitorous, inhuman machines, no alien invasion, no terrible, mind twisting disease - the ""enemy"" is entirely human...... Not a ""deep truth"", no pseudo-mystical debate, just a slight mental nudge in the right direction..... and something we ought to remember.As for the technicalities - acting, editing and soundtrack are absolutely up to par. No real glitches, no real goofs.Miss it at your own risk - 'nuff said.9 out 10",Equilibrium

It basically wraps up the entire Matrix trilogy into one high octane film.  Although ""Equilibrium"" is extremely derivative in much of its plot and subject matter, it is nonetheless the best science fiction film of 2002 (easily beating out the uninvolving 'Minority Report' and the cerebral 'Solaris').  Like many others, I hadn't heard of the movie until I saw it was playing at my local theatre.  What a pleasant surprise. 
Hollywood has forgotten how to make great sci-fi.  This movie is a throwback to the period between ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" when we had some great product coming to theatres.  This flick does steal from a variety of books and movies (1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Matrix, etc.), but it has such energy, such enthusiasm, and such a sense of narrative maturity that it makes up for such lackings.  Add to that great performances by Christian Bale, Sean Pertwee, and Sean Bean, incredibly exciting and hilarious gun battles, and a variety of important themes, and you've got a film that is definitely worth seeing.",Equilibrium

It's a great and grounded idea for a movie but it is a hard concept to do. Because of that this movie has some flaws like the character Dupont screaming with anger and nobody stopping him and he is just like the bad guy in this movie. Anger is an emotion too you know. And sometimes there is times where logic in this film is weird like that. That is my only problem with this movie but it is a big one. To be honest,I don't mind that but I know it is a big problem when you are making a film so yeah. Another thing the fight scenes are SO similar to the Matrix and this movie coming 3 years after that is funny. But except all of that,I absolutely LOVE and respect this movie. I love the action and acting. I love the idea that this film has and I JUST wish people would spent more time on this project to make it superb. Oh well it still is one of my favorite movies.

The dialogue is frequently insulting, and the acting is stale and predictable. For some reason, we accept that ""no emotions"" means acting like you're slightly irritated and full of rage.

296,dementos,"Heavy handed, derivative, and inconsistent.",2,26 February 2003,"To start off, I have to say something positive about this movie: The action sequences and fight scenes are quite entertaining. If you have seen 'The Matrix', there is not much new here. But at least it is copied well.Now the not-so-good aspects: First, the symbolism is annoyingly heavy handed. The 'subtle' allusions to historical totalitarian regimes are too obvious. For instance, the obvious variation of the Nazi flag (the swastika) made me cringe. The bad guys even look like your stereotypical SS henchmen. A slightly more subtle approach would have been more effective.Second, the movie is very derivative and doesn't add anything that hasn't been done or said before. The movie feels like a mixture of '1984', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Metropolis', and the mentioned 'The Matrix'. Nothing new or surprising here.Third, and worst of all, is the unconvincing story telling. The premise that all feelings are eradicated may be implausible, but at least its imaginable. However, the realization of that vision is done totally inconsistent. For instance, even those people in the movie who are supposed to be free of any feelings, constantly display a wide spectrum of feelings (e.g., pride, anger, envy, gloating). Furthermore, the movie contradicts its own premise by having the propaganda repeat descriptions of war and 'bad' feelings. If people don't know anymore what war is, or if you want them to forget, why do you keep reminding them? (Of course, the answer is related to my first point: The director wants to be as obvious and heavy handed as possible, so that every moron will understand that something evil is going on here.) Just about every non-action scene in the movie is spoiled by those recurring contradictions and inconsistencies.",Equilibrium

But instead it falls flat on it's face and fails to get back up again. At the beginning I felt confident I may actually enjoy this film, despite not being a huge sci-fi fan, as I liked the idea and really like Christian Bale. It gets off to a reasonably good start, by introducing us to the premise and the characters. I felt this film could have been a good psychological futuristic thriller, but it just relies on special effects (which aren't a teeny weeny patch on The Matrix) and a simple, bland plot, which tries to provide a twist at the end, and fails miserably. So disappointing, as this could have been a really brilliant film.",Equilibrium
298,saska-3,"Enjoyable, but heavy-handed and flawed",7,2 August 2003,"EQUILIBRIUM features an unexpectedly strong performance from Christian Bale, great production design, an ambitious concept, and an admirable moral.  Its hyper-real and accelerated fight scenes, featuring both martial arts and gun battle, are the prettiest violence I have seen outside of Keanu Reeves' and Carrie Anne Moss' wirework in the Matrix films.This is the story of a near-future world in which the aftermath of World War 3 brought about the mandatory usage of a drug called Prozium, a drug that dulls the feelings of hate and jealousy, as well as their polar opposite, love.  There is no place for art or indulgences; it is difficult to determine what the members of this supposedly utopian society do each day, except in the case of those who enforce the mandatory daily dose of the drug, and of those who make it.Enter John Preston, a cleric who enforces the laws against ""sense offense"", and who also possesses the skill of detection - which any human in our world can instantly name as empathy.Unfortunately, EQUILIBRIUM displays the telltale symptoms of a film conceived as a moral statement around which a story was constructed.John Preston's new partner shows far too much zeal for a man devoid of feeling; John's son is too fanatical to be under the influence of mind-controlling drugs.  At the core of this fable is the flawed logic that humans without emotion (and therefore without ambition or fear) could construct and enforce a system of involuntary control over other human beings.  In all honesty, I followed, enjoyed, and was not disappointed by the two hours I spent with this film.  I give it 7/10 for the strong production and performances.  But I strongly recommend the much superior GATTACA for a near-future utopian film of the recent past, as well as 1984 and FAHRENHEIT 451 - classics of the genre.  And a far more carefully considered fable of better living through chemistry can be found by reading Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"".",Equilibrium

Bale is excellent as the 'soon to get' emotionless Cleric / Emotion enforcer and his transgression to the land of the 'feeling' via the breaking light of dawn is inspired.Put together a few nice set pieces of guns and karate and the less than predictable elements that make this a break from the norm (expect to see people NOT being saved, let off, rescued etc) and this stands out from the ever decreasing Matrix sequels.The score is of particular note, I understand it involved no orchestra and was entirely knocked up via a PC or Mac (or whatever).

301,Leafsman_69,"One of my all-time favorites, and the most underrated",9,18 September 2004,"It is almost a cinematic crime that this movie got absolutely no attention. Everything from the intense acting and action sequences, to the polished yet imprisoning landscape of the perfect world, this movie does it all. It makes you think, sit on the edge of your seat and have you wanting more all in one. This movie as a whole is original, however it borrows concepts that appear in the books ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"" such as big brother andthe desire to achieve human perfection in the movie's background. The film's action sequences are on par with The Matrix. The sets are very well done and watchers are strongly drawn into the lives of the characters. the villains are truly hittable and the watcher can't help but feel sorry for the heroin. Bale gives the performance of his underrated Carrier and a brief appearance by Sean Bean adds the icing to the cake, although i believe his presence was needed for more of the movie then was alloted. The basic story involves a man who is a member of a society which feels no emotion, his job is to destroy anything that triggers human emotion such as books, paintings , decorations toys and colour. This movie is so colourless in some scenes it might as well be in black and white, instead; it is more shades of gray. My hat's off to the production and cast who put this film together, it was overshadowed by a less superior movie which I have already mentioned in this review. Maybe in time this film will get the recognition it deserves or will sadly fade away into Hollywood's archives as the movie that would have been.",Equilibrium
302,LondonOnMyMind,Great and underrated,9,21 June 2004,"Many people have criticized this film as a rip-off of The Matrix and Fahrenheit 451. I disagree, because, even though there are some ripple effects of the two works, this film stands on its own as a unique vision of a society forbidden to feel. The acting, especially by Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Emily Watson, is terrific. The gun-kata sequences are unlike any other fight scenes brought to screen, and the Prozium part of the story is also original - watch for the mass drug interval sequence. However, the best thing about Equilibrium is that the action never overshadows the human element. The two aspects of the film are carefully balanced. We feel for the characters, and cannot even imagine life in a dystopian world that takes away one of the principles of our humanity.
Equilibrium should have got a wider release - it would have been even more amazing on the big screen. I give it a 9/10.",Equilibrium

308,*(CableGuy)*,"One viscerally satisfying picture, literati be damned",9,7 December 2002,"Yeah, so ""Equilibrium"" borrows liberally from ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 481."" Well, I doubt that either Orwell or Bradbury envisioned their stories mixed up with badass geometric combat.  Sure, there's no new points made by the movie, since we're all pretty much sure that human feelings are gift, flawed but still a gift.  I didn't much think about feeling when Bale was featured in the most satisfying fight scenes of the year, and I'm talking worldwide. Hem and haw if you don't like the liberal bites taken out of dystopian classics, but if you've got a sliver of action lover in you, you'll leave satisfied.  The acting's just fine, too, with Christian Bale providing a fine example of stifled emotions, Taye Diggs comes across with just the right hint of arrogance, and Emily Watson has the largest eyes on earth. Oh, and she's good in her small role.  Some have called this a copy of ""The Matrix,"" but I hardly find that justified.  ""The Matrix"" featured a healthy serving of Hong Kong cinema, like a clash between John Woo and Yuen Wo-Ping, while ""Equilibrium"" contains a wholly-original system of fighting that is a wonder to watch.  Would it work in real life?  Do I care?  I don't expect my action films to follow Italian Neorealist traditions or something, I wanna see throw-downs with just the smallest glint of possibility.So anyways, it's a tragedy that this film is being shown on only 300-odd screens, so I hope word-of-mouth or a sure-to-be-mine DVD give it more exposure.

309,chrissyafrica,worthy film deserves second look,8,24 May 2008,"Equilibrium is a strong sci-fi flick, reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451 and Logan's Run. The cast handles the material excellently, especially Bale who once again treads the balance of emotion and emotionless. Taye Diggs does a fine job as antagonist, though his character's obvious enjoyment of his work seems contradictory to the plot, especially toward the end. This film should have done better box office, but was given limited release and little advertising.Undoubtedly, it suffered from the release of the Matrix movies. The plots share a common sci-fi theme, an oppressed people fighting an unfeeling regime, but Equilibrium is based in solid reality while the Matrix world is illusion. Where Equilibrium really suffers is the similarities in the fight sequences. Director Kurt Wimmer originated the fighting style ""Gun-kata"" then given a harder edge by choreographer Jim Vickers, which plays a prominent role in the film. Unfortunately, the resulting fight sequences share the flavor used by the Wachowski brothers without the Wachowski's then revolutionary camera technique. Their ""bullet time"" emphasized the illusionary nature of the Matrix world. Though today the technique is used all over, at the time of release, Equilibrium's no ""tricks"" and lack of wires in choreography emphasizes the reality of the world. One significant climatic sequence is cut so similarly to an iconic sequence of the Matrix that it cannot help but draw comparison. It is not surprising that the studio released it quietly in the wake of the Matrix.Yet, the film does stand on its own. It is a worthy addition to any sci-fi collection.",Equilibrium
310,carcar-759-676336,"Astonishing plot, good action",8,7 June 2010,"I don't think that the action in this film is better than The Matrix, but I think the plot is better than The Matrix. The plot is deeper, more connective and easier to relate to. I love the little things about this movie and the overall message of how important emotions are to us as human beings. Beautiful, gorgeous. The only complaints I would have is a bit anti-climax near the end. They build you up to wanting to see the fight between him (John Preston, Christian Bale) and the man that wants his job (Brandt, Taye Diggs), but John Preston defeats Brandt in one blow.I think their training fight was much more entertaining, it showed a bit more equal footing. I think just in general a little more equal footing would have been nice. I didn't have to see a fight between him and ""Father"", since he's a political head he CAN be pathetic and that wouldn't matter, I cared more about him fighting Brandt. Also, the revolution fighting the soldiers should have shown a bit more loss on both sides. I know they wanted to give you a ""feel good"" feeling of them winning, but a little more reality I think would be best, even if a few of them got hit, you could still show that they are clearly winning.You need to show that winning is not easy and loss is often on both sides. Even if someone wins they often times lose a little to get there. It's sad, but that also stirs reality and emotion. Overall, it's beautiful, though it could use a bit more climax. I especially love Sean Bean's job as Partridge. The beautiful scene when he reads poetry in a church before he dies. Gorgeously done and definitely my favorite scene, the practice fighting between Preston and Brandt being my second favorite scene.Some of my other favorite scenes would probably be the hand touch scene, the Preston gets caught protecting a puppy scene and I love that he repeats Patridge's line ""A price I pay gladly"" before shooting Father. The scene could have been done a BIT better, but the idea and concept is certainly marvelous. A very enjoyable film.",Equilibrium

The Matrix, Highlander, 1984, Brave New World...the list goes on, but I stopped counting at six. I don't respect movies that blatantly rip off others, but I do allow them to redeem themselves if they can improve upon the original. Sadly, this is not the case for Equilibrium.It was stated that for the Matrix the Wachowski brothers had Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne originally scheduled to practice fighting for 6 weeks, which turned into 5 months, simply because they wanted realistic fight scenes with no cuts to doubles. They spared no expense in getting what they wanted.Unfortunately, Equilibrium resorted to jittery cameras, stunt doubles, overly slow fight sequences, etc., to hide their lack of commitment (and perhaps budget). This results in an inferior work from any standpoint. Sorry guys - the realistic fight scene train left in 1999, and you missed it.Add to this critical shortcoming multiple incomplete integrations of other film and book ideas, and you've got a 5/10.

314,UltramarineX,Do not miss out on this great movie,8,8 August 2003,"(Warning: Some spoilers ahead)The cover of the Equilibrium DVD has a quote that says `Forget The Matrix!'. To be honest, I felt that putting that on the cover might actually backfire. Diehard fans of the Matrix might scoff at seeing Equilibrium because of that quote, thinking there is no way the lower budget Equilibrium could beat it.  Others might come in with unrealistically high expectations for the movie, expecting over-the-top special effects, and will probably come away disappointed.  Frankly I think that's too bad, because Equilibrium is a great movie in its own right with an original and engrossing story, as well as some pretty darn cool fight scenes.Equilibrium takes place in a time in which World War III has taken place, and humanity was almost destroyed because of it.  Everyone knew that mankind could not survive a fourth war, and so a radical solution was conceived. Since wars were caused by emotional arrogance and intolerance, all emotions should be suppressed to prevent any future conflict. As such everyone one in Equilibrium's world is required by law to take doses of a drug called Prozium every day to suppress their emotions.  This law is ruthlessly enforced by a group known as the `Clerics', who hunt down anybody who commits a `sense offense'.  The story of Equilibrium revolves around a Cleric named John Preston who accidentally misses a dose of Prozium, and starts being able to feel emotions.  John is eventually sent to capture a group of rebels opposed to the current government, but joins them instead.Many people who have criticized this movie have felt that Equilibrium's atmosphere and characters were too cold.  My question to them would be, where have you been the entire movie?  The society that was presented in this movie is supposed to be devoid of emotions, so you wouldn't expect people to be acting happy (or angry, or any other observable emotion). Personally I think all the actors in the movie did a great job, with the stand out one being Christian Bale as John Preston.  From his uncaring persona at the start of the movie, to when he starts to first feel emotions, to his smiling at the very end of the movie, I could feel what his character was going through.So how about the film's action sequences?  Unlike The Matrix, Equilibrium uses very little computer enhancements or `wire-fu' techniques, but they look just as well done.  There's sword fighting, guns ablazing, and bone-snapping martial arts (therefore a little bit of something for everybody).  Although admittedly there was one scene towards the end of Equilibrium that seemed vaguely similar to The Matrix's `lobby' fight scene. However, this scene was more of an homage if anything, since it is done and choreographed quite differently.It's a shame that Equilibrium did so poorly in the theatres, and that it did not get a better promotional boost.  Personally I wouldn't have even seen this movie if it was not given two thumbs up on Ebert & Roeper's TV show. Now that Equilibrium is out on video and DVD, this is as good a time as any to go see this movie.  With an underlying message about freedom, great acting, and awesome action, what's not to like about it?  Forget about the negative comments made by the critics.  Go see this movie and judge for yourself.I give this film a solid 8 out of 10!",Equilibrium
315,wiredrabbit,A good update,9,23 May 2003,"This is a movie that invites comparison to many movies.  Fortunately, the movies to which it invites comparison, are, by and large, quite good ones.Comparisons of this movie to Matrix are disappointing.  It does have some similar action sequences.  One, in particular, was a bit too similar, even using the same move with the same columns.  If you see it, you'll recognize it.  Still, comparisons to movies such as  ""Brave New World"", ""1984"", ""Brazil,"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" make much more sense.  It's plot and cinematography share many elements with these.  There are many others in the Genre that also seem to have been scavenged.I would not say, however that everything in the movie has already been done. It could be argued that none of these were at all original, having been described in novels long before celluloid.  I think what Equilibrium does is bring the theme to an updated quality, or perhaps brings a quality to the updates.  It may bw the only movie in its genre that combines the dark subject matter of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451, evoking totalitarian regimes with the outline of an action film without becoming lost in too many special effects or too many snippets of a novel shoe horned into 90 minutes.If you don't like films like Matrix and films like 1984 you may not find much here.

Furthermore, it mostly lifts them pretty badly, and the budget is obviously about 100 times less than that of the Matrix. A sense of camp goofiness suffuses the entire affair, from the overly dramatic lighting, to the citizens standing in neat rows looking at a giant video screen with a talking head on it, to the high-concept premise itself. In one way it's like the Showgirls of early-21st century science fiction movies.Nevertheless, the film is fun. It's mostly saved by the stellar performance of Christian Bale in the lead, who has clearly been told, ""OK, put on this outfit that we stole from Neo in the Matrix. Now act exactly like Keanu Reeves."" Fortunately, Bale is good at doing this, and is generally a better actor than the robotic Reeves.The supporting cast all put in some excellent work as well. Probably the most engaging part of the movie is watching them gamely play along and put in serious hard work as the story gets more and more ridiculous. I was very impressed by their professionalism.Probably my favorite scene involves a character who kills at least eight people to save a little puppy (said puppy seems to be played in some scenes by a rather unconvincing hand puppet).

Despite some Matrix-esque aesthetics, this film is all about the big questions: what makes us human? what is love? can we live without the ability to express emotion? It expertly balances action and introspection, providing a bleak image of the future while delivering an underhanded dose of hopefulness.While Christian Bale seems entirely incapable of facial expression, his dead-pan visage worked perfectly in this film.

323,shengyang,Vote-rigging: Compare the IMDB to the Rotten Tomatoes score,1,14 May 2003,"I want to add to my previous comment that vote-rigging is the likely cause of Equilibrium's high IMDB score. Typically, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes scores are highly correlated, but in this case they are diametrically opposed. Rotten Tomatoes gives Equilibrium a 26% rating, making it one of the worst movies of 2002. Meanwhile, IMDB has this turkey at 7.8 out of 10, one of the highest rated movies of the year. While critics and audience members sometimes disagree, they never disagree by this much. There is clearly an error with one of the two scores. Since the Rotten Tomatoes voting is easily verifiable by counting up the positive and negative critics comments posted on the site, I believe the problem lies with the IMDB score. If this is just the result of adolescent boys running up the score to give the movie a boost, then it is not such a big deal. But if it is a commercial ploy to boost Equilibrium DVD sales and rentals then that would be something far more serious.",Equilibrium

In many different war movies, books etc. this has been made evident in the sense, that snipers positions are given away when they make a shot. Equilibrium steps up this argument and makes a martial arts genre out of avoiding opponents bullets in close combat not unlike how Neo throws his arms around in circles and falls on his back. In fact, Equilibrium is where Mr. Smith learned his bullet dodging techniques.Background story/ plot is O.K. - the standard dictatorship - see such recent films as ""V for Vendetta"", ""Serenity"" etc.The script is well written and the film is well directed.Christian Bale, is outstanding - AGAIN",Equilibrium
325,JJCA,an underfunded MATRIX (spoiler),8,5 December 2003,"I admit I came to this movie just for Sean Bean, but since he left early in the film (as usual), I stayed because it was pretty fascinating.  Christian Bale's performance was great- he nailed the character and the changes the character must experience. Perfect for the role. Sean was great as always... I found the set design and locations fit the movie very well, really drawing on the historical horror we feel for the former east germany.  Quite stylish in it's own way (ala matrix).  However, the cars were a really jarring note.  What awful cheap concepts!  Far from being futuristic, they looked very dated.  I also appreciated the energy the director brought to the production.  Considering where it was filmed and in what conditions, very easily it could have sunk into a stultifying mass of 'greyness' - but he was able to successfully keep the energy up and make you want to see it to the end.  The martial arts moves and man to man combat were quite good and interesting, even to someone who's seen matrix multiple times.The storyline is exceedingly interesting.  What WOULD you sacrifice to remove violence from your world?  A question that we are asking more and more at the present time.  Perhaps our esteemed leaders should pay attention to this storyline.  Overall, i enjoyed this movie very much.  My expectations were low, but it was really very good.  I just dont understand why it was removed from the theatres after only one or two weeks. I really think it could have been improved by a larger budget for certain scenes (and for some better cars!). But I recommend it very much.",Equilibrium
326,dicksosa,"apples 1984 commercial, brave new world, and the matrix",8,10 December 2002,"Christian Bale brings an explosive presence to the screen in this film, with a similar stoic presence as that in American Psycho.  The plot is simply a rehash of big brother taking over and controlling us.  Nothing new or novel there.  But lets face it this movie isn't there for the story, it's there for the action. This movie has some great action sequences that won't disappoint in the least.The amount of gunfire in this movie is enough to make a rock star go deaf. But what's an action movie with out the guns.  The best thing about the majority of the action sequences is the fact that are ""fairly"" believable. No people flying around in the air.  No crazy jumping 50 feet into the air and crashing through a 2 foot by 2 foot window only to do a flip and land pointing your guns at the window.The action is pure speed, quick cuts, fast views, sharp angles.  The direction and camera work was well done.  The film keeps a fairly good pace throughout and keeps your interest 'til the end.  As for the acting it's not an Oscar performance, but not bad either.  Bale actually delivers a fairly good performance. Now with any review people people basically want to know ""Will I like t?""  -- Well if you want to see some seriously fun and entertaining action, yes you will.

327,deepion,is it really a matrix clone?,8,1 January 2004,"Equilibrium, (or ""Rebellion"" if your from Japan), is said by most to be simply a copy of The Matrix. But is it really just a copy? The short answer is, no. It does owe a lot of it's inspiration to The Matrix and other action movies, but what major action movie since the original Matrix movie hasn't? (Bulletproof Monk springs to mind). Infact, whereas in any movie nowadays, as long as it has some gun scenes and some slow-motion action it is automatically labeled a Matrix clone, Equilibrium holds it's own in the sense that it tries, and succeeds, to actually have a good story. At many points during this film I felt for the main character, played excellently by Christian Bale. The main plot of the movie is that to stop any more war or crime, all emotions have been outlawed. As our hero (a supercop intent to inforce this zero-emotion law)  starts to feel emotion again after almost a lifetime of keeping it repressed we see him break down and see his battle for, quite simply, our right for freedom of expression. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, far from it, and so what if it does seem to copy The Matrix and other action movies at certain points, if you were going to use any movie for inspiration, you can do a lot worse than the Matrix, and, as they say, impersonation is the sincerest for of flattery. If you¡¦re looking for a good action movie to while away a few hours, you could do a lot worse. If you are looking for a highly entertaining movie, which will make you look at your life, and examine it and make you thankful for what you have, this is perfect.",Equilibrium
328,chambersjad,Shocked at all the Reviewer Love,3,4 February 2011,"It's sometimes hard to take expectations out of mix when deciding if you liked a movie or not. All the love built this up to be ""the best movie that I failed to see in theaters."" I should never think that way, movies never live up to that kind of expectation. Or in the case of Equilibrium, any expectations at all.Like others have said, this movie takes plot points from several other movies and novels. Normally I would say that does not matter, all that matters is if this movie was entertaining or not. Let's face it, most of the good ideas and stories are already out there. Taking a concept and building on it is a good thing. I always rail against all of the haterz out there screaming ""ripoff, way to be original ROFLOL"" (and all of the other lame junk pre-teenagers write on boards and user reviews.) Movies that take story elements here and there and present them in innovative ways can be really entertaining. But this one is not. It takes the story from several other (mostly good) sources and jumbles it together into a unfocused mishmash that fails to entertain or establish its own identity.The only thing separating this movie from its influences is it's credits. They tried to spice it up with a big cast, but I have always believed that success or failure lies with the writing. Take a movie like Southland Tales, worst cast I thought I would ever see all in one movie, and it got a ten out of ten from me. I was amazed how good a movie it was, packed with such blowful actors. Equilibrium filled it's sets with respectable talent... and tripped on it's ho-hum script.I see all of the ""like Matrix but better"" reviews here. No, if you have not, go see the Matrix. Then get Blade Runner, 1984, Logan's Run, Fahrenheit 451, and watch them. Then read some Phillip K. Dick, Clarke's Light of Other Days, and Harrison Bergeron. That all will take a month or so, but at the end you will have watched a half dozen better movies and read a half dozen better books.

329,mwidunn-95-631875,Stinkeroo!,3,24 April 2018,"A stupid sci-fi ripoff of ""The Matrix"" (as the long black coats amply give away). It deserves its lousy 38% rating on RottenTomatoes and, perhaps, deserves less.Just how stupid is this movie? Well . . . :* Consider that the Clerics in the film cannot seem to remember what their title is: Are they ""Tetragrammaton Clerics"" or ""Grammaton Clerics."" Bale's character calls himself both. (Is there some difference?)* The whole premise of the film is that having emotions has become illegal and is punishable by death. Hence, everyone must take a drug, Proseum?/Prozium?, in order to stifle any emotions. Yet, EVERYBODY seems to be emoting. People smile, cry, get angry, get excited, show admiration, show surprise, and so forth. None of this apparently counts. Yet, get caught with a bottle of perfume and you are summarily whisked off to ""processing""!* In the opening scene, the Clerics arrive to purge an underground cell of emoters. After killing everybody, they discover, hidden under the floor, various paintings, books, and so forth. On top of everything is the Mona Lisa. No, I am not kidding. The. Mona. Lisa. It is real, too (doncha know), because one of the techies checks it out with some fancy device. Question: Does it even matter? Everything is burned, of course. (Too bad it was not a Jackson Pollock!)* Oh, by the way: As Bale and Sean Bean, his Cleric partner are driving away, they talk about leaving -- or, in Bean's case: not leaving -- things for the ""evidentiary team"". Yet, they burn up anything and everything they find! So, what is the ""evidentiary team"" supposed to catalogue? Ashes? It makes aboslutely no sense whatsoever.* Of course, being the Future, they have all of these high-tech, futuristic devices. When it came to checking the authenticity of the Mona Lisa above, some guy just pulled out a little device, scanned the painting, and within half a second could tell Cleric Bale that it was real. It is another scenario, however, when Bale wants to check up on whether Cleric Bean has actually checked a book into evidence as he was supposed to. In that case, Bale has to look at a mammoth-sized book in which people have had to scrawl their names in pen and ink.And, then there is:* Bale's acting, which is awful.* Emily Watson, whose right lip keeps twitching upwards when she talks, so that you would think that you were watching Elvis in a wig.* Taye Digges is clearly about five inches shorter than Bale. When he and Bale first meet, he is hunkered down in the driver's seat of their car. He looks like he could barely see over the steering wheel. And, the smiling! I wonder why he was never arrested for a ""sense offense"" (ugh)?* Whenever the matter of some of the negative consequences of emotion and feeling is brought up (for example, war, murder, rape, hate, racism, etc.), the argument from the ""pro-feeling"" crowd goes something like: ""Well, there are trade-offs."" Really?! Even the leader of the Underground admits to Bale's character that there are some who have to sublimate their emotions in order to control and give guidance to those who experience them. In other words, he admits that the anti-emotion crowd has a point, namely, that emotions are dangerous and must be controlled. So, . . . how is he any different from ""Father""?And so on and so on . . . There is some compelling camerawork. The fight scenes can be interestingly done, albeit sometimes pretentiously and with unnecessary showiness. The C. G. I. is substandard when compared to something like ""The Matrix"" which came before.",Equilibrium

The story has enough surprising twists, even though it's one of the oldest stories - ""good guy against the bad guys"". The cinematography is very good and the fighting scenes, especially in the more action-heavy second part of the movie, are breathtaking. John Preston, played by Christian Bale is excellent.

Another half-baked imitation of the 1999 epoch -making effort from the Wachowski brothers ends in one of the most ridiculous and pointless films of the year. Equilibrium is obviously pretentious, the amount of time that is spent focusing on these (literally) emotionless characters and trying to develop a cliched plot is appalling. Especially for a film that appeals to an audience for one primary reason. Killing. Christian Bale delivers a  suitable wooden performance as a - guess what - law enforcer in a WW3 weary society that has banned all types of human emotion. Whether this is a ploy to ensure the hiring of actual actors unnecessary or a innovative sci - fi concept is debatable. What isn't open to question is the unalloyed absurdity of the film's world and the repetitive nature of the narrative. Bale eradicates freedom fighters, kills his partner ( Sean Bean - who is woefully underused) after he shows remote signs of good acting ... sorry, emotion. He then proceeds to destroy another group of insurrectionists and does so several further times until he, unbelievably, is taught the error of his ways by a cute canine. But it's okay, because when he becomes pro-revolutionist and has to fight for the cause, he can still slaughter hundreds of innocent guards just doing their job with a balletic, simultaneous mix of kung fu and reckless use of a firearm. The inconsistency of the world is laughable. Characters are hunted down and killed because they speak in a sarcastic tone but others get away with passionate shouting - surely a form of hatred? Thus  Equilibrium relies on combat (of which there's only a modicum of) to deliver it from lethargy.The nihilism evident would have been acceptable if the fight scenes were actually exciting. The audience's lack of pathos for any of the characters means the brawls give no impetus to endure the films duller sections. The absence a gripping narrative, any excitement, a morale or towering performances doesn't help an affair with no disparateness.",Equilibrium
334,kennyevans,Something about this film never clicked for me...,6,16 April 2007,"Right from the start a bell was ringing in my head about this film. Was it the 80's TV film looking 'futuristic' transport? Was it the clichéd post apocalyptic preabmle? Was it the fact that the 'original' Mona Lisa was about 2 feet bigger than the original currently hanging in the Louvre in Paris? Within the first 10 minutes I had spotted more continuity errors than you see in may films, perhaps 2 or 3. The lack of blood on the floor after the initial slaughter of the rebel group, having been shredded by more lead than a church roof was also worrying. The film, from the start seemed to be so bent on style that it forgot about basic film-making techniques. I thought shot composition was poor, albeit there wasn't much in the way of scenery to balance shots or to make a composition from.Then more problems; The way the police types just stood by and watched whilst one was chopped or killed, allowing our hero Bale to kill multiple foes at a single sitting. Even the plot helping dialogue about 'optimum fighting tactics' didn't seem to explain why the police just stood around and didn't spray the area with bullets. Also Who was training these police? You don't all draw guns and then form a circle around your quarry!! Which leads on to the incessant cocking of weapons, which this film must be the title holder for most gun cocks per minute of any film, even multiple cockings of an already cocked gun were spotted. Oh and then the costume department fell on its face by kitting out our police in standard issue leather 3/4 jackets and crash helmets, in obligatory black. How original! However, Bale was great as the cold cleric, Sean Bean gets another huge fee for dying within the first act of yet another film, he must love Hollywood. I was also drawn into the story as it did twist a bit and leave me wanting more. For me though, there were a few too many helpers along the way to highlight where the story was going. Even the double twist with the Brandt character was transparent given his cocky dialogue throughout.On the whole, for me the whole thing could have been a lot darker in storyline and in terms of the lighting, it seemed to lack atmosphere. Also in a world supposedly bereft of feelings, a close examination of the dialogue shows many lines borne out of feeling by all characters (even the ones taking their medicine!). I did like the Beethoven scene though, only spoilt by Bale's awkward dialogue at the end of that scene.Matrix inspired, didn't quite make its premise, nicely acted, cheap looking, but entertaining none the less.",Equilibrium
335,kessiebear-24936,Great premise with unforgivable plot holes,5,3 July 2019,"Firstly, if the purpose of dosing was to eliminate emotions like hatred, anger and rage; why were there so many clerics and other governing members who overreacted with anger to many situations? Not to mention the patronising and scheming against Preston (Christian Bale) that Brandt (Taye Diggs) delighted in for half the film.Secondly, if the dosing was designed to remove the human element from humans - that is, emotion - then why did everyone not behave like empty robots? Smiling constantly throughout the film, clearly characters are having sex with their partners given there were children, amongst other behavioural displays of emotion.Thirdly, where did all the dogs come from if they're supposed to get destroyed on sight? Don't tell me they were all random strays when the one Preston kept was clearly a purebred Burnese Mountain pup.And of course the dog conveniently reappeared at the end in a poor attempt to quash the ""where did the dog go"" question, except the dog couldn't possibly have been living with Preston and his children the whole time, given he didn't find out his kids were feeling until right near the end.. so it would have been breaking the law to have it there.The film had a great premise and much of it was interesting to watch, but those plot holes made it difficult to fully stay in the film and thoroughly enjoy the concept.",Equilibrium

341,themadstork,"not bad, but could have easily been so much better",6,8 August 2007,"""Equilibrium"" is one those annoying movies which gets enough things right that the viewer can see how it might have been good or even great, but which still falls short. A good many reviewers have made a big deal over the fact that the movie takes ideas from ""1984"" and ""Brave New World,"" but so what? At least it has something serious, and timely, to say; and what's more its dystopia actually makes sense in its twisted way. Both of these aren't things I could say for ""The Matrix."" So I won't fault it for taking ideas from elsewhere, at least Wimmer is thinking over serious ideas instead of just giving us a gun fu spectacle. The problem is that the movie just doesn't think through these ideas on a deep enough level. The movie comes very close to raising some really unsettling questions: Are the very things that make us capable of true humanity, the things that can cause our inhumanity to one another? In other words does the capacity for real good require the very things that can make us evil? Or: Is deadening all your feelings not a fairly sane response to the blasted post-apocalyptic world the characters find themselves in? It comes close to a critique of our use of pharmaceuticals to mold our characters into the ""right"" shape and ward off all those bad feelings and a defense of the idea that at least some suffering- passion in the old sense of the world- might be necessary for a truly human existence. The problem is that while it comes close to these questions, it ends up veering away from complex and controversial issues like these and doesn't take any stand that's all that unsettling or irritating: Puppies are good. Totalitarianism is bad. Quite true, but not exactly original either. Then there's the plot. At it's base it's not preposterous. . . but it does have a good many elements that are hard to swallow. To make them work would require a bit of stage setting and some finesse, but the movie is in such a hurry that it doesn't have time for either. In the end the viewer is left to make a good many excuses and even if he or she does it still only barely makes sense. Still ""Equilibrium"" has a good bit going for it. It looks good. The art deco aesthetic is coldly beautiful and it just fits the character of the regime so perfectly. While I'm not great fan of gun fu, the movie does it well. I have to say the gun fights and other fight scenes are nicely choreographed (even if I do find prettified violence a bit objectionable); I prefer it over the Wachowsky brothers computerized trickery. The acting is also quite good. Watson and Bale can both get more meaning into a glance here than many actors can into a soliloquy. Diggs isn't bad either, though he leans just a bit to ham in a role that needs just a bit more smarmy menace. And the children are deeply creepy in just the right way. All in all it's better than your standard ""Matrix"" rip off; I'd even go so far as to say it's better than ""The Matrix"" (though that isn't gushing praise, I found ""The Matrix"" pretty silly), but it isn't a great movie. And that's the rub, there's enough that this movie does right that one can easily see how it might have been more than the competent, moderately intelligent action film it is. This makes it all the more annoying that Wimmer is so sloppy about plot and plays it so safe with the dangerous ideas he's put his hands on.",Equilibrium
342,rockdude,Excellent but...,8,24 March 2003,"I thought this was an excellent idea when I heard it and having fallen madly in love with Christian Bale's portrayal of a psychopath in 'American Psycho', I had to see this film. I wasn't disappointed.The acting is good, especially when one considers that Bale portrays a character feeling emotion for the first time yet suppressing these strong feelings to avoid execution as a 'sense offender'. Just how you manage to play an 'emotionless' man with emotions is beyond me and Bale pulls it off brilliantly. The supporting cast is equally good and Sean Pertwee's character, while fairly two-dimensional(!) [see the film], is well-played. I'm impressed with the Sean Bean appearance; as usual, the man does not disappoint.No-one who has ever read '1984' could possibly miss the references here (Father=Big Brother, Preston=Winston, Mary=Julia, DuPont=O'Brien, etc.) but there is enough originality to make it seem sufficiently different enough to enjoy. 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Total Recall' and 'The Matrix' (among others) are also heavily referenced but do not believe that this film is just '1984 meets The Matrix'...oh no! The plot is of a good standard, if patchy and containing a few obvious holes such as smiling Clerics. I found certain parts slow and some scenes contained images contrary to the mood of the rest of the film but the good parts more than make up for the bad. Just the action scenes alone are worth going to see the film but PLEASE DON'T for this reason as the film is more than just an action film.As for the ending, it is a tad obvious but nevertheless the final scenes are amazing with the most original and well-choreographed gunfight I have EVER seen in a film. Gun Kata rules!Overall, I give this film 8/10. With a little more effort on the script and some covering of plot holes, it could easily be 10/10.

Utilising far better actors, better fight scenes and an intelligent storyline, Kurt Wimmer's film is a corker.Whilst the story has obviously been heavily influenced by Brave New World and 1984, the idea of an emotion supressing future is a clever twist on the totalitarian regime.  Christian Bale gives a very measured performance as cleric John Preston, looking a lot more suited to his role than the cardboard cut-out that is Keanu Reeves ever did to Neo.What really impresses about Equilibrium is the quality of the fight scenes. I firmly believe this is one of the best films for fights of the last 5 years, blowing you away with it's unique martial art, the gun-kata.Visually impressive, although slightly limited by it's emotion supressing cast, Equilibrium is one of the best ignored films of the decade.

When I saw the opening of it, it blew my mind. It was practically Matrix, with a darker element. The action was superb. It proved to be a promising movie. The movie's story was a bit confusing for me in the beginning, but eventually I figured it out. It was very similar to Matrix story-wise. Although the mood of the film was extremely mechanical-like and the scenes were often gloomy and dark, it was just one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. Christian Bale was great playing like a serious guy with no expression at all. This movie is definitely worth watching, if not twice.",Equilibrium

In the sci-fi sleeper ""Equilibrium"", Christian Bale has the look and persona of an opera star performing on stage. The fight sequences are so well choreographed that one would have to believe that Bale practices some form of martial arts. He moves with the grace and stealth of a panther, just before it pounces on its prey . ""Equilibrium"" is much more polished than the more complicated ""Matrix"". Taye Diggs was also excellently cast as a partner turned adversary. The conclusion could not have been more satisfying. ""Equilibrium"" should have garnered much more attention as a theatrical release. My guess is that it was not marketed properly, a true hidden gem in the sci-fi genre.",Equilibrium

354,RCD1321,Great film!,10,16 March 2005,"I saw this movie, having not heard of it before, with a friend who described it as ""Way better than the Matrix."" So I viewed it with an open mind. What I saw was spectacular. Sure the plot has been done before, but not really that mainstream, and not even close to this well. Others have said it's low budget, but from the looks of it (without delving in deeper) it looks to be about the same budget as the latest Speilburg, Michael Bay, or Coen flick. While it is a bit of a far fetched idea- removing human emotions altogether to prevent war and crime- it does touch base on logic, without emotion we cannot have anger, without anger there is no war. The idea of the film is great... but what's even better is the delivery. In a future where emotion and art is illegal (because art stirs emotion), who is there to enforce these laws? The police... but to lead them you need someone even more equipped to handle the vile acts of ""Sense Offenders""- as people who ""feel"" are referred to. More equipped doesn't necessarily mean firepower. The Cleric (main character Cleric John Preston- played by Christian Bale) is suited to handle anything. With action sequences that are more feasible than the Matrix, more exciting, and less sci-fi. The acting as well is superb. Taye Diggs does an excellent job with his character and I would have to say although it's not the biggest part, Sean Bean delivers an outstanding performance. Of course, leading the cast, Christian Bale gives another performance that proves he's one of the best actors out there right now. View this movie not comparing it to the Matrix, but view it as it was mean to be, a Sci-Fi Action that isn't just a shoot-em-up the end film, this one actually deals with a future that is somewhat possible. If you like action movies that aren't just crappy acting with cool gunfights and explosions this one is a good choice. I give this a 10!",Equilibrium

It arrived from my DVD rental site last week and so I finally got around to it, and was really rather surprised at how good it was. Yes, it isn't perfect, what film is, and yes it borrowed ideas from other sources, but name me one that hasn't? But I don't think it's the utter tripe some have been saying. There were great performances all around, but most especially from Christian Bale who totally convinces as an unfeeling, soulless assassin who works for a totalitarian government intent on suppressing peoples emotions in order to prevent another catastrophic war, who then at first accidentally does not take his emotion suppressing drug, then deliberately doesn't. Your eyes are riveted to him as it slowly dawns on him just what sort of world he is living in. The fight scenes are highly stylised, but unlike The Matrix, actually have a point and purpose to them, instead of just being for show; one grumble I do have is how the soldiers just seemed to line up to be shot – I wouldn't fancy them defending me, thanks! I hesitate to bring up The Matrix as I feel this film suffers unfairly in comparison; it would have done so much better if it had been released first, as, and I know I am likely to be shot down in flames for this, I prefer it to The Matrix, which I think is an overblown, self important, very good looking piece of tosh, which is so far up its own backside, it could play tonsil hockey with itself!Ignore criticisms and view Equilibrium with an open mind.",Equilibrium

And then someone had the bright idea of adding a superb actor in the leading role, and it became something else entirely: good.I'm not very sci-fi literate, so I haven't read half the books like Fahrenheit 451 that this movie copies. Still, a lot of stories borrow off each other. What really matters is whether the borrowing is done well. I think that Equilibrium does this very serviceably.But it's Christian Bale's brilliant performance--and to a lesser degree, Emily Watson's--that lifts this film to a whole new level; makes it enjoyable when with any other actor in the lead it would simply be mindless violence. Personally I found the movie rather thought-provoking. But even without that, it's still an excellent, heart-felt movie about standing up and doing the right thing no matter what the cost.

As far as I'm concerned, <i>Equilibrium</i> is one of the greatest movies to come out of Hollywood or anywhere else in the last couple of years.

It has this strange atmosphere, a dark one and a futuristic one at the same time, combined very successfully. The characters were interesting enough, same goes for the story, and the acting was decent enough. It goes better better, as the main character starts to change, and the scenes that shows that to us are perfectly shot. The music is very good, the direction is tight, performances are great, to make a long story short, it manages to hold you there...And then it hits you. It's like jerry bruckheimer and the watchowski brothers took over.. Special effects are all over the place, meaningless violence, including a lot of bone cracking, endless gun fighting...

Really there is nothing about this movie that stood out for me. In fact the only thing that made me give this movie a 6 is the action (wich was rather good).Christian Bale takes on the role as special agent for a government(if you want to call it that) that is trying to keep people from having any emotions. Yes, it sounds silly but its true! They wan't to stop people from having emotions so that there will be no more war. They way they want to achieve this is by eradicating all people who have feelings (wow, ironic isn't it..). The reason for this is a nuclear war that took place (called world war 3).Besides the stupid and poorly executed story there is also Cleric's (christian bale) sidekick who is not only annoying but seems to show emotion all the time. Sometimes he can be angry, other times he shows a smile on his face.. really can it get any worse? If you want to make a believable story about people having no emotion than make them have no emotion! Don't make them smile or get angry.. it makes no sense.Anyway, after a while Cleric stops taking his dose of prozium (wich keeps him from having any emotion) by an accident that occurs while he is shaving and so he decides to stop taking it at all. Eventually he winds up in the resistance (or underground as they call it) and decides to take out the ""Father"" who of course turns out to be his boss all along.This movie is filled with on cliché after another and it stands out no more than an average Steven Seagal movie. The only thing the movie has going for it is Christian Bale (who i also find fairly weak in this movie) and some awesome action scenes.So besides all the clichés and utterly predictable story I found this movie to be enjoyable only because of the action.If you are expecting something groundbreaking and original don't go see this movie.",Equilibrium

Something that will make you think, but not too hard. That's what this movie is. It's just enjoyable. At least for me. I remember when i first learned about this movie. We were having poker night and a friend of mine was pretty intoxicated and for some reason he was trying to remember the name of this movie.

It wasn't the violence: many of the movies I have enjoyed most and been most impressed with have been violent (Kill Bill, the Departed, this year's No Country and Eastern Promises). No. What is was was that the first five minutes told me that the film-makers simply didn't know what they were doing. Voice-over: 'World War Three.' blah, blah, blah. Stock footage: H-bomb, Stalin, Saddam. (If they'd had any guts they'd have shown a picture of Bush) Voice-over: Blah, blah, Grammaton cleric...

There is VERY little character development and the plot really fails in the believability stakes. The Matrix justified the ridiculous stuff the characters are capable of by creating special rules for inside the Matrix.

Minutes into the film we hear Cleric John Preston hoping that his partner's interrogators will be 'soft on him' - surely indicating a degree of feeling?As well as this running paradox this is one of the most strongly derivative films of its genre.  Essentially it is a mix of two books - Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (a 'Utopian society' where the population is controlled by daily drug doses, called Soma in the book) and of course, George Orwell's 1984 (totalitarian state on steroids).  The parallels between the film and these books is blindingly obvious.  OK, how about we beef it up a bit? Hmmmm, those Matrix fight scenes looked good.  Yeah this Gun Kata thing stuff is fun for a bit, but surely the police (and butchering state who devised this art) would get wind of it and have some form of defense against it? Seeing Christian Bale do his fancy gun dance stuff for the seventeenth time gets a little tired.Additionally we have a highly trained police force who don't even break a nail for most of the movie while fighting the rebel insurgents.

Some reviewers accuse this movie of stealing from Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984)' and Fahrenheit 451 (1966)'. I do not agree since these books clearly were written with a political message and then later adapted for the screen.Equilibrium is on the other hand just' action / thriller entertainment that borrows ideas with taste and respect (like the fascist ruler Father' talking to the citizens from a screen on a zeppelin).This is not a movie that is meant to change the world.The cynical futuristic setting is well done and the costumes greatly emphasize the cruel atmosphere of the police state. At no point is sentimental aspects or political messages overdone  this was never indented. These issues are in the movie - but they never supersede the action.

The acting was excellent, with relatively unexperienced actors [Christian Bale, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs etc] i thought that perhaps the challenge of showing no emotion would be too difficult - i was wrong.

My suspicion about ""Equilibrium"" is that Kurt Wimmer succeeded where Rand failed, and managed to get this particular brand of dystopia to screen. It is just as simplistic in its broad brushstrokes, just as childish in its dualistic treatment of the human condition, and just as rightly overlooked by the general public. Christian Bale's shocking lack of dimensionality (I assume Keanu was still locked into his Matrix contract and couldn't be bothered) paired with the outright absurd conceit of ""Gun-Kata"" (the comically overstated effectiveness of which is probably the singular reason to watch it) achieves an astounding lack of self-awareness which borders on self-parody.",Equilibrium

On of my first thoughts that came up during watching this move was: Emotionless living, where did you already heard of suppressing your feelings? And later i remembered: Religion. Religion is all about faith in greater god (""The Father"") without questioning his commands, while your natural pulses - like lust -> sex - are forbidden or suppressed. The only difference I imagine is, that Religion does indoctrination for economic advantages , where as in the move all this happened in the case of a greater good - the war and cruelty free society. So second: What does the move what to tell?Suppression, blindness and faith doesn't create a greater world, even if its done in a selfless way. Life is about feelings - the ups and downs make life worth; how could you know how much happiness if worth, if you don't know his opposite Anger and Sadness. Every try to uniform mankind ended up even worse than before.So start living, use you're imagination and feel life!Third: Why the f*** then just 8/10 ?

Watch him try to be stern in the first scenes of the movie and you will note immediately, it isn't working. From there, agree or not, the flaws in the script are too numerous to count. Over and over and over men who are not to demonstrate feelings do, from the earliest scenes to the last. Even the statements made or answers to questions (""I am glad"" rather than ""It is good"") suggest feelings though they are not allowed.This is what happens when the man who writes the script also directs.

377,Spellvexit,Mild entertainment,7,6 September 2003,"This movie has been accused of being a Matrix wannabe, and though I agree it isn't the Matrix, I doubt it would have the same look and feel, or even exist, if the Matrix had not made such an impact.  It borrows the styling, the oppressive framework, and the incongruous fight sequences of the Matrix movies to tell a story that in many ways has already been told.  (Then again, one could say the same of the Matrix!)I can't write a review without remarking on the ""Gun Kata.""   The writer of this movie's affair with Japanese culture made for a very silly style of combat, wherein the cleric studies the statistics of gunfight scenarios in order to be all but unstoppable in combat.  According to these statistics, it seems that somebody in the EXACT MIDDLE of a gunfight is the most effective.  This seems less like Gun Kata than it does Gun Kamikaze to me, especially when a well-placed grenade could do just the same thing as a cleric relying upon statistics.  Anyhow, we are supposed to be very impressed when the protagonist makes his entry with laughable gun flourishes and truly superhuman performances, but the end result is more puzzlment at why such a valuable cleric didn't just send in the shock troopers flanking him on either side.  I also found the ridiculous gun posing to be more of an art form than anything very efficient, but that couldn't be, because art and emotion are banned in this society, yes?I enjoyed the movie, actually.  It had enough unorthodox plot twists and thwarted expectations to keep me going, and I actually found some of the slower scenes much more interesting than the battles.  The gunmetal gray, drab atmospheres were well-done, and the music complemented the movie well, save for the schizophrenic ""now = time to kick ass"" music that was queued up when a fight ensued.  Unfortunately, like its cousin, the Matrix, the movie couldn't decide whether it was a thinking movie more along the lines of Gattaca, or an all-out mindless Bruckheimer movie. This movie will not impress, but it will entertain.  It's a good Friday night rental, and is still far better than most of the garbage in the movie circuit (read: Tomb Raider).(P.S. and one tiny spoiler:  Why the devil did Father have artwork in his inner sanctum?  He tells us that he has feelings as well, but it seems to me that these paintings would arouse a lot of suspicion from anybody who caught a glimpse of them.  In my opinion, the whole ""revelation"" that he had feelings was pointless.  And this revelation lasted all but 10 seconds before he got perforated by our hero.)",Equilibrium

From being an emotionless person, a stone, to a proper Human being - first class acting, exemplary display, in the entire transformation in the movie. This man knows how to act. The actions scenes were where he showed his true class - that he is a class above many actors in the business, that few in the industry are as dedicated as him. Some of the 1 against many people action scenes, which might have looked ridiculous and excess if played by some other actors, were played so convincingly by him that you would actually believe that it was possible in real life.This is probably the only review where I have done nothing but praise the lead actor for his acting in the first 4 paragraphs - such good was his acting that the plot becomes secondary.

I cannot really say anything else, the problem is that I do not need movies with 100% action and 0% storyline, and this storyline has so few originality, and all of these originality is so illogical that it is completely worthless.

387,mmr07,"Average, at Best",6,22 October 2004,"I heard about this movie on the net, and the buzz it made as a better match to the Matrix Trilogy, as a fan of the latter first episode, and after seeing Equilibrium recently, I have to say this.THERE'S NO COMPARISON WHAT SO EVER BETWEEN THE TWO MOVIES in term of story, plot twists, directing. Possible Spoilers:Equilibrium had a lame unconvincing story to hold on, although not new, it was done before in movies like 1984, a society ruled by one called Father (in 1984 he was called Big Brother) who both new best.The two movies oppose at the concept of war, although both societies are similarly subdued and carefully spied on, in Equilibrium the idea is the society has overcome the concept of war by suppressing their people's feelings and emotions that may lead to murder and eventually war, however in 1984, the people were working to support their soldiers at war with other continents.I wasn't convinced by the idea that in the future we would ever get barbaric to resort to this method to eradicate war, and so many people would be convinced of this idea and become agents who make sure to fulfill it, and what was so predictable are the underground rebels, very cliché and repeated.Technically speaking, costumes were stolen from the matrix, the monochromatic lighting of the Dark blue world reminds us of the green world of the matrix. The special effects were limited but maybe the budget wasn't that big, but if I recall well, the first matrix ran out on budget of 80 million and the directors had to end the movie as it ended and rewrite the rest to become a hit trilogy.Forgive me, I usually adore anything from Spielberg futuristic movies to classic Merchant Ivory masterpieces, all kind of movies in fact, but I just can't find any spark in this one.What really made me eager to watch Equilbrium is my curiosity of Emily Watson's character, when I heard that she was in it I thought what the hell is she doing here, it was like Helena Bonham Carter doing Planet of the Apes 2001, and what a bad choice for both.I'll give credit to Christian Bale good acting, Sean Bean was a great addition, the guy playing the leader is weak and had no Leader Charisma, I think an older guy should have taken the role, either John Hurt, Patrick Stewart or Ian McAllen would have done it better with pinch of classic evil. Some of the fight scenes had some originality although lacking credibility, but thats the fault of the story line., and thats were the Matrix overpowers this movie, every extraordinary element in the matrix was supported by the story line, and you had the urge to watch it over and over again and every time you'll discover hidden ideas and clues that give more magic and twist to the story.

390,khyrlik,Giant number of flaws mixed together.,5,11 August 2003,"1) World without feelings nor culture can't exist. This would be world of robots and keeping stagnation thru all years. To create community under such terror you need some supporters within people (someone should like such world), I don't think that majority could support this. Even if would be true on the beginning, revolution would start quickly. 2) Even if it could exits it isn't in this movie: Main hero has wife (no feelings?), despite efforts there is huge violence in this world - Police, Clericks and their way of ""fixing"" things. 3) Gun Kata - one of the biggest flaws here. You can't create fighting style based on statistics. You can be good fighter using predictable styles. You can't aim and kill several people unless they are standing and wait for death (as it's in movie). OK they can eventually fire tons of bullets hitting nothing except walls, but not our superhero, which have enough time to reload in-mid of fight. 4) Special effects are joke, if some people see them as better than Matrix are blind or on drugs. Fights here are made of speedied footage (cause of course man can't move so fast that can kill tenths of people keeping alive himself. Well, this movie technique comes from twenties of previous century I guess. This + fast editing. Very weak. Even Bulletproof Monk does it better (and it's the worst movie of 2003 IMO). 5) There is no surprise moment in script, everything goes as it should until end in which of course main hero have little surprise but have to win of course. Acting is average. Only Bale is good and he's ""transformation"" is presented well, but it doesn't save whole movie. As for action film it's under average.

391,Anijo,"Oh, those very dangerous paintings",3,21 August 2007,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan, so I tend to be more forgiving to shortcomings in movies made within this genre compared to many others. But 'Equilibrium' had such major flaws that I couldn't even let it slide as OK entertainment. There are a lot of small things here & there through the film that I find hard to accept, but I won't bother with them because the overwhelming problem is the basic premise that the whole story relies on. Here we are told that after world war 3 there is a totalitarian government which have so much intelligence & technology that they're able to produce a drug that can turn every citizen into a human robot by completely suppressing all their feelings. This government also have so much power that they can convince the vast majority of ordinary people to take this monster drug every day, because the removal of human feelings is supposed to prevent another devastating war. (Yes, we must immediately forget - just as the movie's government & people obviously did - that rather than emotional, the reasons for war are infinitely much more likely to be purely practical; like the need for natural resources, food & land). To make sure the above policy is enforced the rulers have lots of heavily armed men that are ready to track & kill anybody who won't take the drug.But then we also learn that even though the government possess all this amazing intelligence, technology and power, they are not able to suppress a resistance movement whose major interests when staying off the drug seem to be the urge to read poetry and look at pictures of girls and flowers? I'm sorry, I just can't buy into all that. Actually I couldn't do anything but laugh when the first action scene showed a group of tough rugged men with big guns ruthlessly kill and be killed for the right to ... watch old oil paintings! C'mon people, that's not deep, it's just stupid. George Orwell wrote the classic book '1984' about totalitarian states, and he knew more about this subject way back in the 1940's than 'Equilibrium' writer/director Kurt Wimmer does today. In Orwell's book the state doesn't try to keep the big majority of the people under total control, because everybody with reasonable intelligence understand that this is impossible. Instead the state give some advantages to smaller groups who in exchange help them, and these collaborators are then kept under extreme surveillance and threatened with horrible punishment if they become disobedient, because the collaborators are the ones that really make or break the men in power. In 'Equilibrium', maybe you are willing to look past the impossibility that somebody could invent a single drug that totally suppressed all of the strong emotions we humans have. But why then would a totalitarian power waste their resources on the even more impossible task of forcing every single person to take this drug every single day? Not to mention the hopeless effort of trying to destroy every single work of art ever produced on the planet, because unlike some things that the government gladly will allow - you know, really trivial stuff like raising children & shooting people who don't follow orders - old paintings & poetry are obviously way more likely to arouse those Dangerous Feelings, right?A totalitarian state with superior brains & power wouldn't bother trying to keep track of every single person in the world. They would rather deal with the masses mainly through media propaganda, and use the amazing drug to keep a group close to the leaders under total control. That would not only be possible but very plausible since it is every dictator's dream to have an army of human robots that would carry out his orders totally without emotion. Such a force would be enough to ensure that ordinary people couldn't go against the leader's will. Like colonel Kurtz says in 'Apocalypse Now': ""If I had divisions of men who could kill without feeling, our troubles here would be over very quickly"".I rate 'Equilibrium' 3/10 because everything in it didn't suck completely. On the plus side I'll say that I think the cinematography & design looks pretty good, and I think that Christian Bale does some good work in the scenes where he's starting to change from a robot to a feeling human. But for me these minor positives weigh like a feather against the heavy problems within the script. There really should have been much more work done on the story long before Mr. Bale stood in front of the camera.",Equilibrium

Maybe this is due to unfair comparison to the Matrix, and it's true that the fighting and concept are very reminiscent of it, but there's more to it than that.  Equilibrium is supposed to provoke thought, and in this respect it just edges out the Matrix and totally annihilates its two embarrassing sequels.Equilibrium shamelessly plunders ideas from Orwell's dystopian nightmare, 1984, changing the character of Big Brother to Father and placing the story in a near future fascist state ruled over by unseen leaders.While the Matrix asks the question is it better to live in an artificial heaven or a real hell,  Equilibrium asks us what price we are willing to pay for an apparently peaceful society.Its easy to empathise with the main character as he feels inspiration and passion for the first time and to laugh as he begins to resent conformity.The ending was perhaps a little too far fetched but overall this movie stands up well to comparison with its much better known contemporary.",Equilibrium

I thought the bleak future portrayed in the film was an interesting one, and although it lacked credibility, it was an interesting point - they banned people from having emotions so that they could keep the human race from destroying itself, but by doing so, they took away what being human was in the first place. From seeing the trailer I thought that the film looked very much like a matrix rip off, but when I watched the film I realised not only was it a very different storyline and atmosphere, the action scenes were also very different from those seen in the matrix. Equilibrium does not utilise bullet time like many post-matrix action films have attempted to do, but instead almost develops a new type of action. The people are trained in a martial art with focus on guns - the last fight scene where our hero and ""villain"" go at it is mental, they are using guns at close range, trying to get shots in at each other, and using the guns like swords hitting the other ones out of the way to try and get a clear shot - very entertaining. Overall although this film lacked credibility and realism, i thought it was great, and although it feels like there are probably pot holes, i can't think of any after watching it my first time, except for maybe one characters obvious emotional expression (although this could've been a ploy).

Christian Bale was the epitome of restrained emotion and although this film was a very violent one in places, it was essentially a salute to the tenacity of the human spirit and how it refuses to be suppressed. The drugs that everyone were required to take reduced a person's capability for feeling deep emotions like anger and created a non-violent society policed by the clerics but it also diminished their capacity to feel love and experience the beauty of art and music but deep inside them it was only lying dormant. In John Preston's(Bale) case it took the killing of his colleague Errol Partridge, played with great feeling by Sean Bean, who chose death over a life without being able to feel to make him look for something more. The fight scenes were fantastic throughout, first of all when Preston was trying to suppress the resistance movement and later when he had turned against the system, the scene where he kills to save the puppy is one of the most exciting and meaningful in the film. I could go through the film scene by scene as there were so many great moments but that would be rather tedious so I would just say, watch this film before you die!",Equilibrium
398,owenmul,Underrated,7,27 March 2015,"I think the critics were unjustified in the incredible criticism of this film, it definitively deserved more than a 33 meta score, so my first point on this film is that is sorely underrated.While the some of the characters are obviously quite bland due to the nature of the story and premise, but John Preston's transformation throughout the film is incredibly interesting to watch. I felt that this and American Psycho have been Christian bales most interesting performances. I will not go into detail but the most heart wrenching and pivotal moments of the film (The Dog scene) allowed Bale to show the full range of character.The cinematography is also quite astounding at times, while a lot of the time the scenery and backdrop is incredibly bland due its dystopian nature, but some of the action set pieces are incredible to watch. One that stood out to me is right at the beginning when Preston bounds into a dark room and the room is lit up with gunfire.This is one of the more interesting dystopain premises, it takes place in a Fascist future where all forms of feeling are illegal. While this does run the risk of the film being boring or dis-interesting due to lack of character development but it is pulled off in such a way that ever moment is just as gripping as the last. The finale of the film however feels a little rushed but all ties together rather nicely in the end, which would be one of the only issues I have with eh script of the film.I throughout recommend this film to anyone who is interested in quite a fresh action film with an incredibly interesting new premise. While some may dismiss it as a Matrix clone, it's much much more than that and this is one of the reasons I feel that this film was dismissed so readily.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",Equilibrium

Sure, there is a bit of a Matrix feel about it in parts, a bit of Big Brother in other parts, and the premise that a society can suppress their feelings was a little hard to swallow at first, but I really got into this film.Christian Bale is good as the 'seemingly' cold hearted cleric out to stop all 'sense crime'...and I can see why he's gone on to do Batman Begins, he just seems right for it. The supporting cast really are that, they contribute to the story, but it's Bale that the film is following and his journey is very well presented.It is always hard watching a movie when the initial idea or concept seems very strange and foreign, but Equilibrium manages to help you get over that by giving you a good story and characters you are interested in (I wanted to slap his son).I know I said nothing in this to tell you what was going on, but I urge you to watch it and wait until the end when things start cookin'.",Equilibrium
400,invincible_irvine,One of the most passionate and emotional movies I've ever seen...,10,2 April 2006,"""Equilibrium"" is one of the most passionate and emotional movies I've ever seen, and this comes from a movie that depicts a society that exists based on the concept that emotion and passion are the very things that led to the destruction of humanity, which is why feelings have been banned in the movie.Starring Christian Bale, who in 2002 wasn't really the big name celebrity that he is today, Taye Diggs, Sean Bean, Emily Watson, William Fichtner and Angus McFayden, this movie is classified as science fiction, but there's far more drama than sci-fi and even action. But the few action scenes in the movie are spectacularly choreographed and executed, mimicking and even exceeding ""The Matrix"" in fight scene presentation. In this movie, I deemed the action warranted and necessary, while in ""The Matrix,"" action is emotionless and usually unnecessary.It's amazing how well Bale composed himself while playing a character whose strength was drawn from a lack of compassion or feeling: to him, human emotion is the disease that must be suppressed and controlled. But as he regains his humanity, his passion and love for the feelings he has regained leads him to strike back against the hand that has raised and trained him to become a lethal force against the things that he has come to love.Although very few people watched this movie, which opened and played in less than 50 screens nationwide, we all now have the opportunity to view and appreciate this most gripping and fascinating movie with some of the most incredible action sequences I've ever seen.",Equilibrium

Special effects and pseudo-martial arts do not compensate for a well-written script. This film fails where Orwell triumphs - in creating a believable lead character.Maybe I'm just getting old and the target market is illiterate teenagers, but I really wanted to like this movie. I had hoped for some form of intellectual stimulation on a subject that could have been well developed. Sadly I came away with the feeling that it would have been done much better 20 years ago without all the technical wizardry and special effects.Between the effects over-kill, and the script being fairly average to start with, I feel quite generous rating this movie at a 5 out of 10.

At first I didn't know that to think.  In some ways it reminded me of the  Matrix, the priest-like black cassock and Bale's slicked back black hair.  Then as the movie progressed, it completely sucked me in.  I enjoyed that there was none of the usual (and for some reason popular) wire-fu.  And seriously, I've never seen gun-fu and totally dug it.  Cool premise.  I rented it and ended up buying it for my collection.  It's worth it for Kurt Wimmer's commentary.  I'm a screenwriter and may be going into production on a low-budget thriller, so I especially appreciated his comments on budget. Ha!  Won't have any black floors!  Very very awesome movie.

This could have been an amazing film. Bale is still quite good, but what a waste of Diggs (For Taye playing the well-written villian his talent deserves see Way Of The Gun) and Watson (For Emily at her best see virtually anything else she's been in: Gosford Park and Cradle Will Rock especially).  It's worth a rent if for nothing else to see the juxtaposition of brilliance and idiocy.  If you liked David Lynch's Dune for its drastic good and bad you might also be able to enjoy Equilibrium.  The plot is beyond transparent, not even slightly an excuse for filler between action sequences- perhaps because they weren't intended to be?  I really can't tell.  There's an exhaustingly overtold 1984/Brave New World message at work here, but the writing moves beyond (or below) even being trite.  Not quite comic book either.  It's like an infomercial that tries to get 'deep' and doesn't make the audience laugh so much as stand back and be completely baffled by the guy in the bright red suspenders who seems to sincerely, even passionately, believe that this product is going to 'revolutionize your life!'

It really is just a bit to close to be called original. But that is just the start, as others have pointed out, there are influences from most of the SciFi films in this one - only not done so well.The biggest mistake was the casting of the lead rebel - the face is too well known to be put into a crowd and not be noticed. They should have cast an unknown.

410,sikobabel,I'd buy it gladly.,8,1 August 2003,"I don't get it.  I really just don't get it.  How does a movie this well-made slip under the public radar?  It certainly isn't a perfect film, but it is definitely well made.  I don't know what the budget was, but the results look like $100 million.Besides being good looking, it has good acting.  Christian Bale carries a film that requires him to run the full spectrum of human emotions.  The remaining actors also dive into their roles with reckless abandon.  No complaints at all in that department.The story is a bit refreshing.  It's not completely original, but it makes an admirable effort to avoid being too cliche.  It's a new spin on the old ""mankind sacrifices art for peace"" kind of film.  In this film, it's not big bad machines or scary 'big brother' that make up the oppression.  It's a drug.  In the world created for this film, sobriety is a crime.  The world is on dope that kills their ability to appreciate art in any way.  The sober people are like stoners, high on their own feelings.  It's a great way of demonstrating that being extreme in drug policy in either direction is a bad thing.  Banning drugs is as bad as banning sobriety.  A great message.The real star of this film though is the gun-fights.  I've never seen anything quite like this film before.  Seeing how this was done only confirms that the Wachowski brothers really did drop the ball with the second Matrix movie.  Equilibrium introduces a fighting style called 'Gun-kata'.  It's gun-fighting that makes the gun an extension of the fighter.  Instead of ducking and shooting, it makes use of calculated positioning and quickly disposes multiple opponents.  It's a complete thrill to watch.Like I said though, it isn't a perfect film.  Some of the twists in the plot felt a bit cheap.  The events in the third act have similar plot problems to the end of Vanilla Sky.  Good plot twists tease the viewer, giving them at least a chance to see them coming.  Bad plot twists are like shooting someone in the back, and this film is guilty of a little of that. 
With a better third act, this film would easily surpass the original Matrix movie.  As is, I call it a draw.  Go see this film immediately.  I just rented it, but I'm buying it as soon as I can.",Equilibrium

414,SteveHevetS,Thought provoking and terribly flawed at the same time,7,27 December 2005,"The central premise of this film is that the negative consequences of human emotion outweigh the positive consequences. In the futuristic setting, people inject a drug, 'prozium', which is supposed to annihilate emotion. Christian Bale plays the part of John Preston, a cleric in a somewhat paradoxical situation: he is charged with ensuring people do not indulge in illegal 'sense-crimes', which he does by sensing that others are sensing. Now, does that make sense?I had some difficulty getting around this paradox so as to engage in the film, and unfortunately it reflected a pervasive problem. If people do not feel anything, if they are genuinely emotionally dead, then why would they do anything at all? Why even move if you do not feel the desire to eat, drink, interact with another human being? There is no reason. The Latin root of the word 'emotion' is emovere - to displace and so cause to move. Equilibrium would be fitting, except the equilibrium without emotion is most likely a complete lack of any movement in the absence of any motivating drives.Despite this fundamental problem, I could not seem to dislike the film. It was thought-provoking and Christian Bale gives a very engaging performance in my view. Actually, the simple fact that it made me actually think about what I found so implausible was possibly its greatest saving grace. I only wish the creators of Equilibrium had developed the main premise a little further. If prozium made humans incapable of experiencing passion - heady emotions - but allowed them to feel enough that they could engage in the actions and human expression necessary to the storyline, I believe the film could have been really good. In order to watch it, I pretty much substituted this premise anyhow, and on that basis I quite enjoyed it. If this were the intended premise, however, this was not at all clear to me. Worse that that, though, if it were the intended premise, an element of the storyline betrayed that premise. Without going into any detail, the element has to do with exploitation of certain characters by others.I doubt my comments will be popular given the high ""average"" rating of this film (it's not really an average because the ratings aren't measurements but I won't get into that ...). I'm afraid that's tough, though. When a film has serious flaws, it has serious flaws.There were many other more trivial problems, not the least of which were the many Matrix-style action sequences reaching a level of incredulity that was, well, hard to believe. These I found humorous more than anything. Yet, I must admit that I still managed to get something out of the film. At the end of the day, it was thought-provoking, and so despite many flaws, it was worth watching. If only, though ...",Equilibrium

Yes it's 60% ""Fahrenheit 451"" 25% ""Imposter"" and 15% ""The Matrix"". Not a completely original story, sure, but that didn't make it even 1% less entertaining. Something about this movie kept me engrossed from start to finish. The basic plot wasn't original, but the details were new. And there were just enough twists and turns to keep it from being predictable but not get silly. Christian Bale was excellent and could easily have played Neo in the Matrix trilogy. The son was very well played by Matthew Harbour and the character was very eerie. Angus Macfadyen and Emily Watson did some nice work too. The fight work and choreography were well done and the cinematography was quite decent given the apparent budget. Like the shot of Mary in the turbine room, looking out at John.

419,cdtressler,"I didn't ""feel"" either way about this one.",5,12 September 2003,"I have to say, I was a little pretentious going into this, to say the least, out of my love for the book 1984, and the fact that this movie is pretty much that with an added dash of the Matrix. The basic premise for the newbies is that in a society of tomorrow, where all forms of emotion are illegal, the highest ranking officer of the top line in ""emotion enforcement"" starts to ""feel"" I guess you could say, and joins with the resistance force to try and bring down this totalitarian nightmare of a society. Now in actuality, this society is less Orwellian and more the perfunctory concoction of an obsessive NIN fan with a bad heroin withdrawal *no offense to NIN fans, I bear you no ill will as I'm one myself* Now I'm not going to get into the specifics of just how much of a monumental failure the way the movie makers set up the society's cog-work from both an anthropological and sociological point of view. But with a concept as all-encompassing as this one, they sure do an awfully poor job of conveying any sort of believability in the script, the acting and the overall work itself. But when I start nit-picking a movie's logical meanderings, then it's usually not a good sign of my opinion of the work in it's entirety.Then there's gun-kata, the movie's own special martial arts discipline with guns as the weapon. Now I'd like to take this own section to express that I was actually offended by the use of martial arts and gunplay together. These two things do not work when combined and is absurd to say the least, or is that just me? Needless to say, and completely off topic, I think that conflict is what compels me to see The Last Samurai.But all my pessimism aside, the movie is not without redeeming qualities. The visuals and cinematography is very effective in conveying the setting, but I think they could benefit from a longer run in the conceptual art department, and under the direction of somebody who knows a little about anthropology.My final word on this is, flawed but at least worth watching for genre fans, it's no 1984, but I think it's the closest thing this generation's seen.

The editing had very minor flaws though, but the acting was superb, especially Christian Bale.Equilibrium is basically a drama genre film with high octane (gun)fight sequences that have been compared to the Matrix, and even reviewed as a Matrix copy because of the action sequences. Let me make this clear that the Matrix(1999) copied fight choreography from Twin Warriors(1993) starring Jet Li - not surprisingly so as they both had fight choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen involved. Therefore I consider Equilibrium to be an evolution of film making. Kurt Wimmer was also aware of the comparisons when making this film.The premise is a world in the near future, where emotion, especially negative ones have been outlawed and policed. The ""Clerks"" are a highly trained policing team who have become masters in Gun-Kata, a form of calculating maximum gun-fire killings, whilst protecting oneself - and very impressive too. I'll let you see the film, rather than delve to far into the plot, but remember, the film does build up to the high octane action rather than jump straight in.",Equilibrium
423,Phlegyas,Satisfied. To a degree.,7,15 March 2003,"I am purely negative when it comes to Christian Bale and I consider him purely untalented. To be honest i only got to know him in American Psycho, a movie where I felt like he was copying Cruise as good as he could. Watching some other movies, I can say poot Christian can not act. He has one character, his alter ego perhaps, which he brings in each movie he's asked to play in. About the movie? Well imagine that. Bale in fact fits in his role and delivers exactly what he's asked to deliver. I will not discuss whether this is because he finally learnt how to act or if it is because the role itself asked for what he can only do (which is what I personally believe anyhow) but still, he really does exceed anyone's expectations.(spoiler) Taye once more plays the macho character who (SPOILER) will fall as in the case of the way of the gun. (/spoiler end) All in all the movie does not base itself on the performances of the actors although as i already said, Bale does deliver exactly what is expected from him, if not more. (minor spoiler) Bean? Well as in all his other movies...(/spoiler end) Characters? Well they dont really build up in front of you although Preston's character (Bale) is given a certain depth and an attempt is made to relate the viewer's with him. Didnt work with me but it's certainly there.The movie has a smoothly fitting soundtrack to go with the action, some great action scenes which really give another meaning to the word action, fast pace, intense moves, and a very few meanings underneath the glossy hollywood feel perhaps. (spoiler) the last fighting scene in the movie will certainly be remembered as one of the most original as (SPOILER) instead of having people shooting each other -matrix- or what was even worse, shooting each other from an arm's distance -art of war- here, most effort is made to avoid being shot rather than shooting the opponent.(/spoiler end)I gave this movie a rating of 7. I just watched it last night though and tonight I am going to watch it once more. Perhaps the second time will make me reconsider and come change a thing or two. But probably not. The movie manages beautifully to avoid the cult and the following of the matrix while still incorporating many ideas and techniques from it.
At the end of the day, you will come back and think about the movie, perhaps not because of the drama but certainly because you will find something therein to trigger your interest. (7/10)",Equilibrium

I would have to be blind and deaf not to see the similarities. The idea of a ""deluded"" population living under a semi fascist regime that is supposed to bring peace and harmony is in no way new or original, but it was done in an interesting way and people who have never seen the movies I mentioned earlier or read the books might find it quite interesting.The thing that bothers me the most is a the constant comparison with The Matrix. Yes there are some similarities here, especially the action scenes, but they are more believable in E. if you ask me, not that any action scene nowadays is totally believable when you think about it. One of my favorite things in Equilibrium are the subtle effects. No really big explosions, no hanging in the air, THERE IS A PLOT, such as it is and it is NOT spoiled by special effects and the action scenes just enhance it. As far as the story goes, The matrix also borrowed ideas and themes from the same movies and books as Equilibrium did, it just does it in a different way, (they both took the idea of a ""special"" society and a guy in the middle of it, realizing his world is not what he always thought it was and then fighting against it) and since the original part or The matrix idea was not in any way included in Equilibrium, we can easily conclude that as far as the story goes it could not borrow form The matrix (even if it did, and heavily so, from the older movies and books) Just pretend U never saw The Matrix and enjoy. There are other similarities like the light for example or maybe even the costumes, but if you think about what would you have them wear? Futuristic silver outfits??? Sadly there is the issue of predictability. If you have a twisted society under a dictator (in this case The Father) how could the plot not involve underground rebellion? :) There are many holes here of course. The plot doesn't always hold, the thing that bothered (possible SPOILERS) me the most was that the people were supposed to have no feelings, but Brandt (one of the clerics) clearly hates Preston and it that's not an emotion then I don't know what is : ). The idea of gun kata is well ... somebody said stupid and maybe that is a good word for it.

Equilibrium was OK , it wasn't a movie that will change a lot, its not inspirational, I mean for a movie it was entertaining but there was too much reminder of the matrix and in certain scenes I could see Bale doing Neo0like swishes with his head and it was very annoying.I kept seeing scenes that reminded me of the matrix.EX: The Fight Between Diggs and Bale greatly resembled the brawl between Morpheus and Neo.The gun action was very much like Neo Fighting the Agents except with guns in the hand.In itself its not very grabbing also the fighting scenes were very choreograph visible and you could tell it was acting.There were many other things I saw wrong, I was happy at the way Chrisitan Bale acted but he resembled too much Matrix's Neo oh and sorry (last thing) the casting was terrible, the parts of Taye Diggs and the Head of the underground looked terribly out of place with the movie and ""Father"" is pasty looking and overall unpleasant.I can't believe Roeper and Ebert gave it a two thumbs up and I find it hilarious that on the cover it said,"" Forget the Matrix"" which is the only reason I watched it; because I heard it compared to the Matrix but the matrix wins by too far.Oh and for those who don't like The Matrix, it's just because you don't understand it, read the script, it'll help.",Equilibrium
435,Maxio,A must see!,8,10 July 2005,"With only a relative small budget a movie was made with the same haunting atmosphere as the Matrix. Exclusive for the film they created a new martial arts style called Gunkata. It looks really effective, even though it's only a martial arts that exists in the minds of the creators of the movie. Because of the low budget they had to find simple solutions for otherwise big money consuming scenes, but mainly because of this the movie got more charm and is at moment more original then most big budget Hollywood productions.All I can add is that you need to see the movie if you want a good story, good acting, cool fighting moves and just to let the big Hollywoon guys know that a lot of money doesn't always make good movies. Good movies thrive on other things, like as seen in this movie.",Equilibrium
436,SoaringMoon,Amazing Despite Its Flaws,10,6 November 2020,"I first watched this movie from a movie channel at Lemon House in 2005. I always remembered the name of the movie, but didn't watch it again until 2014 with friends to show them the movie. I now own it on DVD, and watch it occasionally for worldbuilding inspiration. Captivating unique story, which reminds me of other ""cautious future"" movies. The difference here is that am absolutely in love with the universe, and am sad to have seen it be a standalone movie.",Equilibrium
437,innatrance,Seriously......watch it!,10,10 July 2006,"If there are spoilers in this - it is very very minimal: This film is quite simply Excellent. It stands alone, incomparable to anything else because of it's uniqueness. True, various plot ideas have been borrowed and mixed up to create this film, but something new and fresh has sprung out of that, just as a new dish comes from a fresh combination of often used ingredients. Having watched it at least 6 times over the last few years, (plus other bits and pieces here and there), i have had great interest to look into why I feel so strongly about it. Some of my friends think it's 'quite good' or 'yeah, not bad', and it seems a certain appreciative mentality is necessary to see deeper into the film. Particularly, the more spiritually inclined, the more the film will affect the watcher. Quite simply, in this human world, the majority of mankind is asleep to their own nature. The film deeply focuses on this fact but in an indirect and alternative way. As Christian Bale (absolutely perfect in the role!), through a series of destined events, comes to realise he has been turning a blind eye to an inherent part of his own nature, in this case emotions - the ability to 'feel' -he embarks upon a crusade to free the rest of humanity, realising it has trapped itself within it's own self-ignorance, which has culminated in a sort of Big Brother regime.On the deepest level it comes down to Awareness. Christian Bale's character becomes more and more aware. Aware of what was always there staring him in the face....and as always his acting and also the directing, the set design and the splendidly chosen music harmonise together to bring to life what really is a deeply important spiritual message. One about standing forth in our own light and as a warrior conquering the darkness of ignorance.But there's more! Indeed dear Mr Bale does stand forth as a warrior fighting for truth - oh yes, it is kick ass sci-fi kung-fu action with a difference! - again, something beautifully unique!......but you have to watch to see it (and be prepared for the rewind and slow motion facility to be readily used!).So let's get this :1) A great soundtrack harmonising with the film 2) Superb choice of cast and superb acting across the board 3) Excellent plot with very good script 4) Excellent set design and art direction 5) Excellent directing 6) Absolutely superb martial arts action choreographyOne final comment is that it's the sort of film one should try to watch straight through, from start to finish, without interruptions - the film builds upon itself, like a pyramid, gradually to a final point, and it works with the consciousness of the viewer in that way. Due to the inherent potential depth of the story, it makes all the difference.",Equilibrium
438,MikeK-4,Interesting Orwellian Parody,8,7 October 2003,"I must admit that I was quite entertained and consider this film a very good film. 8/10It was an interesting mix of George Orwell and Whacofski Brothers.. bringing Matrix and the concept of 1984 in the new millenium. Nice action scenes which don't separate it from Matrix apart from the story line but poor costumes. Good acting and photography and pretty nice f/x.
I guess if I hadn't watched 1984 and Matrix I would considered the movie a master piece but at the moment it only acts as a decent approach to immitate its predecessors. I would gladly watch it again and I'm buying the DVD as it is worth it.I would say its a must see!!!",Equilibrium
439,Mylene-2,Surprisingly Good!,10,20 July 2005,"I watched this movie late one night on one of the Encore channels. Stayed up past my bedtime I did. Then I recorded it the next time it was on. Watched it two more times and then, AND THEN, bought the DVD and watched it a couple if not three more times. First, I rarely will watch a movie twice unless enough time has passed that I have forgotten how it ends. There are just too many movies out there and not enough time. But this movie deserved the time. I loved the fight scenes, loved the premise of the movie, loved the acting (and seeing Christian Bale shirtless). Emily Watson is an amazing actress. It's rare these days to see an action/SciFi with actual plot and dialog. How can I care about a movie if I don't care about the characters? Anyway, watch it. I've lent the movie to about 5 guys and they all liked it. One guy is into the Martial Arts and he thought the fight scenes were awesome (my word -- his word/s was/were ""the fight scenes were well choreographed"").Moral of the story is: watch it, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and I said ""Surprisingly Good"" because I had never heard of the movie and was expecting some B movie crap -- what can I say, I couldn't sleep.",Equilibrium
440,Jon-87,Law vs. Chaos,8,25 January 2005,"This movie contained a few problems, one of the more glaring of which was how emotional Taye Diggs' character was, despite his loyalty to the Sense Offender-crushing Clerics. Another part that made little sense was when Bale's character risked exposing himself to rescue a puppy. Animal lovers will totally ""get"" it though, I'm sure. Also, but this could just be me, I couldn't relate to the use of artwork and natural beauty as being depicted as emotionally evocative. My final difficulty was that Bale's character's transformation from toe-the-line cleric to outright revolutionary stretched my suspension of disbelief.People will try to say that this movie has a standard good vs. evil theme. I disagree. It's about absolute, tyrannical law vs. chaos; its also about safety vs. freedom, and about intellect vs. emotion. And here's where I have trouble with it. Equilibrium wants to convince me that tyranny, by definition, is evil, that freedom is more important than safety, and that intellect should not rule over emotion. (I would further assert that it wants me to believe that emotion has inherent value.) However, I do not believe any of those things with complete certainty, and spending a couple of hours with Christian Bale did not make up my mind. Thus, for me, when Bale's character wins, chaos breaks out in the city, and a revolution starts, it feels to me a bit tragic rather than how the movie wants me to feel, which is triumphant.All that negativity out of my way, I confess that I liked this movie very much. It made me think! Look at me talking about themes and what I believe personally about the movie's stance on those themes. How often do you watch a movie and find yourself thinking about its deeper meanings, its message, the next day? I hear the action in the movie is called, ""Gun Fu"". How apropos! The choreography for the fight scenes is brilliant; I've never seen anything like it. I loved the dark costumes, the bleak sets, the whole look of the gloomy, sanitized city. I also liked how the movie didn't try to shove everything in the viewer's face; the tender caress of a red ribbon accomplishes as much emotionally as soldiers blasting the Mona Lisa with flamethrowers.Equilibrium straddles the line between standard Hollywood and daring Indie. Although, because of its costumes and action scenes, it will get mostly comparisons with Matrix, I also saw elements of THX-1138, and similarities to many stories in which the hero comes from the side that he learns is in the wrong, and so turns and battles against those for whom he once fought. Equilibrium takes chances with its occasional subtlety, its dreary look, and its reliance on thinking person's themes. If those are things you like, it's definitely worth watching.I give it an 8.",Equilibrium
441,speare,definite must see,10,11 September 2006,"Few action films have a truly innovative story line to propel the action forward. Equilibrium is such a film. The cautionary sci-fi tale will always hold a special place in my heart, and this is a perfect example of why. It basically epitomizes Benjamin Franklin's (I'm pretty sure it's franklin and i'm paraphrasing the h*ll out of it but anyway..)quote ""those men who would trade their freedom for a bit of security deserve neither."" This film made me take notice of Christian Bale as a potential up and coming action star and I saw it well before Batman Begins. He is both intelligent and brooding, believable and just down right cool. If nothing else, this movie reinvented the whole notion of how to do a final duel between hero and villain. See it for that if nothing else. It also goes towards supporting my theory that films which quote poetry (except Shakespeare, he's even quoted in an Anna Nicole Smith movie, the poor Bard) generally speaking (and remember i said generally!! )have some intelligent people behind the production. Angus Macfadyen, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean all did excellent jobs as supporting cast. If you like action, and are looking for a bit more than ""someone killed his whole family including his puppy and he's out for revenge"" starring Steven Segal or Jean Claude Van Damme, check this one out. And guys, even your Girlfriend who is not a big action fan may get something out of this. Not of course saying women can't like action films, but if she doesn't, you may be able to slip this one by her and end up with both of you happy.",Equilibrium
442,kaarvok,Impressive and surprisingly good science fiction.,10,15 August 2003,"Some said to me; ""forget the Matrix"" ... and I must agree. Not because The Matrix is a bad movie, on the contrary - The Matrix is great, but you cannot compare this movie to the Wachowski brothers´ masterpiece, don´t even try. They are completely different movies.Equilibrium depicts a dystopia, a brave new world, only made possible by a special emotion-suppressing designer drug called prozium. To maintain law and order the government uses warrior clerics, trained to use Gun-Kata, the perfect symbiosis of unarmed fighting techniques and futuristic firearms. These warrior monks are crusaders against all evil (emotions, art, music), and they rule with fire and steel, just as the crusaders in our real history.The use of Gun-Kata has added something new to the cinematic world, and the movie in itself is a masterpiece of well-directed action sequences, and cool and snappy lines, even though they don´t say much in the movie, the symbolism speaks for itself.While the movie suffers a bit from the low budget, both the acting crew and the directing/producing crew did an excellent job on this one. Extremely entertaining, very streetwise, relatively original, and it has both style and substance. Of course as with all science fiction you will need an open mind, and be sure to read between the lines.",Equilibrium
443,epyon-2,Ugh...another movie trying to be too stylish,2,4 June 2003,"Ever since the release of the Matrix there has been an over abundance of movies that have tried to be ""slick"" or ""stylish"" and I must say, it's rather disappointing that movies are straying from trying to be actual decent movies.People can complain all they want about not comparing this movie to the Matrix, but there is no way that people will not see comparisons, no matter how different the movies may be.My problem is that this movie doesn't try and create anything particularly new.  Jon Woo has better gun battles in all his movies (even the mediocre ones) than even the best gun fight in this movie.  It has yet another character discovering what his ""fate"" is.  No offense, but this has been done to death, and Equilibrium doesn't even try and put a new twist on it.I was less than impressed with the action sequences, especially the ""training"" fight between Bale and Diggs.  As sad as this is to say, Star Wars had better sword fights.As for the story, if I want to think about a controlled society I'll go read 1984 or Brave New World.  Those two books do a better job of dealing with the subject than just about any movie can do, or has done to date.",Equilibrium
444,muraliavarma,Worth watching...,6,17 November 2007,"At first, when the concept of removing ""Feeling"" was introduced, I was almost laughing at the idea. But I decided to watch the movie since I was such a big fan of Christian Bale (especially in Batman Begins and Prestige). He once again gives a great performance, transforming from villain to hero, one of the handful actors who can play both sides equally well.Another thing I did see was that a lot of people compared this movie to The Matrix. In my opinion, the action scenes in Equilibrium look really stylish but they are too made up. The enemies just stare at our superhero while he pumps lead into their bodies. But this was not the case in Matrix (and even if it was made up in the Matrix, I wouldn't have minded since it wasn't supposed to be in the real world!)So then, why did I even give it 6 stars? Mostly because of the style factor. The action scenes were well made (except for our IQ=0 masked morons). I also like the ending because, sometimes, war/rebellion is the solution! A war-less society where life has no meaning or purpose can't compare with the one that we have now.All in all, the mixture of fantastic action sequels and the clichéd idea of new world order was a risky yet innovative one. This one is worth watching.",Equilibrium
445,UETF-agent,Style and Substance,10,7 April 2005,"Although this movie is far from being perfect, after seeing it I immediately placed it in my top ten of best movies ever (which only contained two movies so far). Some people compared it to the matrix, which would be insulting for any movie considering the amount of garbage that is the matrix. The thing that came to my mind is how a movie will be considered 20 or 30 years after its release. In 30 years from now, while the matrix will either be forgotten or considered a gimmick B-movie I think Equilibrium will still stand as a Classic of both Science-Fiction and Action movie.This movie is a refreshing blend of the best of both world.It contains awesome adrenaline-pumping actions and at the same time a good illustration of a classic SF thematic, and also , it looks good. It's not perfect by any means; the acting is cheesy (in the future, being emotionless means having a stiff haircut and looking constipated),the middle part is a bit too verbose and there are some ENORMOUS plot-holes (especially this gun-switching plot with the other cleric, every way I turn it it doesn't make sense at all).The face splitting sequence is a bit inappropriate too, but none of these problems made me hate the movie. Apart for the ""helmet-breaking"" fight, the fighting scenes are excellent . Gunkata is a great invention and it's too bad we probably won't see it any other movies ( but making a sequel to equilibrium would be a sacrilege). As a martial art practitioner myself I appreciated the perfect mix between realism and aestheticism, I hated the stuff from ""crouching tiger.."" and ""kill bill"". Gunkata really looks deadly and , at the same time, fun. The best asset of Equilibrium is the aestheticism, the slick contrasts and the great sense of fashion. I generally hate movies who rely of wardrobe effects (*COUGH* the matrix *COUGH*) , but it was perfectly integrated in Equilibrium and I loved every part of it. It's like if they took the best of the manga clichés and removed all of the bad ones. But this movie doesn't rely on the ""wow"" effect and doesn't feature the syndical number of explosions that would probably have the Hollywood-maffia-critics label it as a good action movie. That's a good reason why you should own the DVD in the first place.Oh and the ending fight sequences (since the hero enters the enemy lair to the end) are the most awesome ending fight I've ever seen.I spent the last ten minutes literally jumping on my seat. :)",Equilibrium

Sadly for Equilibrium is was released at the same time as the first Matrix. On seeing the trailers everyone just thought spin-off.This is however anything but, id rate it above Neo's amazing kung fu styleings any day of the week.What makes this film so great tho thats the question. Its the perfection behind it. The general idea that between this and Wall-E its where mankind is heading to. Christian Bale outdoes himself in any film, totally brilliant actor tbf. This is his greatest works, deprived from all feeling and yet you feel for him.While watching this film you are taking on a ride of both action and emotion, the film mixes the 2 so very well. It also invents a new martial art styling for the modern day.I promise you from the very start of this film you will not regret watching it, i have owned it 5 times now in different formats and i cannot rate it highly enough.Trust me when i say watch it.",Equilibrium
447,phillwillkill,Very good on many levels,9,16 July 2008,"Put quite simply this is an excellent movie, which I enjoy with every viewing.First of all the action pieces are glorious, a real ballet of bullets- Think Matrix with guns, only better. But fantastic action aside, there is still plenty to appreciate about this movie.This movie really makes you think about what you would be willing to sacrifice in order to live in a peaceful, respecting society. When scientists discover that emotion is behind all of mans negative actions, they try and eradicate such thoughts with mind controlling drugs and banning any items that may invoke feelings or thoughts.This is not a new topic for films or books to ponder. However the way it is done in this film, where Preston- the standard bearer of control and duty, discovers what it is like to feel and discover emotions when he inadvertently breaks his drugs capsule, and has to decide where his loyalties should lie and start making all his own decisions, well it is really is an emotionally charged journey, and you feel for him the whole way.Christian Bale has amassed a catalogue of good films and is excellent in the lead role portraying a man torn between rules and order and the price you must pay the state run government for this luxury. And any movie with Sean Bean in (Sharpie!) always gets my vote.Seriously, is it alright to give up emotions if it means the end of war, murder, rape etc? Well without emotions how would we even know we were alive, what would be the point? Watch this film, enjoy it and then have a think about that. I always do.",Equilibrium
448,kane4782,good stuff,8,19 March 2003,"I went to see this film without knowing anything about it, except that my mate said he wanted to see it. I hadnt even seen the trailer, which is rare, as I always want to know about a film before seeing it. Well I was pleasantly surprised, it was not about plot, just action, which was what I was in the mood for.Christian Bale did a great job with his role as John Preston, even though his character wasnt far off from Patrick Bateman. The other actors did as well as they could, however I must admit the film was a little bit patchy.
The idea is too farfetched to be considered a 'real' possibility, for example people would not be allowed to have sex or relationships, because feeling is what its all about. What would be the point of having a wife as John Preston did, seeing as you could always have test tube babies if wanted. The setting/scenery was pretty good for such a low budget effects film, furthermore the gun kata was well developed and explained... although when you actually see it, u just sit in awe at how cool it is.
One last thought about this film, was the way that John Preston was made to be invicible, which somewhat defeats the point of the progression in the film. Nevertheless, if you want a decent film that will 'blow you away' for a couple of hours, then go see it!",Equilibrium
449,nfmadprops04,"Makes the Matrix seem like the ""stupid kid"" in class.",9,10 December 2002,"This movie, which was definitely a blend of the novels 1984 and Brave New World, was fabulous! It finally made good with extremely intelligent action heros, i.e. John Preston. Although the climax was a little short, it was altogether worth the $5.50 I paid for it.I have to truly give props to the fact that a lot of the movie focuses on philosophy. It will often be compared to the Matrix, but that film had very little THOUGHT to it, and was really just a cool mindscrew with computers. These characters are more than hardbodies who can have information programmed into them - they are trained it. They know how to kill from paying attention in geometry class. The film also looked really cool, what with the buildings, and the symbolism of good vs. evil (all black outfits, all white cars, etc.)",Equilibrium

451,stabo,Equilibrium  A true sci-fi experience!,9,22 August 2004,"*minor spoilers*While I can't safely say that Equilibrium brings anything resoundingly unique to the genre, one thing is for sure, it does just about everything right. This movie seems to always be compared with the Matrix. What I will say about this comparison is that Equilibrium succeeds in two areas The Matrix (and especially its sequels) failed. The first being the acting, Christian Bale proves he has a natural acting ability that doesn't need to be forced. The supporting performances from Emily Watson and Sean Bean especially are 1st rate. The second is that this film conjures up more of an emotional reaction. When Trinity and even neo died at the end of revolutions I found myself not really caring and many other people I have talked to experienced the same thing. Bale however takes his character Preston on a ride and you're with him every step of the way. Feeling everything he is, and fighting the same conflicting emotions.As for the sci-fi aspect of the movie, it has it all. The background story based on the themes of the book 1984 definitely works. The characterizations and the plot twists for the most part keep predictability at bay. The action sequences are actually very clever and ones appreciation for them will grow on subsequent viewings. It has some really powerful scenes (the one with the dogs comes to mind) accompanied by an extremely emotionally charged theme.Probably the greatest compliment I can give to this film is that it is a true ambassador for its genre. It has everything to keep Sci-Fi fans happy but it also posses an element of prestige (probably because of the British/Euro feel rather than American). All of which make it a good film to show to people who are dismissive of Sci-Fi.I'm sorry this film didn't get the exposure it deserved;
I rate it a 9/10.",Equilibrium

Don't believe some of the negative comments you see in this review. Just go watch it and decide for yourself....and NEVER compare it to the Matrix....they are in 2 different worlds (literally). This movie has a better premise and storyline than the Matrix. At least this one deals with human emotion, its repercussions and what they think they should do about it. While the other one suggest that you and I are controlled by some damn computer (hello?) Think of it this way...a lot of science fiction stuff becomes true in the future....which do you think is more plausible?  I rest my case...",Equilibrium
453,theratbastard,What movies should be,10,23 April 2003,"Well I downloaded this movie, it was not playing anywhere near me.  I had read reviews, seen blurbs... and basically expected the world of it.  My expectations were met and surpassed.  Bale is an actor who can pull of being a bad ass (umm matrix - reeves... hell no).  This movie was not about kicking ass and special effects, it has a plot and acting.  I know this seems like a new concept, but honestly its not... its just that no one makes good movies anymore in my opinion.  I have resorted to foreign cinema to fill the gaps that american cinema leaves.  Those are large gaps, and I am running out of good asian films as well.Equilibrium follows one man's journey from a drugged robot, to a feeling caring, revenge delivering human.  This is not a fast paced movie... it's one that feels longer than it actually is; but you do enjoy the film.  I have shown this film to 7 people since I downloaded it, all intelligent movie watchers (or so I think).  Everyone enjoyed it, and they were not all 18-25 and males.  The acting is good, the plot is good, the cinematography is good, and yes so are the effects.Equilibrium is a plot movie in disguise.  It has action, but the main character is so skilled at what he does that none of the fight scenes last very long.  All fights are believable on a very basic, ""hey if someone trained me to be a badass I might be able to do that"".  Nothing like Matrix or other movies where the fights exist only in film, and never something anyone could ever pull off no matter their skill.  This gives Equilibrium a sort of accreditation that is felt more as a ""YEH BABY! in fights than a ""ohhh no way!""I like this movie, I will be buying the DVD as soon as it becomes available... and I suggest you do the same.  Few recent films can compare to this, and damn it... not enough good sci-fi films come out, so support the good ones.  If you buy the DVD I promise you that you will rewind the action scenes and watch them repeatedly.  More importantly though the thing that will stick with you is the plot, the message, and the scope of the production.",Equilibrium
454,rbap,Underrated,8,6 March 2011,"First off, let me say that until I saw Equilibrium, I'd never even heard of it. As is often the case, a mix of reviews and trailers convinced me to give it a go. I wanted to watch something interesting, not too heavy, and with good performances. Simply put, the story, the action, and Christian Bale all delivered.The gist of it is that humanity is too emotional for its own good and the only way to keep it from destroying itself is for humans to forgo emotions. Christian Bale is at the higher echelons of the enforcement hierarchy and he hunts and kills all who are guilty of 'sense crime' (ie. displaying emotion). You'll have to watch the film to see how he starts coming around and begins fighting for ""the resistance"", but it's definitely a Conflicted Individual type storyline.There is lots one can pick on with this film; it has a small-budget feel in its setting and CGI and the dystopian theme is somewhat redundant. Yet I found myself making comparisons to Harrison Bergeron, tense at the right moments, and thoroughly enjoying it from start to finish.The action scenes are crisp and perfectly choreographed, this is probably where the Matrix comparisons come in, but it's really not a different version of the Matrix at all. The theme is not technology, it's humanity. This is where I wish there had been a stronger character on the side of the resistance, to maybe show the contrast between the emotionless automatons and real, feeling, people, but again this is about the conflicted individual, so all the other characters do feel very secondary.All in all, good movie; it's simplistic, but it's not junk and it's entertaining too. If you're torn just watch it, you'll end up liking it.",Equilibrium
455,Steal-No-Evol,Better than the MATRIX,10,3 June 2003,"Christian Bale does in one movie what Keanu Reeves wishes he was smart enough to do in one movie....but never mind, Matrix wishes to be Star Wars. Anyway, a stand-on-its-own-two-feet movie is Equilibrium, and I'm really disappointed I never caught this one on the big screen.  Gun battles are so over-the-top amazing they just make you laugh at how bad-ass the whole thing is.  Maybe if everyone could control their emotion in opposition to logical thinking, the world would be a better place.  Four Stars!!",Equilibrium
456,Windtoker,A refreshing alternative to 'The Matrix',8,11 February 2004,"If you liked the action and fight scenes in 'The Matrix' you will appreciate them in 'Equilibrium'.I was left feeling hollow after watching the tertiary incarnation of 'The Matrix' films. The endless ""This happens because it happens."" roads seemed more than a little tedious after a while. I felt the film began to be a stereotype of itself.'Equilibrium' was certainly a refreshing change. A futuristic film, with a solid plot, that didn't try too hard (as I felt 'The Matrix' did towards the end.) There were good performances all round, but I felt Christian Bale was much more than that. He made you believe, without compromise, that he was awakening to a whole new world of soul baptising emotions. You actually felt for him, as he felt emotions like compassion, remorse and guilt for the first time. At one point I was thinking ""It's only a Dog for Gods sake!"", but for John Preston (Bale) it must have been heart wrenching.
I was especially impressed with the scene when he stepped out of the incinerator after Mary (Emily Watson) was 'processed'. He would have had to act like he was emotionless to get out of the building, and at first it did appear that way. But you could see in his eyes that he was grieving for her, like he couldn't accept what he had just seen. This, coupled with the realisation that he was responsible for his own wife's demise, provides excellent material for Preston to align with the resistance, and fight the machine.There are some elements of the farcical, but if you are able to over look them you will not regret renting this.Surprisingly good - 8/10",Equilibrium
457,amelbourne95-43-3421,An Underrated Artistic Dystopian Masterpiece,10,18 January 2013,"An underrated piece of art, this bleak future where emotions are forbidden has an ironic emotional core to it. It doesn't surround itself with blatant copies of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, in fact, what many people would assume are carbon copies I would prefer to call references, harking back to other dystopian films while also being a standalone film in its own right. Equilibrium treats the matter with mild stoicism, foreshadowing particular events in a neat way that manages to explode in a thrilling yet thoughtful way. The ignorance of many critics that assumed the worst, didn't seem to see the whole picture. None of this was about the fact that censorship exists or that you could be executed for certain crimes. The whole idea of the film was to make you see how people behaved through lack of emotion, with the failure to see that emotion is what makes us human. Rather than take a purely political motive, it manages to incorporate perhaps a majorly ethical motive.The action that is contained in this film is not just for showing off. The stylistic features render the action scenes mind-blowing, but no less helping to drive the core theme of the story - besides, the main character is a cleric, trained in the art of Gun Kata (a thrilling name for a sadly non-existent masterpiece of fighting style) who manages to put a chink in Libria's armour as we see through his perspective by realising he can use this weapon against the system that attempts and fails to betray him as someone who is 'feeling'.When I first regarded this film, I became fascinated about how, amongst the close-ups and wider shots, the main character seems to obviously show some kind of emotion without the intrusion of the system demanding why on earth he hasn't been arrested for his crimes. This ultimately came to the climax, whereby the foreshadowing managed to sneak its way in at the beginning. The fact that Christian Bale was chosen for this role makes me wonder why some people didn't think this was good, considering how deft he was in executing the action, the visual non- speaking scenes and the dialogue.To the amazing use of irony, a number of heart-rending scenes kept up the core theme, and the stylistic use of camera focus on Christian Bale emphasised the distress that we could feel he was going through, one being his flinching when we don't see the dogs being shot, but we can feel it by way of his reaction. However, I thought one of the most chilling scenes was during a raid of someone's apartment, with fires burning and people spattered with blood, was the simplicity of a dying man running into the main character, known as John Preston, bleeding, desperation and hope glittering in his eyes as he slides down, leaving Preston aghast and completely horrified, reflecting the man's pain. The expression on his face could not have been possibly matched, Christian Bale just executed that so perfectly that I could feel myself choking up and stopping dead.So this film, by none the way anything completely copied from other films, is a masterpiece in its own right. By way of insulting the stylistic features to convey emotion and provide thrilling action that shaped the film, the amazingly well-acted characters that were to no end incredibly fascinating, the amazingly clever storyline, you are refusing to take it to the light of some of the world's greatest films and distastefully making the biggest mistake of throwing it away. Like the scene in the film, whereby Preston awakes from a nightmare with shock and overwhelming emotion, tears away the fabric from the window to reveal glimmering light on the horizon and a rainbow glowing in the rain, it strips away the layers as the film goes on, lulling you into a false sense of security, but instead just brings you surprises exploding onto the scene, leaving you brimming with hope at the end. Look out for the poignant reference of Yeats.So, despite it being compared to other dystopian films, this is more terrifyingly realistic, with its future being more like a parallel world with its own parable instead.",Equilibrium

The plot seemed odd to me because a civilization is being forced to take a drug called ""Prozium"" that blocks the human senses. But what I liked about the movie was the action scenes. These ""Claricks"" who have been taught how to fight extremely well to go out and search for people who have not been taking their medication(Sense offending). That seems bizarre to me, but there is a good point. There is no war, or crime. This movie I would definitely recommend to the person who likes action, and drama. In my opinion it is good enough to see this movie again, because of the great action scenes and the movie itself.",Equilibrium

The Story has nothing to do with the Matrix. The only parallels are that in Equilibrium there are also ShootOuts, but that's it.Bales' Performance is better in an emotional way, because we follow him throughout the movie and see him becoming another man than before (i don't want to spoil to much). That is the main Point of this Movie.while the Matrix focuses more on the world around. Of course we follow Neo (Reeves) but in the Matrix the change of the world and how Neo looks at it is more important.Just want to say, that the Matrix' Plot is quite more interesting but Equilibriums' Plot is much more emotional. Still that doesn't mean Equilibriums' Plot is weak, it's good and well developed!Still both movies have great ShootOuts and Action in it. Both are great!Equilibrium delivers itself as an ActionPacked, extremely cool but also emotional and well acted movie, which is fun to watch.8/10",Equilibrium
460,Karri_Koivusalo,Valium-flavored Orwell-Bradbury-Huxley milkshake,1,5 October 2005,"This movie excels at what the bad guys in it fail: to kill all emotion.Though the premise is a cut and paste job of 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and the Brave new world, the viewer never needs to analyze the philosophy of the other side as it it's fallacy is emphasized from the very beginning with the pretentious prologue and throughout the movie; the central issues of the lifted stories are replaced by an alien, dis-believable and very artificial ideal of a nation controlled by an involuntary prescribed psyche drug Prozium, and later comes to conclusion that the idea is just as terrible as it sounds. The book '1984' (from which the movie directly lifts several central elements and scenes) deconstructed socialism, which was a widely accepted ideal in the post-war Europe of 1949, as another path to totalitarianism not unlike fascism (Orwell himself was a disillusioned socialist.)Then there is the central character who can manage everything thrown at him, without ever resorting to anything but the (rather silly) Gun-kata.I don't go chewing on the Tetragrammaton wheel, it was unintentionally Nazi swastika like. The irony between the name and the appearance of the symbol is delicious, I must give that much. Oh, and ""Tetragrammaton"" means ""Four letter word"". I like that.The casting, on the other hand, was very good. Sean Bean's character was great, and you had to like Bale's performance too.Unfortunately, the ending was another disappointment. Instead of gripping and emotionally stirring, the movie opted for meaningless Hollywood template solution.Perhaps the movie was a satire of psyche drugs getting more and more commonplace and of the double standards of the ruling class (the ""Father's"" office was full of artwork and there were statues in the Tetragrammaton HQ), but as such it was quite ineffective.I disliked the movie, not because the story was bad, but because the story lacked emotional attachment, the most interesting character was killed in the first 30 minutes, and frankly, '1984' with guns makes a terrible mix. I gave it 4/10 for some visual pleasure.",Equilibrium
461,leeleechick,"Without Emotion, There is NO Acting for a Movie",4,3 August 2015,"Christian Bale is awesome as usual and did his BEST in this Matrix-wannabe like movie. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have kept watching. Unfortunately, watching this movie continuously contradict its key plot element of a no emotion society, made it difficult to watch. Often times laughable. Think about it. How can there be acting WITHOUT emotion? With NO acting, there is NO movie! Who wants to watch apathy for almost 2 hours? Also the core of the movie shows a society that eliminates any hint of emotion to avoid war, but yet they legalize murder on so many groups of people?! People who *GASP* own art, music and culture or anything that causes emotion. Really? LOL? Corny much?At the end when Taye Diggs tried to expose Bale's character, he showed EMOTION *gasp!* I think in the beginning of the movie, Bale was the ONLY one who achieved stoicism that this movie was going for. If it wasn't for Bale, I would give this movie like a 3/10 for its silly plot.",Equilibrium
462,stoneage22,"Good action, good premise",10,2 July 2009,"I don't know why so many critics did not like this movie. It's futuristic/oppressive society at its best. The Gramaton clerics technique of avoiding gunfire is pretty original, and well choreographed. I personally prefer laser guns in futuristic movies, but in this case, the weapons they had fit well. Also original was the partner, played by Sean Bean. In most sci-fi, it's the woman who instinctively feels the high tech, totalitarian society is wrong. It's the woman who initiates the fight against the villains, or inspires the hero to fight back. For instance Jessica-6 in Logan's Run, Princess Leia in Star Wars, the girl (whose name I forget)played by Julie Christie in Fahrenheit 451... However, here's it's a man, his partner. Seeing tough guy Sean Bean, quietly reading poetry in a burned out building is an image I remembered years after first seeing Equilibrium. The overall notion of controlling a population with drugs has been discussed before, but it's just as poignant now. This may be the first generation to give children drugs so freely. If the kid is too hyper give him ritalin. If the kid's to morose and sedate, give her prozac. It won't be too long before the world that Equilibrium foreshadows becomes reality. Ray Bradbury once said; the purpose of science fiction stories is not to predict the future. If anything, it's meant to prevent it! Seeing Equilibrium again recently, I enjoyed it all over again. Some might complain of the bland visual quality, but of course, this is all done on purpose. All the women having their hair close cropped or tied up tight, the gray and black uniforms all the citizens wear is designed to crush any sense of individuality they may have. The intensity of Christian Bale's expressions, and the great Emily Watson help make these characters seem like people, not like robots. All in all an excellent futuristic action picture. I recommend it to everyone.",Equilibrium
463,pikabot,"I'm sorry, but I cannot condone this level of theft",1,18 March 2006,"There is a grand total of nothing original in the plot or setting of this movie.Zip.Nada.Zero.The movie was stolen wholesale from far superior dystopian works, namely 1984, Brave New World, Farenheight 451 and Terry Gilliam's surreal masterpiece Brazil. Toughtcrime becomes Sensecrime, but the oh-so-subtle relabeling can't hide the fact that Kurt WImmer is a plagiarizer.I recognize that almost all stories are derivative in some way, but there's a difference between that and outright theft. And this falls into the second category.And what little isn't stolen outright is horribly cliché-riddled. Cleric Preston, discovering emotion, finds the hidden art chamber inside a sense offender's house. He looks through it and...oh listen....BEETHOVEN. And a SNOWGLOBE. Wimmer, please.The acting is uninspired, and visually this movie is as stolen as the plot and setting. Set designs were taken pretty much directly from Brazil, and the movie version of 1984.Decent action could have made this watchable, but the much-lauded 'Gun Kata' is indecently boring the watch. Wimmer's ""special martial art"" is just Preston standing in one place, pointing his guns in random directions, and miraculously not getting shot. This is compounded by the silliness of the explanation Wimmer gives for how it works.Although not nearly as unwatchable as a lot of movies, there's really nothing here to enjoy that you can't get somewhere else. Somewhere better.",Equilibrium
464,Asch,A masterful blending of things we've seen...and a few we haven't,10,27 February 2003,"The best part about this movie - aside from the fighting style ""gun kata"" it introduces - is how well it blends multiple ideas we've seen before in so many other facets and makes them all part of one seamless whole.  There are elements of 'Brave New World' and 'Farenheit 451' to be sure, and while some would argue 'The Matrix,' others would argue '20 John Woo movies that came before that.'  Equilibrium takes the idea of our increasingly drug-reliant culture and multiplies it to an extreme.  It doesn't matter if this future is plausible, its that director/write Wimmer MAKES IT WORK.  He filters these other ideas through his own sensibilities and delivers a film with style AND substance.  Special mention has to be made for the editing of the fight sequences.  They are, without argument, some of the best action sequences ever committed to film.  They are excruciatingly fast-paced and exceedingly cleverly staged, especially since not one instance in them is ripped from any other movie. You can spot moments of inspiration perhaps, but nothing blatantly stolen.And that is how the entire movie plays.  The story is nothing we haven't seen before, but it is the execution of this story that makes it so compelling here.  Bale is once again in top form and Taye Diggs continues to command respect as an actor who makes the absolute most of every character he plays.  Watch it for the action sequences and you wont be disappointed.  You might even notice that the story is pretty cool too.",Equilibrium
465,Hound222,Judge for yourself,8,24 January 2003,"The biggest lesson I've learned from seeing this film is to judge films for myself, and not to listen to the critics.  If you look at the critics' reviews for this film, they're terrible!  The NY Times said it could ""only be stupider if it was longer."" But look at the viewer reviews.  8.0 from IMDB users at the time of this comment, and four stars from moviefone.com viewers.  I almost didn't see it because of the critical reviews, but my fellow moviegoers won me over. And I couldn't be more pleased.  This film is an intelligent synthesis of the ideas of autocracy and population control presented in such books as 1984, BraveNew World, and Farenheit 451.  It presents a dark view of the future, but grants enough light and hope in the story to carry an audience's attention. Admittedly, the romantic side story with Emily Watson is overwrought and practicallyunnecessary, but what movie doesn't have one or two flaws? Plus, the main selling point of this film is the action sequences. Christian Bale carries off the ""gun-kata"" synthesis of martial arts and gunplay with believability and a surprising grace for someone who, to my knowledge, really hasn't been a part of the action/martial arts genre at all to this point.  And the direction definitely polishes any weakness that  Bale (or Diggs for that matter), may show. It is a beautifully done, artistic action film, with fight scenes to rival the matrix. And it's all done without the ""flying"" (though wirework is undoubtedly used), so it's much more palatable in my mind than the fight scenes in the Matrix orCrouching Tiger. See this movie.

I think this movie could have been propelled further in terms of cohesive excellence (plot, character development, set/costume design, resolution, acting abilities, loopholes, etc.) if the action scenes had been trickier for the protagonist to overcome. I also think, while there was a push for the development of a bond between Preston and Mary O'Brien when they touch hands, there needed to be a little bit more to solidify their connection, physically or intellectually. Finally, I think this premise was interesting and unique within the genre of science fiction, but there were undoubtedly several holes in the plot (i.e. how was it that Preston was the first in his society to refuse or lose his daily dosage of Prozium?) which did not add up and needed to be re-examined.",Equilibrium
471,kaelnin-1,The Future Looks Bleak...,8,8 December 2002,"If the future is to be what Equilibrium projects it to be, I don't look forward to it. The portrayal of things to come in this film is so monotonous and bland that it makes me glad I live in a world like this than one like that. True, things may not be the greatest now, but I wouldn't want it to be like that, either... Equilibrium paints a portrait of a world without sensation, where everyone is virtually the same, and where emotion is supressed. Most inhabitants of this world take a drug called prozium to keep from experiencing any illegal emotions, and those who don't are called sense offenders and live outside the walls of a massive ""utopian"" city. The creator of this world, called Father (Sean Pertwee) is a dictator hidden behind a smile. His elite enforcers, the Grammaton Clerics, have mastered a technique of fighting called Gun Fu and are one man armies. The best of these is John Preston (Christian Bale), an elitist killing machine who can dispatch a roomful of men in the blink of an eye without one hint of emotion while doing it.But the movie is not really about violence, or its casual use in a world where violence was supposed to be suppressed by the use of drugs like Prozium (although you would never know it with all the secret police and soldiers running around). It is more a character study of what happens when, quite by accident, Preston stops taking Prozium and starts to experience an awakening of emotions he had never felt before. Yes, there are wildly entertaining firefights in this movie that will cause many to compare it to the Matrix, but it is more about his experiences with emotion and his realization of what a terrible existence he leads than how many bodies he can rack up by the end credits. Overall, I liked the movie, but I just wished the filmmakers would have made up their mind and stuck with either the development of his character as he experiences new things through his resurfaced emotions or the straight adreneline action of the gun fights, which are too far apart to give the film a steady pace. Those expecting the level of excitement the trailers provide may walk away disappointed (like so many people in the theater I saw it in did), but if you like your sci-fi thought provoking you just might enjoy this movie. I read a lot of reviews naming it one of 2002's best films. I would not go that far, but I wouldn't also dismiss it.

Sure, there are scenes throughout the movie that may look like they've been ripped/copied from others, but in the end, I think that this movie has it's own character. Besides, there's only so many different enviroments that can exist in movies and books that eventually there's going to be some similarities somewhere.
Besides that, some people like many movies in a similar nature. It's not like they would make one movie about a ship sinking, or aliens running around on Earth and so on and then never make a movie like that ever again.

What i found was much more different, it being a much better film than first appeared. The story seems corny and weak from reading the plot summary, but when it is in the film, it is executed very well. One thing that struck me was the outstanding score, by composer Klaus Badelt. It fitted the film perfectly, and some of it was very catchy, echoing Harry-Gregson Williams, and even the mighty Hans Zimmer himself.The fight scenes were what really stood out in the film. again, i expected to see 'Matrix-type' fights, but found that it was completely different. The fights are very well coreographed, and work very well in the context of the film, creating the perfect atmosphere for the film: we are impressed by the stylised action, but at the same time, when viewed through the eyes of the characters in the film, we are shocked by it, and it creates a motive throughout the film.Overall, a good film, better than recent 'matrix-type' action films ive seen, namely ROMEO MUST DIE and EXIT WOUNDS.

It starts off trying to be a serious movie which questions the society it pictures in. The whole first part of the movie is used to picture a man who's starting to see how wrong his actions are, even if they are by the law. During the break I kept on thinking how this story might go. But the second part was kind of a surpise, it just ended this 'might be' story and formed into a 'shoot the head and bring down the beast' scenario.Conclusion? The first part was about 45 minutes too long (the plot is easy, don't stretch it!) Just your average gun movie. The plot is far too simple and easy too seperate it from the mass. Easy role for Christian Bale by the way, I mean, show no emotions and when you do perform them like an five year old. Must have been a hard job doing so...I rate it 4.5 out of 10",Equilibrium
483,renickmarsh,Better than The Matrix,8,27 May 2009,"Great Sci-Fi movie. What the Matrix could've been, if the Matrix hadn't had such a disappointing ending. Equilibrium is an interesting tale about a futuristic oppressive society that has outlawed emotions and individuality in order to control their citizens and prevent possible violent behavior.The movie was obviously inspired by other Sci-Fi classics; such as Fahrenheit 451 and THX 1138, but it's not just blatant rip off. It borrows from other movies, adds it's own ideas and successfully creates a Science Fiction story that's both interesting and unique.I think the only thing I don't like about it, is the title; It's quite a mouthful. Try saying Equilibrium five times really fast.",Equilibrium
484,BluesManBDR529,Excellent movie: deep and thought provoking,10,17 July 2003,"I waited and waited for this movie to come out, then when it finally did, it didn't come anywhere near me.  So I had to wait for the DVD, but fortunately it was worth the wait.  This movie is very good.  It was unfairly lumped in with all of The Matrix clones that came out.  This movie is much deeper than The Matrix, and more thought provoking.  The Matrix shows us a future where mankind is ruled by machines.  We don't know that we are just part of a large computer program.  However in Equilibrium, mankind has had it's right to show emotion taken away.  Basically the government is forcing everyone to be identical.  What makes Equilibrium a stronger film is that we've seen situations like this before, such as Socialism, Communism, and Nazi-ism, and we know that it could happen again.  Communism tries to force everyone to be equal, but of course it will never work.  Nazi-ism tried to kill those who didn't agree with them, such as in Auschwitz.   Examples and consequences of this type of government and behavior are shown here.  Throughout the movie you can see how people still have emotion, although the government has tried to take it away.  The film shows us the negative effects of such practices, poses questions of right and wrong, and it is stronger for it.  If you found The Matrix to be nothing but effects heavy action posing as a deep movie, then watch Equilibrium.  The action is awesome and the plot is deep, and I can't recommend it enough.",Equilibrium
485,ms1720,this movie is worth watching,9,17 June 2003,"this movie could have been fantastic.  if there had been a bigger budget and about 20-30 more minutes in the movie to help explain things a little more thoroughly, and to add another big fight scene in the first hour.  as it stands, it's a pretty sweet movie and I'm not sure why it wasn't released in theatres.  I give it 8/10 stars and it's definitely not a matrix as the dvd cover at blockbuster says, but it's a bit different and almost equal for what it wants to accomplish.",Equilibrium
486,vincent-bullock,"Good fight scenes, terrible everything else.",3,3 February 2012,"This film has great fight scenes. They are tremendously original and very carefully executed. There are quite a few shots and scenes that are quite breath taking. I was genuinely impressed when Christian Bale ripped the plastic coat off his window to reveal a gorgeous sunset. It really managed to convey the otherwise indescribable welling of emotion he was going through.The plot is silly. There isn't much to say about it. It's the kind of idea you just suddenly get and then try and run with it until you realize it's not much to really work on, yet somehow somebody thought they could make a whole film out of it.The script is definitely lackluster. There isn't a single memorable line in the thing and it would have worked just as well with no script at all.Finally, the acting is frankly some of the worst acting I've ever seen. This stuff is only slightly above The Room level of acting. Christian Bale is supposed to be the only character capable of feeling in this city, yet his face looks like a blank slate throughout. He just seems to have been playing the wrong character from beginning to end. Conversely, Taye Diggs can't stop grinning like an idiot and generally looking quite content with himself when the whole film is supposed to be about how much of a emotionless, stone-cold killer he is. A part of me would like to believe that he was actually not taking the drug in order to enjoy murdering innocent people, in which case his character would have served as a clever social commentary on the nature of totalitarian governments. However, at no point does anybody even acknowledge the possibility of this so I can only conclude that it was just terrible acting, accompanied by god awful directing.There is, admittedly, some good stuff in this film, but it is totally buried in sub-par garbage that you wouldn't expect from an expensive film, made by actual professionals.",Equilibrium

But instead I found a very well designed, thought & acted sci-fi story. christian bale is great - and yes this film has a lot to remind matrix series. this is no surprise, matrix is an icon and every good sci-fi/action film will be compared with it.After watching the movie, I got out to crowded streets of Istanbul, realizing it would be a fun to get angry to chaotic traffic, to enjoy beauty of bhosphorus, to feel what emotions this city has to offer. It's free now anyway.",Equilibrium
488,HHoffman-2,"Flawed SF, but worth viewing for what's done right.",6,13 September 2006,"Here's the rub: Equilibrium is very much an action film. An action film that tries to be thought-provoking science fiction, but doesn't flesh out its characters enough to allow this to work. So instead of being serious science fiction, it borders on being a ""skiffy"" film. It's too heavy-handed on its action, which pushes it farther from its ultimate goal.Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), an enforcer for a Utopian society that forbids people to feel. When he temporarily goes off the emotion-suppressing drug, he starts to experience emotions. This leads to problems when regarding his work life. How can a killer have a conscience? The actors in the film, with the exception of Christian Bale and Sean Bean, aren't anything to rave over. There are moments when characters who are supposed to be without emotion are smiling or showing rage. These moments take you out of the film.Kurt Wimmer, writer and director of this film, draws from many different science fiction sources. Brave New World, Blade Runner, and 1984 are among them. But to say most SF is original would be a lie. Nearly every great science fiction work has taken inspiration from something else. The film's subject matter is interesting enough to keep you following along, as censorship is an issue that is becoming more and more easier to relate to in today's society.Where Wimmer stumbles is not giving certain characters a reasonable enough dose of screen time to feel anything for them. One such example is the character Mary (Emily Watson). Her character is left undeveloped, leaving us to wonder why Preston has so much motivation after encountering her.The strongest part (and admittedly, the highlight) of Equilibrium is its fight scenes. The fictional art of Gun Kata provides some cool choreography. If you see Equilibrium for anything, see it for the action.In the end, Equilibrium proves its place among action films while falling short in the genre of science fiction. Kurt Wimmer has given audiences a taste of his film making potential. One can only hope that his talent will develop into some truly great pieces of cinema.",Equilibrium
489,Wbsmith,Can't make a good movie from a stupid premise,1,29 February 2020,"I found this movie amongst an old collection of DVDs. ""Great"" I thought, an IMDB 7.4 science fiction thriller that I haven't seen, and what a cast! The plodding opening exposition slides were the first worry, but I thought they might make something out of it- no, the film continued with a contrived, nonsensical self contradictory story. All films have influences but this was one of the most derivative I have seen. The ridiculously unrealistic gunplay was justified in The Matrix by the manipulation of reality, but this was supposed to be a real-world setting and so it came across as completely unbelievable. And when the twist comes at the end, Keanu (sorry, Christian) just sprouts two massive guns from out of his sleeves (so much for being searched for weapons) and shoots up hundreds of heavily armed yet oddly incompetent stormtroopers (sorry, guards). I can't even give a score for the high production values because the whole thing is nothing but overblown cliche. DVD has been binned!",Equilibrium

It seem to have taken a lot of items from various movies to throw them together here. The FX throughout sucked, reminds the viewers of less money spent on this FX team than is spent on ""family home movies"" for the 3 year old toddler of the camera operator.Bale: has done much better in other roles. Its not a test to his talents to act emotionless. This movie is a dark blot on his career.Diggs: at least he got paid. This does his career no harm or good.Watson: never would have figured the erotic presence, but she is yummy in this.Macfadyen: should be left on shelf in a jar labeled,,, ""Best viewed as a picture, for his acting sucks.""

I never heard of it coming to the theatre, and I didn't even notice it until a friend of mine dropped it off at my desk at work and told me to watch it on pain of death.Not only was the plot fantastic, but the action sequences were great. There were a couple things that were kind of goofy, until they have a brief explanation later in the movie that clarified how the Clerics use certain positions to avoid being shot.While the end of the plot is somewhat predictable, the journey to that end is not predictable at all. I do wish my children were a bit more like Bale's in this show ( you'll see what I mean ).Maria Pia Calzone made an excellent wife for Preston ( Bale's character ).

The story is good(even though it does borrow a lot from other films like ""Fahrenheit 451""). And the action scenes are top-notch, the action scenes are integral to the story they are not there for the sake of being there. And the special effects and production values are so great, it looks as if it cost 100 million dollars to make(Believe or not this film cost 20 million dollars).What didn't work: Some times the story gets to complicated for its own good and there are some big plot-holes. And why wasn't this film released wide(It was only released in limited theaters) If the filmmakers would have advertised this movie better and released in widely in theaters it could have been a blockbuster. Plus this movie is for people looking for a smart action film not a dumb one like ""xXx"" so there are so some slow paced scenes in the movie.Overall: this is an Excellent action film with great acting and amazing action with flaws that can be overlooked. 9/10",Equilibrium
493,Quimby,A rip-off of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 with silly fight scenes,1,28 May 2012,"Despite liking the primary actors in this movie quite a lot, I consider the time I spent watching it a waste. The premise is basically taken right out of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. During the fight scenes I could not help but laugh. They looked silly and contrived. The final fight scene look like a slap fight between two teenagers. With a cast like this, much more should have been made of this movie. Sean Bean gets very little screen time. William Fichtner gets little time and is completely wasted. I also found it odd that there were so few women and the few that there were had little screen time too. The scenes involving The Father reminded me too much of Sleeper (another source of laughter). Maybe it was a comedy and I just didn't realize it.",Equilibrium

More than one idea was quite plainly _stolen_ -- not that this really matters, but it does take away from so-called 'creativity'. I'm not hounding the film; I think it's quite brilliant, but my gripe is that the sources could have been _better_ hidden. Some more obvious idea theft included an adaptation of elements of 1984 and A Brave New World (if you've read those books, their influences will stare you in the face). Additionally, there was a symbol that looked like the Swastika (it's obvious similarity plainly intentional) and the fight choreography was clearly influenced by the Matrix ... and I knew there was something familiar about the way Christian Bale walked and looked and I finally picked it when he put on the white uniform -- Being somewhat of a Bruce Lee fan, I recognized the uniform. That's when Bale became the Bruce Lee of Guns: taking out hundreds and yet receiving nothing but a mere scratch on his face in return.As for the notion of a society without emotion, I noticed several people had them: I caught a smirk from a couple of characters and a couple got angry.Lastly, the ending was a bit abrupt -- I think it would have been more effective had it too conveyed emotion, given that the people with emotions eventually reigned.

498,IrisGoeth,but seriously... Could Christian Bale be any better?,8,16 April 2008,"My review is one on Christian Bale rather than the movie per se. His going from stone-cold to an emotional man is simply flawless. He gets to transmit everything the story needs at the right time. Bale is the greatest actor of his generation and never afraid to get his hands REALLY dirty. He's played a highly controversial psycho (in an admittedly light version of a really crude and insightful novel... But you realise after you watch him, every time you read the novel again HE IS Patrick Bateman), a LITERALLY starving and tormented loner (please see The Machinist if only for his PERFECT, ground-breaking work of art, which includes both his acting skills and his beyond-emaciated body), a hopeful gay teenager turned hopeless adult (Velvet Goldmine, where he's amazingly accurate in a minor -as length goes- role and you really believe he's a shy and lively teenager and minutes later you believe he's a weary, melancholy adult), a conflicted superhero (the best Batman by far, followed by Michael Keaton of course) and all sorts of middle-of-the-road characters. He's not your average mainstream star and he'll never be, I hope... He's too much in love with his work to become that. Good for him.Equilibrium is a very fine movie. Highly entertaining, the score was more than okay, the casting does a really good job (I liked The Matrix -although I prefer Equilibrium's sobriety and rhythm, which many may find boring-, but come on... The actors were inferior and I'm sorry but Keanu Reeves just can't make it. Where Bale is all complex, nuanced and charismatic, Reeves is just handsome wood) and the fight scenes are beautiful to look at. Cons are the Father, who seemed too weak to me, and the ending which doesn't do justice to what comes before. In any case, this is an above-average sci-fi flick. Take a look.",Equilibrium

It is a discipline that most human beings lack. As we lack emotional discipline we lose control of ourselves the consequences chaos and break down as seen in first part of the movie. Moreover a neuro psychological drug Prosium as made to counter or suppress emotions but that solution had its problems, it brought lifelessness. Therefore there must be balance must be maintained between emotions and logic (heart and the mind to keep it simple) thus Equilibrium is message and the title.There were some flaws though: Firearm rules wasn't enforced (finger on the trigger). The police, sweepers and tactical team acted dumb, they use poor tactics, disorganised and poorly trained.

In the future, the survivors of the 3rd world war are well and truly fed up of conflict. They decide to start a new society where everyone is equal, and no one has any emotions. It is a totalitarian society where the proceedings of peoples thoughts are kept strictly emotionless by a mandatory drug that is constantly being self administered by everyone. Anyone who misses a dose, or attempts to develop feelings against the control of the drug is immediately executed. Emotion is a 'sense offense' punished by death.

Emotion is blamed for humankind's warring and steps are taken to ensure a fourth world war never happens by depriving mankind of their ability to feel by administering a medication to the populace which is taken daily.Policed by the Clerics, they enforce the law, where 'feelers' (those who choose not to take their 'medicine') are sought out and punished, ultimately by death.Christian Bale is the highest of Clerics, and he is wonderfully cast as the cold faced, unemotional enforcer.Things begin to change when one day he breaks his morning dose by accident, and does not seek a replacement.The character begins to feel, and what follows is his journey of emotional discovery and realisation of what he has done, with some excellent action fighting scenes thrown in along the way.From the very start i was totally transfixed on this film.

Afew years later, however, I realized what a piece of crap this is.The story goes like this: After World War 3, mankind decides that the only way to avoid conflict is to block emotion. So, a group of cops called Clerics go about destroying anything that would create an emotional response (art, music, film, books, etc.) and kill anyone who opposes them. To further suppress emotion, the people of Libria must take a regular dose of Prozium. However, John Preston (Christian Bale), one of the top clerics, accidentally misses a dose and begins feeling emotion for the first time.The rest you've seen before in other, better films. That's the biggest problem with ""Equilibrium."" There's not a shred of originality. It steals entire scenes from ""The Matrix"", ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", even ""Citizen Kane."" The script doesn't make a lot of sense either. If everyone regularly takes an emotion-repressing drug, how come they show emotion anyway? Anger, pride, sadness, frustration, confusion, etc. How everyone doesn't get arrested is one of the films' greatest mysteries. I will say this though: The actions scenes are fantastic. The gun fights are nothing short of dazzling. Completely preposterous, but fun. Sadly, this is the only source of fun to be found in the entire movie, because everything is boring to no end. The acting sucks too. The dialogue is flat and often unintentionally funny. Bottom line, this is one movie that does NOT deserve its cult following. I can't believe I actually used to like this film.

As the plot develops, one realizes that although emotion does take the pain away, it also take the joy and experience of life, love and poetry. There are two twists within the film that allows the development of the main character to blossom througout the movies.

Best I can tell the story is completely taken from the novel ""The Giver"" with some gun-fu added. And you know what? I've never loved a movie on first viewing (excluding pulp-fiction and memento) this much.This movie is completely stolen, and in my opinion, nothing is unique, but for some reason thats completely okay, I personally don't mind, the soundtrack alone is good enough to necessitate viewing of this film. Christian Bale is an amazing actor, and in my opinion, this movie shows it exceptionally well. Allow me to elaborate, in movies your protagonist always goes through the story and plot and ends up becoming a better (or occasionally worse) person, right? Right. In this movie you can actually see it in Bale's acting, the way he speaks, the way he moves, the way he does everything in the first 20 mins are completely and utterly different from the last 20 mins. In short, This movie may have most of its plot points stolen, and may imbibe too much gun-fu action for your tastes, but I daresay no movie has ever ""clicked"" with me so well.

At the time of viewing - nothing radical. The film captures the attention and does not let go until the very end of it, keeping the audience in suspense, giving delight the ear and the eye. Problems begin a little later - after all your personal thoughts about the plot: You still empathized main character, much forgiven him, script and film in general. The trouble comes about at a time when you try to talk about the film to your friend in an attempt to interest him in watching. And it turns out that you are advertising something very strange and oblique from all sides. The biggest problem, ""Equilibrium"" - parts that are involved in the plot and promote it, although the universe itself claims not so much. A world in which the main character lives Preston - a post- apocalyptic future, the country Libria after World War III, which is quite clearly shows the local Globe. Mankind has decided that all the troubles - due to irrepressible emotion experienced by the individual and their feelings. The film does not try to somehow distinguish between these concepts - continually confusing and replacing them with one another. Everyone except psychologists, it will be a damn, but the future of the society decided to rein in these traits and set to work dramatically - with the help of drugs. And this is the substance called ""prozium"" and formed the basis of the movement of the plot, is the first question. Pharmacology died on the fields of World War III? Hagsli was more inventive, describing a ""Brave New World"" substance to which the characters now and then wanted to go back. No, seriously, what kind of drug is - no addiction, no aftereffects or even buzz does not cause? The task it performs, people go and massively depict ants, but I want to take it only under the influence of propaganda. The latter, by the way, does not cause the feeling of heavy material. TVs are all over the city and achieve the broadcast system and the covenants of the leader, and next to these monitors are people who do not take the drug. The question is how this system has lived up to the action of the picture? Next comes the question of team-mate John Preston, played Teyem Diggs, which is kind of like a bastion of clerics standing guard system. This character walks and smiles throughout the film, but so happy an event that I want to ask him how long he had stopped taking ""prozium""?All of the above sounded rests on the enormous symbolism. Freed son Preston looks like a graduate of the Hitler Youth, clerics themselves go toe the line, a sister on the table setting, they communicate with the authorities through the TV screen, which is and wants to be called Big Brother, the main character Libria something strongly resembles, let alone the fact that Preston the final fight fits all in white .... No, really, all in white and black opponents. White horse stayed behind the scenes, and thanks for that. Speaking of symbolism. Question on intelligence: what would show the inhuman attitude towards humanity, a work of art fire burned at the beginning of ""Equilibrium""? Her lady with a mysterious smile. With that, burned, apparently a copy on canvas, as the original is still drawn on the board. And after all of the above that, by itself does not restrict all shoals ""Equilibrium"" and the reader becomes the most important question: ""How does all this look? How does this work. Works. And how. As soon as John Preston sees the goal and not noticing the obstacles applies crazy skills as a fighting style with pistols, the viewer wants to forget about everything. And kowtow creator is for the fighting style of the future. He, however, raises questions about its effectiveness, but glamor is able to smooth him all the disadvantages. Trace the causes of love can be attributed to the history of screw system, ganged up on her, and apply all the skills that he instilled this same system against it though. This simple plot device resonates in the hearts of many, especially because it's all played for more than a decent level of more than skillful actors. Host borrowed details from classics mentioned in the beginning of the view can be taken as to the disadvantages and advantages to - always nice to see the timeless relevance of the issues opened by good writers. Have a movie and a trump card with which he walks almost immediately - Sean Bean, who ... yes, die! Those who do not want to give this a lot of extra attention to detail, the tape gives a cheerful story, excellent combat choreography, wonderful actors and the corresponding soundtrack. And at the end of it all, ""Equilibrium"" never claimed the laurels of scientific philosophical treatise with elements of documentary. It's a thriller, dystopia, and with these roles, he manages a hundred, if not a hundred and twenty, despite all the shortcomings, disadvantages and ridiculous, such as fade in and out of gloves or traces of blood. It does not matter it's all if you are not picky person. When viewing the tape carries and attracts so much that you just do not notice it, then the film - wonderful.

513,mail-873-825928,Why.. why,2,2 November 2016,"I love Science Fiction. I love Christian Bale. Why, why was this movie such a fail? The writing. This contrived pastiche rips elements from 1984, The Giver, Aeon Flux, and Brave New World in the most predictable, unoriginal way imaginable. They should have just taken one step farther left and called this ""Not Another Dystopian Movie"" and slapped a laugh track over it. Aside from being technically sci-fi and having clearly spent a large amount of money on production, the film has no redeeming qualities. The dialogue is flat, the characters are weak, Christian Bale couldn't even bring this roadkill to life. I think if this was the first movie I had seen with CB, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy American Psycho. The studio should left it on the cutting room floor, washed their hands, shut the door and burned the place down.",Equilibrium

Orwell's 1984, Fascism totally and clevey sprinkled in at every moment throughout every environment. Hitler youth also comes to mind. Totalitarianism.

He was however, surpringly more interested in the political meaning. Wife loved it, again first time ( My boy did wish the ending was longer after explosions etc)I explained the smile at the end, and then he smiled and we're all good.This film was eclipsed by The Matrix

The nazi-era buildings used during the shooting in Germany fit the dystopian world of Equilibrium really well, and the end scene is fantastic, I was very surprised to hear in the director commentary that this was a toned down scene compared to their original idea since they were running of fundings, it was excellent.I sincerely hope Kurt Wimmer one day gets the money to make another movie such as this one without being limited by a license.",Equilibrium

A society without feelings yet everyone displays feelings from the very get go? A score which is an obvious rip-off of The Matrix? Fight scenes which look like a college student's attempt to recreate said title? Countless plot holes, etc. Don't get me wrong, if you're here for the action, able to switch off and just enjoy another b-movie sci-fi flic with a-listed actors then you can't go wrong here.

In fact, instead of the hero being Christ reborn (as in the matrix), he is the destroyer of the mindless fanaticism Christianity offers.Librium= opiate of the masses= religionThe movie feature's a Father served unquestioningly by his Clerics on the basis of their faith.  The government's symbol is a cross, and any works of art are burnt because they stimulate emotion (burnt any Marilyn Manson records lately?). The brutal crowd control tactics of the Clerics are like something out of the old testament (they kill the non-believers AND their pets).Yes, it incorporates many elements from other science fiction works, but it ties them together into a cool movie.

Take an intelligent subject and ruin it with some ludicrous fight scenes.The directors seem to have missed the point of the Matrix.  The characters could do incredible things because they were part of a computer program and, if you control the program, you can do what you want.   The characters in this film are real flesh and blood people who can apparently stand in the middle of a room with dozens of people firing at them from all sides, but not take a single bullet.  The ""explanation"" for this is that they have had a special training on how to predict the patterns of firing in a gun fight.Leaving the idiotic fight scenes out, the film was fairly watchable.  The oppressive paternalistic state was well depicted and Christian Bale's journey from unfeeling machine to human being was well acted.  But what really ruined it for me was the absurd ending in which John Preston single handedly wipes out the entire apparatus of a totalitarian state.  This trivialises the plight of people who really have to endure life under such a regime.",Equilibrium
522,rock130000,Very underrated!,10,7 December 2002,"This movie is probably the best action movie of 2002. The gun-kata idea itself is brand new and very unique. When actually witnessing the gun-kata, you'll be mesmerized. It's amazing that nowadays an action movie can be good without the use of wires or bullet time but Equilibrium accomplishes it very well.Christian Bale surprises me with every movie he does and I really liked the way he was able to have a stone face then show emotion. It's funny to see the guy care when the last time I saw him was as a spoiled rich bastard in Shaft. He doesn't get the credit he deserves. Taye Diggs did well too as a good guy/bad guy. It's good to see him doing something different.
The story itself is clearly a draw between ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" but its including of action is very well done. I also liked the way the future was made to look like. It's strange how much was put into this movie but how little Dimension Films cared for it.Last, the action scenes itself are worth the ticket price. It outdoes every action movie this year and leaves you wanting more. It's amazing to see martial arts mixed with gun play. Great mix with great results.A+ film",Equilibrium

A very well-put story and the cast manage to give us the full spectrum of the lack of emotions and the struggle to get away from that. However the action scenes seem a little bit far fetched, even though the use of weapons, kinisiology etc add up to the story. A lovely combination of Martial Arts and the hero's struggle to find himself in a society that survives through oblivion of emotions that is inhumane, while trying to do the exact opposite... Christian Bale depicts the uncertainty and struggle of the hero for freedom in a very simple yet passionate way - I think it is one of his best roles. A great adventure film that makes you think a lot about the value of feelings, how people get away with violence and how human societies are going to be formed in the future. A message against oppression and apathy...",Equilibrium
524,cyberwares,"Interesting concept, great action, but flawed.",7,16 July 2003,"A good way to describe this movie is to take all the movies that have ever screwed with your head and put them all together. Like such literary classics as Farenheit 451 (major influence), Brave New World, City of Truth and 1984. And such films as Brazil, the Matrix and Dark City. Though this movie is not extremely dark, it is incredibly tied to all those sources and more.At the core of this movie is what is its biggest flaw, the writing. Unfortunately, director Kurt Wimmer forgot the best thing about novels like 1984 and Farenheit 451. Subliminal comedy. Every tragedy must have some kind of comedy to balance the events that occur. The best example of this is Brazil. Technology, a tool to make things more convenient for the lazy masses, had become so ridiculous that it basically made things even more inconvenient. That's a sarcastic and humorous dicotomy that Equilibrium fails to draw upon. Then again this is a film produced by Jan de Bont, who has been more about the flashy iamge than anything else (but not as bad as Baz Luhrman), so maybe in whatever European language this script was originally written in, it's brilliant, but in English, it falters.But oh what a bunch of flashy images this film has. When there are actually moments of action, the film includes some of the most innovative sequences ever filmed. ""Gun-fu"" is genius, though not a new concept. Our hero, Christian Bale, is taken through fight after fight with a new style every time he fights. He takes on six guys at point-blanke range and takes em all out without a scratch. This is hard to swallow in words, but seeing it is believing. The last gun-tango scene at the end is jaw-dropping.
But back to what also is wrong with this picture. Continuity errors. There are many, even if they are supposedly cleared up at the end. Also the editing is not clean at all. It seems as if there was a lot more of this movie that was written and shot but cut out for time.To the film's credit, however, the cinematography is completely breathtaking. Shot after shot, the images burn into your mind and threaten to stay there forever. When our hero finally gets to look outside by confiscating his own window, he finds a beautiful shot of the city; rainbow, panorama and all, and it is breath-taking. Keep in mind the cinematographer also did ""Chicago.""The fight scenes, as said before, are incredible, too. Who did them? The same guy who did Mask of Zorro and... Ace Ventura: Pet Detective? Believe it or not, this guy is just a stuntman who happened to also know how to fight. This is his masterpiece, however. He moves the characters so well it makes the Matrix look like child's play.And of course let's not forget the incredible actor Christian Bale. He's a perfect casting choice. He can pull off being emotion-less better than anyone else in that movie. He even can break down once he doesn't take his necessary dosage of some prozac-ripoff. His performance is staggering.So, see it for the flash, because that's basically the only thing legitimate with this picture. Behind the amazing shots, performances, fights, and design... there is a second-time director who obviously was a fan of 1984 and Farenheit 451... or at least what he read of the Cliff Notes. 7/10",Equilibrium

I love the action and I like grate parts of the artistic production. The story have flaws that can irritate me if I think of all totally insane things like a lobotomizing drug that people them self take. To make the story more easy to swallow they might have considered that the people drugged by the fascist government by food/water poisoning? An antidote taken to become sensitive again would feel more right. The cars does not fit in to the futuristic scenery and the thing with the dog was little to much and cut down the momentum.

We can all feel the pain and suffering of the main character as Christian Bale annihilates another role and Sean Bean flexes his poetic skills when discovered by Bale's character. I wish more money was pumped into this film for special effects during actions sequences; I can tell when they needed more slow-mo camera shots and they didn't have them.

It is a great picture that I will recommend to everyone I see the coming week. The story is great and a lot of things are explained by the picture without going to dreadfull plot stranglers like a voice over.Christian Bale delivers as a man who's former beliefs surely crumble and his eyes are openend. All the while trying to stay cool and collected, and he pulls it of. Sean Bean is a man who you instantly feel sorry for, knowing his partner will get him and that just when he's seen a new world. Taye Diggs is good as sidekick, I liked him least, especially as he's the only figure in the film that almost constantly smiles, he fell outside of the setting.The setting on the other hand was so carefully made, it had the coolness Gattaca had, lighting just right, trying to keep all things in black and white or grey, but adding color when needed to give accent to certain moments. Isn't it just beautifull how the condemned wear a very gothic red dress and cape before they are punished?Big critique of this film was it's resemblance to the Matrix, but except for the fighting (which isn't part of the story) I can't see any overlap. (Well maybe the very cool costumes) Even how Gunkata was formed is explained, and I think I would know if people could kill efficiently because of being in a digital world and not obeying ordinary physics.This is a modern classic, maybe not like 2001 or Godfather, but let's call it a b-classic!

He was amazing at his facial expressions, tone, evilness (per-say), but he was not supposed to have emotion. And yet, he did, for the entire movie.

530,princess_stomper,Underrated: Much better than it has any right to be,10,30 July 2004,"On paper, it simply doesn't work at all. Get largely unproven former child actor to put on an American accent, pad out the cast with British TV stars and unknown American actors, and rip the story off from Fahrenheit 451 and various other post-apocalyptic nightmare stories. Add some martial arts and Robert's your avuncular relative. It sounds, frankly, terrible. Before you can say Big Brother, the cliches are in - burning works of art and classical music, damsels in bureaucratic distress, and poor lost puppies in a world where pets are outlawed.However.Christian Bale's quiet, understated performance matches perfectly the vulnerable, heart-wrenching evocativeness of a by-now trademark piece from Emily Watson. Taye Diggs' overly-emotional turn adds - as the production notes point out - a valued dynamic core to the proceedings as Sean Bean puts in his woefully short timesheet. Angus MacFayden is, to put it bluntly, unforgettable, though this is pretty much due to this movie's Unique Selling Point. The action sequences. Like The Matrix, Kurt Wimmer knew the simple equation that Interesting Film + Great Action = Buy It Now. As derivative and obvious as The Matrix - even with a nod or two in the Keanu-starrer's direction - Equilibrium is as classic as The Matrix for exactly the same reasons - it's a simple, oft-repeated story, well-told, well-acted and with the kind of action set pieces that make you thank God the camera was invented.

Seriously, friends, take a deep breath and decide if you were entertained or not after seeing Equilibrium (for the record, I was). If your concern is whether to worship at the altar of Neo or find your way through Gun-Kata, then perhaps it is time to leave the screen behind and get yourself a new hobby.Equilibrium is nothing more than the same morality tale we've been treated to for the past several millennia. That is not entirely a bad thing in this case, as the story is delivered in a stylish and well-paced manner. While not a completely fresh look (Brazil and Blade Runner come to mind quite readily), set design and cinematography is just far enough off-axis to hold the viewer's attention. The acting is workmanlike and adequate to the task of portraying a numbed-down version of good versus evil in a totalitarian state. For my taste, the choreography of the Gun-Kata action was the saving grace of the film (although I will admit I am no expert on choreography - I just know what I like). Frankly, the comparisons to the Matrix (Matrices?) is a bit baffling to my untrained eyes - High Plains Drifter might be a more apt analogy.I have rated this film at 7/10 for the simple reason that the storyline deserves a five and the design and choreography merits a nine.

534,seamancup,Christian Bale is essentially Keanu Reeves,2,5 January 2012,"Christian Bale stars in this orwellian dystopic action flick with some lame pretensions of being more intelligent than it really is and actually having something to say about the nature of human society. So this is yet another 1984 influenced film about a cold future where people act more like numbed and emotionless robots than humans and the government controls every aspect of peoples lives, and one man alone can save us all. He is awesome at everything he does, he can dodge bullets and singlehandedly defeat armies. And he wears a long black coat all the time. He is essentially Keanu Reeves... We've all seen this before and it's not even visually impressive. Even though the cast is well known everything else looks quite cheap. Like an ambitious TV production from 10 years ago. Not that one should pay too much heed to production values alone but somehow, even though the movie doesn't impress me on any other level even, it does trike me as rather strange that a sci-fi cinema flick like this saves in on props and effects in such a noticeable way while still managing the casting it does. Anyway, all in all, simply put and all that, it's quite bad. It's far from fresh and equally far from its own ambitions of being thought provoking and smart. And the last scene with Christan Bale's son making a total 180 turn (you'll know it if you see it) is just so bad and ""necessary"" to tie it all together nicely and cosy that I actually laughed out loud.",Equilibrium
535,syousef,Made no sense,1,5 August 2016,You can't simultaneously have a premise of the state eliminating emotion and a population subdued with rousing patriotic drivel. The speeches are by their nature emotive. So is the response of the population. To avoid this you would need the characters would be very robotic. This would have made for a dull movie. So instead we have a logically inconsistent mess that makes no sense and so is also dull. Then there were the fight scenes. They're lazy. I'm use to Hollywood nonsense and unbelievable stunts. But could you at least make some attempt to help the audience suspend their disbelief? I was insulted by the attempt at an explanation. Did the writers assume the audience was uneducated or just plain stupid? I wasn't interested or engaged enough by these supposedly emotionless characters to sit through this whole mess. Normally I try to stick with a movie and see it to the end once I start watching. In this case I don't imagine it could have gotten much better so I don't feel bad for switching off. It had become a chore!,Equilibrium
536,granitor,The Matrix Part 20,10,16 March 2003,"This movie has come under attack for the laughable story, but I found it to be refreshing as literal, slightly exaggerated interpetation of various concerns about the effect of a First World establishment (i.e. one wherein the government has total control of the populace) on the beauty of humanity. (Then again, my real life is laughable so perhaps that's why I took this more seriously.)The action is top-notch, and so is the directing: They are subtle uses of color effects which emphasis the struggle of the main character to move from perpetually surpressing his thoughts from his body (emotions:full-body thoughts) to being able to chose whether to feel or be ""calm to the core"". The action sequences combing the American-esque obsession with gunplay with the Asian-esque softer styles of Tai Chi, the flowing yet forceful continuous attacking styles. To my knowledge, this has never been as successfully attempted.Moreover, the straightforwardness of the plot keeps the action coming, whilst also pulling you into the world of the characters, and their forced spiritual undeadness due to the over-order.All in all, worth owning, and watching.Yet, not really ""better than"" The Matrix: more like a side-story, spiritually.

If you're expecting the movie to fall into some other catagory or be the 'new'...well, anything; you probably will be.Keeping in mind that this is a fantasy action flick, everything's done flawlessly. The action is steady enough that you don't get bored, the plot is interesting enough to keep you into it, the characters are varied and deep enough (key here is 'enough'), and you only have to think exactly as much as you want to.Beyond that, the movie builds to a breathtaking climax involving some of the most exceptional action scenes around, taking successful elements and using new ideas to keep this from being just another knockoff of that other one.
That said, I'm not sure this movie could have been made if the second installment of the Matrix was released the same year. Mostly, this one filled a much needed hole in the genre in 2002, giving us what we'd been waiting for.

The idea is rather cool: By mandatory drugs, people are losing any kind of emotions. This is supposed to eradicate wars and other problems. But a lot of folks actually aren't taking their drugs and are therefore prosecuted.Unfortunately, the prosecutors are as absolutely unbelievable as the whole setup. Vanity, aggression, triumph - aren't these emotions? They are clearly around, and no one seems to mind. The depicted future is also rather weird - cars, guns etc. are rather what we know them to be now. The only technological development seems to concern, ahem doors. Out of all things. Just to give it a SF touch, I guess. The rest is just a lame excuse for utterly boring Martial arts scenes (one of them toward the end is actually a tiny little bit cool. If my patience hadn't been worn out so much by then, I might even have enjoyed it). They are endless, and hundreds of people die - no matter whether by the hands of those with emotions or those without.The worst, however, is the terribly annoying music. When total absence of emotion is supposed to be around, we hear - CHOIR MUSIC. Can you believe it?

541,silentbdeadly,"more ""1984"" than ""Matrix""",7,7 June 2003,"*** SPOILERS ALERT ***First off, after watching this movie, I wish Christian Bale had played the role of Neo rather than Keaunu Reeves, but this is no Matrix ripoff -- though it has plenty of action scenes reminiscent of that movie. And it's no masterpiece: I still rate it a 7 and Matrix an 8, but it's a film that seems to take itself more seriously, to concentrate more on the inability of the human spirit to be silenced rather than focus on a rebellion against the system, akin as such to Huxley's ""Brave New World"" and Orwell's ""1984."" You are given the impression that humanity (the realm of emotion) will inevitably surface, whether John Preston (Bale) is successful or not. As such, it's more like a remake of ""1984"" starring John Hurt (although I still feel this is the best realization of the idea) or ""THX 1138;"" perhaps even influenced by ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" in a way. The one truly original idea that gets across is the sort of in-joke that the Father himself (the ruler of the emotionless society) is not taking shots of the emotion-cloaking drug and is just waging a war of his own -- further backing up the belief that without emotions there would be no wars -- against those who are really just like him, a truth he must be ashamed of, and as such he is merely running a fascist state. Sure, there are plenty of silly situations that pop up and keep this from being a perfect movie -- the puppy Preston won't let die while he'll go ahead and kill hundreds of humans; his kids who have also stopped taking the drugs and the ease with which he takes down the system, but, on the other hand, there are refreshing situations to counter the silly: he doesn't get the girl in the end and, in the end, you get the sense that the change of power that takes place (Preston's sly grin at the conclusion) will eventually turn rotten just the same. That comes the closest to the truth.",Equilibrium

I'd never even heard of it till a friend stumbled upon a clip on you tube. Christian Bale is a great actor and from the looks of this movie he either has a great deal of martial arts background or they did such a fantastic job of inserting the stunt double you never even notice it isn't him doing the amazing martial arts exhibitions in this movie. Personally I think he did a lot of his own stunt work in this and it's a good primer for why he was chosen for the role of the black knight in the new batman movies. No, I don't think this movie is far-fetched at all, it would probably be a stretch to believe that so many of society would willingly take their drugs but the threat of incarceration or worse might certainly swing the doubters in the desired direction. This was one of those great stories designed to tell the story of how only one man can swing the balance.......

Basically the whole premis of the film is about as substantial as an ant turd... it's set in the future after world war 3 and claims that mankind realises that it cannot survive a 4th so comes up with the brilliant idea of surpressing all emotions through drugs and attempts the destruction of historuical works of art... this 'visionary' concept is policed by 'clerics' (remarkably like the Matrix in all aspect of dress, make-up and dialogue) and an army of leather clad 'soldiers' wearing black motorbike helmets...

He then basically meets a girl and begins to question authority and his own morality. (All of the above in brackets)It has buildings and airships with domineering screens (Blade Runner), monochromatic vehicles and surroundings (Gattaca), long coats and some chronic Gun Fu (The Matrix), and an underground resistance which is unknowingly infiltrated by the protagonist, who was being used as a pawn all along by his employer. (Total Recall) I'm sure I've missed a couple of other blatant uses of previous films/books, (such as the long-dead leader still used as a virtual authority figure, which still escapes me due to the annoyance that this trash has corrupted my mind with), but past dystopian references aside from otherwise quality viewing, this nonsense is just absolute chicken teeth. Riddled with plot holes throughout, and topped off with an extremely dodgy ""face-off"" one-time CGI effect, and a thoroughly laughable end fight scene in which Angus Macfadyen obviously struggles with the choreography due to some class facial expressions that the editors failed to work around.I mean, Jeez... When did decommissioned 1980's airport service vehicles become deemed as 'futuristic' for the year 2072? And how the hell did Emily Watson's character manage to get all that make-up in prison, especially within such a bleak and passionless society? AAAARRRGGGHHHH!

Yes, while there may be some similarities, I tend to think that Equilibrium as a film in it's entirety is wholly different. If anything, the movie actually reminded me more of a cross between George Lucas' THX-1138 & Fahrenheit 451 (obviously!) But what is absolutely excellent about this movie is Wimmer's introduction of the ""Gun-Kata"" fighting style. Christian Bale does a great job as the lead and carries a very distinct presence with his character althroughout. The sets are amazing, the sound is amazing and the cinematography is top-notch.

I'm a fan of BALE and when i recognized that guy (whose name i always forget) from The Way Of The Gun, then i was sold - the fact that SEAN BEAN was there was a bonus. double bonus.anyways, again this movie proves what other movies have declared before: money does not make movies. desperado was the same, action movies take a lot of money, but with little money, the right director, original ideas and a wicked crisp script you can put together a movie that will rise above the other special-effect orgies out there.this movie, bringing together some bits of religion, fascist history, communism and materialism -as well as- the emotional relationships that we are continually losing with our fellow humans, and what we are willing to sacrifice to feel ""safe"" and then you wonder if the utopia you've created is a utopia at all.the coolness of the movie (action and overall look) will keep people interested that cant keep up with all the references and subtle hints that the movie is wrapped around. the strong and serious criticism towards our way of life and the parts of history that could easily be repeated are kept hidden from the people that simply want to watch it as an action flick - with parts that are reminiscent of 1984 and other works of Orwell and various dystopia sci-fi movies this movie is in the tops.i have yet to meet a man who does not like this movie, but whats even more special is that mostly every woman that has seen it, has watched it to the end with interest. a movie for everyone boys & girls...",Equilibrium

552,uberman5000,Hokey Ideas Meet a Flimsy Plot,4,12 May 2011,"Several years after this movie came out, the same director made a film called Ultraviolet. The movie was mostly about Milla Jovovich, who is some kind of vampire super fighter with a fatal disease, trying to find a cure for her before the fascist government tries to round her up. This film was a mess of unconvincing CGI, silly philosophical posturing, overblown fight scenes, and dumb acting. People saw this film, and if they were of a certain opinion, shouted afterwards ""The director of Equilibrium made THIS??""Well, it's not that surprising, because Equilibrium basically had all the same problems.Libria is a dystopian fascist city-state, equal parts Nineteen Eighty-Four and equal parts Brave New World, which believes that wars aren't caused by competition for resources or ideological differences, but because of ""emotion"". Not any PARTICULAR emotions, just... emotion. In general. In that spirit, all the citizens take emotion-numbing drugs (cough, THX- 1138), and a secret police called the Tetragrammaton Council (""Tetragrammaton"" being the term used in Judaism for the true, unpronounceable name of God), staffed by people in dark trench-coats called Clerics, who prowl around the city killing emotional people, and destroying art and books that they regard as ""emotional content"". One of the first scenes in the movie has John Preston, a high-ranking Cleric played by Christian Bale, finding the Mona Lisa under a trap door (is Libria in France? What is it doing there?) and ordering them to ""burn it"". Also, the head of the government is named ""Father"".So... a grey dystopian city policed by a quasi-religious group (that doesn't really need to be quasi-religious except for Kurt Wimmer to make an obtuse point) that repress original expression because it will make people feel things that aren't in line with the ruling fascist government? We're not even past the premise yet, and already the film is beating us over the head with a Symbolism Stick.The Clerics are so successful because of a radical martial arts discipline called ""Gun Kata"", which basically assumes that if a person stands in one place, with a pistol in each hand, and strikes a certain series of dramatic poses, he will be able to shoot everyone in a room, if they all stand in the right place, and if they are totally unable to shoot anything right in front of them.John Preston has an old partner, who he shoots in the face for reading a book of poems by William Butler Yeats, because he thinks that means he's become emotional. Keep this in mind.He gets a new partner, a fellow named Brandt, and is quickly rising in the ranks of the Tetragrammaton Council. Later, they find a fenced yard with some puppies in them, and the armed guards ask Preston what they want to do with them. Preston picks one of these puppies up, who licks him in the face. Aww. Preston looks like he's about to cry, and stammers that, rather than shoot these puppies, they should be ""taken away and tested for disease"".Now, I remind you, John Preston's last partner was SHOT IN THE FACE for reading poetry. I doubt his new partner is any softer, so why did none of them notice when this high-ranking Cleric almost dissolves into a blubbering basketcase because he held a puppy?He tries to free the puppies, but is caught by armed guards. Preston shoots them in the face with their own guns, to which they yell ""AAH! F***!!"" ...Isn't surprise an emotional response?Later, they find a room full of old, nostalgic crap, like an old gramophone with classical music records, and a bunch of posters from the '20s and '30s (where are the rest of the Louvre paintings, all of a sudden?), and the room had gaudy paisley wallpaper. Apparently nostalgic crap is ""emotional"".After a long and drawn-out plot that involves John Preston having more improbable gunfights where he dances around and no one ever shoots him, and talking with members of the ""Resistance"" (because there's always one) about the nature of emotion, which doesn't seem to address the belief that it's the foundation of all human conflict (because it isn't), he's finally caught by Brandt, who angrily declares that he is ""feeling"".Wait, ANGER IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST EMOTIONS PEOPLE HAVE!! THIS DYSTOPIA'S PHILOSOPHY IS NONSENSE!! WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS MOVIE??You might be thinking that maybe John Preston was led along until he was caught in a more sudden emotional outburst, as more solid evidence. You might also argue that Brandt doesn't really care that Preston is ""feeling"", because throughout the film, he says he wants to ""rise in the ranks"", and that Preston is his biggest competition. All fair points, but WHY IS HE STILL ANGRY?? Also, the Tetragrammaton Council acts without mercy. Brandt could rise a lot faster by SHOOTING PRESTON.So he's taken before Father, and through yet more improbable gunfights, he eventually gets a couple of swords and cuts off Brandt's face. No, literally, like, as if your face is a solid piece on the front of your head, and can be cut as cleanly as scissors cut paper. What was that about Ultraviolet's awful CGI?So he kills Father, somehow collapses the government, and we have basically watched a Nineteen Eighty-Four ripoff with no social value, didn't follow its own rules, beat us senseless with its crass egalitarianism, and was basically stuffed with staged, unconvincing gunfights. This was basically a more pretentious Ultraviolet.A good dystopia is built on something which is seen as a problem in current society, like loss of personal freedoms in Nineteen Eighty-Four, rapid consumerism in Brave New World, or soul-crushing bureaucracy in Terry Gilliam's Brazil. ""Emotion"" was never a big problem with human society, so to hang a whole dystopian society on it seems really uninformed. You want a great dystopia movie, go watch Brazil.",Equilibrium

There was no wire work, no bullet time. The invention of the gun carta - martial arts with guns is cool. The story line based on the constant battle of humanity is worthwhile. The view that no matter how hard you try you cannot remove who we are both good and bad. The irony that after world war 3 all emotion is erased to create peace and yet so much violence and destruction is exhausted in achieving it. Watching Preston gradual realisation of who he is and what is happening is a delight to watch as Bale brings his superb intensity to the role. So easy to see an early Batman there.

The action is a bit sloppy, trying to be the matrix but not quite there, (i think a bigger budget would have helped) but the idea of a martial art with guns was just genius! The story idea was equally inventive(it reminded me of v for vendetta with of the dictatorship),but it wasn't consistent through the script, like there were some bits that made no sense e.g ""why would he act like that if he didn't have emotions"" also the plot wasn't as complex as it potentially could have been. It simply focused on Christian bale's character becoming more and more affected by his emotions (but uses the emotion of love as a fairly descent subplot), and then threw in some ridiculous twists at the end. But the thing that made cringe but also scratch my head was the odd moment where Christian bale's character would try to get the audiences sympathy and act as the gentle, caring hero, like when rescues the puppy or sobs over his beloved red ribbon, and then next minute he he has just mercilessly killed everyone in the room and is mid way through slicing someones face off.",Equilibrium

557,trevisthomas,Don't see this movie. It is absurd.,1,16 June 2003,"Don't see this movie. It is absurd. It is ridiculous, painfully pathetic crap. The flic tells the tediously lame story of a post apocalyptic earth after a third world war. The crux of the story is based on the fact that this future world manages to remove war and crime by subduing human emotion. People have to take some drug or some dumb thing to keep their emotions Vulcan like. They've even taken that one step further but outlawing anything that's not black, white or grey. No art, no music, etc.While the basic premise is laughable if you're over the age of 12 the films biggest failure, to me, was this absurd idea that you could use mathematics to determine the probable course that bullets will take when in any close quarter gun battle. See, the unfeeling police don't feel but they do shoot a lot of people and kicks some ass. Anyway, where was I, oh yeah, with their mathematics they formulated a new martial art called Gun Fu, or something. (Actually I made up Gun-Fu, they called it something else that was more lame and less funny). A master of this art could enter a darkened room surrounded by bad guys and know where all of the bullets would be, and thus kill them without he himself being injured.The whole thing was the stupidest most senseless piece of babble I've ever seen or heard. They tried to make excuses to rationalize their comic inspired gun battles which needed no excuse. I think most would have been simply accepted the look of it as stylized art in lieu of one, especially if that excuse was going to be sophomoric and moronic.This movie is crap, avoid at all cost.",Equilibrium
558,moonfrog4,unexpectedly good,8,2 June 2003,"The biggest complaint of this movie is that it borrows too much from the Matrix, or that it's not as cerebral as the Matrix.

No concept (which there are only a couple repeated over and over again) in that movie can't be summed up in any philosophy 101 class. That said, Equilibrium has at least some brains to it, and more importantly the execution to make it work.  The citizens stopping all at once to take their ""dose"",  the dismal grey color of everything in the city, and the fine acting all work towards making the script work.  The action is a reason to see this movie in itself.  The idea that the clerics learn a gun based martial art in which they study probability of trajectory of return fire is pretty darn intruiguing.

Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos.  On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it.  Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap.  I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was.Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4.  As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine.  I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?""  But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture.I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt.  Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now.""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III.  The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless.  This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection.Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice.""Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier.  But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much.  Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good.All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose.  Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel.  And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice.""I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe.""  Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders.  Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability.Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance, given the fact he was on the drug, he was only on the drug for the first 20 minutes.  After that, I would've expected him to suddenly become warm and likeable.  Instead, he merely dives into his best Keanu Reeves impersonation and begins dealing with ludicrous amounts of heavily armed soldiers in his attempt to overthrow Libria's regime.  And by ""dealing with,"" I mean, ""Terminating with extreme prejudice.""During the course of the movie, we are subjected to no less than 6 major gunfight scenes, not a single one of them memorable.  The Clericks display incredible superhuman agility and strength, which would be fine if this was the Matrix, but this isn't.  It's set in the future, in the real world, and yet we're supposed to digest the idea that humans can jump 20 feet into the air and dodge the bullets of 20 close-range gunman using ""statistical probability.""I suppose by now you're thinking to yourself, ""This movie sounds awful.  I should go see it just for the cheese factor.""  This is where I warn you that I saw the Transporter and the One, and I enjoyed both on a cheesy action movie level.  I feel confident saying this movie makes abysmal blush. Gut-wrenchingly-awful could stand next to this movie and therefore look attractive in comparison.  After seeing this movie, ritual seppuku seemed like a fun way to pass the time.This movie will be the low marks on the resumes of actors and actresses like Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Sean Bean, and Emily Watson.  Kurt Wimmer, whose visuals were forgettable and his screenplay full of clichés and attempts to rip off many other successful movies and books, will hopefully never write a screenplay again.  And I sincerely hope the entire special effects team returns to throwing together low-budget effects for advertising, because Terminator 2 had more believable special effects.In short:  Do not see this movie.  Ever.  If you see it on movie store shelves, run in the opposite direction screaming.  If not for yourself, then at least for the children.  Do it for the children.",Equilibrium

Obviously as humans, we're emotional beings, so I had no problem dealing with the miniscule showings of emotion that the characters gave.The movie also displayed an interesting martial arts form called Gun-Kata.

Outside of The Matrix series, Equilibrium delivers the most original and creative fight sequences I have seen in years. At several points in the movie, I was literally in awe of the choreography and visual effects used.Surprisingly enough, the story isn't half bad either. Equilibrium lends a nice look at the good and bad that stems from human emotion.I rated this film an 8 out of 10 and thoroughly recommend it.",Equilibrium
564,cheezman20,Like a bolt of lightning...,9,29 May 2003,"I don't understand how this movie passed by me.  Did the Weinsteins even put money into the advertising?  After being fairly letdown by Matrix Reloaded's ""Episode 1"" detachment from the main characters and the fighting it was great to see something that actually had good choreography and characters. It is corny on some parts, and the music is a bit annoying (just like the Matrix), but the cinematography is beautiful and you definitely feel that the director has more tricks up his sleeve.  The symbolism and references to utopia story authors were a lot of fun.  I can't believe this was made for $20 mill... every dollar is on screen and actually worth it (unlike the Matrix).  I guess it was best this didn't get the hype it deserved.  Now it'll be one of those ""cult-classics"".9/10",Equilibrium

So I took a friend and we went to see it. After it was over, I was dumbstruck. I must say, it was one of the best movies Ive seen. It smells of cult-following status along Pitch Black standards, and it wouldnt surprise me if it was the next break out hit of 2002/2003. It is rich with symbolism, and you cant help but feel for John Preston (Christian Bale), especially in the scene when he turns on the classical music. Its awe-inspiring, even though not completely original. I rate it as a firm 9.5/10 - See this movie, bring a friend, then tell them to tell other friends to see this movie.",Equilibrium

Now, if some people actually read up about the movie and the people involved in bringing it to the silver screen, one would notice that the producers and other cast and crew members were actually part of The Matrix.

In a world where emotion is outlawed the top enforcer of the law goes outlaw. Plenty of action for the action junkie, Christian Bale plays the part to perfection. In the top echelon of the ""Clerics"" he drops his anti-emotion meds one day and then just discontues taking it after that. He continues the charade but is increasingly drawn into the world of emotion he has up to now tried to suppress. The movie ends well and is not predictable at all. Christian gives a stellar performance. The movie is well worth seeing. It is a science fiction movie with a pseudo Utopian world. It also has some feeling of Fahrenheit 451.",Equilibrium

I think the director of that ""other"" movie also was of some notoriety.Like the Dark City/Matrix relationship, however, this little gem of a movie has elements which are remarkably superior than its more famous cousin, notably a deeper plumbing of emotion and motivation, including a tremendously powerful scene of a character simply holding a staircase bannister.Calling this a ""little"" gem is a bit of a misnomer as the movie is chock full of Matrix-like gunplay and special effects.  In fact, I'd say it was the movie's main weakness--that the power and depth of the movie is drowned out in somewhat repetitive combat sequences.Still, the movie manages to create a compelling world and tell a story which never fails to engross and entertain.  For the record, I enjoyed the ""other"" movie as well--but the stories are similar enough that I do not recommend watching them back-to-back.

It is reminiscent of the book Farenheit (excuse the spelling)451 and it just sort of reminds me a little of the Matrix.  I would absolutely recommend that anyone who liked the Matrix buy this movie on video or DVD when it comes out.  Since they already took it out of theaters where i live, that is what i will do as soon as it is released.  All in all, I'd say that it is the best movie that i have seen this year.",Equilibrium
573,Christian-Buchner1,A German production trying to look like Hollywood,5,11 December 2002,"Being a German myself, I immediately noticed that this movie is not your typical Hollywood movie. The low budget character of this movie is easily recognizable in the choice of vehicles. The crowd control vehicle looks like a German airport firefighter truck painted in white. And the cars they drive simply don't look American - they appear to be European and Asian brands. Also the uniforms of the special forces remind me of the GSG 9 special forces.But all these details are not necessarily a flaw. It is just a Deja Vu of some sorts to me that immediately made me sense where this movie was shot. Actually it was Berlin. So the set designers simply took stuff that was readily (and cheaply) available and put all of it into a scary and futuristic context. And this was very well done! The vision of the future is believable - at least as much as Orwells vision of 1984 is believable.A lot of the looks and the general appearance of the movie is borrowed from what we have have seen 60 years ago in Nazi Germany. It works well within the Orwell-like setting. Quite different from Orwell's vision is the use of mind controlling drugs and high tech weaponry and gadgets.The acting is surprisingly good. The script does have some flaws, but overall it was crafted like this to support and justify the  breathtaking action sequences. For example I would not believe that a secret underground movement does have such a remarkable arsenal of weapons. After all, all they try to protect is a few emotions caused by books, paintings, music and other ""kitschy"" relics from the past. Why would you try do this with automatic weapons? But hey -- without that premise this movie could not justify this extreme gun brutality which manifests itself in the shootouts with the police force. And without these gunfights the movie would not even deliver half the excitement.Some of the digital special effects are well done, others are not. The martial gun arts that many reviewers praised so much is well executed in most scenes. But very few scenes do look a bit cheesy and are not quite credible.This is clearly a decent B movie. If it only was advertised better in the United States, it would have some potential to attract quite a crowd.  But this product which is meant to compete against Hollywood movies will not find much support from movie distributors and cinemas that historically have pushed the big budget Hollywood productions only. There is your reason for exactly ZERO advertising in the US market.My overall rating is 5 out of 10. This is a European production that disguises itself as a Hollywood movie, excessively using some ideas from Orwell's ""1984"", the book ""Fahrenheit 451"" and other successful movies like ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run"". As such it will appease the Sci Fi loving crowd out there. My Kudos to the producers of this movie.",Equilibrium

575,lycaki,George Orwell meets The Matrix,6,9 March 2003,"George Orwell meets The Matrix.EquilibriumA friend recommended this film to me saying it was a ""Matrix Rip off"" - I think that best describes this film. Before I go on I want  to say that the film is worth seeing if you liked the Matrix and is an acceptable film. I won't give away any of the important storyline (ahem!) so you can read without having any spoilers (which I hate!)Well probably like yourself I've seen the Matrix and indeed love the Matrix. For me it changed slightly the way I view films similar to ""Pulp fiction"" In that after viewing every single film now has a higher bar with which to contend with. Matrix changed the way we deal with time and movement in films - verging artistic filming with slow motion. (Before you say yes I know the Matrix borrowed heavily from the artistic concept of the film ""Ghost in the Shell"" so every film normally copies - it's how much!!!) So we come to the films that try and emulate this. Equilibrium is most definitely one of them. I'm still trying to decide if it's a hats off recognition film of the Matrix and basically saying ""we loved the Matrix here's a film similar - coz we miss it."" or "" let's blatantly copy the Matrix style and see if we can pull it off.""let's go with the Hats off - tipped to the Matrix. The storyline follows a George Orwell 1984 type world based in the future in which emotions are the root of all evil, so to combat them they have banned Art and Literature, tactile contact - having objects and things of beauty (or anything which makes you show expression of emotion). Believing this to cause all the negative emotions in humans that ultimately lead to War/Murder/Hate/destruction. So everyday they have to take their dose of drugs which turns them into ""Vulcans"" In this case the film has many of the qualities that the Matrix has - Style and movement/ fight scenes in slow motion. clever moves. However the filming is a little like ""Dr Who/ Blake7"" directs the ""The Matrix""Based on the mathematical probability of statistical analysis of every ""shootout"" there ever was - here's the best way to move in a gun fight. Ahem! Mmmmm that's what I thought, Tai chi meets Jon Woo style fighting. Does it work - well yes it does. It looks surprisingly good at times and is believable (come on - we are forgiving). Christian Bale (American Psycho) who is always good as an actor is a good choice for a lead. He has haunted looks and credible acting. Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings FOTR) as his partner in the beginning is great as well. I feel without these actors the films may have well died a death - thank God it didn'tSo we end up with a film that's not too bad! Watchable and enjoyable and if it is indeed aimed at being a Matrix tribute film then it's achieved that. In fact we even have our own version of ""the Lobby"" scene.Bottom line if you liked the Matrix you'll like this. It's not brilliant but it's okay.6/10Russ",Equilibrium

It isn't all too predictable either. The focus is being put for a large part on the main character's evolution and discovery of emotions, good but also destructive ones. This paired with Christian Bale's fantastic performance is what really makes this movie such a great emotional journey!The movie also evolves between genres in an incredibly well mastered way, the action scenes might require as always some ""suspension of belief"" (what else do you expect in SF?) but are very aesthetic and great fun to watch (and very original despite Matrix influences).The overall art direction is done cleverly (using different styles between the fascistic control society and the underground resistance for example) and with taste in my opinion. The clean, cool and clinical design of many sets is great.Some scenes, especially the ones where Christian Bale starts to feel the powerful maelstrom emotions can be, will leave you with a lasting impression.Over the years since 2002, I got to see this movie quite a few times.

He plays the role of a ""Grammaton Cleric"", which are some kinds of elite police officiers, in a close post nuclear war society, in charge of making sure people are taking their drugs that prevent them from having any feelings (well strong feelings that is, like love, anger, happiness etc...), to avoid having any other major conflict that would ruin the planet.The story itself is inspired by movies like ""Farenheit 451"" and ""Solient Green"".

The cinematography, the soundtrack, the writing, the action scenes, the performances (albeit not great, but still very good), etc. all fit together perfectly to form what in my opinion is a more-than-excellent film that should have gotten WAY more attention by audiences all over the world. I just regret having watched vastly under-appreciated movies like this and Gattaca so many years after they were released, I'm sure then I would have been blown away by them even more than now.

I don't ever remember seeing the trailer for this film anywhere, which is pretty surprising given the strength of the action sequences alone.  Yet, I'm bombarded by trailers for shite like `You Got Served'.  Makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with Hollywood these days.  But I digress.The gun-kata scene in the beginning of the film has an intensity that rivals anything in the Matrix, and Christian Bale delivers a consistent performance throughout the picture.  Whenever he does battle, there's an overwhelming sense of confidence-there's no doubt in his mind that he's gonna win. That's what he's trained to do.  The climactic finale is one of the best payoffs ever.  Ever.Some of the matte paintings looked a bit dicey, but overall the cinematography is excellent.  This is a cool looking film.  The music is good, though there are places where a more aggressive approach would have worked better.Overall, I would highly recommend Equilibrium to any sci-fi fan.  It's a compelling film, with a solid cast, suspenseful story, and some truly great action.  A solid 8 out of 10 rating.",Equilibrium
584,mrbobzima,Typical and Formulaic Film on Emotionless Societies,4,31 July 2013,"This movies is the birth child of Matrix and Demolition Man. The film also borrows themes from The Scarlet Letter.The foundation that ""medication"" is root to turning people into compliant robots is a tired and worn plot line even if medications designed to dull emotions possible create ""zombies"" out of people over stressed and overwhelmed by daily life or unspeakable tragedy.The production values mimic a comic strip with the use of gray, black and white color schemes. Yes it is done this way to create a stoic point of view for the movie watcher; yet it is formulaic and typical of movies in the genera that have already explored this topic. And of course, like the Wizard of OZ and so many other, full rich and vibrant colors tell the audience, as if we are stupid, that the character is going through change.There are a series of quirky and odd story lines moving toward a typical and transparent plot development found in movies similar to this film that examine a society free of emotion and passion. In addition, the film's thinly veiled and weekly positioned view that blind faith to anything (the film offers up ""religion"") is the quickest root to emotions, passion and trouble. Nothing new here. Been there and seen this in movies houses before.The philosophy and message of this movie is cookie cutter and in many ways presented in a kindergartner's level psychology that left me wondering why am I watching this predictable and cartoonish film that has nothing new to offer that Demolition Man and Matrix have not already brought to the table.No need to worry about a spoiler, the average movie goer let alone film junkie can see the ploy twists coming a mile away.Only two things that saves this movie is Bale's performance of an internally tormented cleric among other robotic and uninteresting characters. Movies that predict and portray a emotionless and passionless futures are more dismal and depressing than entertaining or intriguing.Secondly, the films unwavering dedication to be ""real"" and not allow the hero the chance to ""save the world"" as occurs in so many films of this genera. This film and the producers and director has the guts to allow the hero to dangle in his own pain without the antidote of ""saving the day"" which is contrary to most ""Hollywood endings.""",Equilibrium

Either he thought having to think would be too much of an effort for the audience or he is just a very very poor writer. Beside the 1984 rip-off cliché story, there are the Matrix rip-off fights.

Equilibrium might be posted as an action movie, but there was a very strong element of drama backed by a moderately good plot. The acting is decent, and the failings of lesser characters are made up for by a strong lead.

589,kinglet,"Familiar ingredients, singular experience.",9,26 July 2005,"A 9 out of 10 only for some budget deficiencies that show a bit. By all means skip the director commentary because its all whining about lack of funds. Understandable, but obnoxious to sit through. Let me just comment on a few things not much mentioned in the customer reviews. First, despite what's stated by many and even the IMDb plot summary, the population shown here is not drugged to the point of being ""emotionless"". People have to feel enough to care about family, obeying the rules, succeeding at their jobs, etc. Rather, the highs and lows of emotion have been chemically eliminated. Although this is taught from birth to be necessary for ""sense"" purity, the real reason is that it makes it easier for a repressive regime to stay in power and at least partially prevent rebellion. And for anyone who thinks the mass public attendance of televised political harangues is unrealistic, go rent ""Triumph of the Will"" by the chronicler of Nazi ascendancy, Leni Riefenstahl. And remind yourself that Hitler's adoring masses weren't even drugged.Second, although the drug is used to control emotions, its good old indoctrination that dictates behavior. The drugged state is reinforced by every mind control practice you can think of. Children are rewarded for ratting out parents, friends tattle on friends, etc. While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the rattee, you still get the sense that even children can feel some level of satisfaction in having earned brownie points, done their ""duty"", cleansed their family, whatever. Careful watching or re-watching of this movie shows that people around the edges of the main characters express flickers of emotion according to their job status, with those in more regular jobs having less rein on their responses. By contrast one key character is obviously off his meds, though some viewers seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error. Actually its important to the plot.In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for children. So even John Preston (Christian Bale) seems permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son's acceptance into the cleric training school, which he expresses right in front of the most important boss he has. From what we see its only he and his fellow Grammaton Clerics who are trained to squelch their emotions entirely, as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society's vicious goals.Third, Bale deserves a lot of credit for the way this movie succeeds. He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearly-expressionless man who sets his own liberation in motion through one simple accident (or is it?) while brushing his teeth, a small personal cleansing that suggests bigger things are coming. He's soon slammed hard by emotions he's never been allowed to feel, emotions that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express. Its almost worth the price of rental/purchase to see him play a man hearing his first music, or sitting and watching his children sleep late one night. Even as we realize he's feeling paternal love to a degree he's never felt it before, the fact remains he still can't show it and his kids can't know it or they'll turn him in. By the time he reviews a key event in his personal life, you can feel its horrific impact on him by the merest flicker of reaction on his face, and in the tiniest changes in body language. The tension between what he realizes and feels and what he dares to show builds to an agonizing sub-climax that sets the finale in motion.Fourth, the ironic different between what is expected of people in this dark future and how human nature really operates is used to great effect. Preston's special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what lies beneath, what's behind the wall, what his quarry is thinking. In other words, to sense. This makes him suspect as well as valuable to his masters. The feeling of personal jeopardy builds wonderfully as he experiences more and struggles harderto hide it, particularly as he realizes his special mission is being scrutinized by his new partner.The best sci-fi is never about technology, the best martial arts movies are never about the fighting. The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium, and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release. But its worth your time and then some.",Equilibrium
590,goodmanhunting2003,Breath-taking and captivating film...,8,21 February 2005,"I caught the film from the part when Bale's character Preston runs towards the door and, in full speed, kills everyone in the room in a flash.I fell in love.With the film, that is. I couldn't get up to go and have my dinner! Point is, I haven't seen any of the films being referred to -- 1984, Fahrenheit 451, etc -- though I know of the authors behind them. Who can *not* know Orwell? or have heard of the oft-quoted ""Matrix"". I was never really a science-fiction buff, but having seen this, I may re-consider.I cannot tell you how the beginning started (that itself is a bit of a paradox!) but all I can say that if you haven't seen this film, then you better go to an outlet and get a DVD of it.The only words that I could mutter throughout the film was that it was an allegory. Pls let me explain. One dictionary definition of allegory is ""a story which conveys a meaning different from the literal one"".I think that pretty much sums it up, though I must preface all that by saying, then again, most films carry a subtext that transcends the literal.Christian Bale's acting was superb. Add to that the concatenation, or combination, of the fight sequences, which I though were original in their own ways from ""The Matrix"". The kung-fu styles and the artistic manner in which the fights were choreographed were downright sexy.Yes, they exuded an originality that I personally didn't find in the Matrix. This film is in a class of its own, and that is why I think I have rambled incessantly.Cutting to the chase, I would like to add that the idea that we could live in a world where we are devoid of emotion is scary. I don't think this will ever happen. That said, I thought the justification for killing people because they started to feel emotions was credible. In a world where values are tipped upside down, everything is acceptable. But, in so many ways, this film is not just about the future.It doesn't reek so much of eschatological themes that predominate the oft-quoted ""Matrix"", ""Gattica"", to name but two...but more of the reality we are heading towards right here, right now in 2005.How many of us are impassionate towards the picture of people starving in Africa, or disasters in parts of the world where, as Neville Chamberlain said (paraphrased)-- in 1938 to his UK constituents before the so-called ""appeasement"" towards Hitler over Czechoslovakia became entrenched in history--of a country we know little of?? How many times have we tried to intervene on someone's behalf when something bad is happening to them, or when someone is in trouble? Some may say we are already living ""privatised"" lives, and to that extent, we are slowly and surely becoming bereft of the emotions that so characterised life a long time before Reagan and Thatcher botched things up and brought the culture of profit over people as the most important element of human personality.You could argue that there are elements of a post-911 world in here intermixed with fears of the ""Nether"" (wasn't that the name of the downtown that the clerics and their enforcers would go to to destroy ""contraband""?), but the point is no film is written without the context of the reality of the day, and so if it is that, then it is small wonder.WHat is wonderful, however, is the blend of reality, plus the possibility of a future that will never happen, including stunning visuals that help provoke thoughts of what being human is really about that counts.You cannot watch this film without leaving it feeling something. In that sense, the director and the writers and the people who came up with the theme -- as unoriginal as it may or may not have been -- were successful.Because in the end, we all felt something, and we were all provoked and thoroughly disturbed.For me, that is the making of a successful film.I give it an 8/10",Equilibrium
591,sas318,Great,8,2 October 2013,"I liked this movie a lot. I liked the plot, the idea that there was a drug to eliminate human emotion and that feeling was a crime. Christian Bale was excellently cast as the stoic Preston. He was emotionless on the outside but his emotions were revealed in his facial expressions, and he was brilliant acting them out.The worse part was the gun battles. Gun kata or not, it's not even believable that one man could defeat 10 men surrounding him in a circle. Impossible. I watched this movie twice and fast forwarded the gun battles the second time.Brandt was supposedly emotionless but he did laugh and later give a macho speech about how he captured Preston. Taye Diggs' character was annoying in general. I wished there were more Sean Bean screen time.The ending was a bit rushed. I would've liked another 30 minutes to see Preston and Jurgen meet up again to talk about the aftermath of the revolution or at least some dialogue acknowledging it.",Equilibrium
592,meckert-3,A sci-fi classic !,9,8 June 2005,"Well, ""Equlibrium"" is one of the gratest sci-fi movies ever ... It's a crossover between Orwell's ""1984"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Bladerunner"". Like in ""1984"" the main character, Preston lives in a totalitarian state - Libria. He is a grammaton cleric, a man who is train to fight and kill ""sense offenders"" - people who chose to feel, rather than take prozium - a drug that eliminates emotions. All Librians have to take prozium daily - they are a society that eliminated all human emotions, which they believed are the source of all evil. Preston forgets to take his doze of prozium one day and wakes up as a different man ...Similar to ""The Matrix"" we have great fighting scenes, but unlike Neo Preston doesn't have any unnatural abilities, so he uses plain fists, guns, or samurai blades and all laws of physics apply :-) Like in ""Bladerunner"" in ""Equlibrium"" we see a post-apocalypse hi-tech society, and a lone man who is trying to find out what he's true feelings are.Christian Bale plays great, same as all remaining actors. The special effects are there and they look good, but computer generated graphics are only a background and unlike many of today action films the focus is on the characters, not the technical fireworks of computer generated animations.The movie has some minor downsides: first of all it is too short ! 107 minutes is not enough - additional 30 minutes would add depth to the action and would allow to expand character's backgrounds. Second thing is that we get to see Sean Bean only during the first 15 minutes of the movie - what a waste ! But in the end ""Equlibrium"" is a true masterpiece, that outclasses IMHO all the ""Matrix"" movies ..... 9/10 !!!",Equilibrium

This not being a highly advertised, big Hollywood blockbuster action film, I thought it was going to be ""ok"" at best. But the film is brilliantly executed, with a very good script, a wonderful, dark look that carries the background story very well, and spectacular, original, jaw-dropping action sequences to go with all that, too.5 minutes into the film I was already hooked. The performances are also excellent, and Christian Bale in particular, in this pre-Batman time, is nothing short of remarkable, in a demanding role of a character developing and transforming throughout the story. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job, too.All in all, this is one of those ""hidden gems"" that should not be missed. Very, very impressive.",Equilibrium

I have seen BIG BROTHER (the movie, not the show) but this is different. I liked how the world was made, how it looked, the names: Tetragramaton, Neather, etc. Also, the scene where Preston beings to feel, while listening to Beethoven or the one where he tears the white sheet in front of the window to see the sunrise are BRILLIANT. It really shows what could happen in a world without feelings. The only fault was this: if they had no feelings than why did they applaud so loudly, why did they smile, why did Preston's partener fight with such passion. I think that the actors should have been more robotic. All in all, a great movie.",Equilibrium

Not surprisingly, there were many comparisons made to the Matrix, but I think that this movie has a more solid feel to it. The Matrix, while still a good film, tries to be Philosophy 101 on the internet. Equilibrium is more direct with its cultural references, and thus comes across as being more authentic. The technology used in the movie is advanced, but not so much so that one feels this film takes place too far in the future. I also must admit that Christian Bale is a far better actor the infamous Mr. Reeves. The action sequences do utilize special effects, but don't go overboard with the ""bullet time"" shots that saturate almost every action film nowadays. The music is appropriate to the context of the film, and fortunately omits popular tunes which most action films use as an attempt to be more ""hip."" I would recommend this film to individuals who enjoy sci-fi with action that doesn't involve gigantic spaceships blasting one another with laser guns.",Equilibrium
597,knight-36427,A bunch of good ideas sacrificed on the altar of badassness,4,19 July 2018,"Part 1984, part Matrix, Equilibrium is yet another take on the Orwellian dystopia, the twist being that there's no such thing as police brutality or Big Brother but ""emotion control"": by using a drug, the entire population of earth (or at least those who survived a global scale world war) can't feel anything anymore and live without a care. Despite its many logic plot holes (why would someone who has no emotion invest so much time trying to prove a collegue isn't taking his daily pill? Why would anyone even work when they can just spend their time ""existing"" and roam around?), Equilibrium had all the cards to give an original take on the genre but quickly brushes it off the moment it introduces its main character, played by Christian Bale: a government agent trained to become as similar to The Matrix's Neo as possible, without the charm or the style of the aforementioned movie. Sooner than you realize, Equilibrium sacrifices its themes in favor of bombastic action packed sequences that actually manage to thrill in more than one occasion, but feel empty and unrewarding most of the time. 
The ending doesn't salvage the situation but rather makes it even more unbearable with a ""final boss"" to beat through a boring and predictable fight scene. As far as action movies go, Equilibrium doesn't shine and definitely loses in comparison to the movies it tried to mimic so hard. On the other hand, if you're just trying to spend some time watching Bale juggling around and kill everything he sees it may be worth your while",Equilibrium

But face it, if you go into any action movie with such a closed mind, you're going to find comparisons to The Matrix and they will never be as good.  So 'FORGET THE MATRIX', the tagline, doesn't so much mean to actually forget the Matrix as does mean stop your crying about everything being a ripoff.  The fact that they too wear some pretty cool clothing and there are gun fight sequences is as a far a comparison as can be made.That being said, this is a highly entertaining sci-fi movie.  The acting by Christian Bale is excellent as expected.  The martial art form practiced by the clerics that treats the gun as a total weapon makes for most impressive fight sequences.  It is truly stunning for such a budget.  There were few minor parts of scenes that seemed unnecessary but you soon forget them when the action starts back up.If you watch movies for entertainment rather than to pick apart plot holes (there aren't that many) or draw comparisons to see how far they fall short, you'll enjoy this movie. 9/10  (10/10 to the dog)",Equilibrium

Completely absurd and never explains itself using any possible science. I mean, why didn't they say the monks had cybernetics or something? At least then it would be theoretically possible to do what they do.Secondly, the plot holes. Massive, drive-a-truck-through them plot-holes. I don't really want to give away anything here, but the entire end sequence should have most intelligent film-watchers shaking their heads in disbelief at the feeble attempts at explanation and plot twists. Good plot twists are feasible, bad plot twists are simply there for shock value. These are of the latter variety.Thirdly the main concept of the movie isn't particularly interesting or particularly new to most sci-fi fans. State controls feelings? Feelings make us human? Pass the remote.It's not all bad, the austerity of the future world is captured well and the action scenes are pretty cool as action scenes go, but really this film needs a lot more brains than it pretends to have to be a worthwhile watch (although it seems to have fooled a lot of viewers).",Equilibrium

It's exciting.  I haven't been this excited since I came home from the Matrix.  I don't want to make many comparisons to it because so many other people are, but this film blew me away like so few others that it recalls my Matrix experience.
This will probably be a short review because I can't hold back, I want to tell this story so badly.  But know this: This is a serious, thought provoking, heart pounding, blow your mind kind of movie.  I didn't take my wife, but I spent 2 hours after I got home telling her all about it.  She hates guns, but she appreciates good story telling.  This one too, is really more about emotions than pure ""action.""  There are only a couple scenes that are violent enough to merit an R rating and the language isn't bad.  This is a serious movie that knows what it's out to accomplish.  I have to say I'm glad they didn't load it down with unneccessary gore/sex/language.

My only real qualm with this movie is the set design. It was probably the last thing considered in the budget,but the writing is done well enough where its pretty easily overlooked.

This film suffers by comparison, because it came out afterwards and the styling feels informed by (but not derivative of) the earlier Wachowski Bros movie. However, although I liked the Matrix sequels, this is at least equal in vision, style and delivery.It is a superb movie as far as I'm concerned. Here's why: 1) Interesting premise, engagingly plotted: what would a society where emotion is banned be like? What would you gain? What would you lose? The plot works. It's not clumsy. It doesn't plod as afar as I'm concerned.2) Great, great cast: Bale is very, very good. I've read elsewhere that others have a different perception, but I thought he played a conflicted professional enforcer very well indeed. His emotional reawakening was convincing for me. The rest of the cast impresses no end. Bean and Pertwee appear fleetingly in all but cameo roles - yet... they pack punch and panache. Taye Diggs has you rooting for Bale (which is exactly what his performance is calculated to do) and Angus Macfadyen holds your attention with a solid turn.3) Great denouement: No spoilers here, but the climax is just that - a climax. The film doesn't go off the boil and it handles events more realistically than many big-action blockbusters of the last few years.All in all, a satisfying movie experience that I am happy to give 8/10 to.

Unlike most films that truly are just trying to cash in on the cool special effects found in the Matrix, Equilibrium goes the extra mile to actually give a reason why Batman goes on an insane killing spree, not just something like ""they killed my dog.""The back story is simple and gives a lot of promise to create a good plot, which happens. It gets kinda of slow towards the end, but as is often the case its very hard to come up with a good ending to a movie like this, so the fact they were even able to come up with something halfway decent should be looked at as an success. The before mentioned slow parts combined with two or three ""give me a break"" monuments result in the 8/10 instead of something higher.

May appeal to 10 year old boys.What intrigues me more is how this bomb managed to get 7.5 on IMDb? I have religiously used IMDb for years as a cross reference for some unknown films - and usually anything over a 7 is reasonably good - especially if you throw in someone like Christian Bale. Some great films rank lower, as maybe they're a little out on the proverbial left field, but this should not clear 4. And that's being generous.

Usually something of the movie registers, but not with this one. It was no small low budget independent thing either and I'm amazed it wasn't promoted better.I recommend this movie, it's visually stunning and raised a lot of interesting questions.

I'm sorry but whomever tries to praise this movie obviously has very little knowledge of film or is so brain dead and numbed by ""cool guns"" that they actually think this movie is remotely good.
As soon as Sean Bean died this movie just went downhill.  I honestly feel sorry that so many talented actors were suckered into starring in the next Robot Jox.  It's not hard being wooden as an actor and I do have respect for Bale, but this dead-pan ""anti-emotion"" thing just wasn't happening with me. The plot is a rehashed cheese 1984 meets Darkman.  Talk about bad.I won't knock Weimer though.  This was his first film and I can only hope that this movie was severely edited or had lots of script changes due to budget constraints and production house pressures.  Maybe he took it upon himself to take credit (or more like blame) for the writing.  Some films that were supposed to be excellent have been hampered by studio interference.  Maybe Weimer wasn't big on standing up to the production house or maybe, just maybe, his direction and writing really is that bad. Though I certainly hope that I am wrong about the latter statement.Alien 3 is a good example of a noble idea being tarnished by the production company.  A good director (David Fincher) who was so disappointed with the studio control that he walked out on it!  Did Weimer do the same thing?  I hope there was at least some dissent between his ""idea"" and Dimension Films'.Hopefully he will do better the next time around but, then again, some directors never learn from their mistakes.  Stuart Baird is a good example. Speaking of which, this and Star Trek Nemesis rank among the lamest Sci-Fi films I have seen in recent times.A film that's supposed to be Sci-Fi has to at least be interesting.  Sure the Matrix has ripped off other films but this one is so blatant and so badly completed that it doesn't deserve any good review in it's present state.  The Action scenes are pretty weak for 20 million.  If you want to see how a good low-budget action film is made check out El Mariachi.  I believe it was done on a budget of about $7,000.  Legions beyond this.Again, I don't want to rip into Weimer but I have to say that if his next film is as bad as this one, then I'll know that the reason Equilbrium was such a poor film was because of the direction.There's a good reason that this film was in limited release.

EQUILIBRIUM is, by far, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. With a tightly written, deeply involving script balanced with original action, suspense, intrigue, a few great twists, quality actors, quality production, great sets, nice costumes, fantastic cinematography and a well-balanced soundtrack, the title is aptly earned.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Angus McFayden and Emily Watson make a great ensemble, each with a distinct role to play and never over- or underexposed.  THere are no wasted lines of dialogue.  In fact, you'll find some of the most poignant and emotional moments are the quietest: Preston seeing the rainbow after a rainstorm for the first time, Preston revealing his deepest secret to Mary, Preston witnessing the inspired and devastating results of his actions. All of these moments are wordless, the anquish, torment, awe, shock, and every other emotion depicted with facial expressions and gestures. I won't bother you with a synopsis, you've probably already read one here on IMDB or elsewhere.  I'll simply tell you this: If you want to spend a couple of hours involved with a solid plot, well-written characters, adrenaline fueled action scenes, and rich visuals, EQUILIBRIUM is the movie for you.

The plot, to be fair, is nothing original (straight from the likes of 1984, The Handmaid's Tale and other sci-fi flicks depicting a future dystopia) however, this does not limit the films appeal. The films also raises important morale questions about freedom to choose and freedom to feel, and whether a society can ever fully function without true emotions and mental functions.

So, when I learned that the DVD was being made available, I pre-ordered it and waited with much anticipation. Five minutes into the movie, things are going well. Then, our lead man storms a room and I watch in horror as cartoon-ish CGI effects are applied to the rapid arm movements of Cleric John Preston, as he annihilates a group of emotional offenders. I do not exaggerate, the arms were not even the same color as the rest of Preston's suit. To top it all off, cheesy ""whoosh"" sound effects were added each time Preston's arms moved. A minute later, we see Preston overlooking a stash of hidden artwork, and a portrait of the Mona Lisa is presented to him. The Mona Lisa a teeny piece of art, painted onto a piece of wood- any self respecting European knows this (I'm a stupid American, BTW...) But, in the movie, the painting was at least two feet wide. ??? Why?!So, the movie progresses a little more, and I'm still simmering over two blatant misrepresentations, and things are going well. A person dies, blah blah blah, then we meet Brandt. Preston, the greatest of all Clerics who can ""sense"" when someone is an emotional offender completely ignores that Brandt is smiling and chuckling, yes SMILING and CHUCKLING, when he says good bye to him after their initial meeting. We're not even past the first 15 minutes people, and there are still 92 more to go.Anyway, I'll cut this review short. I wanted to like this movie. But, it's bad. The gun-kata idea was a nice touch, though not original as many have said. If you can ignore blatant errors in plot, special effects and character motivation, by all means, watch the movie. I'm sure there's a hidden message in there somewhere. But, rent before you buy. If had known that the director would be so slack, I would have never bought the movie. 5 out of 10 stars.",Equilibrium
623,bcarson60,Couldn't get past the ridiculous premise,2,24 May 2004,"The premise of this film is that in some near post-WWIII future, citizens must surrender their emotions in order to prevent WWIV. Apparently a society whose citizens subject their emotional lives to state control becomes pacifist -- societies that have actually attempted to do so, from ancient Sparta to modern North Korea, notwithstanding.So the premise is that violence can be prevented by breeding sociopaths. Actually, that could sustain a pretty interesting film, but not one that takes the premise seriously. Alas, Equilibrium takes itself far too seriously.But then this is an action film, so you don't expect the screenwriters ever to have cracked a history text or ever to have read a newspaper, and a laughable premise doesn't have to ruin the fun, as long as the action maintains a manic pace. No such luck. While the action is okay when it happens, it's not quite frequent enough, not quite fast enough, and not nearly clever enough to sustain the C-movie plot.",Equilibrium
624,tryptamine,more then just a good movie..,10,9 June 2003,"Some of the reviews on this board are downright laughable.. Just watched this movie twice in a row and I am thoroughly impressed, mostly by the emotional response and the ""blown away"" feeling it gave me.  I've been watching movies all my life, I am well over a quarter of a century old, own over 1000 movies, and this is truly a gem.. The only other action/sci-fi/drama films that gave me such a response the first time I watched them (and repeatedly after) are The Terminator, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Usual Suspects, Leon (latter 3 are non-sci-fi, I know, but still action/drama), and perhaps on a bit smaller scale Dark City and Predator. Some others that come to mind as far as sci-fi goes are The Thirteenth Floor, Pitch Black, Cube, but again, not nearly as effective as EQ. There are probably a very few more that I cannot remember now that I missed.  As far as problems with the movie, I found much less trouble with this movie then The Matrix for example, this movie had almost no mistakes, everything that happened could be explained, if different by every viewer, whereas in The Matrix I was questioning some things towards the end of the movie, to which I could come up with the answers but most likely the writers would not agree.  Taye was my only problem in EQ, his character was a bit too emotional, but this again could be explained by him skipping his dose on purpose after he first finds out (without proof) that John has skipped his (with the book scene, that was probably the point).  I loved the Matrix, and I am only comparing the two due to the overwhelming comparrisons between these two movies, which were really very different, but I have to say that Neo doesn't even come close to the hero that Preston is, Preston blew me away like no other hero since Jet Li's character Wong Fei Hong in the Once Upon A Time In China series.  I loved the fact that the hero was nearly untouchable (very asian style) and almost god like, although still just a well trained human.  EQ borrows from other movies and ideas, which every movie of course does (Matrix borrowed mostly from Asian techniques, I am a huge asian movie fan as well (well, german and spanish and italian too, lol), but EQ still manages to be very original in its storytelling, and it made me feel like I haven't watched it before, even though I've seen all the movies that have been compared to it (such as 1984, fahrenheit 451, minority report, or the book brave new world).anyhow, 4.5/5 (excellent movie, should be watched by fans of all genre, will be especially enjoyed by fans of sci-fi/action/drama fans).",Equilibrium
625,theeroticmonkey,An excellent and exciting sci-fi outing,7,29 January 2008,"You can argue about the films derivative nature all you want and i will come to that later. But in essence the film is an action film and it does this extremely well. The fight scenes are extremely well choreographed and are handled slickly and profesionally. The gun fights are both exciting and fun to watch and the characters, all though not particularly believable or well developed, are compelling enough to push the narrative on. Christian Bale puts in an good, admittedly not ground breaking, performance and the rest of the cast does an alright job considering the nature of the film and the fairly poor script. The films influences are clear and there is an extremely thin line between being influenced by something and copying. However i believe it is unfair to say that this films copies Farenheit 451 or 1984. The only reason people say this is because it's a dystopian society. To say that this film just copies these is ridiculous as in reality the only similarity is the fact that they are all set in dystopian societies. Another problem touted by the film's pedantic critics is that it is just a rehash of the Matrix in a vaguely different setting. Once again i believe this to be unfounded. Whether you like the film or not the Matrix has undeniably influenced popular cinema ever since and the fight scenes have been emulated in many films, not just Equilibrium. To bad mouth the film because it has exciting combat sequences seems to me to be down right ridiculous. This is a science fiction action film at it's most exciting and entertaining with gun battles and sword fights galore. If you wish to be excited, and aren't hung up on trying to pick holes in the film, then you could do a lot worse that buy this.",Equilibrium

Christian Bale, continuing on the path undertaken with Reign of Fire, is brilliantly restrained and fully dimensional as the hero struggling with spiritual awakening.

627,beyondstain,Revolutionary action that revives a long lost fear.,10,7 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Equilibrium is a movie with a purpose: show you mind-bending and awe-inspiring action as well as give you a distinct sense of suspense. First off, I have read a lot of other reviews saying that this movie is just a rip-off of The Matrix and Minority Report.  This is not true.  There are no revolutionary stories anymore.  They have all been done before in some way and the point now is to improve instead of invent.  Equilibrium does this perfectly.  You can say that The Matrix was a revolutionary film but it really wasn't.  The special effects were revolutionary but it was a standard story with some damn fine film-making behind it.Now that all comparisons have been dismissed, the action in Equilibrium is way above average.  I will even go so far as too say that the action in The Matrix can't best the gunfights in Equilibrium.  They invented an entirely new style of fighting called Gun Kata which relies on 360 degree movement of the arms and body to destroy an opponent with relative ease.  Equilibrium contains the best action scenes I have ever witnessed.  Your heart will jump and thump like crazy as Cleric Preston kills without remorse.  You won't want to leave the theater.Of course, it can't be all about action.  Kurt Wimmer develops a story that is reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451 but that doesn't detract from how entrapped you become as you watch John Preston feel for the first time in his life. Here is the basic story:  John Preston lives in a dismal future where world war 3 has destroyed most of the planet.  The government decides that the cause of the killing is human emotion so they create a drug called prozium that the populace takes in order to suppress their emotions (I say suppress because there are displays of emotion.  if you consider this instead of eliminating emotion, you'll like the movie more.).  John Preston is one of the Cleric.  An order of highly trained officers who eliminate people who commit ""sense offense"" (those who do not take prozium and harbor emotional content such as music, literature, art, or anything that you can feel.) He kills without hesitation until he misses a dose of prozium and discovers how wonderful feeling is.  His new partner Cleric Brandt (played almost too emotionally by Taye Diggs) suspects Preston's feelings and works to catch him.  In his search for feeling, he discovers he is the only person who can bring down this terrible regime.  And he does so with purpose and style in one of the most amazing conflicts ever captured on film.Wimmer uses natural light and great cinematography to give his movie a gritty yet futuristic look.  Equilibrium moves with purpose toward the final confrontation and even gives multiple twists in order to keep you guessing. Despite all this, the movie is almost stolen by Christian Bale's performance as Cleric John Preston.  When he is emotionless, it's chilling.  When he is feeling, it's intense as can be.  His eyes carry a purpose that you can feel in your bones.  Bale is always serious and in Equilibrium, you know he is dangerous.  Taye Diggs gives a fairly good performance as Cleric Brandt but nowhere near his chillingly emotionless character in The Way of the Gun.
After all is said and done, Equilibrium stole my heart.  I said, goodbye Matrix, goodbye Minority Report and walked out of the theater in awe. This is the MUST SEE movie of past 5 years.  It is in limited release so it's not everywhere but If you can get to it, you better do it or else stop going to see movies at all because you no longer deserve the priviledge.  Grade: A-.",Equilibrium

The movie has fantastic performances (particularly from Christian Bale), an involving plot, super set design, and the action sequences are truly unlike anything you have ever seen.

The plot has its share of gaps, but Bale is convincing in his role as a emotionless ""cleric"".Of course, the real highlight of the movie is its stylized action scenes, where the introduction of ""gun kata"" will have action junkies drooling.

But if you are looking for a movie that will leave your mouth open this movie is it.

We have all seen films where people use whatever is at hand to inflict death and mayhem to the enemy. This takes it to a new level. Guns AND martial arts combined works on screen here! I can honestly say that Miramax have shot themselves in the foot with the release schedules they had. This film deserved far more publicity than it was given. Shame. I am sure that many people who loved films like the Matrix will simply drool after watching this film.This film could have been a Blockbuster for anyone who likes to see ""Rage against the Society"" and win.

I thought, ""what the heck, it can't be that bad..."". At the time I was a bit tired on all those soulless action-blow-them-all-movies being produced in Hollywood at a rate of fifteen in a dozen...Try then to imagine my surprise when it starts out good and then gets better! Even the wifey who normally doesn't like my choice of action-flicks got drawn into the living room (although it might have been Christian Bale's ""fault"" too...).Cubic is IMO what Matrix2 and 3 should have been all about. I can't help notice that Cubic does use almost the identical formula action-wise, as does Matrix, but smarter. One could say the main difference is that I care more about what happens to the ppl in Cubic than in Matrix... The characters are more believable. And yeah, the plot seems stupid at times, and the background with WW3 and 4, sure, but it's well done if you get my drift.It's often an overseen fact that cheapo B and C-grade flicks *have* to rely on a better script and on better acting actors, in order to make it to the public (or rather to the shelves as is more often than not the case) than your regular Hollywood multi-million dollar flick.Basically Cubic is a Matrix with brains.

633,bbaum-6,Equilibrium is filmmaking delirium,2,18 December 2010,"All I ask of a film is a modicum of plausibility. Are the people credible? Is there some distinct human quality that I can identify as real? Does the plot make any sense? Yes, I know this is science fiction, but even this genre has to meet some minimum standard of plausibility. I'll give you an example of what I mean. Take the TV series, The Prisoner with the late Patrick McGoohan. OK, it wasn't based on the aftermath of World War 4, like Equilibrium. (I'm glad to see mankind pulled through World War III relatively unscathed.) The Prisoner series was based on some hard to identify tyrannical leader who's agents and police tried to control the minds and behavior of residents trapped on a distant island. The TV series was infinitely more interesting, thought-provoking and plausible than Equilibrium. The Patrick Mcgoohan character had more depth, more character than that posed by Christian Bale. Bale is a very solid actor. I've seen him in several films and the guy has genuine talent. But watching him in this move was like watching ice melt over a period of 90 minutes. Then, there were the gun- firing machinations, where the Bale character uses the physics of ballistics and human psychology to anticipate the trajectory of bullets, all in a matter of nanoseconds. Such tactics apparently enabled one man to kill several dozens of highly armed soldiers in brief thunderous cascades of gunfire. As I began, the film is utterly devoid of plausibility--- and thus ultimately boring.",Equilibrium
634,theconjourer,"As Good as The Matrix, just different.",8,13 March 2011,"I honestly wasn't expecting much going into this movie. Like many other people, it looked like a movie trying to look like The Matrix. However I was pleasantly surprised that not only was it cool, but it actually had a plot, and a plot that kept me guessing. The story is as follows. In the future emotion has been outlawed, and people take a drug to help suppress emotion. Christian Bale is what is known as a Cleric, and his mission is to eradicate ""sense offenders"" or people who have been caught feeling emotion. After a series of incidents, Christian Bale's character ends up missing his dosage of the emotion suppression medication, and then the story takes off from there. The biggest surprise for me was that despite this looking like an action movie, the action seems lightly sprinkled in with the arch of the main character. The pity is that, with a bigger budget and possibly a few better direction choices this could have been better. They did do a great job with what they had though. The story is great, action was very good. For anyone who wants to see it, I will admit the beginning is pretty cheesy, but once you get past the first few minutes and just get into it, it becomes great.

The vehicles were a little unimaginative and the Third Reich sets a bit predictable but the fight/action scenes were exciting and pretty fresh. Emily Watson (The Water Horse, Red Dragon) is beautiful in this film and all gave convincing performances. Equilibrium has some easy twists and is a great escape from our way too cynical world. I found it an equal mix of Dark City and The Matrix with similar forgivable holes.I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 because fun must prevail over the tyranny of one star seriousness.

637,OpinionatedBystander,I cannot believe this movie was made,1,1 January 2003,"Spoiler Alert After reading many other user's comments, I'm beginning to think that many of the ""positive"" reviews out there are nothing more than thinly disguised sarcastic cracks. While this movie wasn't a total disaster, it is unthinkable that anybody would willingly and without jest rank this movie as a 10.Many people have already addressed the acting in this movie. It's sufficient, and in some cases, quite convincing. After all, since the characters in the movie are supposed to be devoid of emotion, saying the performances are ""wooden"" doesn't really do the actors any justice. Of course they're wooden. They're supposed to be, remember? A-The special effects were so-so. There was nothing new brought to the table, but what the movie did provide was thoroughly entertaining. The editing on the action sequences was sub-par. Too many fast-cuts and blurred shots make it too obvious that the movie was straining to make mediocre scenes seem exciting and quick-paced, while hiding what was actually going on. Too many times during the movie, I found myself wondering, ""what the heck just happened? Where did those people come from? And why are they already dead?"" Compared to a movie like the Matrix, where the action scenes were well choreographed and brilliantly executed, the action scenes in this movie are chaotic and rough. B-And now, we come to the actual script and storyline. And within the story lie the reasons why I cannot believe this movie was actually made. Although many have already said this: This movie's story was about as hackneyed and trite as humanly possible. It was as if a group of washed-up Hollywood writers had sat down and penned the story over a quick lunch. Yes, this story takes material from such classics as Fahrenheit 451 and a Brave New World, and so forth. That's not the problem. The problem is that every line of dialogue is so insipid that any scene that doesn't involve somebody getting shot is a pain to sit through. There are no twists in the movie, at least none that would have any effect on the audience. The storyline is so weak and illogical that even for an action movie it borders on the ridiculous. I'm not against ridiculous things happening in movies, for they are fantasy, but Equilibrium is ridiculous but yet tries to be serious and meaningful at the same time. It's difficult for any movie to make the audience think it has watched something worthwhile, no matter how well it was made. For a movie like Equilibrium, it's impossible. DThat said, the last 5 minutes of the movie are perhaps the worst 5 minutes of any movie, ever. Weak, utterly weak. Poorly edited and confusing.

641,bobbyandbeans,So Much Potential,5,2 June 2012,"This movie is very interesting and I give it kudos for trying to tackle the subject of a fascist government and their enforcers the way that it did, but every time I watch it I just see how much potential it has to be better. Most audience members pick up on the gun swap plot hole immediately, which means writer-director Kurt Wimmer should have as well.When movie makers give up common sense for the sake of being slick and smooth, this too is bothersome. The gunfight scenes, where Bale is standing in one place while shooting at various targets, is a bit silly. Standing in one place makes you an easy target, and no amount of supposed physical training will change that.A few other cleanups to the plot and overall premise might have also made it a bit more believable. For example, why not have a regimented, rigid society where you're forced to medicate if you don't follow the rules? I have a hard time believing an entire society of people would just take doses of a mind-altering drug without question, and rounding up criminals and forcing them to medicate seems more logical than just killing people on sight. Forcing medication onto dangerous criminals and those with violent mental illnesses is already a hot topic today, so I can see it being worked into a script somewhat easily.Even with these shortcomings, the film is definitely worth watching and it has its own appeals. The action sequences were IMHO better than the overblown Matrix walking-on-ceiling scenes, and the delivery of the message in Equilibrium was much less heavy-handed than the constant sermonizing in the Matrix trilogy. Bale does a great job as the tough guy that suddenly discovers his heart, and Taye Diggs holds his own as the self-absorbed company man. Fichtner is always fun to watch, and of course it's just not an action movie until Sean Bean dies. I highly recommend giving it a try, if you can overlook its few shortcomings and appreciate what it does get right.",Equilibrium
642,Carnoic,An Excellent Film.,10,3 April 2003,"I really enjoyed this film.Equilibrium explores vaguely similar ideas to those dealt with in The Matrix, but, in my opinion, it is not just a copycat film made to cash in on the success of The Matrix. For such a low budget film what has been achieved is very impressive.It takes some fairly standard SF ideas: dystopian, post-apocalyptic future; oppressive omnipresent State machine; a group of rebels fighting for change and puts a different slant on them.Equilibrium examines the idea of the State forcing people to taking mood-suppressing medication to prevent negative, destructive emotional consequences such as War. This is supposedly a sincere attempt to protect Society from further collapse. However, the State's fear of strong emotion means it also suppresses positive, creative emotions like Love and it kills those who refuse to subscribe to its ideology. In the film the State's argument is that Liberty for citizens breeds chaos and danger: therefore sacrificing individual freedom will protect Society as a whole.The film's main character John Preston undergoes a conversion from perfect State enforcer without a conscience to passionate Rebel quite simply because he accidentally misses a dose of the universally dispensed mood suppressant ""Prosium"". He begins to feel emotions for the first time in his life. His consequent emotional confusion leads him to make a snap decision to save the lives of Rebels he was sent to kill. His ultimate role in the film is to turn the skills he was taught to kill Rebels against the State that created him.Preston has to come to terms with the consequences of his past actions as a tool of State oppression. His naivete and lack of experience in dealing with his newfound guilt and emotions causes complications that lead to his potential destruction and that of the rebellion.Christian Bale gives a moving and credible performance in the role of John Preston. The range of physical and emotional talents he displays in this film is impressive. His portrayal of a man dealing with feelings for the first time in his life is sensitively handled and is far from stereotypical. In fact the entire cast of this film give strong performances.I would recommend this film to people who enjoy Martial Arts and SF films.",Equilibrium

A friend of mine highly praised the sci fi flick, so when I say it airing on the sci fi channel, I thought I might as well watch it.I've seen enough movies to know it was awful. The story was going places, but it wasn't taken anywhere. Instead, most of the script focused on the unrealistic, fight scenes with cleric John Preston and other characters using ""gun Kata.""Plot holes abounded. From moments when a character is accused of being guilty of ""relations with a woman"" when the man himself had two children, and no one seemed to have a problem with that. He had been married previously as well, and yet that wasn't a crime.The infamous ""gun swap"" occurred, in which Preston trades guns with Brandt, unrealistically as well, and the death of a cleric is incredibly fake as his body slides apart.I will admit, visually, it has a certain appeal. The primary colors used are black and white, to represent the unfeeling setting that the movie takes place in. The only scene with any more color than that is a fight scene between Cleric John Preston and his oppressor, which struck me as symbolic as well as John running blood stained fingers over the image of Father, a man he felt betrayed by.

I commend him in his acting and choice of roles. The story line of course was excellent in its writing. I enjoyed every bit of it most especially the gun fight scenes. They were well rehearsed. I just enjoyed watching them over and over. The music used in the film was well incorporated. Christian performed his lines with excellent style as always. He never fails to deliver the role written for the movie. I hope that Christian Bale will continue to do more action movies because he does them so well like this one. I will watch this movie over and over. I hope that someday Christian Bale will be publicly honoured in awards and events for his professionalism and talent.,Equilibrium

I heard about it first from the guys over at Penny Arcade, and they both gave it good reviews.The action is superb, the camera-work is amazing, and the acting is good all round.  The plot itself is vaguely reminiscent of many things.  1984 is one of those things, as is Fahrenheit 451.  This film is not as existential as The Matrix, but is certainly just as deep.Not one to ramble too much, all I really have to say is: If you liked 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and/or The Matrix, you really should watch Equilibrium.",Equilibrium

651,lynseytate,What A Surprise,9,19 July 2011,"I'm not a fan of action movies, but I loved the fight sequences in ""Equilibrium"" - they're beautifully choreographed and the characters are so smartly costumed its a visual treat. I'm indifferent to romance in movies, probably because its done so often and so very badly, but the superbly portrayed sexual and romantic tension between Bale's and Watson's characters is surprisingly believable and totally hot. I generally cannot stand the lone-hero-fighting-dystopia theme because it's so overdone, lacks credibility and usually ends depressingly badly, but ""Equilibrium"" is so well-acted and beautifully filmed that I forgot to hate it.Did I mention the acting is wonderful? I know there wasn't enough blandness in some of the characters who are supposed to be drugging all of the emotion out of themselves, but that just seems to remind that you can't drug all the emotion out of a human; it's a point of optimism in a theme that usually has a depressing effect. I think it's also another symbol of incipient corruption in this society that the characters that seem to be least drugged into social acceptability are the ones who are in charge or are enforcing the rules on everyone else. This dystopia clearly contains the seeds of it's own destruction. Contrasted with other film dystopias, this one looks more doomed than insurmountable, inevitable and crushing to the human spirit.I know the plot-line and actions of minor characters sometimes stretch belief, but this film actually makes your suspension of disbelief worth it. I know the concepts and philosophy here are far from new, but although I highly value original thought and philosophy, I enjoyed the pure emotional impact of this movie so much I was left thinking ""who cares""? ""Equilibrium"" is so well-made that it leaves me reflecting that a constant diet of badly done formula entertainment will have an effect on the human mind as inhibiting as most other drugs - so is it so far-fetched that people in this dystopia get up every morning and voluntarily drug the emotion clean out of themselves with a chemical dose?",Equilibrium

A special police force has been  established in order to control this new rule of life.This may sound a little strange, yes, I admit - it IS strange. But the movie depicts this world in great and believable detail. Think of the Matrix background... humans as batteries? I actually liked the story here.Christian Bale does a good job acting, the others are quite good, too. Especially the children were good, they managed to be unannoying in an action/sci-fi movie, so thumbs up.Now... the fight scenes were just awesome!!!!And there's not a single bullet time sequence in the movie.

Much better than an action flick with no plot (I find that there are a lot of these) Even though not an original concept (THX1138) I thought it well done. It's dark, a little matrix oriented (long coats & surreal fight scenes) This is a gem, an underground movie that at the time of release it seemed to go unnoticed. The cast is excellent even though Christian Bale has a good track record & I think him a fine actor, I admit that it's no hardship to watch him for 2 hours. Emily Watson is one of the more serious actresses of our time (not just fluff flicks for this girl) she is mostly involved in meaningful films.

If it is well balanced. But here, I did not even fear for the main hero. Either he was totally pathetic, or he was unbeatable. And those oh-look-so-cute scenes with a little puppy barking at his feet, as he is weeping uncontrollably. Pathetic. In a single word - PATHETIC.

657,MxSChizo,A masterpiece with one negligible flaw.,8,31 October 2005,"Sitting here at this screen I'm trying to think of where to begin. The beginning seems most suitable, where it appears from the start how this is an action movie of exquisite quality.Realistic, down to Earth action with actual tactics and of course the unstoppable force of a Cleric, however I'll stop before I start drooling and cut right to what makes this movie as great as it is. The emotional depth, powered by an excellent script, outstanding dialogue and choreography, and commendable acting of Christian Bale, are a rarity in the movie scene, and beautifully coincides with the worked out details of the society portrayed in this flick. Reminding me of WWII, the resistance is worked out quite nicely, however it doesn't even begin to describe how wonderfully Preston's gradual revelation, the rebirth of his soul, is played out - In an action movie!However, this movie gets an eight from me, of course the tag-line ""If you liked the Matrix, you'll love this!"" is ridiculous and a poor, poor marketing error, but the ending (from Preston's arrival at Father's supposed office, leading to his actual capture) was hasted far too much, this may be due to an approaching deadline, a drying budget or perhaps an error in the script, but still the error is there in the final product.Regardless, I recommend anyone who enjoys either full-on action or an emotional movie watches this, and hopefully enjoys it as much as I do.",Equilibrium
658,ColinChapman,Unbelievable,1,13 January 2007,"Plan 9 from outer space was bad but at least it had a heart and was unintentionally funny.Equilibrium on the other hand is dreadful in ways I cannot describe.It is painfully obvious it copies Fahrenheit451,the Matrix,THX1138,Brave New World,Logan's run,1984,Metropolis to name a few.Kids that have never seen above mentioned believe they're getting a new idea.Add a absurd plot about feelings being the cause of war.Gun-Kata made me laugh out loudly.Statistics can make you dodge bullets,what a crazy idea.According to the story they shouldn't feel a thing yet the boss of Bale's hits his fist on the table in rage,clearly he is feeling.His rival is apparently jealous of him and has a smirk in his face.The soldiers show fear and panic.There's plenty of feelings in all of them!In fact the whole premise that feelings cause wars is laughably silly.If we felt more we could feel sympathy of the victims and never go to war due to stupid politicians.Oh,and the puppy scene made me say loudly:""What a seriously bad movie!"".Kurt-the idiot-Wimmer wondered how he could convince the audience how cruel the society was and thought:""hey everybody loves cute puppies,let them kill puppies to provoke disgust among the audience"".Clearly he is a totally incompetent writer and has a mindset of a 7 year old.I wish they could find all copies of this turd of a movie and burn them.It flopped but found buyers on DVD for some strange reason.Anyway Kurt-the idiot-Wimmer later did Ultraviolet which was both a critic-and audience mega-flop so we won't see more of his ultra crappy movies in all likelihood.Obviously the studio saw his version of Ultraviolet and were shocked how bad it was,so they cut it down heavily and marketed it as a brain-less action-flick,but it flopped anyway.Hopefully this dung-heap of a movie will fall into obscurity and oblivion in a few years time.On the rottentomatoes site this movie got a rotten rating at 32%.The majority of course saw the movie as unbelievably stupid but I was totally convinced this movie clearly should have had a 0% rating there.Some critics like the action.I thought that was lame too.Anyway avoid this movie like the plague.If you like it seek help.",Equilibrium
659,mark-1224,As shallow as the emotionless characters,2,14 September 2008,"The high ratings this film gets constantly baffle me. Where to start on how bad it is? Well most bad movies are so because they have a bad story and script. Equilibrium delivers both of those effortlessly; a plot so sci-fi cliché that it feels like a sequel to an Orwell novel adaptation and lines that that have as much style and originality as a the label on a Heinz tomato ketchup bottle.However, on top of that Equilibrium manages to have shoddy directing, pointless scenes which have the only use of trying (but failing) to entice vengeful emotion out of the audience and a set that looks so cheap and tacky that I din't for one second believe I was watching dystopian Libria (how beautifully ironic eh?) but simply that other dystopia - Los Angeles - in a back yard studio behind a brothel...in Los Angeles, to be precise.Pile on ridiculous fight scenes and I am talking the most ridiculous you've ever seen on film, we are talking kung fu...with pistols...that make sword sounds; absolutely blatant film references that, quite frankly, embarrass themselves against the original sci-fi masterpieces (Ridley Scott would swallow his own fist watching this film); the most shoddy CGI of the past ten years; and a soundtrack that sounds like it was made by a fourteen year old kid on his MIDI X100 keyboard that he dug out of the attic - and you have one helluva bad movie.It so desperately wants to be Nineteen Eighty-Four, Blade Runner and (most notably) The Matrix but misses the point completely - they all had substance.

There was just too much dialogue for it to keep my attention and the story wasn't very gripping...at least compared to a story like, say, the Matrix. However, Christian bale did deliver a good performance, as he usually does, and Emily Watson was amazing also.

Unfortunately, this movie was only released on around 300 screens (of an available 3,400), leaving it far away from the high profiting movies and even more regrettably, away from viewers.Other than politics, I can't imagine why this movie did not get much more recognition. It is truly a beautifully done film. Having it remain an unknown title is alongside having movies like ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""The Matrix"" left behind for a ""cult audience"" when really anyone could appreciate and really enjoy it.Thanks!",Equilibrium

No, it isn't an accurate view of what the future will be, but many people have come away from this movie thinking and feeling something.

When I first went to see it I thought it was going to be the sort of movies Dolph Lundgren and Jean-Claude Van Damme used to make-pointless and stupid waste of money. And I was wrong. Christian Bale makes a very good performance(not the best to date but still quite good). And so do the other actors most of who are English. The fight scenes were not bad- Eastern martial arts with a futuristic touch. Of course, the movie has its not so good sides. First, it was obvious from the first 15 minutes what was going to happen. The other thing I didn't like is that in some scenes the movie looked very cheap and home-made, as if the director has decided to put an extra scene but realized that they have run out of money when it was too late.",Equilibrium
665,MissMarauder,Strong dialogue and acting makes this better than The Matrix,9,30 November 2004,"Being a big fan of The Matrix Series I was prepared to feel Equilibrium was a cheap copy with its Clerics wearing long coats and slicked back hair styles etc.However the high class acting in this movie dominated, with so much being expressed in a way we can understand without big special effects..This movie is in a different league than bigger budget films about future life systems and philosophies.The script is intelligent and allows real knowledge of the lead characters and philosophies of the ruling system. Communication between characters is often non verbal with subtle feelings expressed in a look or focus of the camera. Objects such as a book or perfume bottle are used to convey strong values. When special effects are used, for example in the scenes where the Cleric goes in to kill groups of Sense Offenders,they have a bigger impact for being used sparingly and are just as amazing to to watch.We do not lose our belief that the performer of these feats is really human. The ending scenes where the main character enters the head office of The Father and destroys large numbers of troups and finally his main protagonist with his combination of gun skills and physical combat is riveting. There is no over load of effects to make this divorced from reality.The idea that humans can live a life deprived of the evil consequences of their emotions leading to world peace, is an interesting one.No more war or murder, none of the bad things that humans have done to each other will continue.However the establishment of a German Reich style society controlled by enforced self administration of a powerful drug and policed by troups heavily armed is terrifying from the beginning.THe extent of this inability to feel is gradually revealed and culminates in the lead character discovering he actually stood passively by while his wife was condemned and sent for incineration for Sense Offence.At the time he felt nothing at all when the woman he loved was removed and murdered by the society he defended.When he stops taking the drug he gradually discovers the the ability to feel, even the sense of touch when sliding his hand along a railing on a stair case is an amazing revelation.The way he feels when he finally rips the covering off a window in his sterile apartment, and sees rain trickling down the window and views the city he lives in for the first time unveiled, moves him to tears.In the end the triumph of the reality of humanity with all its weaknesses, over the totally drug controlled state is a satisfying conclusion. People with emotions are not perfect but the total lack of the ability to feel anything leads to death of the things that make life worth living at all.",Equilibrium

The film is really great, quick action, combined with a brilliantly stated philosophical question, breathtaking scenes with lots of effects, superb actors! It perfectly balances on the verge between just a high-budget nonsense action film (despite it's low budget) and extremely boring science-fiction film. It was quite a nice surprise when I watched it, because the director is not famous! And there was not any Hollywood superstar but all and the acting is amazingly great! Like the actors completely fit in their roles and ruthlessly overwhelm the weak script parts! I still remember the change of the emphasis when the main character changed sides! With this performance it is a serious competitor of ""the matrix"" or maybe more! Although one little remark must be made in the beginning, when cleric Preston enters the barricaded room with the rebels, some shooting scenes are the same!

667,mathiaswce,Brave New World meets Fahrenheit 911.. oops 451,1,23 September 2004,"In a not so distant future, so much civil unrest has broken out that it causes the Third World War. Exactly how this WW III has broken out is not discussed in the film. Probably it is some country in the so called Axis of Evil that has developed a nuclear warhead and started the war. The US never starts a nuclear war, except in WW II (although it has about 15000 warheads), it only finishes it. Perhaps it started as a pre-emptive attack or some simulated enemy attack like in the Tonkin bay in 1964.However, in the aftermath of this supposedly nuclear war, the rulers of the rising society have decreed that no such event should ever happen again (as they did after WWII) and administers a drug to eradicate all human emotions to end the anger and rage that threaten to devour the world. The result is an emotionless, drone like, media controlled society where everything even remotely cultural and emotionally stirring like records, books and paintings, should be destroyed. It has almost too much resemblance to George Orwell's '1984', Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' with a twist of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' and the likes.This movie asks a lot of relevant questions about the present society that most users on this site live in. Rhetorically it seems to hold a black and white view that communism and dictatorship by nature creates all evil in the world, and that the occidental notion of democracy by the same logic is the sole Good counterweight to this evil. This is depicted by clips of Josef Stalin and Saddam Hussein with the complete absence of Eisenhower (the only world leader yet to deploy the nuclear bomb, twice) and Adolf Hitler who were both democratically elected. If this is a pointer to Kurt Wimmer's lack of historical knowledge or just a general view of the American public, is hard to say. But history has always been written by the winners and not the defeated.To make a film where the actors are not allowed to show any emotion is a difficult task, and here mr. Wimmer shoots wide of the target. In one scene, when the leader of the society known as The Father, makes a speech on a large television screen in front of the masses, he receives a standing ovation much like a State of the Nation speech from George W. Bush. The fact that this is taking place should hint of some sort of emotional backdrop, even though the standing ovation is as uncalled for as the eleven ones in the last SotN-speech. In another scene, the character Brandt (Taye Diggs) gets very worked up and gives an emotional response although his character is supposed to have no feelings. In this sense, the movie fails on its very concepts, the drone-like existence of such a society that is depicted in this movie is just not worth watching if one does not make some adjustments. Therefore, it all becomes rather unbelievable, because regardless how wooden an actor is, he/she can never rid him/herself of all types of emotion.If one does not view this as a mindless action movie, because it is very possible to do that just as with 'Starship Troopers', 'Equilibrium' might just make you think about the society we live in today, with its media fixation, leader worshiping and mind control. However, one should probably read one of the books previously mentioned to get a more elaborate, comprehensible view instead of watching this compressed, Disneyfied blunt ripoff.The action sequences are really worth watching, it contains less stringfighting than most and the actors actually stay on the ground for most of the time. Another plus is that the cars used in this future run on gas rather than some hydrogen-derivate, electricity or God-forbid nuclear power. A future where Halliburton, Occidental, ChevronTexaco, Shell and the others would loosen its grip of the world is just plain naïve.As of this writing, the rating of this movie is 7.7 out of ten. I would rate it about 4.5 myself. The idea in the script is self-contradictory, but it may pass as a decent action movie if one is not too picky.",Equilibrium

669,rregan-3,Bleak future,8,15 September 2005,"Christian Bale is certainly one of the better actors in recent years. He always gives strong performances. In Equilibirum, he plays a law enforcer who must find those who are ""feeling."" The movie is set in a world with no strong emotions. Only love no passion. Only delight no happiness. Only sadness no depression. To make sure everything goes to plan, all citizens take medication to suppress emotions. After Bale's character, John Preston, misses a dose, he is enlightened to the feelings he may or may not ever had. His strange new behavior has caused skeptics, mistrust, and conspiracies to come arise.In the vain of 1984 and Faranehit 451, Equilibrium gives a compelling story into the human heart and mind. Christian Bale gives a strong performance as always. The movie has plenty of jaw dropping action scenes that rival the Matrix, including writer/director Kurt Wimmer's Gun Kata, a mix of martial arts and marksmanship that will leave you begging for more.

670,jesper_doolaard,quite bad. quite.,4,15 March 2008,"This movie must be one of the most overrated movies in the entire IMDb-database. OK, OK, i just said that to make a dramatic statement, but that's needed here. An almost-8/10? Come on!Don't believe me? Look at the DVD-box itself. It prominently reads ""Forget the Matrix!"" while showing two characters in Matrix-like suites, with Matrix-like expressions, in a Matrix-like stance. But here's the scoop: this movie isn't any better than The Matrix. It doesn't even trý to be better than The Matrix. It just says that on the box. Rather, this movie wants to imitate the Matrix in every single way humanly possible, and to ride the wave of that trilogy's success. Doesn't that ring the B-film-bell in your brain? (Yes, it does.) A good (and grounded!) reason to let this movie be, in every movie store or whatever where you encounter it, until perhaps you find yourself in that particular mood where you just want to see bad movies for the sake of it. You know this mood you get sometimes, when you jut want to see crap on TV and laugh about how somebody thought this here little plot might work out on the big screen - but it doesn't? Yeh, that's when I rented this movie here.What you get is what you can expect from the cover. It's something like 'The Matrix' versus Orwell's '1984' on lowish budget. Sure, that could have worked out alright. Combine a great movie with a great book and you get an awesome film, right?Well.. not if you do it like THIS, though. It's slow-paced, has a weak plot fulla holes, weak acting by almost every actor (although that might have to do with the fact that most of them HAVE to act emotionless as it is part of the story), terrible action-scenes (i.e.: the first time the protagonist gets to show off his super-cool gun-shooting/fighting-abilities(?), it's in a completely dark room. He might have made some awesome moves, but i missed it, since it was.. well.. in a completely dark room. Also, the final fight, the climax of the entire movie, takes about ten seconds. TEN SECONDS, for what should have been a huge gory bloody Mortal Kombat-like rampage! Buh.), lame clichés (killing animals for sympathy is só..), dumb plot-twists, bad character-development, etcetera.Overall, this movie was bad. Quite bad. It's not the worst ever, although i can name only a handful of other movies that made for such a dull hour 'n a half. It's just boring. It does attempt to be 'philosophical' in some sneaky way (just like The Matrix occasionally does, surprise surprise), but it doesn't make the point it probably wants to make (which would be something like 'emotion is good', I guess - how's that for a greater message, huh?). Anyway, it most definitely did NOT make me forget about the Matrix.",Equilibrium
671,johnhuxter,Why waste your time with this when there are SO many better films it has copied?,2,3 July 2009,"OK, first the good. The cinematography was excellent, and there were sequences which, in a better film, would take your breath away (the battle illuminated by the strobe-light effect of the gun-flashes was definitely memorable). Despite the obvious attempts to replicate some of the show-stoppers from The Matrix, I appreciate a film where you actually get to see the action, instead of having it cut-to-hell to merely give the impression (Star Trek or Quantum of Solace, anyone?) Now the bad. Like special effects, cinematography cannot save a truly dire film where the scenarios are unbelievable, the acting is wooden, and there isn't a single character you can connect with. In fact, the ""big-effect"" shots look laughably out of place. I'm used to suspending disbelief for a good sci-fi romp, but the whole ""gun-fu"" concept was just stupid, and no amount of high-speed filming can make it otherwise.Christian Bale is a good actor, but here he flounders, probably due to heavy-handed direction. His character is supposed to be smart, but he couldn't make his ""off the meds"" status more obvious, even knowing that the penalty for feeling emotion is death! Keanu Reeves might be a dire actor, but he hit his stride in The Matrix, and even I became interested in Neo's voyage of discovery. The same can't be said of Bale's stilted - and frankly hypocritical - ""cleric"". Overall, the plagiarism from The Matrix, released 3 years earlier, is obvious and painful. My god, they even copied the cover art! I also found it... well, boring. A good director and good actors can express so much in a single look, a 5-second frame. I was in agony waiting for scenes to end where the message was clear 10 minutes ago. I know he was upset by the death of his wife - for Christ's sake, don't beat us over the head with it! There are many other flaws with this movie, covered by other reviews. Don't get me wrong - I'm a big sci-fi fan. Bladerunner, The Empire Strikes Back, Alien/s, The Matrix, Gattica, The Fifth Element, Serenity - these any many more are brilliant examples of the genre.But that's the problem - once you've seen the greats, you just can't be bothered wasting your time with unoriginal knockoffs like Equilibrium.",Equilibrium

673,nervouswreckhana,A Great Marmite movie- you love it or you hate it.,9,26 March 2006,"'Equilibrium' starring Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs amongst many others is a haunting, worrying vision of a strange fascist future where all emotion is outlawed. Christian Bale stars as Cleric John Preston who turns things right on their heads when he starts to feel.Sadly, since the Matrix anything in a style vaguely similar seems to get generalised as just another Matrix knock-off that never matches the 'genius' of the Matrix. It's sad but true, But lets not turn this review into a rant about how overrated the Matrix is. Anyway- with 'Equilibrium' you know that these ideas have indeed been looked at before in other movies and books, Dark City, 1984... Of course it has, because it's important that we don't let things get like this particular future. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't feel stale or cliché. Not at all.Christian Bale gives a great performance- a man who is learning to feel, and at times it's heart-wrenching to watch as a man capable of taking out whole rooms of heavily armed men single handedly becomes in an instant so childlike as he discovers what it's really like to feel.Taye Diggs is a wonderfully unlikeable character and Sean Bean in his small role is the exact opposite. I was genuinely upset about his fate, even if we didn't really see him for very long at all.This movie has a lot of emotion, and plenty of fantastic Action sequences of Christian Bale kicking some major behind to contrast it. Watch this movie, give it a chance, except if you're an obsessive Matrix fanboy that thinks the Matrix is the best thing since sliced bread- because you'll probably hate it.",Equilibrium
674,hiddenattacker,Spectacular film - better than the well-known Matrix,10,20 July 2005,"This movie has a spectacular plot (post-apocalyptic world war III), and thus a fascist regime in which feelings, emotions, and so forth are abhorred. Taye Diggs does a great job as Brandt, who takes over as Preston's assistant. I would have liked to have seen more of Sean Bean, but his presence was known anyhow. Christian Bale does an excellent job playing Grammaton Cleric John Preston. The action scenes in this movie surpass those of the once hailed Matrix (1999). The plot builds throughout the film to a brilliant climax near the end. This movie is one of my favorite action movies of all time with both a good plot, stellar acting, and excellent cinematography. Easily a 10/10 or ****/****",Equilibrium
675,scottgerry,"A Decent Film, Minor flaws, Spoilers Subject To Interpretation",7,24 May 2016,"Equilibrium is both a Dystopian cliché and a surprisingly different film with the barrier being relative to an actor's/actress's ability to repress emotional expressions. While the base script is incredibly well-written and the delivery in most cases is great to nearly flawless their are a few moments where you question the actors ability or the characters obedience to the dictated reality which subsequently makes the story all the more enticing. Christian Bale is good, not great, but certainly does a good job in the role. Taye Diggs was fair, I certainly wouldn't categorize this as his best film despite his gifted acting prowess. William Fitchner was divine. His character, though supporting at best, really imprints into one's psyche without remotely feeling forced. He isn't a leader, he is a shepherd, and his flock in caught deep in the middle of a den of wolves he in no way can combat. Sean Bean's contribution, while minimal in terms of screen time is tremendously invaluable in terms of character development. Angus Macfayden, while almost satirically an Antagonist, was fair to decent though his effort in this project seemed to fluctuate. Emily Watson, last but certainly not least, was wonderful. Her character probably reflects the deepest commitment to the role which she portrays along the lines between insanity and hopelessness. In terms of directing Kurt Wimmer really experimented with bullet time without really crossing the line into the over-the-top angle frenzy that became the two Matrix sequels. In truth this is probably a better story than the Matrix, and far more in the realm of realism (As much as a dystopian tale can be really). Now the breakdown by category. NOTE: While I rate the film a 7 Overall on the ""star-bar"" I don't feel that it is really fair or rational to amalgamate averages with a film without using decimals as it marginalizes it making it appear better or worse than it actually is.Audio Experience: 7.5 Reason: The score was great, soundtrack was decent and relative, and the tones were set perfectly with the Classic music segues serving as contributions not pretensions.Visual Experience: 8.1 Reason: It wasn't perfect, some of the scenes felt sort of tacked on to push effect but never in a way that stops the story flat. Other scenes were visual masterpieces that told a part of the story no dialogue could possibly explain in a way that allows you to feel with the characters instead of for them.Emotional Experience: 8.2 Reason: That is almost entirely what this movie is, an emotional experience built around the shell of an action film. It is more than a drama. It is more than an action film. It is likewise neither of those things while occasionally being science fiction or a thriller. In regards to this aspect of the film, it is the primary reason you should view it. While other aspects work well or well enough this film makes you reflect on your own reality without really imply you should.Story Experience: 7.7 Reason: At times the pace feels rushed. It isn't blamable on anyone other than Miramax really and I'm sure they were logical based on expected revenue and release date, but there are points that feel too fast to truly enjoy. While I watch a film at least three times before reviewing it to normal people with lives and things to do it can muddle the point of the film and a film without a point is just a really long television show.Recommendation: I recommend you see the film. It is really universal in terms of demographic. If you like dramas or even romances I imagine you'll like this film. If you like action or science fiction I think you'll like this film. If you like art pieces or introspective self-discovery I assume you'll like this film. Nod of recognition to writer director Kurt Wimmer for this one. Good job.",Equilibrium

He also has quite obvious emotions. It's just stupid. I mean COME ON! SHOUTING IS AN EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF ANGER!!!!! flaw, deep flaw, obviously missed by the hero who has the ability to 'see' emotions before even an 'offendor' knows it... B.F.S.this film is an awesome idea, but doesn't quite do it. And believe me, i would love it if it did.Let me start by saying that the tag-line 'if you loved the matrix, this is a must...' isn't so ill deserved as some have said on review. it has many elements of the matrix in terms of style, however, the premise is very different. this is '1984' vs 'bladerunner'. however, the depth is not there, in terms of either reference.To me, this film has 're-make' all over it, perhaps and hopefully with the same cast with a better director and a bigger budget. Basically, the budget just wasn't there, the film needed an extra 30 mins at the end and extra refinement throughout (sreenplay rushed?). this film could easily have been a 10/10, but it needed direction that wasn't there, a budget to reflect it's realistic ideas, a f******* decent producer and serious financial backing. As we all know, Batman Begins has brought out the best in Christian Bale (imho) but perhaps he will retake a gauntlet to this franchise and turn it into an awesome re-make.In two words: missing something.",Equilibrium

Fascists rely on intense emotion in a collective sense to keep control, just as communists do. This government is something new- more in the tradition of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"". Scarily, it is like the current trend in Western politics to eliminate all competition in schools, and allow only collective ""problem solving"" games. I know I should only write about the movie, but this is such a thinking mans movie that it demands commentary.

681,cmg3,Equilibrium is good...VERY good.,8,4 March 2006,"The plot is simple enough. World War III has come and gone, and the survivors don't wish to see another. They conclude that humanities greatest gift, emotion, is at the heart of war, and thus, a drug, prozium, is designed to rid humans of any strong feeling. At the heart of the government is the Tetragrammaton, and their executioners, the Grammaton Clerics. Their mission; to hunt down and purge those people who still feel (whom they call sense- offenders). Cleric John Preston however, had gotten fed up with this system.I'm going to flat out say it, the plot of rebelling against an oppressive regime has been done to death, but believe it or not, it has been done very well in Equilibrium. Christian Bale (John Preston) is excellent, going from cold, stoic and emotionless, to showing real drama and very believable emotion for acting as a character who has never felt in his lifetime. The rest of the cast is perfect for their rolls. Aside from a few cheesy scenes and occasionally dry dialog, I can find few faults in the actingAny rehashed plot points that may show up in Equilibrium can be forgiven with the absolutely mind-blowing action sequences. Kurt Weimer's cinematic child, Gun-Kata, is a beautiful thing to behold. Gun-Kata is the martial arts form of handling firearms, and it is presented in such fluidity that it is guaranteed to get your blood flowing. After every action sequence I was forced to pause the movie, sit back, and just try to absorb it. ""Wow"" was the only word I could speak afterward...I then watched that same scene again. From that point on, I kept looking forward to every action-sequence. The way Bale lays waste to the surroundings was that good.The only fault I can give this movie, which is unfortunately rather glaring, is that for an action movie, there wasn't enough action. After the first shoot-out, I was yearning for more, and yet there was little, often spread out over periods of twenty or so minutes. I was practically begging the movie to let Bale go rip-s**t again.Despite this, if you like action movies, and are a fan of Orwellian literature, check this one out.

But it just doesn't reach that level. If you have seen the more prominent films in the genre, like The Matrix, or is a general fan of these kinds of movies, you realize that this film doesn't surprise you enough to become a real classic.

684,helava,What movie did the critics see?,10,10 December 2002,"It seems that the critics' reviews of Equilibrium are almost entirely negative, with a few notable exceptions. I'm wondering if they saw the same movie I did. While the movie borrows liberally from the oft-mentioned Brave New World, and Farenheit 451, and there's definite visual similarities to some specific parts of The Matrix, the comments that Equilibrium isn't more than the sum of its inspirations is unwarranted.The basic concept behind the movie requires a hefty suspension of disbelief, but to say that the movie is ridiculous because of the premise is like saying that the whole premise of Lord of the Rings is silly because it couldn't happen on Earth. Once the initial leap is made, the movie is largely internally consistent, and poses some interesting questions that are particularly relevant in today's society.Not to mention the gun battles.The fight sequences in Equilibrium revolve around the Clerics' unique martial art, a series of Gun-katas. The concept being that statistical analysis of fight sequences can be analyzed to maximize the Clerics' efficiency in battle. While that basic explanation is enough to justify the way the sequences play out, the end result is a unique looking, visually interesting fighting style. While the Matrix took Hong Kong style action sequences to a new level, Equilibrium shows us something almost entirely new.It's a shame that this movie is getting virtually no publicity. Kurt Wimmer & Co. have made a fantastic film - a thought provoking action movie that oozes far more style than its modest budget would suggest. Christian Bale is convincing as a killer who's feeling emotion for the first time, and the rest of the cast is good enough to make this difficult concept not end up ridiculous.Check it out.",Equilibrium
685,Wayne-51,A good movie...if you're a Nazi...,1,16 December 2002,"Ebert, in his review, writes that he doesn't think most audiences will ""understand"" this film.  Somehow he missed the fact every audience will be beat about the head and shoulders with the meaning.  This horribly written and terribly conceptualized movie got much more hype than it deserved.  This film, unlike BELOW, deserved the 'swept-under-the rug' Miramax treatment. I enjoy a good action or science fiction film and will even go so far as to accept the fact that not many have strong stories or good writing. However, if the action movie is going to pretend to have a brain, it should acknowledge the fact that the audience has one too. Sure, there are a few moments of brilliance and a couple of excellent action/martial-arts scenes, but the rest of this SHORT film is painful.  I mean, c'mon.  I dig machine guns as much as the next guy but massacre after massacre of 'good' people just wasn't very entertaining.  I spent much of the film worrying that folks I told to go support this film, might have actually done so. Hopefully, for Ebert's sake, there won't be much of an audience at all.

This though is not surprising because Equilibrium is not a film for cynics or even elitists.  It is actually quite simple and in many ways an old fashioned tale, embracing the heroic ideal of films and stories long gathering dust on the shelf.  It is a film that asked the viewer to exhibit an emotional reach and for some this is just too difficult if not completely impossible to achieve.  Does this make it a bad film??  Well, to those who can't make the connection with the characters I guess so but for the rest of us it was an incredible experience seldom accomplished by modern films, especially those of the action genre.  Equilibrium is a film you have to ""feel"" to enjoy and if you don't it seems to either become quite a heavy burden to those who see it or merely just a movie with some outstanding action sequences.",Equilibrium

Farenheit 451, 1984, Metropolis, A Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, Citizen Kane, The Matrix, anything by Philip K. Dick, Dark City. The list of works that this movie ""borrows"" from is endless. ""Equilibrium"" is chock full of horrendous performances. The special effects are amatuer at best. The logic at play is faulty. According to the future soceity of the film all of the worlds violence is caused by the poetry of W.B. Yeats, great works of art, Beethoven, and tacky furniture and knick knacks, so these things are burned (I wish someone would set fire to this film). Yet all these things get destroyed and the movie is still incredibly violent (maybe it takes a while for the violence to wear off after we've destroyed all aspects of sophistication). All the characters are supposedly without emotion yet we see fear, anger, jealousy, pride in all of them. The filmmakers and actors should all be embarrassed (what is poor Emily Watson doing in this movie?). The only way I would watch this movie again if it was on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

His use of quick cuts, lighting, and music make for some of the best action sequences ever. And yes, I saw the Matrix. I even enjoyed the plot, which is refreshing for an action movie. I mean, did anyone see Collateral Damage by the supposed action king, Arnold Schwarzenger? That was complete crappola compared to this. The story was thought provoking and portrayed well by the visuals and the acting, which was top notch. Of course, Christian Bale makes this movie. I am a huge American Psycho fan, but I think tops even that performance here. He is so cold and emotionless at the beginning and it is interesting to watch him transform into almost a feeling human being. I can't say enough about this great movie. I know the critics trashed it, because it reminded them of 1984 and other type stories. But, I read those books and I don't remember as much kick ass action as this movie had. I am probably going to see this again next weekend and will definately be getting it on DVD, when it arrives.

The directing style is cold, stark, and heavy-handed, which helps encourage the feeling of a world filled with human automatons, unable to feel or emote. Christian Bale does a good job melting from a stoic law enforcer into a freedom fighter unable to control his new emotions. The half classical and half heavy metal score works well, but most notable in the movie is the concept and expression of a Grammaton martial art developed to perfect gunfighting. The scenes where Cleric John Preston dispatches dozens of armed fighters single handedly are spectacular.

This movie is about as much like ""The Matrix"" as that Ducktales episode that the makers of ""Clockstoppers"" ripped off.

WHO CARES? Yes, Cleric Taye Diggs shows that winning smile a lot, which is a show of feeling. Yes, apparently, Prozium does nothing for Pride, Anger, and my favorite one, Intuition. The Clerics practice the ""Arts of Intuition"", but Intuition is based on FEELING.

Sean Pertwee's turn as The Father is suitably Big Brother-y, and Emily Watson bubbles with repressed emotion throughout.While the supposed utopia but at what cost type story is nothing revolutionary and some of the effects are a bit ropey, the film makes some interesting comments, and has some of the most innovative gun/martial arts fights I've seen in a long while (the one on one fight near the end with the cyclical deflecting of each other's guns just as they fire was particularly brilliant).Overall, if you can look past the trailer and watch the film as something other than a Matrix style action movie I suspect you'll come away well satisfied.",Equilibrium

In a society of Patriot Acts, Hate Crime Laws, and borderline censorship, this central story of a place kept under control by medication and censorship shouldn't seem that far fetched.Some very nice cinematography and brilliant action sequences compliment some very strong performances (and short for some character like Sean Bean).

The first one, you could tell the reviewer was (or had the mindset of) a rather idiotic adolescent. Roger Ebert though should have known better. Nevermind his brief nap during the middle of the film - he apparently didn't hear Gunkata mentioned several times, and attributed the term to the aforementioned 'critic.' It didn't stop him from giving it a whooping three stars. You're better off listening to the New York Times. I went prepared to see an idiotic film with at least some good production values and some great fighting scenes. I didn't get either. Oh, I did get more idiocy than I ever thought possible. But the action was uninspired, clearly trying to copy the matrix and doing a bad job of it. My idea of a great fighting scene is definetely not someone standing in the middle of a room, making no effort whatsoever at dodging anything, while a score of soldiers with automatic weapons are emptying everything they have on him.

The storyline and plot was developed well before the matrix was released. It was delayed a year from release because of the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. Apparently the anti government connotations were a little to much to be swallowed at the time.The ideas in this movie are so original. The way they did the stunts was not with giant box office expenses it was done with basic equipment and effectively. The fighting scenes are to die for and the music creates a great atmosphere.

Its a shame the critics are so blind and cannot appreciate a good movie, all they ever give good comments for a useless movies about the holocaust.. which a mind boggling dreary and full of hardship... yes we know this we have been told a million times.. the war was bad. Give it up. But the general public know it and thats this is a great movie as seen by the votes.. over 30 percent gave it 10 out of 10. Well done to the director. Acting was great too :)",Equilibrium
699,MovieFiction,It was just awesome in its unique way.,9,4 December 2006,"This movie was so like Matrix but again not so like it also. The plot where human emotions are subdued for better future and freedom of right put into dumps by a pill was a unique idea. Moreover the action was just too good to find faults. I mean Christain Bale performed his stunts without mercy. No climax in fighting with the lead characters, meaning he was just too good. In the end it is a movie, which makes you think. Emotion were also sky-high. The movie was superb and should be seen by the people who loved matrix. The movie in itself has a unique blend of action and emotion. Quite sensible screenplay with not too many loose-ends(none that i could find). The movie's title in itself suggests how do you define Equillibrium.",Equilibrium

It is pretty much a paint by numbers plot copied from others that came before it with ridiculous stupid fighting around guns. There are multiple huge plot holes that honestly make no sense such as the emotion suppressing drug litterally having all effects being nulled after what is assumed after being taken since birth by missing one dosage of it. The other blazing one is how he ""tricks"" the people to believe he wasn't the traitor even though he would of left tons of evidence and the thing he did the trick with happening after the events happened. There are more but I dont have all day. The fightimg to me is all flash to levels of stupidity with the logic behind what actually is going on.

I thought it might be bad given the lack of marketing for this film, but I ended up loving it. I am not sure why this movie has been getting trashed by many critics, nor do I get why the studio decided to dump it.  The story is a bit of a stretch, but I bought into it quite easily.  And, as hard as this is to believe, it has better action than The Matrix.  In fact, this movie has some of the best action scenes I have ever seen........EVER!

(gun-katas aside ;) I had such a welling of emotions after watching it that I could not sleep, and I lay awake thinking about it until the following morning. Positively brilliant film!Although, I must admit he did steal ideas from George Orwell's ""1984"" and other futuristic totalitarian tales. His twist on totalitarian society was superbly rendered.My attention to detail is much greater than some, and watching this story unfold was not unlike watching an artist's brush on canvas. Every little detail in this film helps broaden the senses, and the gun fight choreography was executed beautifully. This film immediately became one of my top 5 favorite films.UPDATE: I checked the screen releases, and it was only released to 309 screens in the US. Compared to 2,849 for The Matrix!

Possibly it was overshadowed by the bigger box office draw of the Matrix, I don't know.Obviously Christian Bale survived as the Batman franchise is in full swing with #2 on the way and #3 already contracted. I was impressed with his performance in ""American Psycho"" but had NO IDEA until this movie of his action/adventure capabilities, as well as physical fighting skills.

The story line was original and although I thought at the beginning of the film it would be unable to sustain the no emotion rule to everyone who took the drug, they did it perfectly. The lead was performed with style despite looking slightly too much like The Matrix. The fight scenes included some of the best close combat fighting I've seen and there was even parts included to touch us in the midsts of all that violence (the dog).

Isn't he feel anger, fright or something like that when he shout? Or at the end. Why is Brandt laugh? And the biggest mistake: Why is Preston give up to take his pills? Because he was curious. And it's a human emotion too. I think in this movie everybody has to be a piece of wood. :) But the fight scenes. Mmmm... I've never seen a more spectacular fight scenes.

Well get ready to see the endless copy-cat battles that this movie will incur. Gun-Kata (the fighting style of the Grammaton Cleric) is so absolutley awesome and revolutionary, that just showcasing it is worth the price of admission alone. But, there is also a story, and a darn fine one at that. Good sci-fi rarely comes along, but a good sci-fi action movie happens about every 10 years. The closest I can think of in how this movie relates to the buisness is how Blade Runner did when it came out. Now, I'm not saying this is as good as Blade Runner, but it is close.It is a shame, CRYING SHAME, that has been treated like it has by Dimension, when a film like Extreme Ops is advertised as much as it is. The difference between this and say, Extreme Ops, is that Equilibrium holds an appeal. If only it was held in higher regard by a better studio then I dare say that it would have entered the top three films on it's opening weekend and pulled in a lot of money.",Equilibrium

I haven't been so pleasantly delighted by a movie since a friend dragged me to a film school screening of The Killers a dozen years ago because Chow Yun-Fat was to be there in person.Did Equilibrium borrow heavily from other movies?  Yes. Did the director shamelessly use one of the biggest clichés in the book to tug at the audience's heart.  Yes, again.  Was the whole story line preposterous in retrospect? Certainly.  Did I enjoy every minute of it?  Again, yes, very much so.The combination of corny B movie plot devices, charismatic actors and kinetic direction are the cinematic equivalent of kettle popped corn drenched in real butter.  The food puritans can scold about the fat and sodium count in the nutritionally empty calories.

710,Shail48,Highly Underrated Cool Action Flick with a Decent Partially Inventive Plot,9,20 April 2003,"This movie just flew by the theatres some how.  I blame bad publicity. Equilibrium has a little something for everybody except the cynical nuts who's only purpose in watching movies is to find tiny little plotholes and inconsistencies.Firstly, the action was great.  Very stylish, unique and inventive.  For those who think it was stolen from the matrix, you need to watch your movies closer and realize that borrowing simple camera techniques that may have been introduced by the matrix does not make a movie a rip off.  Besides there was plenty of novelty to keep things more than interesting. Borrowing actions styles from multiple movies and putting it into one only makes a movie better as an action movie.Secondly, direction and camera work deserves serious credit.  Yes, the symbolism got a little cheesy at times but it is obviously intended to be that way and not just some form of amateur blunder.Thirdly, powerful acting.  No, I was not incredibly moved by anybody in the film but that again is not the purpose of the movie.  Great feeling and non-feeling acting by Christian Bale and even more so the young actor playing his son.  Emily Watson and Taye Diggs also gave a decent performance.I suppose the only thing that holds back this movie is the filmmaker's attempt to please a wide audience.  He attempted to give it a good plot and while he succeeded with some good unexpected plot turns here and there, overall there were a few too many hackneyed concepts used.  He also failed to fill some holes in the plot making some of the transitions in the film abrupt.It still deserves a lot more credit than most mainstream movies out there today.  I had been craving for some stylish action since the matrix and I was finally satisfied.  Go watch it and judge it for yourself.  Don't ignore this one just because it wasn't advertised like crazy.  If nothing else it is at least bound to be entertaining.",Equilibrium

It isn't in the same league as, say, the Matrix - or even Blade or Highlander - for stylish, exciting action.It steals ideas from better stories (1984, Farenheit 451) and better films (Metropolis, Matrix and Blade Runner) but can't live up to the standards of any of them. Worse, it takes the ideas of these stories and twists the moral so that the film becomes a justification for ""might is right"" and the glorification of anger and violence.There are plot holes the size of Brazil! Why ban art when everyone is taking drugs to stop them feeling anything? And don't even get me started on the stupidity of a master detective not being able to work out that his prepubescent son and baby daughter are not drugged to the eyeballs to control their emotion but have been fooling him for YEARS.Don't watch this film.

And while I can honestly say the story was overdone, the action sequences more than make up for it -- something that can't be said for many B-class films of this day and age.  In addition, the movie was done on a tight schedule and with a relatively modest budget ($20 million) -- so all things considered, I think it did an exceptional job.  And based on the feedback of the audience I saw it with (booming laughter, tons of clapping and hooting after the action sequences), I know I wasn't alone.I definitely plan on picking up with DVD, once it comes out (slated for May 2003).

I love the Matrix less, though.

It's premise is insultingly simple: that being alive without feeling is meaningless. This is the premise of most futuristic movies, but whereas they express it through metaphor, Equlibrium simply states it, sets up the story and then lazily lets it play itself out.And the problem is that the film thinks it is saying something profound but can't carry it off. It's a film trying to talk about emotions filmed by a director weaned on MTV who's great at the action sequences but has no idea how to convey human emotion, and acted by Christian Bale, who simply isn't affecting as the man coming back to life. Bearing this is mind, this shoudl have been an action film; as it is, the action comes in too rarely and each action sequence feels contrived and out of place.Watch Alphaville instead.Equilibrium's tagline should be: 'how one man's love for a stray dog can overturn regimes.'

There were some parts of this movie that could have lifted it beyond the ordinary, but it was always something that disturbed. If it wasn't the rip-offs from other movies, it was the really bad costumes. It reminded me of some of the old Steven Seagal movies, but instead seated in the future.

Sadly despite an impressive beginning and a decent performance by Christian Bale, this film felt extremely disjointed, and made logic leaps when the story ran out of things to recycle. What started out as an impressive film, ended as a very mediocre one, with no emotional impact.

But it also makes little or no sense in the context of the movie. Bale is supposed to be just a well-trained human, but he seems able to move faster than bullets, thanks to the whim of the action genre. That's fine--but it severely undermines the realism of the story's dystopic future.It's a shame, because the premise sets the scene for a few amazing sequences in the middle which shine in their recognition of the indomitable human spirit.An almost-great movie overwhelmed by script, premise, plot and acting (Taye Diggs) mediocrity.",Equilibrium
719,clemptor,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING,10,7 December 2002,"ANY comparison to ""The Matrix"" is unfair and misleading.  The angle and goal of The Matrix and the production company that released it was completely different than that of Equilibrium.  This movie infuses and original story with all of the great elements of such science fiction literature classics as Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and even a touch of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.  Equilibrium has inspired directing and acting.  I must say it is wonderful to see Christian Bale in a leading role again, especially one that highlights his talents as an actor.  HE IS NOT IN ENOUGH FILMS!In addition, any one who danes to call this movie ""predictable"" or ""cookie-cutter"" is being some sort of pretentious stick-in-the-mud.  I say not ENOUGH movies evoke the response out of me that this one did.  The creators or this film obviously believe in it enough to have spent all the money they had on the film production itself, as opposed to a superficial, bloated advertising campaign like most movies with this much action do. AND...there are very few movies that has as awesome fight sequences as Equilibrium that also have a quality movie supporting the remainder of the effort. Last, but not least, the cast has a diversity unlike all other mainstream movies this year besides Lord of the Rings.  I already explained how pleased I am with the lead, but just look at the rest of the cast:  Emily Watson (BRILLIANT actress; far and away my favorite), Taye Diggs (a man who is extremely talented but often gets type cast because of his looks and youth...good job, Taye!), and Angus McFadden (of Braveheart fame, if anyone recalls, and since that movie I will watch a movie if he is in it). Equilibrium is the most exciting and inspired movie I have seen since Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.

But anyways, I went into this movie knowing very little about it, but when I finished the movie, it left quite an impression on me.  I'm a die-hard Matrix fan (I've seen it roughly 50 times), and to me, not too many movies can top Matrix in special effects and in ""cool factor"".  Equilibrium is not only a contender with the Matrix, but in the sense of something ""new and unique"" special effects wise, Equilibrium may not be the underdog anymore.  All I can say is if you liked The Matrix GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!  I'm going to go see it again today just to watch some of those scenes over again.  If only the director had more money to work with.

It offers big, show stopping gun battles and explosions, but, offers a pretty intriguing story as well. And most importantly, both aspects are handled very well. As both a fan of action films and movies with a bit more brain to them, it was refreshing to watch a film both exciting and thought provoking, two elements that are usually mutually exclusive to one another. But, Equilibrium finds a very nice, well, equilibrium between the elements and ended up being one of the most satisfying films I've seen in a while. Christian Bale seems to have his eye on being the next big action star, and he should be. He's got the biceps, the moves (which are well on display in this film), and the guy can act (I know I'm not the only person who felt he was slighted with his lack of best actor nods for American Psycho). I just hope more people will go and see this film (most people I've talked to haven't even heard of it), and I suppose it doesn't help the most critics are basically tripping over themselves to be the first in line to lambast it.

Christian Bale does a good job of portraying his characters evolution from unfeeling Cleric to resistance fighter, though the movie could have spent a bit longer on how cold he was before he stopped taking his Prozium.  This movie has a lot of style and visual detail: namely the uniforms of Clerics and Sweepers and the buildings (both interior and exterior).

There are a ton of comparisons to 1984, and why this is the perfect implementation--but the fact is, there are a lot of key differences.Firstly, the premise is simply unbelievable in this movie. There's absolutely zero reason for them arriving at the future--where no emotion is given. How am I, as the viewer, supposed to believe that they are incapable of emotion--and that, amazingly, nobody has ever missed a doze of this ""prozium""? There's such a thing as ""suspension of belief,"" but this just doesn't make sense. The whole premise is shaky from a sci-fi perspective--and as a human being watching this, it just feels like a poorly written movie.Secondly, John Preston is too much of a ""picture perfect"" protagonist. Of course, he starts out as the ideal soldier--the image of perfection that the Cleric harps upon. But from the very beginning, he just seems like a cardboard cutout of a religious ideal. At no point can I possibly believe he had any obligation to his partner. Even the much heralded ""dog scene"" makes me laugh, because it is so ridiculous out of character for him.Thirdly, and most importantly--there's always a foil for the opposing authority. And in this case, it's the ""general populace"" that doesn't feel. But outside of the Clerics, we never see *anybody* that is part of the regular, ""sense offending"" populace. So throughout the whole thing, it feels like we're just taking a tour of the Cleric station. We never see the population buying into a ridiculous notion because, quite frankly, the very idea is outrageous. WHO would possibly buy into this? There's no series of events that would even make sense. ""People"" don't even exist in this society. There's only the underground rebels, and the clerics.Finally, the acting in this movie is great--Christian Bale does deliver a great performance, but the sources for his acting just don't deliver. Even William Fichtner, as a key man in the resistance, doesn't really deliver. Granted, they all deliver the lines in a convincing manner, but ultimately, articulated garbage isn't any less wasteful.Overall, I had high hopes with Equilibrium, but it just felt so... fake, and contrived. Not to mention, I feel like the writers don't understand what ""feeling"" really is. I ""feel"" like the only emotion they deemed illegal was love--anger, hate, frustration, are all considered acceptable. But feelings of compassion and love are not. How, exactly, does that work? They never explain it, and thus, I am left with a complete misunderstanding of the movie's point, not to mention feeling utterly unsatisfied with the ending.",Equilibrium

Great story, great thrill, great action and good acting (as always for Mr. Bale). I don't want to tell too much, so its basically like I mentioned in the title. If you've seen or read those you might think that there is not much new in this movie (the parallels to Fahrenheit 451 are huge), but it is a great composition and the aspect of disabled emotions is more emphasized in this one. And it is seriously cooler than the old Fahrenheit451 movie (really expect you to read, not watch it.). So great disturbia, whats more to say?

733,Tirranek_Aaron,Not a Matrix knock-off. It doesn't deserve the flak,10,31 July 2003,"As I'm sure many of you have, I heard mixed things about EQ. Personally I thought it was fantastic. There wasn't a moment in the film when I thought it was a dissapointment, and certainly not deserving of the harsh criticisms it's recieved.To say that it ripped off the Matrix is stupid. As another member of imdb mentioned that it didn't steal bullet-time, nor were there any major similarities in the story. If I had to compare the 'Gun-Kata' scenes to another form of media, I would sooner match it to the Devil May Cry series on PS2; John Preston was far more like Dante than Neo in his style; and it was very original for a film. It is NOT a Matrix knock-off.*spoilers ahead* People complain about the mushy or corny emotional scenes, such as the one with the puppy. While I do not entirely disagree, Preston was experiencing emotions for the very first time, if you've never felt sorrow before how are you supposed to know how to supress it? i think Christian Bale portrayed his character perfectly. The ending was quite cliched but not overly so, it certainly didn't ruin the film.
I think it has the mis-fortune of being made in a time when anything involving martial arts and ace gun-slinging will be called a rip-off of the Matrix. But if we follow that mentallity, we might aswell say that any film with a car chase rips off Bullitt.I should mention that I watched this film without any expectations, nor was I comapring it to any other films. The only similarity I repeatedly noticed was 'father' on the video-boards, and that was from a 1984 Apple Mac commercial. I accept that with this in mind, my review may not be the most informing for sci-fi veterans that are familiar with similar films. Still, I really enjoyed this film, give it chance.",Equilibrium
734,markhazen,Maybe I expected too much.,3,13 March 2003,"I tend to be pretty demanding of psychological thrillers, which might explain why I was so let down by this movie. I will probably rent it in the future, just to see if I was wrong in my judgement, but I found this film tedious, short on the action scenes, and completely devoid of nuance.The flawed nature of the Orwellian society being portrayed here (with overt shades of Nazi Germany thrown in for good measure) is continually pounded into the viewer's skull from the first frame, through the last. Likewise, the emotions of every character in the film (including the lead) are never hinted at, but instead are splayed on the screen so bluntly, that never once did I find myself having to contemplate the motivations, feelings, or inner struggles of these characters.This completely ruined any possibility that I'd find this movie interesting. I had no impetus to think for an entire two hours... which made them tick by very, very slowly. If there were subtle hints at *anything* in this movie, I think I would have enjoyed it far more than I did.The only other draw for me would have been the action scenes, which are far and few between, and when they *do* exist, are far too short, and too cut and dried to be interesting. This is also a remarkable pity, because there is a remarkable new fighting style which is described, developed, and demonstrated in the film. Unfortunately, we really only get to see it for about sixty seconds of screen time, over four or five fights. This includes a couple well edited fights, but overall, I wish this film had shown us more of this, and less of the perpetual gray concrete architecture.The story is a fairly clinical retelling of Farenheit 451, morally-speaking. There's a smidgen of 'Total Recall' as well, but beyond that, it's unoriginal tripe.In my opinion, if you want to see a good Orwellian psychodrama, go rent '1984' instead, and save this one for a lackluster Sunday afternoon viewing on the USA network.",Equilibrium

It's unique, dark, everything it should be. The character John Preston is the best rebellion-themed character since Jonas from the book ""The Giver."" Each and every character display a thin dreary tone thanks to the wonderful actors playing them. It truly deepens the feel you get from the movie. The action sequences (although exaggerated) are a complete thrill ride that Jackie Chan is probably hitting himself on the head for not doing it before. The story is simple but very clingy.

Of course, to me a spoiler is virtually any trailer that contains more than the name of the film and the major cast members. As far as I'm concerned, most trailers now available show too much. That being said, here's what I think of this film.I just purchased the DVD of this film and was not sure about it's premise. To think that there may be drugs powerful enough to suppress ALL emotions in a human being is TRULY SCARY. THAT is the major ""suspension of disbelief"" required to enjoy this movie.The premise of Preston being able to participate, without feeling, in the death of his wife - and the mother of his children - is a bit hard to get past. If there are no emotions, how and why does one GET married and have children? Does one even CARE about his/her children? What is caring? If you can get through that, you'll find a film that will keep you VERY involved. While not ""fleshing out"" ALL of the major characters, the filmmakers of this one have given us a protagonist in Preston whom we grow to find is not only a truly scary killing machine (who is really ""cooler"" than Neo of ""Matrix"" fame - he doesn't need ""virtual enhancements"" to make his abilities awesome, it's just extensive training), but a character who comes to understand there's something wrong with the ""system"". Sean Bean (Boromir in ""Lord of the Rings"") has a short, but significant part early in the story that causes our hero (Christian Bale, now probably the definitive ""Batman"", as Preston) to question his job, which usually involves the virtually indiscriminate killing of lots of people - in the name of ""no more murder or war"".While our main character is developed well enough that we can care about what happens to him, film time developing those who form his opinion of the necessary changes is rather short. There are not as many action scenes as ""The Matrix"", and probably not necessarily as ""flashy"" (though definitely fast, furious, and satisfying), but there is one major thing this film has that I found lacking in ""The Matrix"" - a clear motive, reason, and story brought to a conclusion! After watching this film, I felt moved to check out what others had felt about it and was pleased to find that most seemed to feel it was underrated. I liked the picture very much and thought that, overall, it was very well done, the actors were believable - if not excellent - the story was generally very straightforward (not confusing, convoluted, or having esoteric religious references) about the values and consequences of just being human and having emotions - and realizing that without emotion, we're not ""human"".I probably overrate films, but I DID really like this one. I definitely do not regret the purchase and know I will watch it many times again, probably catching something I missed in previous viewings. It's a keeper!",Equilibrium

Also, let's be honest, as an actor Christian Bale is annoying at best. The Dark Knight was good because he had an AMAZING supporting cast (now 3 academy award winners), and Heath Ledger's Joker made the film.

However, in the year 1948, this very famous book was published about a dystopian future called '1984.' Even more intriguing, there was another book titled 'Farenheit 451' that was also a dystopian novel. In 1999, a very influential movie was released titled 'The Matrix.' 'Equilibrium' is simply just a mixture of an already famous action movie and a bunch of famous novels. The story had 'Father.' '1984' had 'Big Brother.' That was lacking a ridiculous amount of originality. The fighting scenes were most certainly done well, three years too late I am afraid, though. If there was a possibility that during a fight scene I could stop thinking I was watching 'The Matrix,' I might have enjoyed the film. Even the music during the fight scenes (of both 'Equilibrium' and 'The Matrix') at the end were almost identical. It felt as though it was Keanu Reeves playing the lead role. To end my rant, I have to bring up the most funny scene. The man's face being sliced. Is it assumed that in the future swords will be sharp enough to go through bone and a skull like a 'hot knife through butter'? That had to be one of the worst ideas in movie history.

Fortunately, I was wrong and this film is the one that proved me wrong! For a low budget film (so I heard) it manages to be quite an outstanding work. The actors perform well and the moves are original, stylish. The fight scenes are NEVER boring, since most of them are quickly over with, yet simple and exciting at the same time. One welcome asset is the lack of special effects that most contemporary action movies overload their action sequences with. NO MORE dull and useless bullet time, camera rotations and big explosions serving no purpose at all !! The film photography is also good, the futuristic environments are quite believable. There is no redundancy and superfluity in the way the future is presented, no flying cars, no automated machinery roaming about, no metal cities (well you get the point)....The plot I consider to be another one of this movie's strong points. While not very believable at its core, it is concrete and the character's actions are coherent with it. It also leaves you with some questions in your mind, which is good. But don't expect any revelations or big WHYs...Sure there are quite a few reminders of Matrix (the original), Blade Runner, Demolition Man, but the film totally goes beyond mere copying or reproducing scenes.

And in the perfect ""Equilibrium"" world, the enemy DOES seem to stand in formation, or surround you in a perfect circle. In real life, it's just trying to give a martial-arts explanation for a semi-mystic ability to shoot everybody around you.Christian Bale seems to be continuing to act by showing as little emotion as possible.

Philosophically the movie proposes an interesting thought: human feeling is the primary cause of pain and death. This is nothing new; in fact is the whole basis of Buddhism: attachment causes suffering, avoid attachment and you'll avoid suffering. This movie, like many works in the genre, fail to deliver a credible future. The story occurs a few years from the present, pinpointing a society that has changed dramatically, mixes high with current or old technology in a messy way, it is constantly contradictory, and completely disregards politics, economy, ecology, philosophy, religion, history and even physics.

The action is think and the plot '1984' like (timeless).What made the movie more fascinating for me was the use of 'martial arts' and the way in which the use of guns evolved like the samurai arts of old, replacing the sword with a pistol.The acting was superb and the main character was the icy killer from 'American Psycho', who used his charm and wit as in 'American Psycho' to pull off a superb non-feeling Cleric.There are of course some great fight scenes, utilising guns, samurai swords and empty hands that would make any viewer happy to sit down and watch this film.If you liked 'The Matrix' and love old Samurai movies, try this film, you will feel for it.",Equilibrium

No one I knew had seen it and despite some harshly negative reviews I figured I'd give it a go. I quite enjoyed this film though I now see exactly where everything from ""Ultraviolet"" comes from.This film doesn't break any new ground or ask brave new questions but it does ask what makes one human and whether mere existence is enough. The plot moves along at a brisk enough pace that my attention never waned and there are some surprisingly touching moments. There are no twists here, but there are a few gradual corners where you have to crane your neck to see what's coming. The director doesn't feel the need to beat you over the head with the 'message', instead simply letting things play out pretty much as you think they would.For some reason I felt as if this film could have been made in the late 80s or early 90s rather than 2002; something about the way it looked, the color pallet, the soundtrack... and perhaps the way Bale's character dispatched enemies with combat maneuvers resembling Madonna's ""the vogue"". I should add that Bale was very good as the flat line assassin-turned-emotionally awakened savior. He looked very much the part and executed (pardon the pun) the action in bold style. The costuming was effective and I thought the priestly garb of the monastic hit-men was particularly effective.Overall, this film was an enjoyable ride for a rainy afternoon and one I will recommend to friends when they need a couple of hours to kill in style.",Equilibrium
767,verser-2,An Action-Based Dystopia That's Surprisingly Fufilling,10,30 July 2006,"As a fan of dystopian novels and films, I was used to a more psychological and more dramatic take on the environment. ""Equilibrium"" definitely takes a turn from dramatic dystopia, and transforms it into an action-based roller-coaster.Amazingly, the film retained the sense of dystopia and its psychological and emotional horror, while maintaining the critical entertainment needed in an action-based film. Christian Bale (Preston) did an equally astounding job portraying the protagonist, and was perfectly casted. He brought that true sense of pathos plausibly hidden in a stoic man with a cold heart and a talent for mass-destruction.The cinematography is emulated from the ""Matrix-style"" of combat: a mixture of martial arts and shoot-outs in a gruesomely quick manner. It's incredibly thrilling to watch, and maintains the sense of the film as what it is, ultimately: an action film.The folly of most action-based films is that the ubiquitous violence is never justified with any purpose or is abrasive to the plot (if there is any real plot at all). ""Equilibrium"" maintains a sense of purpose, and does create the cold dystopic environment that I've come to know, love, and be terrified of.The movie may not be a profound portrayal of the intricacies of human nature, thought, and society, as in most dystopic works, but it delivers a very entertaining movie. It is the pinnacle of an action-based film and delivers all that such a film requires (and it's a plus that it's dystopic!) Therefore I give the film nine out of ten ""stars"".",Equilibrium

To boil it down, this film is about a superhero ninja with guns saving the world from soulless lefties who want to take away your snow globes lest they cause you to have feelings and start wars.

Much like the books it's modeled after, (Fheranheight 451, Brave New World, and Animal farm, or 1984) it takes a look at the world where censorship is king and totalitarian control the way of life.

Trust me, I am a movie nut, and I have watched the matrix and all those other visual effects nut jobs. I personally think that the main thing that killed this movie was Hollywood being afraid of the concept of a new idea. for gods sake, if it doesn't have some kind of anti-bush undertone nowadays, they will, mark my words, throw crap down upon its budgets. this one should have had an underworld-esquire budget (90 million) instead of a house of the dead budget (15 million). but, it had a new and interesting idea, so no. This movie was a stunning adaptation of 1984. I give it 10 out of 10 for the acting, the character development, and the completely awesome concept of a martial art designed for guns.

774,bob-orth,Hollywood's 1984,8,6 January 2006,"World War 3 nearly destroys humanity, and the government decides that the best way to avoid another war is to control emotions. Without emotion, there is no hatred or desire to harm others. The perfect society is formed... but there are those who value their emotional freedom. Some people feel that having to suppress their emotions (by taking the drug Prozium) is not a fair trade for peace. These ""criminals"" are hunted down by the Tetragrammaton (the what?), and a new war begins.Overall, I see this film as a (good) film adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. The story isn't the same, but it bears many similarities. The ""Father"" is very similar to ""Big Brother."" There's the same ""Party."" Everyone is a suspect of thoughtcrime, or in this case, emotion.The story is pretty good, backed up with decent acting. Sean Bean, without a doubt, does the best job of all of the actors. His character easily shows both sides of the conflict, and his death spurs Bale's own transformation.One of the problems I had with this film is that Taye Diggs is a bit too ""excited"" throughout the film, which makes his character emotional. While Bale, Bean, and Harbour are all very contained, Diggs seems to be bursting with energy. Usually, that's not a bad thing, but here, it ruined his character.The special effects are of medium quality. The action is generally good, but a few scenes suffer from blurry action. The props are standard fare: motorcycles, black trench coats, G36 rifles, katana swords, etc. The use of fire trucks was strange, though.",Equilibrium
775,quinnmjohnson,Why this movie rocks,9,6 June 2005,"Why does this movie rock? This was the movie that turned Christian Bale from a guy I remembered in smaller movies like Newsies and Reign of Fire into one of the coolest actors around. He ably steps into the role of physical action hero, with some amazing fight scenes, but also shows off amazing acting prowess. Throughout the whole movie he perfectly captures every tiny facial expression, every subtle physical motion, to convincingly portray a man cold to emotion to one who becomes scared of his emerging feelings, to one who must then hide these feelings from his superiors, to one who revels in the feelings and the strength they give him. His performance in Equilibrium got me pumped to have him play Batman in ""Batman Begins."" Also the action scenes are awesome!! What could have been yet another Matrix copycat instead utilizes its own unique camera moves, shots, etc. to make adrenaline-pumping and balletic symphonies of destruction (that was me being dramatic). And his switchblade guns are AWESOME!!! The whole concept of the Gun Kata is really unique and cool and some of the action scenes where the technique is used are amazing (hand-to-hand fighting with guns? Totally sweet!). So this is an awesome movie. It blew me away, and 99% of the people I've shared it with have the same reaction. They always ask how such a great movie totally flew under the radar.

777,dE-Void,The Whatrix?,8,21 September 2005,"From the offset, looking at the DVD box, it is apparent what this film is trying to be before you even read the quotes - ""The Matrix meets 1984"", ""the fight scenes are delirious"", ""If you loved THE MATRIX, this is a must"".So far, so wannabe.The story, in a nutshell, is that humanity has finally decided, after many wars, pain and suffering, that it would be a better world if we had no emotions at all. Our love and compassion would be forfeited for a world without lust or hate. We have given up all happiness to have no sadness. We are essentially hollow.In this world, not even the arts and crafts all permitted. Everything has to be clinical, and as most of the population are on constant emotion numbing drugs, no-one really cares. No-one, that is, but the sober people. A group of rebellers have stopped taking their medicine, began salvaging some lost art, media and feeling, and are banding together to combat their rulers. However, 'Father', the face of world peace, is hidden far behind many tiers of defence. Foremost are his Clerics - the robot-like men who seek out and destroy all remaining art and other such emotion enticements. If any rebellion is mounted against them, they simply destroy the opposition with their bastardised martial art/gun play hybrid style of fighting. A style that has been inputted into their bodies in a computer like degree of control, allowing over 100% efficiency and accuracy. Aiding these seemingly unbeatable clerics is a seemingly impenetrable army of basic foot-soldiers with guns. Against a neo-hippy group of art rebels, the emotional side of humanity seems to stand no chance.Sean Bean, in an excellent underplayed role that he is so good at (his performance of Boromir in the Lord Of The Rings is perfect proof) gets the unravelling of the tight ship off to a good start. His character is one of the Clerics, but he is a 'sense offender'. He secretly pockets the arts which the Clerics are recruited to destroy. Our main character, and Sean's characters partner, John Preston, because to suspect his friend of stealing such things, and is not surprised at all to find him during a raid reading a book in a darkened building. After a brief attempt at converting his friend, Mr Bean says an early farewell at the end of Preston's smoking barrel.From here, the story goes on to follow John's downfall from Cleric to rebel, told through cunning wordplay with his new partner Brandt (Diggs) and many fast (perhaps too fast to take it all in on the first watch), short action sequences, showing off the Clerics new and only 'art' - that of battle. There is even a great 'lobby scene', but it far surpasses the Matrix's bullet-orgy in favour of a more sleek and humanly-possible sequence.Surprisingly, the movie not only throws many red herrings and plot twists at the viewer, but it's climatic 'final battle' between our two sparring partners isn't handled with typical Hollywood arrogance either, and while most action fiends will be howling with tears when they view it, I for one think this different approach is commendable and actually works well with the rest of the film to create the feeling of actuality in a futuristic setting.From the film's very beginning, it is hard to imagine what the all Matrix references are relating to. Apart from being set in the future, humanity being slightly subjugated, and there being some awesome fight scenes, (three things apparent in most action movies), there is no other comparisons to draw. There is no machines. There is no alternate reality. Everything that transpires was created by humans, for humans, and could happen with future humans. And that makes it much more scary and realistic than anything the Wachowski's could ever produce.Final Thoughts - Spectacular and underrated film, which means you can usually get it for a bargain price at the shops. Everything is handled in a brilliantly realistic way for a futuristic film, and the approach to the fight scenes and entire film is uniquely applaudable. The only faults that the film falls down on is weakening it's integrity by including many cheesy film stereotypes, and for also having little in the way for re-play value other than to watch the fighting again in slow motion. Rent it, borrow it from a friend, buy it if it's cheap, but whatever you do, make sure you watch this film at least three times. It will take you that much to be fully awed by the world, amazing by the battles, and appreciative of the characters.",Equilibrium

It also, however, ""borrows"" ideas from Movies Fahrenheit 451 and even The Matrix. After reading 1984 and seeing the two movies, ""Equilibrium"" was terrible for me. It was completely unoriginal, and did not even explain the main ideas of the other sources of media nicely. Because I love the book, I have to rate this a five, but it really deserves lower.

Human kind has now united in a society called Libria, in this society, there in no emotion. All forms of art, music and literature are banned totally and all people must take a drug called prozium that eliminates all the highs and lows emotion such as anger, hate, grief, joy, love etc... the people don't feel anything. The hole point of the system is to end war and murder.If you are court feeling or in possession of emotional content (EC-10) you are a sense offender and you are to be eliminated as soon as possible without trial. The police force is called Tetragrammaton, the enforcers are called Grammaton Clerics who are trained in the deadly art of GUN KATA.The No.1 enforcer is John Preston (Christain Bale, the new Batman). He has spent his hole life tracking down sense offenders, but one day he misses his dose of prozium and than, well i won't give too much away.It's also got Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and Sean Bean.This film saw very, very limited advertising due to the budget - they didn't want to turn a money maker into a money loser - i know very few people who know this film even exists. This whole movie cost less than just ""The Freeway Scene"" in Matrix Reloaded, only 20 million dollars (which is chump change to Hollywood these days).This film has Awesome action and a great story.

The Matrix was an imperfect movie, because you have to believe that machines can extract energy out of humans. Otherwise, everything else was pretty cool and thought-provoking.Equilibrium, on the other hand, doesn't even make an attempt at being interesting or novel, although it does make a spectacularly dismal attempt at being cool. The plot twists are predictable. The set design is a 5-minute copy many much better movies. The characters completely contradict the plot at every turn. The big-picture philosophy is one gi-normous cliché and the intellectual equivalent of me telling you ""hey, I don't believe the world is flat, I think it's round"".This movie is comparable to Matrix in that it is set in the future and has high-action martial-arts-laced scenes. The comparison ends there. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of one is because the ""Gun Kata"" was mildly entertaining to watch.The Weinstein Bros were wise in not releasing this in US theaters.

I really can't understand how the screenwriter and the director could expect from adult and mentally mature people to swallow such an idea as to avoid wars and violence all is need to be done is erasing ALL kinds of feelings and emotions and colours of the world... What perverted mind can hit upon that idea? Is it not obvious that there are positive emotions and negative ones, and that not necessary negative feelings such as anger, hatred, rage etc. but often sober-minded calculations bring to wars?

My only problem with the movie is the the practice of taking the drugs that will block your feelings. I mean as far as I understand the system expects eveybody to take their regular doses without any questioning or without any external problems. But such a system is obviously doomed to fail. If for some reason you miss a dose or two and start feeling again, I believe noone would go back on that drug. Then they kill them all and with such a rate there wouldnt be left anybody to kill letalone fight a resistance.

I do agree with some of the comments, about how if you're in a world with no feeling, how can you feel anger, and other emotions like these? It contradicted itself a few times, but It ruined it none the less. The action made it easy to shrug off some of the errors.

One of my friends recommended it, and what a ride I had.The movie does have flaws, like the gun-switch scene, though it doesn't really matter since the cleric was setup to do what he did, it's still a plot hole. Also, the last long distance gun fight scene can be done better. But, with all that, I loved it.Christian Bale is the perfect cast. I always think that extreme emotions are easier to act than subtle ones, and here it is the latter. There were no cries, laughs throughout the movie, yet you can feel the sadness, joyfulness from the smallest expression change, from the eyes, which is not easy to achieve. Beautifully done.Also, the movie flows smoothly. Not like the Matrix or other Sci-Fi movies, in which things just happen randomly, here the story develops itself naturally. I am not sure why some people don't understand the reason clerics were destroying arts/musics/books, the answer is simple, because they are the main objects to bring out feelings in human beings.I can't believe it only made over 1M in theaters... :( I hope it can be re-released for us to watch on big screen.",Equilibrium
791,Fillinthegaps,This Move is SO-O great!!!!!,10,21 February 2006,"""Equilibrium"" was an AWESOME movie!!! I first watched it on public television having never heard or seen anything about it before. I am absolutely disappointed that i did not get to see it on the big screen!!!Firstly, what I found was the greatest thing about this movie was the spectacular acting. It was believable. In most Sci-Fi/Action movies what you get is a sort of Rambo/Conan/Braveheart mix of stilted dialogue with some impressive bouts of killing, or, some quite emotional moments and A very lame death scene. ""Equilibrium"" on the other hand managed to pull both together and I think a lot of the credit for that should go to the actors. Christian Bale, I believe, did an absolutely brilliant job at playing the Grammaton Cleric, Preston. It must have been a very hard acting job, but Christian Bale managed to show me a man who had never felt in his life feeling for the first time, in a very believable way. So good!Not having ever seen any of the other films and books mentioned in the other reviews, I found ""Equilibrium"" marvellously refreshing and original, I absolutely loved the 'gun-kata' and also found many of the little twists in the storyline a real bonus. e.g. the fact that Preston couldn't save Emily Watson from dying, the whole, managing to turn around his outburst of emotion into the conviction of Taye Diggs etc. SO-O-O fabulous!!!!I thoroughly recommend this movie to everyone who was disappointed by the Matrix sequels (as I was), but especially other chicks like me who love Sci-Fi/Action flicks but also appreciate a plot and storyline to get your teeth into. (As a guide to just how great this movie is, i went out and ordered this movie at my local DVD store and have now watched it about 10 times in the past 2 weeks, SMASHING!!!!!)""Equilibrium"" was great, awesome and all other words meaning the same thing. Now all I'm waiting for is another movie to match up to it (I'll be waiting a long time I feel)",Equilibrium
792,obsidian468,Bradbury wrote it first....,6,2 November 2008,"Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, wrote this story back in 1953 (at least, that's when it was first published).The film, still great on its own merit - something I can't say for most Hollywood films released after 1970, lacks the spirit of the original novel.I still love this film, but think Bradbury's estate should be getting royalties. It's a total rip-off.While this film is great in its own right, the similarities to Bradbury's novel are too much to ignore.At this point, I'm just trying to get ten lines of text so that the frigging bot will accept it. My review was complete four lines ago, with all of the commentary needed.",Equilibrium
793,ianlow,Sci Fi Masterpiece,10,27 March 2007,"Never even heard of this in 2002 when this was released, and 2002 was a great year itself for sci-fi. We had Star Wars Ep2, Solaris and my favourite sci-fi film up to that point ... Minority Report. Then only a couple of weeks ago, went down to my local HMV store and saw this on the shelves on sale.My expectations wasn't very high, but I am a big fan of C. Bale and to me, he was always engaging. After putting this on, and 107 minutes later, I was hooked. Not the way I was utterly impressed like Minority Report when I first watched it, but somehow, it certainly had me thinking of the movie's theme, the gunkata fight sequences, which were so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything Matrix ever had at a fraction of its budget.Then I watched it again with the commentary, and I caught all the details I missed out the first time. Then it hit me, this was a great film. No, make it a supreme film. 2nd time around, I noticed the cinematography and the production design, which were in a word, beautiful. And the story, which whilst not original, is definitely very engaging. 1984, Fahrenheit 451 are movies that come to mind, but they were never this entertanining.Make this the 1984 for this millennium, a movie that moves with the ultra slick pace of a Matrix, but with a more deep rooted theme of dystopia and control that is worlds apart from the philosophies and twists of the Walchowski bros. In a way, it is a simple story, but simple stories told well and acted well can also be profound and long lasting.And the acting, I believe Bale's role is his best. It's not easy to notice at first as he plays a cold, ruthless cleric and despatches the resistance with hardly a blink. But his physical abilities and fluid movements shows off Bale's capabilities as an action hero that can give Keanu's Neo a run for his money. But what augments this immeasurably is his ability to act ... and to slowly emote over the length of the film.Catch the scene where he awakes to a sunrise and for the first time, is able to feel and appreciate it even for this simple act. And Emily Watson's short but very effective role as the woman who first instigate him to think about turning. Their scenes are not the easiest, yet the tension and eventual connection they make through just looks and the slightest of dialogue. Sean Bean is always equally memorable in his very brief role as Bale's partner.Round it up with good performances by Taye Diggs and Angus McFadden and this movie surpasses the usual sci-fi stilted acting that we are so often bombarded with. Kurt Wimmer, the director is also a smart director. Instead of giving us clichés, he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect, short but stunning fight sequences instead of prolonged fights and explosions/stunts which only hampers the story and pace.Ultimately, it's a movie that rewards with subsequent viewings, and may explain why this has turned into such a cult classic among its devoted followers, myself included. Fan fiction and fan videos have already extended the world of Libria and pay homage to the movie and its characters. While it may never reach the dizzying heights of Matrix, it doesn't need to.This film is not for the masses, but for those who can really appreciate its intentions and its strong visuals (despite its lack of budget) and eventually, the theme behind it. As Kurt himself says, its more about numbness towards everything and how one man reacts to it and finds himself liberated by the simplest of things that we take for granted.For myself, I will enjoy rewatching this as only the best in sci-fi movies can compel me to do so. It is simply not just a sci-fi cult classic, it is a genuine masterpiece in a genre that rarely produces one.",Equilibrium
794,james.campbell,"daring, many interesting ideas",9,17 July 2003,"Loved how it dared to go where Fahrenheit 451 has ruled for so long. GunKata does rival the Matrix for its combat styles.  Shades of social/religious/political brainwashing teasingly depicted like communism/fascism meets a Vulcan doctrine....  Even though it lacks in certain areas (such as emotion showing), it dares to tread, nay sprint, carrying so many fresh ideas.  A film you can watch again and easily leads to further discussions.",Equilibrium
795,Sn@ke,1984 meets Matrix,7,21 May 2003,"Before I saw the movie, I had some expectations partly due to the rating on this very site. At the same time I was excited to see a big-budget sci-fi again (they don't come that often). Having seen Equilibrium, I was dissapointed and thrilled at the same time: the lighting and art direction were marvelous, but the promising (and pretentious) premise in the beginning was not investigated all that well. The idea that feelings are pointed out as being the one cause for all human terror is potential, but the script doesn't allow us do to much thinking of ourselves unfortenately. What the viewer's supposed to think is so obvious, that the filosophical mind is soon bored. The fighting scenes on the contrary are astonishing and Bale's acting word is not all that bad either. 7 out of 10 therefor.",Equilibrium

As for the action sequences, some may compare them to the Matrix, but that is irrelevant. The action in Equilibrium is much more realistic, it maintains a sense of style and a little choreography without getting overly-extravagant.  The sequences are a joy to watch.Everyone who hasnt seen the movie yet: The bottom line is that this is a pretty solidly put together science-fiction/action movie that is really fun to watch.As for the rest of you...1. It doesnt matter what stories this movie's plot is similar to.  Yes weve seen similar, nearly identical ideas before, but if you dont think EVERYTHING is just a copy of something else, that is just naive.2. This is a work of SCIENCE FICTION, people.  I would think self-proclaimed Star Wars fans could understand that.  Reality is defined by the movie, not by us.  Accept the fact that these men are trained well enough to take down seven armed guards without firing a single shot.  After all, why not accept the unpreparedness of those same guards if you can accept the atrocious aim of every single stormtrooper that has every pointed a blaster at Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?3.

797,andyleece,More emotion than action,8,6 July 2003,I have bought this movie some time ago and I was wondering if I should watch it before other good movies on my list. I guess it would be just another fun-to-watch sci-fi action movie with loads of action so I put it aside until I decided to watch it 2 days ago.And so I was wrong. It is not just another action movie. It is surprisingly good. It has more emotion than action. Of course there are action sequences throughout the movie but I was touched with the emotionally part of the movie. The action sequences in fact are worth watching too especially for the Gun Katas which is very fresh. A well made sci-fi movie as a whole.,Equilibrium

Moulin Rouge was the first to make me feel that it had done something right in a movie because it was right (not to make everything feel good.) I have been stunned by special effects or the effects that are so very subtle.This movie just blows all that out of the water. I was stunned and sooooo pleasantly surprised. There is a scene at the beginning where the movie just slapped me and proclaimed it would not be the same as other movies. The use of silence, color and plot were just marvelous. There have been movies I loved where I found some things just too cheesy and wish i could change that part of the movie. Equilibrium was not like that. I just had to sit at the end and appreciate every part of the movie. Knowing that they did not compromise  on length, actors or anything to appease anyone. Taye was even good in the movie .. something I was not expecting. Sean Bean .. he was in the movie !!! Did not even know that from the one preview I saw.

Everything is done so well, I mean, you would think that in a film where no one has emotion, there would be more slip ups but there aren't. The style of fighting is singularly graceful and all of the fight scenes are a joy to watch. The DVD even has a special feature separate from the chapter selection that lets you jump to any fight scene. There is also something truly beautiful in some of the scenes such as Christian Bale's character crumbling under the power of emotions he has never felt due to the simplest things such as hearing a piece of music or seeing the sun rise and when he has to watch the woman he loves being executed, well, you just have to see it. Also, the costume people should be commended for the simplicity of the dress in the film is the final touch in illustrating how nothing, not the tiniest thing that could spark off an emotion is allowed.",Equilibrium

I am a great fan of Christian Bale and prided myself in having seen all his movies. Well I was quite surprised to see a preview on TV for a Sunday Night movie where my favored actor was kicking behinds. I really enjoyed the story line and the action. The fight scenes were excellent and the acting was extraordinary. I loved it!!! Without giving out to much the main character - Christian Bale - has a family and a great job. Well that what he thinks. His wife gets taken away for having personal items. Their society does not regard feelings has being a necessary thing even dangerous. The source of humanity;s problems. Christian Bale's character does not remember his wife taken away until later in the movie. His children are empty shells. His partner becomes dangerous as he starts collecting items found in their victims' houses. They clash. And finally Bale's character admits that killing people for having feelings and souvenirs might not be quite the right way about healing humanity. His society's fear of war and disease has killed something special in them. He struggles to free himself and the rest of the world. In the end he prevails - a true hero.,Equilibrium

Not quite...,6,26 December 2002,"The problem I had with this movie was NOT its similarities to _1984_, _Brave New World_ and/or _Fahrenheit 451_, but the sense that it really brought nothing truly new to the party, plot-wise.Yes, I left the movie quite exhilarated from all of the action scenes. That was, with a doubt, some top-notch editing; I haven't seen anything that jaw-dropping since_The Matrix_.  But still, as I came down from the buzz on the drive home, I felt like something was missing. It took me a while to figure out, but then I realized what my beef was: nothing about the plot really made me think. The society portrayed in this movie was so obviously bleak and devoid of beauty and value that the alternative -- a society of expression and love, with an undercurrent of more ugly base desires -- is a paradise by comparison. It doesn't really take the issue and ""run with it"". Rather than create a society of tradeoffs that could make for good conversation, it creates a society with virtually no redeeming qualities.Yes, the action sequences were great.

Moreover, the comparison with the Matrix is unfortunate. The Matrix is unique and Equilibrium just a false copy.On the other hand, the subtlety of the plot is no better than an ordinary film.

Still, despite quality performances (and a horrible casting for the main antagonist)it was the ending that really sold me. Honestly, how often do we really get a good sci-fi action ending anymore? If this movie was given a big release with heavy marketing today (i.e., AEon Flux or Ultraviolet), it would be an instant hit.

I watched it a second time and that's when i got the full story and ever since then i have just loved this movie. It's a must see for all action and story driven fans. This movie is based in the future and everyone follows the guide lines of whom everyone calls father. He is the leader and equal to a president like figure. The people in this future era a forced to take an emotion suppressant, which makes them have no emotions (anger, sorrow, happiness etc). The main character of this movie is Christian Bale who plays the role of John Preston, a loyal officer of the law who originally fights against the resistance, but then converts over to fighting for there cause, ""freedom""! Emotions can cause people to do some amazing things. It can also cause people to do terrible things, but it's all in the options of a single person.",Equilibrium

Also, the final showdown fight is so cliche - if you are fighting a war and have the chance to win for the benefit of all humanity, why would you put down your guns to give the enemy a fair chance in a sword fight?  To make the director happy, that's why.",Equilibrium
829,darthwedgie@yahoo.com,Complexly bold **minor spoiler**,10,31 July 2003,"Equilibrium took a big risk with it's subject matter and it's execution. While others may not agree, it pulled it off with grace, talent and believablity.The idea of a perfect world in which war and dishonesty does not exist is an ideal that we all share and would all like to see achieved. But what most don't realize that for it to be achieved, ""Equilibrium"" must exist.
The basic concept for this film is that the world has been cut off of all extreme emotion (i.e. Love, anger, fear, compassion, regret, frustration, apathy, creativity, pride.) The purpose behind this is to try and stop any type of conflict from arising in any given situation.Now, a lot of people have told me, while discusing this film, that there are times when you see the characters ""feeling"" when they are supposed to be devoid of all emotion. But what they, and others, fail to realize, that the drug that hinders the emotion can not get rid of every emotion. Having no emotion at all would cause people to have a lack of motivation do to anything at all, even keeping themselves alive. It just cuts off the brain from realizing the extremes of emotions that could possibly lead to any type of confrontation.The action sequences in the film have also been questioned in my discussions. **a bit of a spoiler** The idea that a man could take out 6-12 guys with guns does seem a bit absurd. But when you think about how small groups of armed men work, be it in movies or real life. They tend to work under the ""strength in numbers"" ideal, which would have them clumped rather closely together. So if you were to train a soilder to fight against both that and long range combat at the same time, you get a single soilder that could take out a large number of people. (There are self defense and fighting styles that do teach this in the actual world.) And I believe that it was done very well in this film.Over all Equilibrium is more of an action/drama than a sci-fi/thriller. With it's main focuses on what it is to be 'human.' Why emotion is so important, both good and bad. And that, sadly, a perfect world could probably never exist.I personally think Equilibrium is a wonderful film, for a lot of different types of movies lovers, and it deserves it's place in recognition. 10 out of 10.Thank you drive through.",Equilibrium

Perhaps true, but the story is smartly and beautifully told, the writing and acting are great and the bottom line is that it is ultimately a very GOOD movie.How many times do we see boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back type movies?

I was tempted not to return it to the video store to save someone else ever renting it.If all the characters were on an emotion suppressing drug, then why would they be tempted to go off of it. Desire is an emotion. Why do the people who are enforcing the drug, have such tempers? Anger is an emotion. In fact it's close to hate which is the emotion they are claiming to suppress. There's no war? They are at war for the entire movie against the revolutionaries who can think of investing in a sniper to shoot the non moving cleric. (Ok, I can suspend belief for the gun-kata art for the sake to the movie.)Oh, and as if it's a puppy that is the final catalyst to make Cleric John Preston finally revolt against the system which he works for. Well, at least the film makers had a sense of humour.I'm fairly disappointed in Emily Watson for involving herself in this project. Hope she got a decent cheque.Why it's compared to the Matrix is beyond me. There's no bullet time. There's no cyberpunk influence. Is it the black clothes?I wish people would put more thought in to reviews and comparisons. Don't you realize you're spreading misinformation to people? Everyone seemed to use this movie as a ""I'm gonna be cool and underground and not like Matrix because it got popular"" outlet.

834,alex-capricious,"It's The Matrix, but with actors and a plot!",8,16 April 2007,"This was on Film 4 last night and I thought I would give it a try as I missed it first time round.I wasn't disappointed.Firstly there is the plot. The idea of pseudo-religious fundamentalists running the world and censoring history and knowledge really isn't that far-fetched and the point, although at times laboured, made sense. The nods in the direction of Orwell's Big Brother coupled with some terrific action scenes and Bale's ability to emote and act (Keanu take note!) gave it an air of gravitas lacking from the Matrix and its sequels.Secondly there was the build up to the climax and the dramatic tension. Again, belying its Sci-Fi roots, it gives as much weight as to why something is happening as to how it happens. There is an inherent difficulty in portraying a society where feelings are hidden in that you have to make the point where feelings come to the fore seem dramatically credible without descending into hysteria or melodrama and Bale is an actor of enough capability to make this transition seem plausible.Even if you are not a fan of this genre there is enough that is good here to recommend it. Bale and the supporting cast carry it off without ever descending into unintentional farce; the plot and story are well structured to avoid these pitfalls. The near-future setting with the regime that is in place has some familiarity with films such as V for Vendetta and Children of Men.8 out of 10",Equilibrium

836,Smithroz,Lighten up. It's just a movie...,9,28 May 2003,"...some enjoy a whole lot more than others.Many who wrote they didn't like Equilibrium go on to call those of us who did drooling idiots.  If they slandered us with style and wit, not to mention good grammar, their reviews might be worth noting. But in a critique of the critics on this site most of the style points go to Equilibrium's many fans.The science fiction genre often seems to bring out the worst in movie audiences.  Pseudo intellectuals demand grimly novel philosophies of life, the universe and everything.  The irredeemably shallow seek only two hours of cartoon action interlaced with portentous cant to fuel this month's outbreak of block buster movie syndrome.  Between these two extremes there appears little room for small, enjoyable films like Equilibrium that try to balance nifty action with interesting ideas while having a bit of fun in the process.I find those who slam Equilibrium as derivative a bit dishonest. When pretentious critics like a film these days, they turn plagiarism into an asset by raving about how the director paid homage to his predecessors.
The pans of the acting also amuse me. There is a huge difference between suppressing what is naturally there and being born-or created-without the wiring needed to experience emotion at all like the comic foils in Star Trek.I doubt if any drug could ever make humans totally emotionless and still leave us functioning as the social creatures we have to be to maintain life itself. But drugs do suppress highs and lows, reduce inhibitions and make us more open to the power of suggestion.All the people I know who use Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil etc. describe themselves as independent thinkers.  Are they?  One serious take on Equilibrium is that the most dangerous suggestion of all may be that of pharmaceutical companies' alluring advertising 'use our psychiatric drugs and be free'.
Director Kurt Wimmer has said fan reaction to his movie during previews was ""volcanic"".  Equilibrium certainly raised lots of emotion among movie fans here.I found Equilibrium definitely worth the price of admission, if only for the hilarious scenes with the puppy.

Worth watching it 3 times a day. It shows you the strength of human nature which prevails no matter how much suppressed. A masterpiece from Kurt Wimmer deserved to be revised at least in a month. I saw it very late as compared to the date it was released but after watching I eventually said ""thumbs up to you guys"". The best thing in the movie was the portraying of human emotions, for instance, after the combustion of Mary O'Brien, how deeply Preston was caught by grief and sorrow and broke out risking his life so much. It really is, if not better than Matrix, certainly not lesser by any aspect.",Equilibrium

Kurt Wimmer was able to combine action with good story and good acting (with the exception of Taye Diggs, who was a little disappointing).  The movie takes place in a post-World War III timeline in which all forms of emotion are illegal and punishable by death. But don't think of these people as Vulcan-like from Star Trek, rather than just controlling their emotions, they completely remove them with a drug called Prozium. The Clerics are the enforcers of this new government who employ a style of fighting called Gun-Kata (I won't say any more about that, you must see it for yourself). Over all it was an exciting, and great film, that combined elements from Farenheit 451, 1984, and even a little of the Matrix but with a little spin on everything. I think you will enjoy it.

The director, Kurt Wimmer, frequently says that if he had more time to shoot particular scenes the movie would have been much better.  And I have to agree.  Everything he comments on and wished he could fix would have improved this highly imaginative sci-fi flick.Wimmer is not insensitive to what this movie could have been.  He pays homage to movies preceding his own including Metropolis and Fahrenheit 451. He recognizes that Equilibrium does not standalone in the science fiction arena and states his movie ""rips off"" the Matrix and shots from The Crow. Kurt Wimmer gives credit where credit is due and through this movie he uniquely blends originality with amusing familiarity.
Wimmer knows what everyone else knows about this movie, and that is with more time and money Equilibrium would, or should have been an instant classic without dispute.And I have to admire the no bulls**t fighting sequences in this movie. This raw action not seen since John Woo may prove to be Wimmer's most lethal weapon in his next feature film.",Equilibrium
842,jenechka80,It 's changed something in me,9,23 September 2007,"You see, I'm not good in such things, but I can't leave this film out without telling my opinion. I really liked it. I was looking thru our local network when I found this film. There were no ratings, no comments - only a description. And something made me to see it. I was shocked - I do not mean I hadn't seen anything like that before, no. But how it was made - that's what astonished me.I got deep inside it, I was feeling with the heroes. I looked at the rainbow, that Preston sees in the window, as I'd never seen it before in my life - just like him. I almost felt the touch of their fingers, when he interrogates Mary and touches her hand. You see, this films just makes you feel. And that's its purpose, I think, and it answers it.I can't compare it to any of the films that had been made before and I won't do it, 'cause too many people had done it already. I just say that this film has something in it that rises something inside your soul, that awakes feelings.I give all my respect to Christian Bale for his acting, he's really one of the best actors of our times (IMHO).So people go and see this film and make your own opinion. 'cause it's only your free choice whether to like it or not.My best regards to everybody...P.S. such a pity that there're so many comments on the making of the film and on the comparing it to the Matrix etc., whilst there are few on the meaning of it. Just imagine: feelings that are so deeply rooted in human nature to be pulled up and thrown away - no love, no passion, no fear, no sorrow, no pity, no mercy, no laugh, no joy, no anything. Just emptiness.Then perhaps you'll see the world with Preston's eyes, and the first feeling would knock you down and turn inside out and it would almost tear you apart - only then you will understand everything. I hope you can do it.",Equilibrium
843,bluecalix,Amazing action sequences with an interesting but not totally original plot,9,6 December 2002,"WOW.  First, let me say to the many literate critics out there, the plot is basically Fahrenheit 451 done Hong Kong action style.  That being said, it has some nice touches plot wise that make it more interesting than most SciFi movies.Many have compared it to the Matrix, but I think this movie is much better. Better actors, better action (with a miniscule budget), and nothing as cheesy as the Matrix's ending (although the BS with the dogs was close). There are some beautiful sets done with no money.  The highest compliment I can give it in this respect is that it was as well done as the equally low budget Titus.  The action was very frenetic, but not the sole focus of the film.  I read a reviewer that said as he watched it he kept saying to himself, 'I've never seen THAT before', and I concur.Some of the themes of the film are very timely considering many of the things many people are considering in today's climate of the liberty versus security debate.  Ultimately and predictably he chooses freedom as the heros in these things always do, but there are some grey areas there.

Eliminate them and you have a race of motiveless zombies. If none of the characters ""feel"" anything at all (fear of punishment, anger at those breaking the law, etc.) how are they motivated to do anything whatever? This is never explained, as far as I can see. SF is all about ""what if?"" but if the ""what if"" is ridiculous, the resulting story will be silly as well. That, sadly, is the case here. Also, the gunfight scenes are laughable. The concept of a ""gun Kata"" that makes someone effectively impervious to gunfire just doesn't wash.

851,EpcotBoy,Biggest Surprise of the Year!,10,11 December 2002,"This film blew me away from the first scene! It has some of the best action sequences ever seen on film! Not only is it filled with some amazing action, but it has a story that is enjoyable to watch!  First of all, in regards to the story, it borrows a lot from Farenheit 451 and 1984, so the idea is nothing new, but the way it is viewed IS! This movie will be compared a lot to the Matrix, but I must say that Equilibrium has it beat not only in action but in the story as well. The story in Equilibrium has heart. You empithize with Christian Bale's character as he goes from a high ranking officer in a society that punishes those who feel emotion and experience creativity to a man who is discovering himself and everything he has been blind to when he learns to feel emotion. The music greatly enhances the cathartic effect you will feel while this story unfolds.With that said, now we get to the action which is present and accounted for in this movie! It introduces a style of martial arts/gunfighting called ""gun-kata"" which for action fans is reason enough to see this movie. It is very unique and although it was probably inspired by The Matrix, in no way is it the slow-motion, CGI bullet-ripping, high flying fighting that you may have become used to. It has a style all of its own. It is fast paced action that will leave your jaw dropped during any action sequence. When Christian Bale's character walks into a room, you hope that he faces opposition only so you can see him tear the room up one more time! Gun-kata is not something you can imagine when you hear about it, ""you have to see it for yourself.""I find it amazing that they have put no effort into marketing this movie when it is truly a cinematic gem. Do yourself a favor and go see it, you won't be sorry that you did.

The film was almost totally centred around the characterisation of Bale's ""clerk"" figure. His performance was as ever slick, and for most the the performance - genuine. His character was well portrayed and really captured the transition from his initial robotic persona, to his latter more emotionally free state of mind. This was illustrated both in his professional life and his social interactions and really showed how his entire existence was shaped totally by the numbing of emotion. Some great ideas and proficient acting, not to mention lots of traditional ""destroying the place"" action mixed in, really gives this movie the edge over many other similar titles within the broad action genre.",Equilibrium
854,Twiin,Huzzah!,10,19 May 2003,"This is a first film by Kurt Wimmer, who wrote, directed, and kicked my ass. Seriously, this film would have been an instant sci-fi/dystopian classic if Dimension Films had marketed it whatsoever. I had never heard of it before I stumbled across it in a binaries newsgroup, and I thought it'd be a funny Matrix rip-off that'd be worth a few laughs. Instead, I got the ass-kicking.This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. Visually, it's beautiful. Set in an Orwellian post-war world, the visuals mix imposing real-life architecture (Hitler's Olympic Stadium) with paintings instead of models, giving the setting a washed-out, surreal feel. The action sequences show the first real innovation in film gunfights since Bullet Time, or when Chow-Yun Fat first jumped onto a dolly with two handguns. All the actors are perfect (really, perfect) in their roles, and the lighting is the best I've seen since a Coen film.Wimmer manages to do more with a ridiculously short shooting window and a tiny budget than most action directors have ever done. No distracting CGI, no wires (really - no wires), and for at least half the action sequences, no choreographer and no rehearsal time. The only thing more impressive than the movie itself is that it came out of production conditions terrible enough to sink most films.In addition, the movie is brilliant. Obviously drawing from Bradbury, Huxley, P. K. Dick and other great dystopian writers, the world this movie is set in gives me the same chills that I felt the first time I read 1984. The plot is simple, but the narrative is complex, and repeated viewings reveal insight and subtleties into the motivations of the characters.I've seen a dozen reviews that have called it the worst piece of cinema since Battlefield Earth, but I can't say enough good things about this film. It's science fiction, it's dystopian literature, and it's a fantastic action movie. Rent it. Buy it. If you can't find it, I'll give you a copy. Just watch it.",Equilibrium

856,whoopage,Utter Crap.,1,4 April 2008,"Are you serious? Lets think about the basic idea behind the plot of the movie - the simple idea that emotions and feelings are not allowed, and that those in charge, don't have them and will keep all others from having them.At first mention, it sounds like a cool concept. A pretty good idea for a story, and it gets people going - the feeling of not being allowed to feel! But any competent person should be able to immediately realize how absurd this idea is. From it's very conception, the idea for the story is utterly and completely flawed.I'll break it down simply first, then get more detailed. Simply: If there is no emotion, there can be no conflict. If there is no conflict, there is no story. No story, no movie. Or at least, that's what the creators and writers should have realized from the start and this whole project should have died there.But they didn't, and now we need to go into detail and show why this movie just doesn't work: The current rulers of Libria supposedly have no emotion, or at least those that enforce the will of the leaders have no feelings. If they have no emotion, why then do they care if other's do? In order to care, to have the capacity ""to care"", as in feel in-deferent or adversely to another's actions... oh wait, I said it right there - to feel. Therein lies the flaw, but lets not stop there.The most devout follower, Andrew Brandt (played by Taye Diggs), exhibits feelings in more than one instance. Passion, anger, humor, doubt, all of these are shown. He gives a passionate speech to everyone in a room about Preston (Christian Bale), he questions his future, he taunts the protagonist, he shows fear (or feigns it - but to feign would be the product of deceit, and do I really need to explain that as well?) when being dragged away, and above all a point is made to show that he has ambition... A desire to rise in power. Why would a man who can't feel a thing desire power and prestige? And all this from ONE character.The writers and creators present at the beginning of the movie the concept of no feelings, and then completely ignore it throughout the rest of the film.If that first example were not enough, here is another. Taken from the plot summary on Wikipedia: ""Following a standard police raid on a Librian woman, Mary O'Brien, who has stopped taking Prozium..."" If this ""Prozium"" takes away all emotion and feeling, how and why did this O'Brien decide, or even desire, to stop taking it? I don't think I even need to elaborate - it speaks for itself. The entire story is so full of holes I don't understand how it every even got past the conceptual stage. It just goes to show the crappy quality of films being put into production these days. In fact, I would almost rather watch a Uwe Boll film than this. At least those have a more solid story.Don't waste your time on this film, unless having action (with ridiculous and amateurish cinematography, and extremely poorly choreographed fights) is all you require in a film.All in all, this is a film that tried to capitalize on the Matrix's success, and failed miserably (but that's a whole other argument against this film). Stay away at all costs - as was said, it was flawed from the start.",Equilibrium

I am really surprised that I'd never heard of the flick before and really happy to have pulled it from Hollywood obscurity. It was totally different than what I expected. The movie builds up slowly, but you see why in the last 30-35 minutes. You find yourself completely wrapped up in the story and the action sequences are classic. There are also surprise twists and turns that catch the viewer and the characters in the movie unaware. When I finished I started going back over the little clues I had missed in my mind. I could watch this again and again and I will. There are even eye-candy shots for the ladies! What more can you ask for? A must see for fellow Bale fans!",Equilibrium

861,Film_King_SB,Trying Too Hard To Please,4,6 October 2008,This film was dull and lack-lustrous. The action scenes were very co-ordinated well but this was nothing compared to The Matrix. I think it tried too hard to set a story with meaning but it failed miserably. The budget for the film looked very low and maybe they tried to compensate it by focusing on the drama element which was not written well enough. I was bored 20 minutes in and wondered why they kept it so long when most of the plot could have been figured out before it happened. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of British comedian Brian Connely even though it is a brief appearance it lifts the mood into hysteria. Overall a forgettable film with a sombre performance by Christian Bale and the rest of the cast.,Equilibrium
862,thecleaner,"Fantastic--Farenheit 451 by way of ""Gun Kata""",10,8 December 2002,"""Equilibrium"" is a new movie starring Christian Bale. Christian bale is a ""Grammaton Cleric"", an elite agent of a post war world three dystopian government that has outlawed all strong emotion, seeing human emotion the source of war and crime. They enforce this by medicating all the citizenry, and executing ""sense offenders"" on the spot. All art, music, and anything else eliciting emotion is outlawed and destroyed, being rated EC-10 (Emotional Content, rating 10"") by the totalitarian ruling elite and burned promptly. Bale's character misses a dose of his ""Prozium"" and finds himself questioning his society. As a death-dealing Cleric, skilled in the ways of ""The Gun Kata"", this gets pretty intense, by way of profound, eye-candy gun and sword combat. The movie is a great combination of expressionistic film-making and thoughtful script, and beautifully choreagraphed action.My wife and I loved it. You've got to get out and see this film. When we went, it was only playing on one screen to a very sparse croud over at a local theater. I'm sure it will get yanked very soon, but will quickly assume cult status after its release.",Equilibrium
863,dominodamsel,Blatant rip-off of 1984!,6,6 August 2003,"Whilst this film was reasonably enjoyable and the fight scenes were pretty dam good, has nobody noticed that the story is a blatant rip-off of George Orwell's classic novel 1984! Obviously the people who think that this is a really original film have never heard of the book that originally coined the term ""Big Brother"" which has been altered to ""Father"" in Equilibrium. The acting is impressive particularly from Christian Bale and Emily Watson but the film wasn't as action packed as I expected it to be. The trailer gave the impression that the audience would be in for a Matrix style treat with an abundance of special effects and fight scenes but it failed to deliver on this count. The whole concept of the film is clearly ""inspired"" from 1984, with issues of mind control, conformity, lack of emotion and freedom. I was half expecting characters to be whisked off to Room 101! Despite the comparisons with 1984, Equilibrium was still a good film and a bit different from the average action/futuristic film.",Equilibrium

I guess if you have good action, a good story, people dying, and you don't need tissue paper in the theater to watch it, It must be a bad movie.  I say that's bull#@*&!?  Equilibrium combines elements from The Matrix, The Killer(by John Woo, another must see), Sphere, and a little touch of the Twilight Zone.  It's an action-packed thrill ride that make you question the value that we put on that thing that seperates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.  Our Emotions.

I usually stay away from movie boards, and in fact, this is my first time to post in one.  I just came from seeing this movie, and I must say that it was a poorly underdone movie.  I kept on waiting for the story to take me somewhere, for there to be a greater sense of emotion coming from the main character.  None of that happened. Additionally, The music was more distracting than it was helpful.  It looked like an overpriced student film.  Equilibrium is a huge let down of a film.",Equilibrium
866,seekers_eye,A thought-provoking B-movie,10,7 December 2002,"*possible spoilers*How often does one watch a low budget action movie that has a true philosophical point behind it?  The questioned asked by Equilibrium is what does it mean to be human?  What does it mean to be truly alive?  Yes, man is capable of great hatreds, but also of great love, we are just as capable of creation as we are destruction.  The story tells us that as we take away our ability to make war, we also take away our ability to love and to create.In the few user comments already posted for this movie, each one mentions the ""Gun-kata"" sequences.  There is a certain ironic subtlety in those sequences.  An art form was created to destroy art.  To some people, the action scenes may take away from the overall message, but it also illustrates dramatically the theme of the movie.  That creation/destruction, love/hate, good/evil, war/peace are intertwined and inseparable.  All these feelings have to balance each other or be in equilibrium. :-)As for the performances, Christian Bale was excellent as always, believably playing both the emotionless upholder of the society and the man learning to feel.  The true defining moment was when he looked at the playback of when his own wife was executed, as he stood by with no passion or emotion. Emily Watson turned in another fine performance full of dignity and humanity.The only performance I had was with Taye Diggs, and only because his character showed a flaw in the writing from the beginning.  He was clearly ambitious, and ambition, like any need or drive is fueled by emotional desire.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie, as for the low budget, I think it helped in a way to create a drab colorless world.  And big budgets don't always translate into superior story telling as in Mission Impossible 2.",Equilibrium
867,jakelubniewski,Matrix on Speed! (Possible Spoilers),9,7 December 2002,"This film is incredible.  I am a regular movie goer, and I believe this movie should do great in the box office.  Unfortunately, I believe it has come out at the wrong time.  The film is going against bigger movies.  The only shot this film has is word of mouth. The movie will explode when people start talking about the incredible plot and action.The amazing action scenes should propel this movie into greatness.  The action scenes, while slightly unoriginal, have intence sequences and violent images.  The picture deserves the R rating given by the MPAA.  The sequences are filled with excitement, the fine camera work brings the fight scenes to life.  Moviegoers will sit back in their seats and watch with bewilderment as they visualize the gifts of the characters on the screen.  The action is comparable to the Matrix.  The Matrix is one of the greatest movies ever. This said Equilibrium took the style of the Matrix, and cranked it up a notch.The acting was great.  Christian Bale does a remarkable job. He brings his character to life like few actors can.  His performance was portrayed even better through the fine craftsmanship of the DP.In an askewed look at what the future could hold for us, this picture showed how one man can make a difference.  This film definitely makes you think, and dishes out some intence scenes as well.In one sentence: Matrix on SPEED!",Equilibrium
868,dwh3721,Lower your expectations and give it a chance.,10,6 December 2002,"I was anticipating this movie so reviewing it is affected by rose colored glasses and tempered by my shattered expectations, heh.  In quick defense of this film, it has been attacked on a level far above its budget and depth. It's scifi plot is an action vehicle which is being compared unfairly to the landmark work Farenheit 451, while the action and production is being contrasted with The Matrix's (with a budget nearly 4 times greater)... this is also Wimmer's first writing/directing project done in gritty analog not shiny and sharp digital.  The comparisons being made simply aren't fair. There are also ""plot holes"" that have been pointed out which simply show a lack of attention on the viewer's part.  That said, I have my own complaints.A good sound track shouldn't be noticed, acting only to compliment or heighten what's already on screen, but the synthetic strains are pushing 80's B-movie buttons, the classical music is overbearing at times, and the industrial rock too much.  Perhaps, I wouldn't have noticed if more was going on, but the pacing seems awkward at times and makes otherwise poignant moments almost laughable.  I hate Watson as Bale's foil... the age difference shows and as a symbol of seduction for emotion in the film, she comes across more crazy and alluring.  With no shortage of attractive people in acting, I'm curious about that casting call... given the limited role, I would have picked eyecandy with moderate acting over Watson (forced to overact anyways).Finally, the action.  It's good, hyper kinetic and original but hard to take seriously at times.  The final ""duel"" and the pistol-whipping scenes come to mind.  I'm not sure it's good enough to make the entire movie a must see, but the scenes themselves are if you have the opportunity.In the end, I think this movie is best enjoyed as a mythology trapped in a B-movie with a shoe-string budget.  Think Highlander or Robocop.  This movie begs to be remade or turned into a TV series.  If I were doing it, I would have made the acting less hyperbolic, trimmed the plot (focusing on technical details while reducing melodrama- emphasizing that the film is a ""stupid"" action vehicle), and basically focus on the Clerics kicking ass in an out and out action film.  Recommended but only for action aficionados with lowered expectations.",Equilibrium
869,gamez,Great Movie,10,6 December 2002,"After CHUD described Equilibrium as ""a thinking man's Matrix"", I knew I had to see it. Comparing Equilibrium to the Matrix because they both have martial arts and gunplay along with a similar central theme is unfair to both movies. I liked this movie because of the incredible fight scenes with precise martial arts, the amazing gunplay, and the sleek swordsmanship, all with little or no wire work and CGI. On top of all this action is the thought provoking plot that has been so many times before but never presented this slick. There are very few movies I enjoy watching over and over again, this is definitely one of them.",Equilibrium

This movie really took me by surprise. I went in with an open mind and was not disappointed at all. This may be a hard movie to find due to its limited release and poor backing.
The good: Christian Bale does a great job in the lead and supporting cast follows closely in his shoes.  Fighting sequences were very nicely done. Lots of wire-fu and neat camera tricks.  There is a very high body count for you action junkies and the story moves along very nicely. I would fill you in on the story more but if your reading this you already know the basic outline of the movie. There are lots of other good things but you'll have to judge those for yourselfThe bad: Hmmmmmmm.... well, for a movie working on a smaller budget they did a good job.  The special effects could use a little work. Blue screen shots were not as nice as i'd like.  The music is good but the sound track could use some work. The story lags a little from time to time but, it appears to be necessary to set up the story ,thinking back.Summary: This is a Matrix-like film working on a Pitch Black budget, but it pulls it off beautifully. The movie does a good job of tapping into your feelings and makes you think what if.  What if you were forced to have no feelings? What if you had no senses?  What would a life without art, writings, music and love be like?  then it kicks you in the face with great action. 10/10",Equilibrium
872,matthew-ocasio,"My review of Equilibrium, read it, then go see it.",10,7 December 2002,"Words can not do a movie with such style justice.  Not since The Matrix have I seen so much style go into the fighting of any movie.  Although some might see this as blasphemy, I must also point out that I feel that Equilibrium matches if not surpasses The Matrix on many points.Take 4-5 Classic Utopian novels and extract the best parts from them. Now make a  well thought out story with those parts and some good original flavor.  Equilibrium isn't a re-hash of old books, it has the old formula of a fascist nation that keeps it's citizens under foot with drugs and propaganda.  But it's a new way of telling it, and in my opinion, one of if not the best.  The scenery (minus one CG scene) is unmatched since Se7en in giving a bleak outlook on life.Now for the flavor: John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Clerick, someone who is responsible for destroying things like books, paintings, and anything that makes people feel human (think the firefighters in Fahrenheit 451). Not too cool on it's own. But the Clericks are trained in martial arts.  Again, not too cool on it's own.  Ha!  Their weapon of choice is pistols, and this adds up to one of the most ingenuitive ideas in recent memory.  See, some forms of Martial Arts focuse on certain weapons, this form focuses on guns, specifically double pistols (as cool as anything can get).  The result is not just the normal gunplay that goes on in so many movies, shooting, diving behind a counter/table/wall, popping out and shooting more, going through way more bullets than possible, then shooting more.  Equilibrium has a style about it that reminds me of the best done animes.  There's such a grace to the fighting, it is a truly unique experience.  The guns aren't just a raw force, they have a style and grace all of their own.  What I mean by that is like the difference between Conan The Barbarian and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It is something that must be seen to be fully appreciated.  In fact, one scene has two people fighting with guns and it is way more comparable to a swordfight than a gunfight, that alone is worth the price of admission.So how do The Matrix and Equilibrium compare?  The Matrix was ingenuitive in it's presentation of it's fighting.  It looked amazing with the cameraplay, and the wire fighting gave it a look that had not really been done before to such an extent.  Equilibrium doesn't rely on fancy cameraplay, or on wires. The Matrix was fantastic, the characters bending the very world to their needs, therefore, while awesome, ultimately not as cool as it could have been.  Equilibrium just focuses on how awesome a human can be.  Nobody does anything that isn't plausible, and the effect is much more believable fighting, which makes the awe factor go through the roof.  I give it a 4.5 out of 5.",Equilibrium

As usual, I was practicing my theory of ""lowered expectations.""  I expect a movie to be horribly awful ahead of time, so I can not be disappointed.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the film I could not sit still in my seat.  I felt the urge to go out into the world and proclaim the utter awesomeness of ""Equilibrium.""  Such words as ""Sweet,"" ""Crazy,"" and ""Righteous"" sprang forth from my lips in rapid succession when I talked about the movie with my friends. Not since the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" have I desired to sing a movie's praises.  And I mean literally SING.  ""Equilibrium"" could, and should, be the sleeper hit of the year.  The film's action sequences stir up the blood and pump the adrenaline as if you were riding a roller-coaster.  The art style, while minimalistic, and thus maybe confused for low-budget by some, is actually quite successful in portraying a totalitarian and emotionless society.  The acting is excellent as well, and quite possibly the best I have seen in an action film in long time. While the nay-sayers will say that the film is too unoriginal, borrowing elements of its story and premise from ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Brave New World,"" these complaints can be disregarded as the movie adds enough of its own style and story to make the comparisons plausible in basic premise only. In the end, like any movie, ""Equilibrium"" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well.  It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent whole.  Go see it. Go see it twice.  Go see ""Equilibrium,"" Cleric.",Equilibrium
876,limesforchrist,Action with a plot?,7,11 December 2002,"Kurt Wimmer shakes an admonitory finger at society with an unusually well made sci-fi thriller called Equilibrium. Adorned with blood-stained carcasses that drop by the dozen the movie tells the almost cautionary (although honestly speaking, not entirely thought through) tale of a devastated post WWIII world where all emotion, or objects of beauty that may stir up emotion, are deemed illegal, and the population voluntarily subdue their own feelings with a yellow serum called Prozium (ring a bell, anyone?). Those in charge of enforcing said serenity are called Grammaton Clerics. They use a martial art that incorporates firearms called 'Gun-Kata' to pierce the flesh of their sentiment-hording enemies. The story, naturally, is about one such Cleric gone haywire, and the world-altering events that follow. Despite the volatile combination of poor acting and poor dialogue, the story in itself is engaging and the action sequences were truly redeeming, with impressive choreography and an array of cleverly-shot death sequences. Not exactly a movie for the whole family, but certainly fulfills the sadistic need in all of us to see grown men beat the crap out of one another.",Equilibrium

With this relatively unknown cast, with the exception of perhaps Christian Bale you would have expected a cheap production on the boundaries of cheesy, but the action is slick and the story fascinating. I have watched this one several times already and each time, it seems more and more like a cross between The Matrix and Japanese Manga, with its slick choreography, dynamic action scenes and never seems to drag on pointlessly like some films do these days.

Well for one thing the plot sucks, I mean how are the actors suppose to act having no feelings? It just comes out hollow and expressionless and you cant feel anything for them in return making this a very un-involving movie. Plus every single action scene is not just copied from the Matrix, its lifted from it directly. The brilliance of the lobby scene in the Matrix is ripped off blankly here and you sit in the cinema absolutely disgusted that they could do this to a masterpiece.

Overall, if you like your films to be copies with no attitude or emotional content, by all means go and see it but if the genius of the Matrix makes your heart pump and you're salivating over the sequel, do not use this to bridge the gap, just be patient, it'll all be worth it soon.......",Equilibrium

In fact, I was surprised they could pull off a film such as this, because I imagined it an incredible task for those involved in the film, especially the actors, to perform while restricting pathos as much as possible.  Sure, it is not perfect towards this pursuit - the suits, even the color of the cars, or the layout of the bathroom would not look the way it would if there was no pathos at all - but it does it as best as a visual work could do it.It is this task alone which gives this film merit, in my view, and makes the film unique just as other groundbreaking films.There is also a technical lesson it gives us.  Even in the 21st Century, Sci-Fi films can still look good without complicated CGI.  I have never see a Sci-Fi movie make such a statement as this movie does!  It refreshes the Sci-Fi film lover with simplicity, efficiency, and, ironically, realism.
The bad ones get more of a platform in this movie than the good ones, which is very interesting.  The points Father makes are somewhat accurate - and the clips and stories of dictators, wars, and political legislation ring quite true.  The price to feel is a price that includes poorness, political corruption and more.  Is it a price we can pay, not just pay, but gladly pay?  Seems we do so now.  Will we for long?  We'll see.
Many who are lovers of traditional film will probably see this film as a sad, cliche piece of trash.  And I can't blame them for seeing that.  But, again, it's not working to be the traditional film, and, personally, I'm tired of seeing films which try too hard to be unique while holding its traditional roots.  I was elated to see a film like Equilibrium and hope it starts a trend.  No way the best film I have ever seen, it is grand - and though it is cliched and has plenty of mistakes, its storytelling and use of scenery make it hard for me to notice them.The beginning shootout scene Bale does is, itself, a work of art painted on screen.  Even by the way it uses words and scenes in the main title and use of editing is, itself, refreshing.If you haven't seen this movie before, I urge you to view it as an experimental film.  Realize you may not be pleased with the results. Never the less, I urge you to keep yourself open to change.  I think it will deliver if you do so.",Equilibrium
886,cblkwell,Everything the Matrix: Reloaded should have been.,8,25 August 2003,"I found out about this movie through a BBS I'm on, and never saw it in theatrical release around here.  When I saw it for rental, a few friends and I decided to pick it up and see if it was really all that good.Every single one of us was just blown away.  The production values are very good, even for a movie which did not see wide release, the plot keeps you guessing, and the action sequences are amazing -- and well edited.  Where the fights in Matrix: Reloaded seemed to go on forever, in Equilibrium, they are just long enough and excellently done.I think that it is obvious that Equilibrium was influenced by the Matrix, as well as Logan's Run and 1984; but it is very good and stands on its own. If you liked the Matrix, you will like Equilibrium.",Equilibrium
887,couchfry,Matrixesque action with subpar acting,7,29 March 2003,"When I first heard about this movie I was interested. The backstory of the movie is really interesting a Big Brother type named The Father has taken away what makes humans cruel and 'cause wars: their emotions. The story takes place in Libria, which is under the reign of The Father. To make sure that everybody doesn't have emotions, everybody takes a dose of a drug every 6 hours or so to suppress them. But like every good story you've got to have the people against the system who are trying to fight it, the so called 'underground'. And to combat those people you've got 'clerics', Christian Bale and Taye Diggs, who hunt people who aren't taken their dosis' of emotion suppressing drugs and they hunt and destroy the things that call up emotions in us. Thus they hunt all forms of art and destroy them. The impressive opening sequence shows us the extreme extent that they go to when Christian Bale orders the destruction of the Mona Lisa. So the story revolves around this basic theme and with the struggle against The Father and The Council.The only thing that bugged me about the movie is that it's so blatantly made as a satire for the people who are against war at all costs. It stuck out like a sore thumb through most of the movie that if you're a moviegoer that actually thinks about the message of the movie, you kinda get disturbed by it. But this message is cloaked in matrisesque action sequences and a 1984 and Brave New World style story. As i watched it I continually wondered why the typically liberal movie maker would make a movie like this.
The action sequences are in essence better than in the Matrix, but the action coordinator seemingly stole a couple of action scenes out of the matrix. And that's kinda sad, 'cause the cinematographie of the action sequences are better than in the Matrix. I find them better 'cause they're made in real time and they're not cloaked in special shots and whatnot. It's graphic and shows you everything. Simply great.The acting didn't support the storyline. It seemed to continually oppose each other and thus kinda showing the glaring holes in the plot. How can somebody get angry if they're not supposed to have emotions in the first place? The only performance that true to his character, or how i think the writer intended his performance to be, was Bale's son in the movie. He stayed original to this character motivations. Bale and Diggs dissapppointed me, but i think that Bale was miscast, even though his performance in the action sequences was impeccable. And I think that Diggs' bad performance was due to the directing, 'cause it didn't seem like they were really told how they were to interact with each other.All in All, great movie if you're just going for the action scenes, but if you're going for the story and the acting you might be kinda dissapointed.
So I give it a 3 out of 5.",Equilibrium

While I loved the concept, none of the individual characters really did much for me and I still have nagging questions about just what they consider feelings (isn't anger a feeling?) and why can some citizens on prozium express them while others seem unable.

I enjoyed many different elements about the film ranging from the fantastic cast to the fight choreography.  It is a shame that it was marketed as a ""better"" Matrix, because the two have very little in common other than the fact that the leads are partial to wearing black and the intricate fight scenes.  I highly recommend this to fans of 'Fahrenheit 451' and '1984'.",Equilibrium
893,seanbalkwill,Hilariously Bad,4,11 October 2009,"I understand that people will disagree with my review, but wait. This isn't for you. And you shouldn't read this review if you like this movie, because, well, you'll just end up getting mad. And really, people have different standards about film, and it's always related to your expectations of that film going in. But if you are going to make a heady sci-fi thriller, you can't all of a sudden pull back and say, ""give me a break, it's better than Spaceballs"".My expectations were higher. As a film, I rate it a 4, as sci-fi a 6, but as a movie that you openly crack jokes about with your friends I give it an 8. If you are funny, if you are good at making jokes, it's hard not to get together with friends and step on each other's lines because there are so many opportunities. It's that bad. There are multiple reasons that it's bad, but the reason that it's a great ""bad"" film is that the production values are high and it's inhabited by several A-list actors (and an Academy award winner). It's really similar to the beautiful paintings hidden underground in the movie, except the viewer is the one who gets burned.I took this DVD over to a friend's house based on cursory reviews about how it was a sleeper, but 10 minutes in my friend raised her hand and said, ""Enough!"" Luckily, we waited it out and and the jokes started flowing. And there was enough badness to get to the end.A couple of obvious glaring points: First, the world has become a place where the populace is forced to take a drug to suppress emotion. You're not going to get the best acting out of actors who have to follow this code. In fact, Taye Diggs is at wit's end being Christian Bale's foil, and can't help showing both glee and pi**ed off anger at key points. This makes for a better film, as we really don't want to see a bunch of sad sacks walking around, but that's not how the world is supposed to be. Second, the actions of these art police, forced to find the ""sense offenders"", are simply ridiculous. Early on, they uncover a cache of art that includes the Mona Lisa, and run a scan on the painting to see if it's authentic or not. But if the world has become a place where art is illegal because it draws an emotion, even reproductions of the Mona Lisa would just be as illegal. There would be no question as to whether as to destroy it or not. After several of these nonsensical actions or plot points, the mind starts to cry for humor.Art is evidence that people care, but a smart police would try to use art to catch people not taking the drug instead of looking for hidden evidence. For instance, you could play heavy metal music to a crowd and if you see devil horns or mullets, time to make an arrest. And I would be okay with that.***Real Spoilers***Christian Bale can be a serious, intense actor, as he showed in the Dark Knight and other films, but this can also work against him. Here he decides to stop taking the futuristic Ritalin, but as an actor he never really changes his range. This could be really complicated to pull of in a film, as it probably was not filmed sequentially. But that's what would make it a better film, to see him physically change in emotion, rather than determine by his actions that he has changed.And those actions are hilarious. He's a kick-ass dude that can kill an army of men in a heartbeat, but gets weepy about puppies and (yes!) take a hidden moment to sniff a ribbon that is more than a little creepy. That's right, he sniffs a ribbon. Early on, when he""confiscates"" a book to study it further, if you substituted a porn mag for the book it would come off as ludicrous and obvious as it looks. ""I'll just, uh, confiscate this for further study"". If you are watching this film for laughs, shouting ""YOU! DROP THE PUPPY!""at the TV during a couple scenes is mandatory.Bale's son, a creepy Nazi-like kid who suspects him of showing emotion (Don't want that in parents for sure!), provides the movie with the most groan-inducing scene at the end, which I and my friend were at a loss to make fun of because it was over-the-top bad. There's nothing worse in a movie than the forced twist, and this movie has more than one. It is a shame that Bale was in a movie (The Machinist) that had a proper twist that showed clarity instead of here using it as a cheap theatrical device. As for the ""gun switch twist"", it has been discussed here by others in much better depth than I could.In this movie's world, owning a Carrot Top DVD will get you killed, as it should. But Equilibrium will, assuming you give it a chance, provide you with a lot more laughs. Just stop taking the drug.",Equilibrium

The plot doesn't ask the actors or the special effects to do anything that they can't, and Christian Bale is really good.

That is, ""Equilibrium"" is completely male-centric (it's a film by and for straight guys), has fairly high production values, hypergymnastic/balletic action scenes, and a sci-fi Orwellian plot that would seem cool and thought-provoking to a 10-year-old boy.However, if you're better acquainted with Orwell's ""1984"" or possess reasonable reasoning skills, the plot is pretty hard to swallow. ""OK, so, following WWIII, humankind realized that its own hard-wired emotions were the root of its perpetual warring, so all the remaining people in all the remaining countries of the world agreed to be dominated by a fascist leader who requires that everybody take a docility-enforcing drug.""But if you like ""The Matrix""-ish fight scenes...well, then you'll be willing to overlook the plot.",Equilibrium
896,jhw49,a wonderful combination of two great pieces of literature,10,23 February 2003,"In high school I had the privilege of reading both Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" and George Orwell's ""1984"" and was blown away by both. ""Fahrenheit 451"" continues to be my favorite book, and when I saw that a movie was being based on a combination of it and ""1984"" I was very excited. However, I was a bit skeptical, since books like these are often hard to make movies from, and thus I doubted the director's ability to successfully capture the message of both books.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got to see it in the theater.  It holds true to both books, while adding in a little bit of the new sci-fi effects seen in such movies as ""The Matrix"".  Christian Bale was perfect for part of John Preston, and the supporting actors and actresses were also cast very well.This movie is intended for pretty much all audiences, so I highly recommend it to anyone, though I also recommend reading at least one, if not both, of the previously mentioned books before watching this.  I think doing that will give you a greater appreciation of the movie.  And if you're one of those people who don't care to read books and could care less about any underlying meaning(s), this movie is pretty easy to follow and has some amazing fight scenes, so I think you will enjoy it as well.",Equilibrium

This should have been marketed to the highest degree.  Equilibrium takes place in the future, amidst a facist government.  In this society, emotions are repressed since they are the harbigners of war, murder, etc.  People take an injection which renders them emotionless.  All items which provoke emotion, such as music, art, literature, are condemned and burned.  People who have these things are executed(burned alive).  There is an underground resistance which seeks to free the people of this society and it's ways.  Here's where the elite Clerics come in.  They are lethal killers trained in the art of Gunkata, a martial art/gun fighting art which allows them to kick all sorts of ass! This is the coolest fighting style which makes for some amazing fight scenes. Back to the story, the main character is a guy named Preston who is the highest level of cleric.  He is a master cleric who becomes torn between upholding his duty and the concept of feeling...The movie is a mix of 1984 and the Matrix.  There are many things that could have made it better, like more action sequences, but the few we do get to see are nothing less than spectacular.

I had no expectations because I didn't have the vaguest idea of what the film was about. I found this to be an exhilarating and sometimes sad interpretation of an emotion-deprived world.The movie starts off being narrated by ""father"" who mentions that after the 3rd World War, a group of men got together and realized that they needed to save Humanity from Humanity's worst traits. You know - anger, love, fear, happiness, etc. A.K.A. emotions. They developed a drug (Prozium) that suppresses emotions.It actually dulls the emotions that are associated with negative thoughts and expressions, in order to avoid catastrophe's such as war.People were required to take the drug twice a day. Of course there were those individuals who decided to rebel. They were hunted down. Enter the Tetragrammaton. These were elite soldiers who practiced the art of GUNKATA.Cue John Preston( Bale),the best of the best. Private first class cleric charged with policing of sense offenders. Sense offenders were those who refused to take the drug. Cleric Preston is superb at executing and apprehending sense-offenders.The film then examines what happens when Cleric Preston misses his dose of Prozium. He begins to feel,smell,touch and appreciate music and the sacred nature of friendship.He starts to see people as more than just citizens of Libria but as humans entrusted with the most sacred gift of all: Humanity. Enter Mary,she plays the tough but tender love interest shared by both Cleric Preston and his deceased partner Patridge(whom he killed for sense offense). The best scenes were the times when he tried to save the men in the factory but they ended up in an ambush and the rescuing of the little puppy. Bale gave his character sympathetic treatment whilst retaining a hard edge.One of the movies strengths is the incredible stunts. The flip on the bike is a testament to that, not to mention the many awesome one-liners...such as ""Not Without Incident"" and ""I'm coming""Overall this an excellent movie which really should have been given wider publicity, 10/10I loved it and I'd recommend it...Brilliant",Equilibrium

Backdrop was Matrixesque, but it really had nothing else to do with that film.Main problem from the outset was that the actors were on a hiding to nothing trying to act in an apparently emotionless world, which contained families living together and friendly with each other, dry wit, half smiles and a lot of violence.  I kept thinking, well why did he smile there and why did they burn than painting, in fact why did this pointless Grammaton cleric thing get off the ground without someone passionately believing it was the right way to go...Very surprised that the film got funding for such a flawed vision - sounds like a pet project...instead of a questioning and political film, this really was more of a feel-good ""what we have now is great"" film.  Frankly, because the vision of the film is so unlikely, it ended up being an unhelpful film, in that it didn't even suggest anything other than the most banal solutions to current world issues.Even the puppy bit was flawed in that I felt that in order for Prozium II to have the effects on society it was supposed to have, the drug would need to have long-term and permanent effects on the brain.  He forgets to take one dose and suddenly he's crying at the sunrise breaking over the city and sobbing over a lickle puppy.

I've seen the Matrix 2 trailer, and the over-use of ""effects"" just bored me to death. Equilibrium is no doubt eons better than the Matrix, or any other movie in it's league. Heck, I even felt like I'd rather watch Equilibrium again even after seeing X-Men 2. I liked X-Men 2, but Equilibrium just has a whole new appeal. I've seen it more than 10 times and it never grows old on me.
Why do I say so? Less computer effects and more character depth! Movies nowadays depend too much on effects. It gets corny. ESPECIALLY with all that ""floating"" about effects in MATRIX... it gets boring. I'm like ""So where's the talent in all this?""Now, EQUILIBRIUM lessened that ""effects"" thing and brought out more of ""TALENT"". Not only does the whole story have a much more touching and deeper plot... (Only unimaginative people would compare it endlessly with other movies...) But hey! Christian Bale's acting beats Keanu Reeves anyday! He was just perfect for the role! Sorry, but to me, the characters are EVERYTHING.Hey, and who says not showing emotion at all is easy??? Get real! It's difficult to pull of John Preston the way Christian Bale did! It takes attitude & real talent. It's rare to find such actors nowadays...I'm not surprised that this classic one-of-a-kind movie isn't so well-received. It's not pro-masses. ITS NOT A SELL-OUT. You'll only enjoy it if you watch this movie as a human being, not as a critic.",Equilibrium
918,pliskunk-1,Matrix clone it's not...,10,1 June 2003,"When I saw this film its story, acting and style impressed me. I heard a lot of people slating it for being a half-hearted Matrix clone. I can't disagree more to that statement. The story is set around the banning of emotion; this ended all war and violence. The enemies of the state were people who stop taking the emotion-inhibiting drug and begin to feel again. The action scenes were fantastic. The idea of mixing firearms and martial arts I felt was one of the more impressive points to the film. Christian Bale is one of Britans most underrated actors. His change from emotion free champion of the state to public enemy is believable, and at times moving. Definitely on my must buy list.",Equilibrium

It wasn't made well in movie form, from an acting perspective everyone got angry... so thats feeling, too bad. Maybe gets a 5 as a movie if you have read 1984 and liked it. The movie didn't credit the book 1984 at all and they were so similar.I felt as though emotions were controlled by Christian Bale's character too quickly after gaining emotion. This would not be possible for anyone who is just learning emotion. I do feel like It is nearly impossible to present a film with such ideals though.Sorry, I was disappointed.",Equilibrium

I saw a short discription in a newspaper, and since I had nothing better to do, I went to it. I figured I could take a chance.I wish more people would have.Equilibrium is a great movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. Christian Bale gave an absoloutly wonderful performance as John Preston, a Grammaton Cleric who stops the thing he makes sure everone else does: injecting himself with a drug called Prozium that dulls your emotions.Many people make statements that it's just a Matrix ripoff.

The same feeling I got twenty years ago when watching ""Blade Runner"" unfolding. That was a movie which at the time flopped at the box office and was mauled by the critics, and is now recognized as one of the best of all time.Equilibrium has been fairly compared with ""The Matrix"", however it exceeds it by having a more believable premise and two of modern time's finest actors, Bale and Watson.

Apparently none of these reviewers have seen El Mariachi or Desperado because those are the gunfights that came to mind during this film.  It has a bleak look at the future and it's a decent movie.

923,Debbieuk,Coolest movie ever.,7,28 July 2003,"Great actors, fantastic fight scenes, interesting (though unoriginal plot line.) What I loved most about this movie was the lack of sensationalism. Yes some of the fight scenes were massive, perhaps for the sake of it but they were fantastically filmed and so much fun to watch. There was no hot babe whose function's simply to seduce the leading man, there were no massive special effects that did not serve the story, there were no terrible Hollywood actors in it just to add market value. Hence my comments are pretty much all positive- I could nitpick but it's too good a film for that.The one thing I will say and I'll give the director the benefit of the doubt about this- I would have liked to have seen Emily Watson's character developed further. Perhaps my view is slightly biased because I know she's such a fantastic actress and this role didn't really appear to challenge her- she felt yet she was quite empty. Anyway Equilibrium gets a big thumbs up from this London Lass!",Equilibrium

If you havent already seen, when a revolutionary movie comes out that changes the way people look at special effects, that movie breaks a mold which a lot of people try to follow.  Blade Runner, Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, all of these films became milestones in cinematic special effects.  It is absolutely ridiculous to smash this movie for its ""matrix-style"" fight scenes and its imitation of 1984.  the fight scenes may have been similar to the matrix, but it was only that way because directors of now are trying to bend the style of fight scene originally created by the matrix.  and another thing, if you are watching this movie for the action, turn it off and return it to where you either rented or bought it, because you obviously do not need to see this movie.  yes, the action is pretty cool, with a stunning opening sequence, but the movie uses the action as a means to further the story and not to draw in moviegoers.  the director had an interesting take on the worlds proposed by bradbury and orwell, and i applaud him for his excellent work on this movie.  10/10",Equilibrium

Not because they use million dollar CG effects, but because they are brilliantly directed and oozing with style.There are a few wires involved, there is a touch of CGI, but what the action really relies on is the incredible sense of motion, choreography, and filming.

Christian Bale has proved that he can be a magnificent actor (""The Machinist"" is a brilliant display of his acting skills), but in this, he just seems like a cardboard prop. It's just another conveyor belt, 1984 inspired piece of crap with the cliché dose of a paranoia induced society and the classic ""hold the man down"" dictator. These elements CAN be implemented in an interesting and clever way, but the creators instead opted for some cheap, stereotypical characters with as much depth as Barney the Dinosaur. And ""Gun-Kata""?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Definitely the most pompous and flamboyant style of fighting ever invented, it just looks retarded and seems to simply have been put in for its showmanship quality.

Did anyone see Kurt Thomas is Gymkata? That movie featured  pommel-horse based karate. Gun-kata is its intellectual successor. Apparently,  mastering the art requires little more than striking a karate pose while aiming a gun. If  you're really good, you can look in a different direction than you're shooting. But the real weight of the movie lies in its powerful social commentary. I mean, this is a  society that DOESN'T LET YOU FEEEEELL!!! Oh the humanity! The world has been in sore  need the type of filmmaker with the courage to tackle such an important issue. I had  been tempted to embrace a ""feelings-are-bad"" political platform. But this movie has  shown me the error of my ways. After seeing Equilibrium, it's a wonder to me that the Vulcan society ever made it as far as it did. I mean, don't we all need feelings?

And you will NOT be disapointed..
this review will contain SPOILERS..I've seen alot of comments here.. And so many of these have totally misunderstood the point of the movie.. This is not a poor attempt to make a hollywood sci-fi flick.. This is more a journey of discovery, i think many people have the wrong way of watching this movie.. what i find most effective (I've watched it several times) is trying to put yourself wholly in 'John Preston's' shoes.. imagine that you had no comprehension of what feeling is.. What do you think your reaction would be the first time you really FELT your heart beat? The scenes that so many people consider predictable and boring.. are there because he reacts as any human would have in his situation.. The one that seems the most left out in the comments is the one where he hears music for the very first time.. Many of these scenes had immense impacts on me (perhaps im a softie.. but i could totally 'feel' christian bale's pain as he made that connection with the puppy).Something else that is totally misunderstood is WHY he ""falls in love"" with the sense offending woman he encounters.. it's attraction.. he doesn't feel love.. he feels attraction, and it is totally new and unexplainable for him, so he acts instinctively.. while some people just can't seem to understand this, I know that many people who havent even heard of this movie will understand it the way I have..Another thing i keep seeing is people putting down the Gun-kata, but that is just a cool way to add an action element if you ask me, it doesnt have to be all to plausible to have the desired effect.. Some of the scenes are for me totally mind-boggling, and the choreography is extreme in some cases (although in the scene after he has taken the test, and moved to the next room, the choreography isn't quite up to par.. it doesnt matter, this movie isnt about the effects.. it's about a great story of a man feeling for the first time..) Sure it's all quite clichè.. but if you look at most movies today, none of them are *new* and this is probably the best told story, with the most emotional stress i've seen..Another thing people consider a plot hole, is the gun switch.. but if you notice what Mr. Dupont says in the end, they pretty much expected him to do that, he wasn't fooling anyone.. this only came apparent to Preston in the very end of the film tho.. where he seems to totally blank out (shown on the 'polygraph' or something like that) and that's the first time he was in control of what was happening.. he has been a pawn for ""father"" or Mr. Dupont all this time, and he has had to much stress around him to realize it.. I actually feel sorry for those people who have misunderstood this film so badly.. It is truly a great journey through heavy emotional stress, it might not seem new, but the mix is interesting, and somewhat critical to todays society, where people's senses are more and more dulled down (not in this grand a scale but still) by the way our 'leaders' want it to be..",Equilibrium

Emotions have been found to be the cause of war and violence and are now illegal! But alas, emotion is natural. The movie depicts the triumph of emotion in the fascist world obsessed with order and conformity. GREAT MOVIE! If the fighting seems silly, it is because the clerics are -trained to be perfect-. Every moment of this movie is perfectly done! The main character is our example of how emotion crept in and slowly took over the fascist mind set.

The next generation has been enslaved by a totalitarian society and forced to take a drug which suppresses their emotions in a bid to prevent wars in the future by eliminating anger.Unfortunately, this turns out to be a soulless reworking of the Matrix genre. Christian Bale has obviously been chosen because he looks and sounds like Keanu Reeves, and whilst the fight scenes are somewhat impressive the first time round, they do not stand up to a second viewing. What little chance the film had of some decent acting with Sean Bean is killed off in about the first fifteen minutes, and the whole thing comes off as very one-dimensional.

945,bakstar,Loved AND loathed Equilibrium...,8,6 August 2011,"Equilibrium presents an interesting (yet not entirely original)concept of an Autocratically dictated society, void of any true human emotion or sentiment, and combines it with some very uniquely choreographed action scenes. Think of a hybrid of The Matrix and V for Vendetta, both personal favorite's of mine.The truth is that I was torn between cringing at certain aspects of the film, while wholly enjoying others. Certain scenes, particularly the action one's, seem somewhat overdone, all the while still managing to pull-off some very cool and creative sequences. I'm still not 100% sure whether I loved or loathed the idea of the 'Gun-Kata', though it definitely could have been done better, I still enjoyed the aspect of a completely new style of firearm combat.Christian Bale is perfectly suited the role of John Preston, one of several specially trained police, put in place specifically to enforce the rules of this soulless society, known as 'Clerics'. Clerics can be summarized as a futuristic Green Beret, only with the characteristics of a Samurai Warrior, sporting a sidearm instead of a Katana. As a Cleric, Bale's character represents the unquestioned obedience expected from all people's, making him one of the least likely to revolt against the system, which of course he eventually does. Preston's self-imposed rebel status sends him on an inevitable collision course with those who control this system, and he does so in an elaborately violent fashion.An interesting and enjoyable film, that I couldn't help feeling would have been better off with a bigger budget, Equilibrium is sure not to disappoint those who know what to expect.",Equilibrium
946,Rotiki,This Movie SUCKED!,1,3 December 2006,"The idea for this movie had so many interesting, thought-provoking ideas and yet the plot seems to just be there as an excuse for them to create 2 hours of badly-choreographed, unrealistic fight scenes. I think I have this straight. The producers attempted to create a world in which humans cannot feel. Maybe they should have had the actors be more like robots - there were way too many feelings being shown by the people who were taking the emotion-inhibiting drug to ever believe that they weren't able to feel. For example, Taye Diggs' character obviously enjoyed overthrowing Christian Bales' character - he smiled like three of four times throughout the movie! And what is with Emily Watson's character? She's apprehended by the clerics but even when she is imprisoned, she's still wearing makeup and colorful clothing. You wanna talk about a movie that has plot errors? This one wrote the book about it! Not convincing even for one second! Plus, they said that this movie is in the near future? The set looked far more in the future than that. It takes a really long time to change the way a city looks. The city portrayed in this film was cold and unfeeling (which is good to set the mood for the film but completely unrealistic for a city ""in the near future""). But the city looked far too cold (not scientifically advanced, just cold and lacking stimuli) like as if they have been trying to eliminate emotion for more like 20-30 years which in my opinion is not ""the near future"". Plus, let's think about human emotion. Honestly, if the people in the film really lacked emotion, the human race would have to have found ways to harvest people to create new life since there would be no love, passion, sexual desire, etc. Therefore there's no desire to reproduce, or connect to anyone ever! Really, they should have thought up some way to compensate for those obvious things when writing the screenplay. People die without emotional connection.

Right, we kill them.This is the most important point which makes me hate this movie. Even though it probably was Wimmer's choice to portrait it like that, to show us how f*cked up the world (and its leaders) can be.However, the idea of the future being this horrible place in which people cannot choose for themselves isn't really a new idea. Also, the fighting scenes were lame as well, I swear, at some point it looked like the two were sword fighting with guns.. At other points, all you could see were bullets (which looked more like a level of a video game than a movie). It also looked like Wimmer wanted to imitate the Matrix and did not succeed.

Though I will certainly not defend those regimes, I just want to make the point that the world is certainly more complicated than the one Equilibrium tries to imitate. Unfortunately, according to the other reviewers, this cheap demagogic picture has paid off. Instead of the viewer sharing the enlightenment with Christian Bale (of the true virtues of life), the viewer is really the one being blinded.",Equilibrium
954,Jolyne,Bravo!,10,16 December 2003,"Equilibrium is one of the most wonderful movie I ever saw.

We need to feel, to be free, if we want to be alive not only being a machine. (A clock ticking).",Equilibrium
955,subtribal,Lousy attempt to make something like Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 (spoilers),3,21 December 2003,"OK, this film had some nice ideas and great fight scenes and some great photography, but the story was so poor it detracted from the movie.Cinematography, sequences and visuals are ""borrowed"" entirely too often to be a tribute. Matrix 1, Gattaca, The Wall, Minority Report, Brazil, Metropolis, Bladerunner, 12 Monkeys, etc. etc. etc.From the outset, it was blindingly obvious what was going to happen, including the many plot revelations. Cleric fights emotion, cleric meets beautiful girl. Cleric embraces emotions. Cleric embraces girl. Cleric embraces puppy. Cleric weeps as puppy gets shot and vows to avenge puppy (girl?) by killing the insane dictator that masterminds a ruthless controlled society that can't seem to keep people from listening to Beach Boys albums and collecting mood crystals, even though they can track individual items of equipment and create souless apartments that shouldn't have cunning hiding places where no-one ever looks.It passes as a mindless action film, but for me, lacks depth that others seem to enthuse about (did they watch the same movie?). The society is remarkably tolerant for a Big Brother state, and the makers should have read a book or two about the East German Stasi, rather than assuming that neat leather coats and zeppelins are all it takes to cow a population. Minority Report did a far better portrayal of a believable police state and its consequences.I'd also recommend films like Soylent Green and Clockwork Orange as doing a far better job at depicting Orwellian states and human spirit in the face of oppression. Even Wizard of Oz for that matter.I gave it a three, because it's a poorly written derivative of other people's work.",Equilibrium
956,srrvant1,Essentials of Feeling,7,1 December 2011,"Equilibrium has all the action of the Matrix, with a mind bending and thought provoking twist. This movie is most definitely not just another Matrix knock off. Christian Bale did a fantastic job portraying a character in a world where feeling is illegal. In the film feeling is equated with rage, anger and the cause of war, because of this anything that may cause feeling or anyone who has feeling must be eliminated or take a pill that stops them from feeling. Bale stops taking the pill after his partner had to be killed after succumbing to a feeling. According to the law, Bale had to kill him, which he did. Right before Bale shot his partner, he was told that ""everything that makes us what we are is gone."" Equilibrium brings out the question of what are true feelings for and what is truly worth living or dying for. Everyone strives to have a purpose for living and having something they care so much about that they are willing to die for. This movie forces the viewer to think of what life's true purpose is and why we have feelings. It is most definitely a movie worth checking out.",Equilibrium

Isn't it war every day against the ""feelers""? Yeah, you could say that it was just a pretext invented by the government to eliminate opposition, but somehow it doesn't add up on the movie's universe.Oh by the way.

It is one of a very few movies that I can watch over and over again , and never get enough of it. The movie addresses us as humans at the very core of our humanity. It simply introduces us to the very meaning of our human souls from entirely a new angle , that you feel like you are getting introduced to your human self all over again but from a different perspective you have never thought of before. This movie recreates the balance between our brain and heart that defines our daily emotions and the struggles within our souls.

The plot is set in the 21' century and revolves around a totalitarian system which have strict rules against any forms of emotions with a shoot on sight law. Christian bale plays the role of a cleric/lawman who enforce these simple set of rules, and is helped by a drug created to suppress emotions. Put simply, he brings life to the character and shows a massive spectrum of feelings and intensity. After he accidentally destroys one of the vials of the drug, he starts to open up to his emotions and learns that he cannot live without these new and strange feelings and starts to question this way of life.Both the technical aspects and the acting is very enjoyable. Laced with a martial arts form aka gun-Kata, which blows your mind and leaves you wanting more. I highly recommend this movie to other martial arts / scifi fans.",Equilibrium
965,imdb-296-307618,Neither Nineteen Eighty-Four nor The Matrix,5,20 February 2012,"Described as a cross between George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Matrix, Equilibrium has neither the intelligence of the former nor the special effects budget of the latter. The opening shows what to expect: a monologue details the origins of the society, leaving nothing for the viewer to infer, while intertitles punctuate generic images of modern warfare and photographs of Stalin, Hitler, and, bizarrely, Saddam Hussein.Comparisons to The Matrix are obvious, not least due to the inclusion of a low-budget remake of the famous lobby scene, but while The Matrix has a plausible explanation for its characters' fighting prowess – namely, the ability to perceive and influence the matrix itself – Equilibrium relies on an unconvincing theory: the Gun Kata. As expounded upon in a voice-over, clerics have determined, through the analysis of thousands of recorded gun battles, the 'statistically predictable' distribution of opponents and trajectories of return fire; this allows a cleric to engage a large number of gun-wielding opponents and emerge not only victorious but also entirely unscathed.All dystopian films are likened to Nineteen Eight-Four, if only due to its status as the most well-known dystopian work. Equilibrium's similarities are limited, the most obvious being the parallels between Equilibrium's Father and 1984's Big Brother. A scene with a grey-clothed audience obediently watching Father's speech on a large screen owes more to Apple's famous 1984 television advertisement than to Orwell's novel itself. Whereas Orwell's Party must lie to its citizens, Father's broadcasts talk openly of the cost of losing the dizzying highs, and accepting as fair sacrifice the loss of joy, love, and elation.Instead, Equilibrium is more influenced by two earlier dystopian novels: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We. Equilibrium's prozium is a mirror image of Huxley's soma: both societies depend on their respective drug, but while soma satisfies emotional needs prozium eliminates them. Both societies share an atheistic philosophy couched in religions terminology: Citizens of Huxley's World State refer to our Ford in place our Lord, and the Arch-Community Songster of Canterbury parallels our archbishop, while Equilibrium's Libria is controlled by the Tetragrammaton Council, who enforce their rule through the monastery-trained clerics.While less well-known than either Nineteen Eighty-Four or Brave New World, We was one of the founding novels of the dystopian genre, and it is in Zamyatin's novel that the greatest similarities to Equilibrium are found. Zamyatin's One State, like Equilibrium's Libria, emerged after a global nuclear war, but is a mere city-state surrounded by untamed land where revolt is brewing. Zamyatin's Benefactor and Equilibrium's Father are paternal figures (unlike Orwell's sinister Big Brother), and both societies use the technological removal of an aspect of their citizen's humanity to avoid the need for psychological coercion: Equilibrium's prozium removes emotions, while Zamyatin's Great Operation removes creativity.Where Equilibrium falls short is in its failure to follow through the consequences of prozium. For a society facing external threats and dependent on its citizens' continual medication, it is woefully lacking in security. There is no formal monitoring of prozium usage – citizens are expected to take prozium when the siren sounds, but can go years without doing so provided they do not behave emotionally in public. Clerics are able to take banned content (rated EC-10 in reference to the American film rating system) from crime scenes and are able to leave the city at any time by telling border guards that they are on unspecified (and unverified) enforcement duty. Various supposedly unemotional characters show emotion: Brandt in particular talks about being pleased with his new placement and being glad about the murders in the Nether, and smiles on several occasions. Finally, Equilibrium breaks a key rule of the genre in having a happy ending.Equilibrium could have been an interesting contribution to the dystopian genre, but lacks the intelligence and depth to be anything more than a mildly entertaining action movie.",Equilibrium

The touch with Taye Diggs in the fight scene at the end of the movie is absolutely sickening despite being, in some way, predictable.

It's a fun movie that kept me watching because of it. People who try to compare this to 'The Matrix' need to take a step back and judge it for its own. I've watched Equilibrium almost 10 times now and will continue to do so. Instead of trying to find flaws and comparisons to other sci-fi flicks, just sit back and enjoy. Not every science fiction movie is trying to copy 'The Matrix'. When I heard that this movie is starting to get its own following, I was thrilled.

The special effects are certainly ""special,"" though not in the sense one pays money to a video store or cinema to see (in any gunfight involving three or more people, smoke bombs hidden in the actor's clothing are used to simulate the ""dust poof"" that supposedly occurs when someone is shot, the sheer volume of which often obscures the actors).If you like to rent movies that are so appallingly bad they aren't even funny, but get your blood boiling with rage, this is for you.

I sat through the Matrix movies and thought yeah they are kewl, but that was mostly because of the computer effects. Somewhere after the first Matrix they lost the feel of the whole thing. I watched Equilibrium, thinking I've never heard of this movie, I just know it's going to be low-budget and not interesting at all. To be honest I thought the first scene was lame because of the way the computer makes Christians arms move like a toy puppet or something, but then the story starts and locks you in your seat. The action scenes were flawless, Christian Bale had fluid motion and it looked natural, like he had really been a gun-kata for years (and they weren't on strings). The clothing was also very well chosen, Matrix used great coats and this uses dress uniforms you could say. The clothing adds to the sense that the public has no feeling on the matters of colors or difference and I think that gives the movie an added sense of forbearance. To be honest I loved this movie because it wasn't so long and drawn out until you wanted to scream and the whole point of the movie was right there in your face the whole time, not hiding in the background confusing you as you watched. And sorry girls but I really don't have love for Keanu Reeves (Just never fit for matrix) Equilibrium was right on the mark with everything, but of course critics will be critics and tell you it isn't good when the general public will say otherwise. This is a movie guys can see with their girlfriend and not worry about her thinking it's just a shoot'em up bang bang story, because it does have a story with morals and just a touch of romance twisted in.

The discovery of emotion.The way emotions penetrate him slowly throughout the whole movie, combined with absolutely insanely cool action scenes that weren't overdone, was well done. 2 other great scenes: When he kicked the asses of that police squad.

The action scenes were well choreographed, quick, intense, and well done. But there was something missing...something I cannot put my finger on. It may have been the lack of dialogue, but this is very usual for Christian Bale movies. It might have been the lack of visual effects, but I wasn't expecting big bangs, mostly hand-to-hand combat, on which this movie aptly applied itself. The one thing I wish I had seen more in this movie would have been to see the way the world worked outside of law enforcement in this post world war horror. I would have been interested to see how, not why, the world changed as it did. Changed from a world based on individuality to one completely obsessed with exposing and eradicating it.

The first one seems very cool but very silly if you ask me, the poses he makes are just comical but it gets very cool as the movie progresses and the ""gunkata"" [this martial art with guns] is just brilliant.But taking all the beautiful action away, this movie is really a thinker at heart.

I was fascinated by the look and premise but didn't have time to watch just then. After finding out the next time it would play, I made a date with the television and watched it through. When it ended I bought the DVD online. That was two months ago and I have watched (or listened) to it at least 25 times since. My husband thinks I am crazy. While that may be debatable, I have found the following to be true.One: The movie does not come even close to being anything like the Matrix. I was a Matrix (original movie, not the other two) fan. No more. The Matrix is now to me empty, void. The Matrix story left me cold. As it ended I said, ""big whoop"" and have never had a desire to see any of them again. There were NO emotional truths in any of the movies; they were technically sound. Two: Equilibrium, on the other hand, is a better movie than I think even the writer knows. Yes, there are some editing flaws, but I don't care. A small cost I gladly pay.Equilibrium. Wow. The emotional content is astounding. Hard actions taken in good faith that these are for the greater good, relationships based on air, wrong prices paid and regretted, inner conflict when an accepted and cherished way of life is being challenged, the acceptance of new realities and knowledge he was the deliver of horrible hurt. These are the things that have driven mankind for thousands of years in their own homes, communities, and nations. These things have not changed. This is not a ""political statement"" movie designed to change the world, as some limited thinkers have opined. Preston doesn't fall in love with Mary. It is only through her he connects to his slaughtered wife and mother of his children and realizes what he lost. Power seekers will always want the pretty things, the easy life, while forcing ugly, hard lives on those they rule. These are eternal truths that Mr. Wimmer has so simply and powerfully brought us.

At best, this is a B-movie wannabe that can't get past a second act. Nice ending too; kill the leader, we all live happily ever after!",Equilibrium

My approach, though, is of a different colour all together. I'm a guy, and since that's a fact, I care about the gizmos and gadgets used in a movie ;) . So, one thing and one thing alone got in my way of enjoying this movie to the fullest, and that is their personal means of transportation: cheaply (in my opinion) converted Caddys. Come on!!! They could've come up with more ingenious ideas than that!!! Anyhow, it looks to me, that they kinda didn't try hard enough :( ... All in all, I hope anyone watching it won't get hung up on that...

The originality to the story was great, a society so blind about themselves they're willing to take drugs to block the one thing that makes humans humans, emotion, because they feel that emotion causes everything bad you can think of.The whole fighting/gun art style called ""gun kata"" was just amazing. It was as if it could actually exist. Everyone in the film was emotionally disabled. So I would say the acting was superb, their was no need for emotion, haha. The feel of the film was great, it wasn't what a lot of sci-fi's go for, the whole technology, crowded, unorganized, lawless visuals people come up with. It is actually the total opposite. That's what I liked about the feel of the world in Equilibrium, a orderly, clean society, and a man that wants to break free from it.The action sequences were just amazing, making me want to get up and try and preform it.

Christian Bale gives a good performance and has changed a little since Empire of the Sun, he was suitable for the role as he is able to keep up an uninterested monotonous voice throughout.

It is mildly similar to the Matrix in cinematography, but other than that you shouldn't say it's for Matrix fans. It's definitely more for fans of George Orwell's 1984, ""Father"" can be substituted for ""Big Brother"". A lot of the elements are taken from that book, except Equilibrium ends with the destruction of the system, where 1984 ends with the realization that destroying, or even going against anything, is futile. Read that book, and then watch this movie. If after that you still feel it's like the Matrix then you are focusing far too much on the aesthetics. Yes, he dresses similarly to Neo, and some of the action scenes are reminiscent to the Matrix, but they are not the same. This is more realistic than the Matrix. They explain why he can take out twenty people without getting hurt by showing the training process for gunfights. This movie tries to express emotion and how important it really is, how hard it would be to live in a world without it and how it would feel to feel for the first time. Emily Watson does a wonderful job as the woman who makes him want to feel. Taye Diggs plays a great suspicious asshole.

I had had one look at the cover and i was already convinced that this was another of those cheap, brainless, terribly plot less action straight-to-DVD flicks and was very skeptical towards it. The only reason I agreed to watch it was Christian Bale, whom I always liked as an actor.The movie itself was truly fantastic, one of the best I had seen in a long time. It has got a clever, suspenseful and especially thought-provoking storyline, the actors did a terrific job. Bale, Bean, Fichtner were all top-notch. Apart from that, I also have to praise some unforgettable scenes. The sequence where John Preston tears down the paper off the wall and watches the sunrise hit me full blast.

That is not to say it's a bad movie, to the contrary it's entertaining and fairly well executed, but, many of the plot elements are so blatantly ripped off from other movies. It bears painfully obvious similarities to the following works: 1984, Brave New World, The Matrix, Dune, THX 1138, and other sci-fi and non sci-fi works that focus on some form of social oppression. It's not even a case where you can say ""well all movies are bound to have simliarities"". It goes well beyond that. Aside from that, what carries the movie is some of the imagery, some of the acting, and some of the dialogue. The main character does some seamless acting given the script. I'll even go so far as to say he carries the movie.This movie could have been better had it stayed true to the format and theme and the holes in the plot were patched up but it's obvious the movie broke down at many points just for the sake of fulfilling someone's desire to ride the Matrix fad. It seems to come across a bit piece-mail as a result.Still, it's worth watching, above most other action movies out there. An interesting watch.

The promo was interesting enough for us to hunt down a movie theater that was playing it (quite a ways away). I figured it was going to be awful considering the low publicity, but I couldn't have been more wrong. We were simply amazed. While stealing from many other movies (1984 and gattaca come to mind), I felt the personality of this movie was unique, and the fight scenes (gun Kata) were very matrix-esquire. I really think this movie would have done better had there been significant more publicity. The only cheesy thing IMO, was the white car looked as though the film ran out of budget.

Initially I registered here to add to the short biosketch provided on Bale's cover page, because it contains no mention of ""Equilibrim"" which is a huge oversight! Suffice to say, in agreement with another review here, it is a movie well worth a second viewing--even purchase in order to be able to share it more readily with friends.

1002,origin191,Disappointing...,6,12 August 2005,"I watched this movie after hearing my brother say that it was one of his favorite movies of all time. I usually agree with him on stuff like this, so I went in with high expectations. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed...The movie is set in a utopian society reminiscent of stuff like Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451 where human emotion is outlawed and any objects which invoke feeling are too be destroyed, and it follows the predictable tale of one of the Clerics, the people who enforce those laws, as he begins to feel and such. Now story was never meant to be the main draw of the movie, so I can forgive this.The real main draw is supposed to be the fight scenes, a mix of martial arts and gunplay. However, just as the emotionless society has sought to find the optimize their fighting style to find the single most efficient technique, so have the filmmakers optimized the fighting style to find the single coolest looking technique, namely the hero surrounded by a dozen or so guys and proceeding to kill all of them without breaking a sweat. Yes, it looked pretty cool the first time he did it, but this same scenario is played out at least 5 or 6 times with hardly any variation.The really only good parts in the film are a couple of emotional moments where the Cleric is caught in a tough situation that his newfound emotions have gotten him into or the final climax fight, which is the only truly original fight. Instead of the normal situation, we only have two guys each with one pistol. I can honestly say I've never seen a fight scene like that.Other than that, its just a mediocre compilation of clichés from The Matrix, Brave New World, 1984, etc.",Equilibrium
1003,gwade10,More than a sum of it's parts...,6,7 June 2007,"Equilibrium got a lot of bad press on it's release. Critically bashed for being a Matrix rip-off with nothing going for it, it's been pushed into the background ever since, even though Christian Bale has since become a much sought after A-lister.The thing is, although it certainly owes a debt to The Matrix, it isn't a copycat. The Cleric gun battles are unique and impressive, and slow-mo moments are actually very rare. I don't recall seeing a single 'bullet-time' moment in the entire film.The atmosphere of the futuristic '1984'esque society is captured well, and the idea of a population which lacks emotion is certainly intriguing (even if certain 'emotionless' characters seem to emote a bit too much). Luckily though, the film does a sound job of setting up this backdrop, lending the events and actions some much needed believability.The script does cause problems, with lines so out of place that even the talents of Bale can't save it at times, but overall the performances are solid, with particular credit going to Emily Watson, showing how to make good use of limited screen time.So yes, the film has it's plot holes, the script isn't perfect, and the finale is a touch underwhelming, but Equilibrium manages to tie all this together into an enjoyable film.

I really enjoyed this movie's representation of the book; it kept the important theme in ""1984"", but gave it the twists necessary to become a great film. The final battle between the character John Preston and the rest of the anti-feeling police was a classic that measures up to even ""The Matrix"".

Christian Bales character is very similar to Keanu Reeves', same outfit and cool demeanour. However, whereas Reeves spends the entire Matrix series without a flicker of emotion, Bale manages to convey the deepest of feelings with the barest movement of his eyes. His acting is, once again, amazing.The plot itself, is gripping. It's the sort of thing that will stay in your mind for the rest of your life. It has many similarities with the film and book 1984, the dystopic utopia as it were. A perfect world, built so very imperfectly.The aspect of the film that I most enjoyed was the gun katas, the fight scenes were like poetry in motion. I stared at the screen in envied awe at the beauty and skill of their every movement. (Sad I know...but you will too!)

1008,keithezard,Unoriginal: Maybe. Generic: Possibly. Entertaining: Definitely!,9,12 March 2005,"Just as you should never judge a book by its cover you should never judge a movie by its trailer. Equilibrium sets itself up to be uninspired, eye-candy whose purpose is first and foremost to put bottoms on seats and entertain on the most superficial level. It certainly achieves that and not to be scoffed at either. Even the most distinguished film critics amongst us like to see wanton violence with the right mix of poetic justice and special effects if we are really honest. But what I can't abide are movies that are conceptually flabby. Equilibrium promises to be just such a movie asking deep questions and giving superficial trite answers that wouldn't satisfy the intellectual curiosity of a three year old. Thankfully it fails in its task and actually ends up being quite moving. Drawing heavily on 'Brave New World' it has a subtlety that sets it apart from its contemporaries. It can either be interpreted as a comment on state control in the style of 'Nineteen Eighty Four' or as I prefer to think of it as a comment on our Western societies: without real emotion. This might all seem a little unoriginal but I might point out at the risk of sounding unpatriotic that while much is made of anti-communism in Hollywood the Brave New World theme has rarely if ever been touched on - lets not forget that the T stands for the model T Ford.It achieves all this, however, whilst not being too preachy or troubling the minds of those who prefer to remain ignorant - a simple story with a happy ending. And as I sometimes fall into that camp myself I know to appreciate that. Equilibrium therefore is a film that can be understood on at least two levels: violence after a fashion that puts the Matrix to shame and a conceptual story that makes you tingle. It took me three years to finally see this film and I love it. Don't make the same mistake.",Equilibrium

In many ways it outdoes the battle scenes from the Matrix by adding Kill Bill into the equation, it combines 1984, Brave new world and THX into one and what I consider the most artistic part of it all is that in spite of a lot of killing you see only ONE drop of blood dripping from a sword and then some bloodied clothing during the end bringing us back to the ""good old times"" when killings were only performed in the street like in the old westerns or by silhouettes as in the old gangster movies. In todays trend where nothing is left to the imagination this strikes you and awakens you.

The cinematography, the superb casting and the excellent locations (much of the film was made in tastefully bland East Berlin) were ideal for the story that Mr Wimmer was trying convey.Secondly the concept of the Gun Kata (martial arts with guns) was what truly blew me away. Christian Bale was fantastic. Never before have i seen someone embody a character like he has. A nice surprise was the appearance of Sean Bean, however so brief.Equalibrium is set in a post apocalyptic world where the powers that be decree that human emotion is the true enemy of man. The masses dose up on a drug called Prozium which numbs people of anger, jealousy and hatred but also of love, joy and compassion. Bale plays John Preston, a senior Cleric lethally trained in the Gun Kata, whose job is to ""safe guard the continuity of our great society"" ie. exterminate anyone who is off their dose or is found to be committing other ""sence offenses"" The story really starts when one of the most highly trained and lethal Clerics misses his dose.Although the concept of Equalibriums totalitarian society is not entirely original this film will impress you. Extremely well made on a low budget, one wonders what could have been if it were made for wider release or if a few more dollars were thrown at it. Enjoy",Equilibrium
1017,7words,Surpasses The Matrix in Many ways,9,23 June 2005,"I think the people who call this movie a ""matrix ripoff"" are more fan-boys of the matrix trilogy then movie fans in general. I came into this film with no expectations and was surprised by how much i enjoyed it. I think the Gun Kata scenes surpass a large amount of the battle scenes from the matrix and i might add that this movie had a FAR more meager budget to work with. I do not think this movie received the kind of pr/advertising it should have and it ends up as a cult classic. This is a little gem of a action film and anyone who enjoys the subject matter(IE: 1984 big brother conspiracy etc) will come away with a positive experience.",Equilibrium
1018,mdcancel,Worthy of watching over and over.,9,1 December 2014,"Have you ever wondered what kind of world our world would be if it was devoid of emotion? Equilibrium seeks to answer that question. Set in a futuristic totalitarian government, emotion and anything that can make a person feel has become illegal and punishable by death. Human emotion has been deemed a disease and the reason why the world has gone to war over and over again.Under the mantle of this government, everyone takes an emotion-neutralizing drug called Prozium, including the Grammaton Clerics. The Grammaton Clerics are a select group of highly skilled and trained officers that execute sense offenders by firing squad or burning them alive. The Clerics identify all that is capable of creating emotion and destroy it. Art, music, and books are all burned and animals like dogs are shot dead. The Clerics are experts in the martial art fighting style of Gun Kata invented by the director, Kurt Wimmer.One of the Senior Grammaton Clerics is John Preston (Christian Bale), who while taking Prozium, witnesses his wife accused of feeling emotion and is burned. Disturbingly, Preston feels nothing and does not react in any way to his own wife being guilty of feeling. He even goes as far as shooting his own partner after recognizing that his partner, Partridge (Sean Bean) is feeling emotion.Prozium seems to consist of a very strong nerve-controlling agent. Yet its weakness is that it is regulated and must be taken by injection at intervals throughout the day. Preston, upon waking up one morning, accidentally shatters his morning interval and does not take one at all. Slowly, he begins to feel all that he had never experienced, and to keep himself from prosecution exercises amazing self-control long enough to keep himself from getting caught. His new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs) has secretly been assigned to identify Preston as a sense offender.Wimmer takes Preston through a journey of discovery. Initially being a law enforcer to eradicate sense offenders, he slowly turns Preston into a body of emotion. Eventually, he drives the character to find other sense offenders known as The Resistance lead by Jurgen (William Fichtner). The Resistance's purpose has been to overthrow the Tetragrammaton government as it is properly called. Preston becomes the perfect antihero when he chooses to help The Resistance. The use of color in this film directly corresponds to the balance of emotion. Director Kurt Wimmer uses black, grey and white, as neutral colors to accentuate the effects of Prozium on the society and the clothing. Other colors like red, green, and blue are used to highlight the sense offenders and the items that they safeguard and protect from destruction. Kurt Wimmer takes Christian Bale's performance from American Psycho and enhances it. He pushes Bale to an internal battle within himself to embody a character that goes from not feeling due to his job to becoming the savior of The Resistance. In the end, a powerful and moving piece that defines the meaning of emotion. It proves to humankind, that while emotion without control can be ultimately chaotic, at the same time, the feeling of emotion defines what it means to be human.",Equilibrium

1022,shortrnd42,This movie is bad,3,29 June 2005,"I find it hard to believe that this movie would score anything higher than a 4 on IMDb. While some movies can successfully follow the bleak future science-fiction stereotype while contributing some original and thought-inspiring content, this one certainly could not. The plot was stamped out of a science-fiction mold, right along with the dialogue. *Spoilers* My favorite holes in the plot and story include: How everyone, especially the clerics and father, seems to be angry when confronted despite supposedly abandoning emotion. While this could be justified in father's case, as we don't know whether or not he's taking the emotion-killing medication, the pleasure Taye Diggs clearly derives from turning in his fellow cleric makes no sense. Also, how father's guards manage to search the main character toward the end of the movie and miss the guns he has in his sleeves, where he has kept them for the entire film, is a mystery to me. *Spoilers over* In the end, the plot and story are unoriginal but remarkably poorer than their predecessors. The use of names like Father(obvious and cheesy reference to Big Brother), cleric, the hall of justice etc. just pointed to overblown metaphor, ironically set in an emotionless world. Also, the use of gun martial arts, while very entertaining, was ludicrous. Any martial artist will tell you that a kata is a set form from which some pieces may be borrowed in a fight, not a form to be recited when one jumps into a room hoping to kill all of its inhabitants. The positions into which the main character puts himself while firing his guns are even more ludicrous than the use of the Kata, as I cannot imagine any reason for which one would want to fire a gun aimed from behind their own neck. Finally, the fact that the makers of this film felt the need to include sword fighting was absolutely ludicrous. I will never understand why a person would learn katana arts in a future devoted to efficiency wherein there exist gun Kata, which clearly make killing untold numbers of people easy. So, for all of you said that this movie was better than the Matrix, let me say that it is a stretch for me to give it a 3. Anyone who tells you that this movie is good is probably one of those elitist pricks who just wants you to know that they know more about movies than you. In short, this movie was bad. Very bad.",Equilibrium
1023,dalebv,"Great cast, good movie",7,5 July 2005,"The story is a mish-mash of a lot of other sci-fi works--1984, Fahrenheit 451, the Matrix--not bad, but not worthy of the cast assembled for it. I'm amazed that this movie didn't get better reviews on the basis of the cast alone. Sean Bean, Emily Watson, and Taye Diggs all give fine performances, as does William Fichtner in a small role.Christian Bale, though, is terrific. You can't help thinking of Keanu Reeves in The Matrix--the long black robe, the slicked-back hair, and at times, Bale's voice is very similar to Reeves's. But the similarity ends there. The role calls for a great deal of restraint, and the character's emotional wakening is handled with great care.The action sequences aren't bad, either.The director's commentary has a few interesting tidbits, but it's mostly whining about how tight the budget was. Worth skipping.",Equilibrium
1024,hanshuber008,Every single frame a masterpiece,10,10 July 2005,"An excellent movie with a great story. Fascinating style. Everything is metallic cool and colorless, only the ""illegal content"", things that are burned and destroyed by some kind of anti-feeling swat police are warm and colorful: books, paintings, vinyl-covers etc. This gives a very intensive contrast. Camera, screen design and art direction is remarkable. It's one of those movies an amateur movie maker would watch several times to study the methods and tricks of the makers. Indeed, this movie is a compact fusion of art, action and philosophy. First I thought the shooting scenes are kind of unrealistic due to their choreographic style where the main actor looks like a dancer with guns. Later it turned out this is part of some kind of optimized aikido with pistols that makes a man the ultimate killer machine. I think Matrix Reloaded was more than only inspired by this movie since Neo had about the same clothes like the main actor in Equilibrium. Then again, Equilibrium was surely inspired by Matrix 1.",Equilibrium

My friends had however and they told me the movie looked great so one night when we were bored we went to see it, even though i didn't expect it to be any good. I couldn't have been more surprised. The society in equilibrium was set up nicely (even though it may have been a little far fetched). The creators of the movie made a good point. A society that represses feelings such as hate and love is society with no war or violence. However without such feelings as love and hate there is nothing really to live for. Cleric John Preston figured this out in the movie after he accidentally breaks one of his capsules and isn't able to take the drug that represses his feelings. Since he didn't take the drug he begins to feel these emotions which he has never felt before. I believe Christian Bale did a fantastic job acting as someone who was actually ""feeling"" things for the first time. His performance in the movie was what made the movie so great. Eventually he becomes the savior of the people who rebel against the society. This movie had unique and creative action scenes as well as an interesting plot. I give it a 9 out of 10",Equilibrium

I have seen how people have bashed this movie because of too much emotion from some characters in the movie (Diggs). However, as a human, it is impossible not to feel something. I think that most of the cast does a good job of being as emotionless as possible. Bale does a terrific job of going from cold hearted killer (basically it's what it is), to a sense feeling person. I hope I see Bale in more films. He did a good job in Batman Begins. Some of the fight scenes were just plain amazing... there is no other way to describe it. The city was drab looking, very good for what it was trying to accomplish. Now, I won't go into the obvious (F451, Matrix, etc.) but there are some flaws within the movie... however, in the end, these things can be looked over.

1046,Scrinnameless,Love the movie.,10,18 December 2005,"(Possible spoiler)I have to say, I was a bit weirded out by some of the hostile response to this movie. After watching it for myself when it came on Encore, I liked it enough to buy the DVD. The movie's concept is intelligent--even if it does draw from 1984 and similar works about dystopian societies. The idea of a society which outlaws emotion seems odd. I don't think it's a 'bleak vision of the future' but more like a fable about the dangers of such trends in our society. What's odd is that most, if not all, of the apparent faults in the plot or acting--like Diggs' character's habit of smiling--are explained elsewhere in the movie. For example, at one point Diggs's character says he needs to get his dosage of the drug Prozium adjusted, the implication being that his current dosage is not currently suited to him--which would explain his flashes of emotion throughout his performance. The only thing is that you have to watch the movie a few times to catch such explanations. Christian Bale really makes the movie. His character grows from an unfeeling enforcer who's practically a god of death, to someone who experiences almost the entire range of human emotion in a short time, with no prior experience of emotions, and no knowledge of how to cope with them. This is really the kicker for me. I can easily imagine what Bale's character, John Preston, goes through in the film--the poor man must feel like he's having the top of his head blown off. Incidentally, that ties into to my next point. The Gun Kata. It's over-the-top, but visually exciting. They try to explain this 'gun-fu' which enables its masters to fight like a natural disaster on two legs (an ability to predict the movements of multiple enemies gained after analyzing thousands of gun fights). The explanation is semi-logical, but the end result is nearly hyperbole. But it's cool, DANGIT! The sets do a good job of portraying a minimalist architecture, and the offices of the higher-ranking government officials hint at the hypocrisy that is eventually shown. I recommend this movie because of the thought-provoking plot, the good acting, and the action sequences.",Equilibrium
1047,sophiesox,My Favourite Film,10,7 February 2018,"Even though emotions are banned in the film, it certainly manages to evoke many feelings from the audience. The spectacular combination of acting, direction, camera work and extremely well choreographed action scenes allows the viewer to be completely absorbed into the complex story line.
Like many others who have watched the film, I do wish the Sean Bean had been more prominent in the film, but the fact that his story line - him not taking the dose, becoming affiliated with the underground, beginning to feel, and inevitably being killed by John Preston (Christian Bale) in a very clever foreshadowing of how John Preston's life will unravel in the near future (with the exception of him being killed).Christian Bale is, as always, fully immersed in his role as the complex Grammaton Cleric John Preston, who is completely dedicated to his job - enforcing the regime of the government upon everyone, and killing anyone who resists. Part of his job includes destroying any remains of a world with feelings. This includes music, literature and art, as is shown when John Preston orders the Mona Lisa to be burnt. As the film progresses, we see immense character development, as a result of a missed dose of the mind-altering drug Prozium by the Cleric. By the second half of the film the audience is left feeling sympathy for Bale's character, after multiple points of his life are revealed - The Cleric found out that his wife was a sense offender after authorities came to arrest her. As a government agent with no feelings, he did not stop them, and was even present when his own wife was marched off for 'termination'. 
As Preston's feeling begin to return, we see regret forming behind his eyes, and an undeniable hatred for the very system he was upholding beginning to implant itself in his mind. In the end, Cleric John Preston becomes and advocate for the underground resistance and, many brilliantly choreographed and acted fight scenes later, kills the fascist leader of Libria. 
Bale plays both sides of his character with equal brilliance, and fully captures the essence of the story-line through brilliant acting and emotional attachment to the character which has all been shown through another of his roles previous to this - Patrick Bateman in American Psycho - all before he made a name for himself in The Dark Knight Trilogy. The complexity of not just this role, but all roles Christian Bale has portrayed throughout his career clearly emphasises his abilities as a versatile actor.

1048,tanz_ez,"Excellent Movie, Better Than the Matrix?",10,30 December 2005,"I picked this film off the shelves of the video store when I was looking for some action packed no name films and was willing to try anything. Equilibrium has the quote of the front ""Forget the Matrix"". At the time The Matrix was one of my favorite movies because of all the action, gun play, etc. So I picked up the case and read it and was like ""Alright, just this once I can forget the Matrix."" I rented watched it and was amazed. This isn't a Matrix rip off with bullet time, this film is action packed. I really really enjoyed watching it and recommend anyone else to Check It Out. Apparently a lower budget movie that I had never heard of when it was in theaters but this is one of the movies that should be remembered. Only disappointment is that to buy this movie at HMV it costs $44.99. A little steep for a DVD.",Equilibrium
1049,kensilk,Awesome,10,17 January 2007,"This movie was very under-rated. It was a great movie. All I heard when it came out was it was a Matrix rip-off. That was stupid. They used bullet time photography a little, but the story line was totally different. You need only to sit back and enjoy. It was filled with decent actors, Christian Bale to be sure. It is a must see. I loved the action and moving plot. I was riveted from the moment it started to the moment it ended. Christian Bale does a superb job and gets better with every film. The special effects are beautiful and were a joy to behold. Yes, it was not as flashy as the Matrix, but i felt if they tried it would have taken away from the beauty of the movie.",Equilibrium
1050,senna-4,Almost 1984,6,27 April 2007,"Obviously, this film is just nothing more than a very good production of almost 1984. That is what you think right from the beginning. The actors are good, and so is the director of the film.However, this 'almost' kills large part of the efforts.1984 was to show that such a society may not even be given a chance to exist - once you get there, no-one will be able to change anything. But this film is different: suddenly, lone hero save the world. Oops. Didn't we knew it from the start?Last 20 minutes of the film kills biggest part of impression. Not to say it breaks some logic (son's behavior?)Still, the film is very enjoyable.",Equilibrium
1051,jade-90,Flawed gems are the most beautiful,9,22 January 2006,"Despite an element of inconsistency, and derivativeness, this film really touched me. The performances are absolutely first rate and outshine any perceived inadequacies this film may present. Bale and company have put a phenomenal amount of effort into their portrayals, and the action sequences almost defy belief in their aesthetic presentation and execution. To begin with I was a little disappointed with the film's rather blatant conceptual borrowings, but the longer I watched, the more I became entranced with the portrayals. The cast includes a lot of my favourite actors, all performing at the best of their ability, so perhaps there is a touch of representative bias involved in my assessment. Bravo, I want more!",Equilibrium
1052,kwanguru,Breathtaking action,7,8 May 2007,"This movie has breathtaking and original action sequences, but let's not exaggerate. The story and level of acting isn't much better than most action sci-fi movies out there. The film overall is not very believable, the pacing needed some work, and the plot was quite predictable.Yet, the low score given by critics is not deserving. The movie shows good attempt for cinematography, and really cool action sequences. I wish I could make a film like that.WTF 10 lines? Alright if you're a teenage boy, rent it with some friends. You'll like it.",Equilibrium
1053,kbrown45,provoked strong emotional catharsis,7,28 January 2006,"I'm a 53 year old, and the killing the puppy dogs scene made me very upset. (I love dogs.) I felt regret for all the selfish and rotten things I've done in my life. I can't tell anybody this, but I need to air this one out. The totalitarian government depicted in this film resembles in key ways the UNITED STATES aka the federal government. Both seek to completely control the population. Both will not hesitate to use deadly force to silence opponents. Both use the big lie technique. Both are thoroughly loathsome, and deserve to be swept into the dustbin of history. The film's strong libertarian message is refreshing, yet no doubt on the department of homeland securities watch list. I suspect any who rent this one will wind up in the persons of interest database and perhaps eventually imprisoned in a F.E.M.A. concentration camp.",Equilibrium
1054,writetoillia,Unrealistic plot but lots of action,2,30 March 2006,"Predictable and impossible all at the same time. It is like a Korean vengeance operatic, except with a white person as the protagonist. An as action flick it's highly stylized violence is appealing, as a science fiction flick the plot fails to be plausible, but of course that has never stopped Hollywood before. There is an unquestionable ability in the directing, and if you can put aside the nagging questions and the refutations of feasibility you might enjoy the movie. Overall, I would say if you are guy watch this flick with your buddies and a keg of beer (which will deaden the ability to reason, which will come in handy). If you are a gal the shirt-off scenes with Christian Bale make the movie more interesting than it actually is.",Equilibrium
1055,lamarquelee,surprisingly good,10,19 February 2006,i thought Equilibrium was surprisingly good. the story was very original as well as thought provoking. it was also a great sleeper hit for Christian bale. i was captivated from the opening scene. the movie was advertised as the next matrix. but i found no similarities between the two. with the exception of the guns mixed with martial arts. the story was just as original but extremely different. in was also impressed with Taye Diggs i had never seen him in an action role before and i believe he had a good performance. he was believable as an action star. i think its a movie that sci-fi and actions fans would really enjoy because i know i did.,Equilibrium
1056,bravojohnnyhooha,Equilibrium or Idiotic,1,4 March 2006,"Matrix lite and Kung Fu awful. With a bunch of left over actors from ""Braveheart, Patriot Games, and Batman Begins"", you would expect to be a little entertained and not drained. I don't drink or do drugs but this ""Cinema De Garbage "" made me want to get loaded fast to ease the pain of viewing.Was it to cash in on the ""Matrix""? to give Christian Bale a ""pre-Batman Begins"" work out? Who Knows but it was put to print and should be put to storage or better yet maybe every copy confiscated and buried with copies of ""Waterworld"".Yikes my eyes are bleeding.",Equilibrium
1057,Spastic_Individual,Blech,2,6 March 2006,"This film artfully takes all of best qualities of A Brave New World, 1984, and Farenheit 411 and discards them. What's left is an empty, ridiculous mess of eye candy that tries to coax the audience into believing that it is deep. The story is about Preston, a Cleric, who seeks out offenders of the law that prohibits emotion. The citizens are overlooked by a ""Big Brother"" figure and are constantly monitored in case they themselves become criminally emotional. As is typical in these sorts of movies, Preston eventually defects and turns against his government. The problem with this film is that it tries too hard to illicit feelings in the audience, jumping on every transparent cliché that it can. According to this film men love women and dogs; those are the only things for which killing or dying are acceptable. One instance I recall is Preston brutally slaughtering his compatriots in an attempt to save a puppy. Now that is a sensitive guy. So, if you enjoy empty promises for a large payoff in a pseudo-intellectual film, by all means rent Equillibrium and have at it. I will forever curse the guy that suggested watching it in my Philosophy of Film class.",Equilibrium
1058,alravic,"Good movie, didnt reach its full potenial.",8,5 February 2019,"Premise is great, action is good for the budget they had, actor power is where they lacked a lot, Bale is as always amazing, Sean Bean even in those few minutes had more impact then Diggs, which for me downgraded movie quite a lot, Diggs was terrible, Priests shouldnt feel anything and he was portraited character as some smug ambitious guy, that throws winks and smiles all the time, it just made me cringe, definitely if the character was better i would rate movie 9/10 considering budget, but it seemed they threw him in there just for movie not to be racist. Movie focuses more on what Christian Bales character feels, and i think it would had more impact if movie showed us how others felt or rather didnt feel, like few scenes in other characters eyes Diggses and that would make their fight a bit more meaningful. There are some quite good scenes that show us sacrifice, which i think was a very good theme added to to thr story. Owerall, good movie, we deserved better, movie crew deserved better, i also saw some",Equilibrium
