0,Prismark10,A passive look at a killer,5,4 May 2019,"I am not sure I learnt more about Ted Bundy after this movie. He certainly was a charming suave and clever man. That was a facade, inside him was a cruel callous killer.This movie starring Zac Efron as Bundy has a lot of tonal shifts. At times it is wacky as Bundy plans to escape from custody or argues against his own lawyer at trial. Then it could move to being chilling as the injuries of his murder victims are described. Then it moves to the footage of female fans who attend his trial each day.The story is based on the memoirs of Liz Kendall (Lily Collins.) She was the single mum who had a long term relationship with Bundy when he was a young law student. She also gave his name to the police when his behaviour aroused suspicion.The movie does not want to glorify Bundy and be respectful to his victims. However I felt that the character of Kendall was bland. The film really has to focus on Bundy. Efron gives a charming performance but the script never gives him a chance to show a dark, brutal side of Bundy apart from just a glimpse at the end.Ultimately in a scene stealing turn by John Malkovich as the trial judge, he describes Bundy as an intelligent man who could had used his talents to be a good lawyer; but it was not to be. The movie itself never gets a handle on how to tackle Bundy.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
1,nogodnomasters,I did not do these things,7,18 May 2019,"This is a biopic of the charismatic Ted Bundy (Zac Efron), family man. It also focuses on Elizabeth Kendall (Lily Collins) his girlfriend in Washington state. The production does show any gruesome killing but describes them. This allowed the filmmakers the money to hire John Malkovich to play the judge and Jim Parsons to be the prosecutor. The film has a long build-up until it becomes a courtroom drama.The acting was top notch. Zac Efron made Bundy look good, perhaps too good. Interesting for those who missed it.Guide: F-word, brief sex, male rear nudity. Lily Collins gives us the screens worst shower scene.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
2,blanche-2,excellent performance by Zac Efron,6,15 May 2019,"As many others have stated, this isn't a film about Ted Bundy on one of his murdering sprees. This is about Bundy himself and how he made his way in the world. Someone said at one point they found themselves rooting for him. I never did, but that's because at my age, it's hard to fool me after all the phonies I've met.Some people will be disappointed because we didn't get to see all the horror he visited on women, but it was a refreshing change of emphasis here.To see the young women salivating over him in the courtroom, cheering him on, was both shocking and expected. Real footage was used. I remember women doing that over the Menendez brothers. Part of it is the old takeoff on a Geraldo Show - ""Men in Prison and the Women Who Love Them,"" a phenomenon that happens time and time again. With Bundy, because he was particularly good-looking, it was an even stronger reaction.Zac Efron is a favorite of mine -he resembles my favorite classic film star, Tyrone Power, and I thought he captured the charm and personality of a whack job really well. Lily Collins is terrific as his girlfriend. Both of these actors are growing into exceptional performers.In the end ""Extremely Wicked"" makes a sad statement. Good looks. confidence, and charm will bring you a long way in this world. We've seen it too often. It's time to start looking at people's souls. The external is, after all, only that.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
3,ComedyFan2010,Great acting,7,6 May 2019,I was kind of disappointed in this movie. It did feel kind of boring. Like a reenactment of the trial that would be much more interesting to see as a documentary. That said the acting of Zac Effron was perfect. He did a great job portraying Ted Bundy as a manipulator who charmed so many people despite the horrible things he did. He made it so well that when watching it and knowing who Ted Bundy is and how it ends I was noticing myself wanting him to win that trial and be innocent. His performance is basically what made me give the movie an above average rating.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
4,Calicodreamin,"Anticlimactic, but interesting.",6,7 May 2019,"I would consider this to be a fairly historically accurate movie, with a lot of the lines taken directly from interviews and old recordings. Even some of the real news bits used in the film. It goes into more of the psychological toll the crimes take on the people around him. A very anticlimactic movie. Not what I was expecting.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
5,phd_travel,Star studded and fascinating,8,6 September 2019,Even if you think you have seen enough about Ted Bundy on TV this turned out to be fascinating from beginning to end. Lily Collins as his girlfriend acts well from beautiful and in love to depressed and devastated. Kaya acts well as Carole the insanely devoted next girlfriend who supports and believes in him totally. Zac Efron does a good job and gives a charismatic performance without glamorizing the monster. Big stars in supporting roles like Jim Parsons as a prosecutor and John Malkovich as a judge. At first things are shown from the POV of the love of his life. Later it's a fascinating look at his 2 escapes and trial.Worth a watch.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
6,trashgang,about Ted himself and not about the killings,7,7 May 2019,"Zac Afron for me is one of those posterguys my daughters grew up with, you guessed it, HSM. Once you are a teen idol it's hard to get job with seriues acting. I came across him years later with the funny Baywatch (2017) but even there he was the idol.So when told he was going to perform one of those notorious serial killers for me it was like, omg, I will give it a try but let's hope he can get away with it. And luckily he did. He's believable.The movie itself, as it is about a serial killer, doesn't show the killings or slaying of the victims. It's all about Ted himself and his ego. For horror geeks it can be a letdown due not one killing is shown but for those who has seen the shots made in court or the interviews with him will be happy. Some famous moves from him are redone by Zac. At the end of the movie you can see the footage of Ted that has been redone in this movie.So for teens it's ideal to meet the era of the serial killers with two famous names for them, Zac and Lily Collins. Angela Sarafyan is there too but not that much but again, all top notch here and well casted.If your world is serial killers, watch it, if you want more about Ted himself, watch it, if you want a horror movie, drop it as imple as that.

7,siderite,Well acted story of Ted Bundy,8,18 June 2021,"It's a pity that we all know who Ted Bundy was. The entire mystery of the film blows away. However, if you could, just for a moment, pretend this is about someone else, then the film becomes terrifying. That's because Zac Efron played the charming psychopath who admits no wrongdoing and is smart enough to fool just about everybody in a way that made you root for the guy. Normal people just can't internalize the situation. Surely if a man doesn't exhibit any hint of remorse for such heinous acts, he must be innocent.Ironically, the ending shows a mob waiting outside the execution center and cheering the death of another human being. Of course, they had already decided Bundy wasn't one, but what if the same thing went through his head when he was killing young girls?The film is not terribly entertaining. Other than the constant tension of the characters and the mental dissonance between proof and emotion, it is a slow descriptive movie. But it's important to know how these things work. It's not about good and evil, it's just about people missing a part of them that we have always associated with human beings.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
8,sddavis63,"""The Very Definition Of Heartless Evil""",7,19 July 2019,"The makers of this movie are to be commended for resisting the temptation of sensationalizing the story of mass rapist and murderer Ted Bundy. The title suggested sensationalism. Bundy's crimes were, indeed, ""extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile."" But aside from one very graphic photo of one of his victims, shown near the end of the movie, Bundy's crimes - while obviously referred to, aren't really the focus of the movie. In a lot of ways this is more of a psychological profile. To me, one of the ""extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile"" things about the entire story is that Bundy was, basically, quite a normal guy. He had a job, he had a girlfriend, he was apparently a good father-figure to his girfriend's young daughter. He later had a wife and a daughter of his own. His life was actually disturbingly normal - except for the fact that when he wasn't living his normal life he was kidnapping, raping and murdering young women. So the question throughout this movie is how such a monster could seem so normal? Why were the women in his life (the ones he didn't kill) so loyal to him and so unwilling to accept his guilt? Bundy's life story is a truly bizarre one, and it's the mystery of his life story rather than the crimes he committed that are central to this movie and that turn this into a much more interesting movie than a sensationalized account of his crimes would have been.Zac Efron's performance as Bundy was outstanding. He seemed to capture Bundy. Bundy's crime spree could only have continued if he truly was able to convince almost everyone that he was innocent - and Efron managed to portray Bundy in that light. In some ways - except for the fact that you know what he did - Efron's performance as Bundy maintains his innocence and convinces the people around him to do the same turns Bundy into an almost sympathetic character. It was easy to understand why so many people could be so mesmerized by him. Lili Taylor as his girlfriend Liz (on whose book about their relationship the movie is based) also put on a strong performance, although Kaya Scodelario as Bundy's later girlfriend turned wife Carol Ann was less convincing.The movie is interesting - but it's not a suspenseful movie really. The viewer already knows about Bundy and his crimes. This is more about his life when he wasn't committing his crimes and when he was trying to convince everyone around him of his innocence. So it perhaps lacks any sustained power, but it holds the viewer's attention. Efron's portrayal of the perfectly normal guy who also happens to be the personification of evil is actually disturbing. But, of course, Bundy's story is disturbing. Apparently after his trial and conviction, one of his own defence attorneys described Bundy as ""the very definition of heartless evil."" The movie - and Bundy's life - points out to us howeasily ""heartless evil"" can hide if it wants to. (7/10)","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
9,bowmanblue,Zac saves it,7,26 July 2019,"Yes, the title has been claimed to be a bit 'click-baity.' You're probably thinking you're going to be watching the most hardcore and depraved film ever made. Well... you're not, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth a watch.It's the - sort of - biography of real life seventies serial killer, Ted Bundy. And, if you're interested in his life then this is definitely going to interest you. Plus it has the - quite bankable - Zac Efron as the titular killer, Bundy and this is where the film starts to draw criticism from some people. They say that, because of Efron's natural good looks and charm, he draws quite a lot of sympathy towards the crazed killer. This may be true, however it's also worth noting that the real life Bundy was also considered attractive and it was his natural charm that allowed him such easy access to his unsuspecting victims, so, in my opinion, the casting is spot on.In fact, it's Efron that steals the show in his portrayal of the psychopath and this is definitely one for his acting C.V. Now, back to the title again. I've watched other films about Ted Bundy and they were pretty strong stuff, all choosing to show his hideous kills and various crimes. In 'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,' unless I'm much mistaken, you don't actually see a single kill. Whereas most other biopics start with the crimes and progress to show Bundy's capture and imprisonment etc, this one pretty much starts off with him getting arrested and the rest is the subsequent trial. Therefore, anyone expecting gore and violence will be sorely let down by the title.The rest of the cast all play their parts well, including Lily Collins as Bundy's conflicted (main) love interest, plus John Malkovich shows up in the final third as a judge in Bundy's trial. From what I understand the film-makers have done their best to portray the events pretty accurately, even going as far as to recreate photos from Bundy's life and also copy parts of the dialogue from public appearances word for word.So, as I say, if you're into real life killers and/or Zac Efron then you're in for a real treat here. However, if you're looking for kills and gore then you're not going to find it here.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
10,ThomasDrufke,For the Most Part - Opposite of What the Title Suggests,6,8 May 2019,"There's something about serial killers that we as an audience find undeniably fascinating. I don't really know what it is, other than putting yourself in a world that 99% of us will never come close to. Ted Bundy's story is among America's most notorious, vile, evil, and wicked. However, the film never dives deep enough to give the audience that type of reaction. And you can make the argument that doing so would be exploitive and off putting, and your more than likely right, but I expected to be more unsettled by Zac Efron's turn as Ted Bundy. The last 20 minutes are really well handled though, especially as Lily Collins' 'Liz Kendall' finally begins to invite us into her psyche, but perhaps all too late. Perhaps a story like this does ultimately work much better in a TV series/Documentary format. - i.e. the Netflix one earlier this year.6.4/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
11,cricketbat,An interesting perspective on Ted Bundy's story,7,3 July 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is kind of a terrible name, but it offers an interesting perspective on the story of Ted Bundy. However, I feel like this fictionalized account is a companion piece to Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, also directed by Joe Berlinger, as they kind of balance each other out. In the documentary, you hear and see many of the horrible things Bundy did, whereas in this film, you see how he deceived those around him. It's a bit unsettling how charismatic Zac Efron is as Ted Bundy, but I guess that's kind of the point.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
12,ops-52535,a spectacular view of a serial killer,7,3 May 2019,"Its 40 years since mr bundy was excecuted in florida, and i guess this is why netflix has agreed to make a kind of comemoration of his devilish deeds in this way, i do feel the symptoms of sympatition, the way most of the story is presented. its based on the story told by his girlfriend, who were left alive, iguess mostly because she had a sleeping sweet child in the cradle at their first rendevouz/date, that mr bundy were mesmerized by and therefore postponed the killing of liz, that in the aftermath surely became his anchorpoint to sanity. i'm not a psychiatrist,nor a criminal, but i may assume a lot of things,from what ive read heard and watched over the years on the bundy case.its not a bad film but its not good either.mr efron does a good act, as do most of the main cast, but the story has so big loopholes in the timeline that you loose track. considering the vast period of time mr bundy worked out his business, i see the problem for the makers of this movie to compress all of it in a 120 mins film. ive not read the book that the film is based on, so bear over with me , but i still feel something is missing. but there are tons of docus and even recordings of the tv broadcasted trial of ted bundy on the world wide web, watch these to get the full story of a heinous deeds of a serial killer, and remember heis just one of them, there are for sure plenty more of them out there, so you better watch out....i give the flick a ''seven'', its entertainment after all thinks the grumpy old man","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
13,UniqueParticle,Charismatic & stylish,9,10 May 2019,"This is a wonderful take on the sinister sociopath! I agree that Zac Efron nailed it, but I prefer the Ted Bundy (2002) starring Michael Reilly Burke because of the darker subject matter that's not shown in this version only talked about and shown in photos.The nice things with Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is that it's beautifully shot, witty, awesome soundtrack, and well acted! Also refreshing to see Zac Efron in a dark drama role rather than a party animal or singer.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
14,Thanos_Alfie,Ted Bundy...,7,3 April 2020,"""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" is a Drama - Biography movie in which we watch the crimes of Ted Bundy and his relationship with his long time girlfriend Liz Kendall. We watch only some of his crimes and not all of them, and we just watch a part of his life.I liked this movie because it is based on real life events and because it had much of suspense. I didn't like the fact that it wasn't showed to us the other crimes of Ted Bundy or even to mention them inside the movie. I also didn't like that it wasn't presented to us the manipulative skills of Ted Bundy or even the psychopathy behind him, we only watched a very small part of that. The interpretations of Zac Efron who played as Ted Bundy, Lily Collins who played as Liz Kendall and Kaya Scodelario who played as Carole Ann Boone were all very good. The direction which was made by Joe Berlinger was above average but there were missing some very important parts that I mentioned before.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
15,eddie_baggins,Efron shines in an otherwise so-so tale of a murderer,5,6 May 2019,"Making one thing crystal clear, Joe Berlinger's Ted Bundy focussed feature Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (based on a real-life statement made concerning Bundy's crimes, but not a great title regardless) is not a comprehensive Bundy bio, with little insight into his thought process, upbringing or motivators, as Berlinger instead shines a spotlight on his relationship with two key woman and his trial in front of a national television audience.Those viewers that were anticipating getting more of a warts and all Bundy experience are far better suited at checking out Netflix's other Bundy themed event The Ted Bundy Tapes, which gives viewers the opportunity to hear from the man himself about his life, crimes and deeply depraved thoughts.Berlinger here showcases Bundy as more of a rock star, a charming rogue that somehow convinced many that he was merely a scapegoat for the American justice system for a collection of horrifying murders that shocked the nation in the 1970's and early 80s. It's an odd, sometimes bad, sometimes brilliant attempt at offering a different angle of a man that is the very definition of a monster.Based on Bundy's one-time girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall's book The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy (here played by a relatively short changed Lily Collins, spending most of her screentime cuddling a grown up Sixth Sense kid), detailing her relationship with the serial killer that saw her fall in love with the more human side of the man, Extremely Wicked loses sight of its most important angle on a well-known story by shunning Collins for much of the screen-time to instead turn its attention to Zac Efron's incarnation of Bundy.This is both a good and bad thing for Berlinger's film, as Efron is quietly menacing and totally charming as Bundy in what's finally the high-profile role the actor has been craving ever since he graduated from High School Musical.Glimpsed in part in The Paperboy and Me and Orson Welles, Extremely Wicked provides Efron with a whole new lease on the acting life and Berlinger seemingly knows and understands this ace up his sleeve, as all else within his film gets swept aside to let Efron strut his stuff in the lead role.You can't help but feel however the central and driving relationship between Kendall and Bundy gets washed over the further we dive into the film and while the film starts out in a way that suggests this will be the key core to the tale, by the films middle and end stretches it only ever feels half explored at best.The other issue for Berlinger's film is the style he goes for, with quick edits, time jumps and often unfocused direction, Extremely Wicked does come across as more of a TV like movie, not a fully-fledged feature, no doubt part of the reason why Netflix ended up with the distribution rights for this film that was at one staged touted as a potential awards player.Final Say -There's a few standout scenes in Berlinger's film (the final conversation between Kendall and Bundy is skin crawling) and features a memorable Zac Efron turn but Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile feels like a missed opportunity to deeply explore the relationships in Ted Bundy's life that may've allowed us to gain further insight in the mind of one of the most nefarious yet brilliantly calculated killers the world has ever known.2 ½ VW Beetles out of 5","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
16,pmtelefon,Okay true crime made for tv movie.,6,13 May 2019,"I've seen a bunch of made for tv true crime movies. The heyday of that genre was from the mid '70s to mid '80s. There were too many good ones to even try to list them. That said, ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" is a pretty entry into that genre. It tells its story in a pretty straight way (even as it jumps back and forth in time). The movie avoids showing violence ( for the most part ) but it shows Zac Efron's butt instead. I don't need to see either. Zac Efron does a nice job but I don't see him continuing with many serious roles. My daughters grew up on the High School Musical movies and they thought he was great. They thought the movie was great too. They were born to late to know what a truly great true crime tv movie is like.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I recommend watching the Netflix docu-series Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, after watching this film. Also Bundy 2002 film n the TV film The Deliberate Stranger may shed more light on the heinous crimes for late comers.
Coming back to the film, it is no way slow or boring. In fact it is engaging n for the very young viewers who doesnt kno anything bah Bundy, this film will b more like a suspense courtroom drama.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
18,imseeg,Zac Efron TRYING to play a serial killer is just plain silly and nOT believable. No chemistry between him and leading actress either. What's left?,4,28 April 2020,"Better watch a documentary about Ted Bundy or only watch the end credits of this movie, with real life footage of the court which judged the serial killer Ted Bundy.The bad: Zac Efron cant be taken seriously in his role as a serial killer. He tries. And I usually like him as an actor, but the guy hasnt got a bad bone in his body, he is mister good guy, mister charming and HE now has to be believable as a serial killer? Come on. The other leading actress isnt bad either, but there are no sparks flying across, no chemistry.Any good? It's based on an interesting story of an infamous serial killer and IF, and only if you happen to BELIEVE in the portrayal of Ted Bundy by Zac Efron, then this might just be a nice, slowburning character portrait.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
19,jtindahouse,A masterful movie that I did not see coming,9,6 May 2019,"Before watching 'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile' I knew of Ted Bundy, but I didn't know any details or really have any information or knowledge about his crimes or him as a person. I would suggest that the more you know about him, the less you will enjoy this film. Or at least you will have to enjoy it on a different level. For me this film did something I didn't expect it to do - it made me almost like Bundy. And it also (at least from the point of view the film was coming from) made me question his guilt for a large part of the runtime. This was a quite masterfully put together film.Firstly, the performances are outstanding across the board. This is the best performance I have ever seen from Zac Efron. As a comedic actor he does very little for me, however this film was proof that as a serious actor he can carry a film entirely on his own. Also Lily Collins impressed me immensely once again. She had already blown me away in 'To the Bone', and once again here (admittedly I didn't actually recognise her due to the normal weight she had in this film) she was captivating to watch every time she was on screen. The final scene these two share together is some acting of the highest quality.This is not a film that is trying to shock you with grisly murders and over the top characters. It is something very different to that indeed. In fact in terms of action there is almost none, however the 110 minute runtime flies by. The pacing is exquisite, mostly because the dialogue is so well written. I'll be honest, this film caught me off guard by how good it was. If you're on the edge about seeing it, please do. You'll be very happy you did.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
20,billcr12,Average Film,6,5 May 2019,"Zac Efron is OK as Ted Bundy, but Mark Harmon was better in the 1986 two part drama back in 1986. This film focuses on the relationship between Ted and Liz Kendall and is based on the book ""The Phantom Prince."" I have read it and six others on the killer. As a true crime aficionado, Extremely Wicked is just an average entry. I followed the case from 1981 with Ann Rule's excellent book, ""The Stranger Beside Me"" to Bundy's execution in 1989. The movie skips around too much for my taste. The structure is extremely uneven. The clips of the real Ted show a man with extraordinary charisma. It is easy to see how he fooled so many women with his charm and good looks. The cast is fine but I would still recommend the Harmon version over this one. P.S. Zac should have done his homework. Ted was left-handed. We lefties always notice one another.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

23,alindsay-al,A Great Twisted Thriller,8,27 May 2019,"This film has gained alot of publicity recently whether negative or positive and I have now seen this film and I must admit this film gripped me quite a bit and had me interested throughout. The premise of the film documents the life of Ted Bundy who is accussed of Rape and Murder of numerous girls and how he charmed his way into the public eye. Zac Efron was cast as Ted Bundy and honestly this is probably the best I have ever seen him, he is charismatic, charming but also intense. He totally owns this role and I feel like he was perfectly cast in the role. Lilly Collins plays his girlfriend in this film and she does a fantastic job in this film, she is great as this loved up woman that sees how great this guy is, but as more is revealed she starts to break down and become really damaged. The cast is littered with top quality performers and they all do great jobs, Haley Joel Osmant, John Malkovic, Kayla Scodelario & Jim Parsons all nail their roles and give really solid performances. The story is fascinating as it shows a bad guy believe he is the hero of the film, you are drawn into this character and are interested how this is going to develop even if you know the story and the way it goes it is pretty gripping. The script has some decent dramatic scenes in it and the characters feel like they are in turmoil for pretty much the whole film. However, considering the charm of bundy I thought there may be a bit more humour used in this film and it would have added more to the story. The style of the film has some really intense courtroom scenes, I love courtroom scenes and I can buy into them. However, this film is a clear made for TV movie, it just seems to have a low budget and feels quite cheap. Overall this is an interesting film that I enjoyed watching and if you are interested in the story then you should see this film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

25,jimbo-53-186511,"Reasonable story and acting, but as a character piece it is thin and superficial",6,1 June 2019,"I'm not even going to bother to write the film's ridiculously long title in my review which in itself seems to over egg the pudding (Ted Bundy is bad OK we get it) , but the title notwithstanding this film (which I'll continually refer to it as this film) is a helter-skelter of hit and miss...It sets it's stall out well and perfectly sets up Bundy's character - his early relationship with Liz gives this film a warm homely feel that we know is a façade. But somewhere along the line, this is lost and director Joe Berlinger does god knows what from this point on; we have the initial getting together of Ted Bundy and Elizabeth Kendall and their early relationship, but then this film skips by around 6 years and then hones in on Bundy's legal troubles; OK so what happened in these 6 years? Nothing of interest I presume?Even if you can ignore the flaws in this aspect of this film then there are plenty to be found later on; this film quite often uses the words 'present' rather than 'show' when referring to Bundy's killing spree (meaning the killings are presented rather than shown). In fact when murders do occur they are often glossed over and either discussed off screen or by other characters in courtroom scenes. Now don't get me wrong I'm not a masochist who revels in bloodshed or others misfortune, but I just expected this biopic to scratch beneath the surface, which sadly it doesn't.So what else can be said? Well Zac Efron was a revelation and applied himself to the role much better than I expected- although the cynic in me did question what drew him to the role? I was wondering the conversation between director and actor; Director; ""Yes Zac Ted Bundy was a brutal man. but chicks loved him. Zac Efron ""Oh cool so I can play against type whilst at the same time chicks love and adore me."" Director ""Yes Zac you've passed the audition."" Yes that's a little harsh and to be fair he was much better in the role of Ted Bundy than I expected. Lily Collins was equally as good as his girlfriend and was every match for Efron. The supporting cast consisting of Malkovich and Osment were fine - although the latter hasn't developed into a particularly convincing adult actor and seems to play the same person he portrayed in Sex Ed and therefore. sadly, didn't add much to the film.""This film"" is certainly not bad and is watchable if you have some patience, but the sketchy way it explores Bundy and his crimes meant I could never get to grips with it as much as I should have been able to and at times (particularly in the first half) it felt a little boring. Like I've said it works in parts, but it is far too thin and superficial for it to be qualified as a particularly great film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
26,a_baron,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile",4,14 November 2019,"Somebody once said a story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, preferably in that order. We know all about Ted Bundy: his beginnings, his end, and what he did in between. It soon becomes apparent that this somewhat disjointed offering is intent on humanising this monster rather than portraying his crimes, thus we don't see the kidnapping of Carol DaRonch, any of his shennanigans with the plaster cast (barring a cameo at the end), the sorority house murders...even his last victim, Kimberly Leach, is mentioned only en passant and as an afterthought.Zach Effron looks rather like Bundy, and puts in an excellent performance, but even the best actor in the world can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, regardless of the quality of the script. So apart from portraying Ted as a regular guy, and showing us how moronic were both Carole Ann Boone and the Bundy groupies, what do we learn from this film? How about in some respects America's open justice is too open?Thinking back to the Kennedy assassination, if Houston Police hadn't held a press conference after Oswald's arrest and transported him publicly, but had treated him the way suspected murderers are treated in most every other country, Jack Ruby wouldn't have assassinated the assassin, and the conspiracy industry as we know it today would not exist. By the same token, if Bundy had been permitted to use the law library only while manacled and under a heavy escort, and if he had been properly incarcerated in Colorado, the Florida outrages would never have happened. And it beggars belief he was permitted or able to have sex with a visitor while awaiting trial and under suspicion of committing such heinous crimes.For such a lengthy film. ""...Shockingly Evil..."" has little to say, and is strictly for Bundy scholars only.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
27,I_Ailurophile,Truly fascinating,9,4 July 2021,"The music overseen by reputed film composer Marco Beltrami with Dennis Smith catches our attention right away, as does the selection of popular songs that rounds out the soundtrack. Zac Efron and Lily Collins both look stunning, and the ease with which they slip into character and actualize Ted and Liz is impressive - they have outstanding chemistry as scene partners.It would be easy to say 'Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile' humanizes a horrific monster of a person. I understand that perspective, and have found myself voicing a similar sentiment elsewhere. Yet that's hardly the intent behind this film; what I see instead is a demonstration of how even the most loving and unassuming person, who would never be suspected by their friends and family, can hold a dark, terrible secret close to their chest. To that end, this is riveting.Efron portrays the cool confidence of Bundy with a poise echoing the disparity between the family life the man hoped to return to and the brutal crimes he committed. That disconnect is made still more glaring by Bundy's cheeky insistence on his innocence, and the broad declination to show the grave acts of violence in the picture. Meanwhile, Collins capably renders the heartbreak and confusion of Liz, who was ready to build a life with the killer. The early scenes of their deep romance contrasts sharply and painfully with Liz's despondence after his legal troubles begin.The narrative is told with a sense of style and wit befitting the unprecedented spectacle that Bundy's Florida trial represented. Michael Werwie's adapted screenplay builds complex characterizations that allow the cast great leeway to wholly embody their roles, and they do, with aplomb. Surprising cameos (James Hetfield?!) are balanced by acting veterans who anchor the feature in pivotal roles (John Malkovich, Haley Joel Osment), while the young, fresh faces among the leads and supporting cast more than prove their chops. That the words I've written here have largely focused on the actors emphasizes how the movie relies heavily on their skills, and they do not disappoint in the slightest. Everyone here is at the top of their game, dispelling any past notions about their prowess, and I look forward to seeing many more films from all involved.I have a penchant for loquacity when it comes to writing about films, but in this case I find I just don't have a great deal to say. 'Extremely wicked' more than speaks for itself. The content is disturbing and difficult, but the production and performances are top notch. It's entertaining for the flair with which director Joe Berlinger tells the story, and all around captivating for the great excellence of its craft, in all aspects. This is well worth watching and comes highly recommended for all viewers.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
28,s3276169,The Ted Bundy you might not have known.....,8,6 May 2019,"I was a teenager when I first heard the name Ted Bundy. Although I do not live in the US, his crimes and subsequent trials were international news. Depictions of his life followed his death by execution in 1989. This film is yet another to delve into the life of the prolific serial killer.Firstly let me say this is for the most part an excellent film.I'd always associated actor Zac Efron with films that were for the most part well and truly not in my age demographic. Well Efron has aged well, so to speak, handing in a polished, chillingly credible, performance as Ted.The preppy, kindly exterior Ted presents to his loved ones, who he appears to genuinely care for, hides a coldly cunning, shrewdly manipulate, predator. A predator who, on a certain level, is so damaged he is, in a sense divorced from his crimes. Bundy lives in two worlds and neither is the sum total of who and what this badly damaged man really represents.Whats also presented fairly openly is the shortcomings and the cruelty to be found in the US justice system. Its a dehumanizing mechanism that actually leaves you feeling a degree of sympathy for Bundy, in spite of the appalling nature of his crimes.Engrossing and entertaining. 8/10 from me.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

30,AudioFileZ,Another Look At Evil Is Quite Interesting,7,4 May 2019,It doesn't go away. Ted Bundy lives on in memories and shattered lives. This is the story of that vile ongoing travesty. I'd say it's good in that if you've seen all you care to see you might just find this movie revelatory. If we're all capable of light and darkness then it's plausible that dark side could co-exist and take control of a person. It certainly did that with Ted Bundy and like a disease it did infect others such as the central love figure profiled here. It also might have tricked many others to let their guards down. Apparently it did so with another young woman who carried his child. I was unaware of this to which this film was a striking revelation. In the end such evilness could not escape the light of justice and day. This is a very unsettling peek into the crime of Theodore Bundy.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
31,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting, Human Look at a Monster",8,7 May 2019,"This was a film that I was quite excited to check out. I remember when this was first announced that Zac Efron would be playing the role of Ted Bundy and it was something that definitely fit for me. I even have written a couple articles for a site about this film as well. The synopsis is courtroom frenzy ensues and sweeps 1970s America when a young single mother reluctantly tips the attention of a widespread manhunt toward her longtime boyfriend, Ted Bundy.We start with Liz Kendall (Lily Collins) waiting in a prison visiting room. Ted comes in and he pretty elated to see her. She isn't there for a social call and she asks him why he did what he did. He's still adamant in his denial.It then shifts to the past. Liz is at a college bar with her friend Joanna (Angela Sarafyan). Liz was just out of a relationship and Joanna is trying to get her back out there. Liz though has self-esteem that she is a single mother and works as a secretary. That night she meets the charming Ted Bundy, who ends up taking her home. It is there she reveals that she has a daughter. This doesn't bother him and he stays the night. The following morning he is making breakfast and watching her child.From there the two of become a couple and everything seems normal. With a bit of a voice-over, we learn that there are disappearances and murders in the Seattle area. They know the man's name is Ted and that he drives a Volkswagen Bug. The police sketch really does look like Liz's amazing boyfriend.Things take when he is pulled over and they find supplies in the backseat that could be used to kidnap people in Utah. The disappearances shifted to there when he moved to the new state. Liz is upset and Ted tells her he didn't do anything. Along with his lawyer, John O'Connell (Jeffrey Donovan), they try to go about proving his innocence. The truth of what Ted really did though is much darker than Liz can even imagine. This all culminates in Florida with the first nationwide trial.Now I wanted to go a bit vague to start off this review as I'm assuming many people have seen documentaries or know roughly the true story of the events. I found this film to actually be quite intriguing in the fact that this is being based off of book that the real Liz Kendall wrote. We really get this film from her point of view for the most part and the effects seeing Ted had on her. I do have to say, that really tugged at my heartstrings.It is crazy the events of Ted's life and the things that he did. It really does make for a good film in that way for sure. This actually has the two escape attempts by him, going to Florida where it ended up being his undoing. To go along with this though, we also see how someone like Ted could get away with the things he did. At the end there is even a line about how we think that the monster is going to look hideous, when the truth the matter is the opposite. The thing is though, we are more likely to have a killer like Ted whose looks and charisma would allow him to do what he did.I did see from a fellow person in the horror community complaining about the film being boring. I found this to be interesting, but I could definitely see where he is coming from. What really causes this in my opinion is that director Joe Berlinger is a documentary filmmaker. This film though isn't a documentary, definitely has that feel with how it presents the information. We never see any of the kills and it is really just the personal side of things.Another issue I see being brought up is this film glorifying Ted. I didn't really get that from the film. I think it does a really good job at embodying that he was attractive and that women loved him. It makes it worse though is that he was such a manipulator. Going even farther from that, I could see how he could some of things he did and it is crazy someone could do the things he did with no remorse.I personally didn't find this film to be boring, but as I said, nothing really happens. I think that it does present the information much like a documentary would present them. It is very matter of fact. I can't really give the film too much credit though in building tension. I know what is going to happen and how things end for him. I did think that it did well in bringing the events to life. The one thing I will say, this film isn't horror aside from the subject matter.The best part of the film though has to be the acting. Efron was absolutely amazing as Ted. He is such a scumbag, yet women loved him. There were so many that didn't think he did it. Efron has such a charisma and way about him that really brought this monster to life. I was very impressed with Collins as well. She is someone who is already struggling with self-esteem due to her life situation. Seeing her break down and turn to alcohol to cope really hurt me. The guilt she is carrying, even though unfounded, was powerful. This film had quite the cast that really did a great job. Some of the standouts are Dylan Baker, Haley Joel Osment, Terry Kinney, Brian Geraghty, Jim Parsons and John Malkovich. I really do have to commend Osment as well for his role in this film.As to the effects of the film, there really aren't any. Since we never seen any of the deaths, all we get were the real photographs from the case. That really is impactful if I'm going to be completely honest. The film is also shot very well.Now with that said, this film I actually did end up enjoying. It does have its issue, but I thought it was interesting to bring to life Ted Bundy with Zac Efron and to see him all grown up from High School: The Musical. He is actually really impressing me with his acting for sure. The pacing is a bit weird being that it feels like a documentary and plus this is a story I already know. The rest of the acting was great as well, with a special shout-out to Collins. There aren't really any effects as it never shows us any of the deaths. The soundtrack of the film I thought was fitting to help bring the time period to life. I thought this was a good film and I would definitely recommend giving it a viewing if you are interested in this monstrous human being. I will re-iterate this film isn't really horror in my opinion aside from the subject matter.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
32,jadepietro,Extremely Evil and Shockingly Tame,6,22 May 2019,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Fine performances are given standard treatment in this sanitized version of the life of serial killer, Ted Bundy.JIM'S REVIEW: The title should says it all: Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, a film biography about serial killer, Ted Bundy. Directed by Joe Berlinger, the film chronicles his sordid life with factual details.. But the movie takes a surprisingly sympathetic view of this psychopath and downplays his killing spree. Instead, it focuses on the relationship between him and his loyal girlfriend, Liz Kendall, and makes her boyfriend just another charming cad. The tone and point of view is off base.We follow their love story, his secrets and lies, his trials, and his many incarcerations while Michael Werwie's screenplay unwisely avoids the heinous crimes. This imbalance allows plenty of empathy for Liz, but there is also some emotional leftovers for this killer. While the script does follows the events leading up to his execution, it soft pedals his violent acts, only hinting at his bloody trail of victims. It all leads to a melodramatic confrontation scene between the two lovers, extremely well played, but an all-too-obvious plot device.The director captures the period well, but he overuses pop songs to emphasize the action, an unnecessary distraction. The storytelling of this crime drama remains standard television thriller variety. The murders themselves are discussed but rarely seen or re-enacted, a missed opportunity to show Bundy's true identity and the ugliness of his brutal acts.Yet, the film is always compelling. The gory evidence of Bundy's crimes and his televised trial's circus atmosphere are interesting material. However, what elevates the routine story and direction is the fine acting by its cast. Zac Efron uses his boyish good looks and charismatic persona to maximum effect. He delivers a chilling performance as Bundy. Lily Collins is very good as his steadfast and confused lover. Both actors are convincing in their romance and its fall-out. They add more to their stock characters and their predictable dialog. Providing strong support are Kaya Scodelario as Bundy's wife, Carole Ann Boone, Jim Parsons as trial lawyer, Larry Simpson, and a wonderful John Malkovich as Edward Cowart, a judge at Bundy's trial.What should be an indictment about Bundy's disturbing crimes and the criminal system itself becomes a simple love story gone wrong. Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile should have had the courage to live up to its descriptive title. If it had, that would have been a film truly worth seeing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
33,Amyth47,Zac exceeds expectations!,7,22 June 2019,My Rating : 7/10The film offers a completely different perspective on Ted Bundy's character here -- as a boring simpleton who leads a normal uneventful life. Zac Efron does great work of showing what a normal innocent person with a deep dark underbelly looks like.It humanises the criminal and shows the kind of psychological fugue and compartmentalisation a person can have! How a person can be divided in his mind to be so extremely evil is truly astounding. Malignant narcissistic of the highest order!,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
34,Kingslaay,Not bad,7,25 May 2019,Zac Effron has come a long way since his High School Musical days. This film gives him a new serious role to play and he runs with it. His portrayal of murderer Ted Bundy is truly great. What was also good about this film is the unique perspective the viewers get into his life and vantage point. You do not see him commit the gruesome murders but a personalised view into his life. For a little while you almost believe his lies and buy into him being a victim. Zac shows some acting chops here by playing Bundy well and showing this invented innocence he wears around like armour.7.5/10,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

37,m-47826,"Decent enough movie, without the documentary perks.",6,7 May 2019,"Some parts were really hard to sit through. I even lost track at one point around the middle of the movie. but thankfully, the trial was gripping enough.
Speaking of which, John Malkovich was completely mimicking his « real life » counterpart, giving a pretty forgettable performance. So let's move on from this.
As far as the rest of the cast go, I was pleasantly surprised. Not by Zac Efron, who was a little too sure of himself, making his portrayal of Ted Bundy missing the humility required to give justice to his impression of him. As if he was expecting some award out of this or something. Nice efforts, though. But I was by the rest of the cast. Lily Collins, showing she really is a gifted young actress. Kaya Scodelario, flawless as ever, despite her haircut/3 layer glasses, making her look silly, in a cute girl trying to look ugly kind of way. Jim Parsons, completely transformed from his usual mimics and acting patterns. And Haley Joel Osmend, who managed to make his tiny little part, crucial to the story. Story that is, despite the things I was talking about earlier, nicely packed and executed. I would've personally preferred less emphasis on Ted's Jekyll, and more on his Hyde personality. But what can you do.
All in all, although flawed, to say the least. The movie was entertaining and interesting acting wise. And beautifully shot, in the usual Netflix « originals » fashion.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

41,aciessi,Criminal.,2,6 May 2019,"This movie is none of those three things. Let me rephrase it for you. Extremely Boring, Shockingly Banal and Dull. You're looking at the biggest waste of time this year on Netflix, at the movies, and anywhere else. Was the world clamoring for a Ted Bundy biopic? Not particularly. Is it an interesting concept for an independent film? Fair enough. What can be done with the facts at hand, and the demented character of Bundy himself? Well, I don't really want to go down that dark and gruesome rabbit hole, but I can guarantee you it would be something much better than this. Joe Berliner took his engrossing documentary and turned it into a narrative farce. Watch the doc, and call it night on Netflix. You would have missed out on nothing. This is a dressed up, over calculated, horrendously acted dramatization of real events. You don't need to see it.Zac Efron, despite being a total dead-ringer for Ted Bundy did not convince me as a psychopath. The real Bundy was a snot-nosed aristocrat who politicked his way into making people think he couldn't have committed those murders. Efron plays him as some dreamy frat boy. No, all wrong. Even worse is John Malkovich (fulfilling what I gather is a 5-picture deal with Netflix) as Judge Edward Cowart, the man who sentenced Bundy. The real Cowart is a hard nosed southerner who saw through Bundy's charade, knocked his block off and led him down the path of justice for his crimes. Malkovich plays him as John Malkovich. No acting required. A real paycheck casher, indeed. Lily Collins is fine here, and admittedly tries hard for a character that was written without much thought or care.You'll notice that less than half of this movie is told from her perspective, while the film was advertised as it was entirely through her POV. The narrative structure is all over the place, and as sloppy as a biopic can possibly get. You have to make a decision in a biopic between telling a true story using the perspective of the real-life character, or tell the story as a faux-documentary as the events played out. You can't do both.I left having learned nothing I didn't already know about Ted Bundy, and not enjoying myself watching it either. Even if serial killer movies and docs are your thing, this film will let you down.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
42,rockman182,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile(2019)",6,5 May 2019,"I have been getting into documentaries about crimes and conspiracies recently. I had checked out the Ted Bundy documentary a few weeks back. I was fairly familiar with most serial killer cases seeing as I have a background in forensic psychology. When I heard Joe Berlinger was making a movie to kind of go as a companion piece to his documentary series I was excited. Then I realized it was going to be a Netflix film and knew it was going to be terrible. It is confirmed, this was quite bad.The film is primarily about the relationships and court trial stage of Ted Bundy's life. Zac Efron plays Bundy and portrays the not as violent portions of his life. Showing his early relationship with Liz Kendall and the craziness of his court trial where Bundy even decided to represent himself and be his own counsel. Of course, Ted Bundy was eventually tried for his crimes and fried in the electric chair. Good riddance. Touchy subject yes, but if you are going to make a movie about this evil man it needs to be effective and focus on his killings.This felt like a useless and tame look into a serial killer. If you are going to make a movie like this in the first place it needs to really focus on what made him so inhumane and kind of be raw and gritty with a look into what actually happened. Instead this was a quasi-romanticizing telling of Bundy's relationships and his charm and confidence in court. I'm not saying that's not important but it doesn't need to be the full focus of the film. Lily Collins character, what purpose does she serve? She just fades into the background and mopes around.I think Efron was good in this film and is able to capture some of Bundy's mannerisms but the performance is wasted on a extremely tame and shockingly generic film that leaves the mind just as soon as it enters. Berlinger's documentary touches on all the important aspects that it needs to but the film shies away from everything and is unremarkable.5/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
43,Holt344,Different approach but greatly told with superb acting,9,3 May 2019,"Joe Berlinger manages to create a sad and human biopic of the disgusting and notorious serial killer Ted Bundy, in all honesty it delivers something unexpected but if you just do some research you will know he was a dangerous and disgusting human being but the movie does a good job at making us see a different side of things and the director and writers succeeds in setting it up. I can understand how some will dislike the narrative focus as the first half is through Liz's eyes and the second half is through Ted's and in my opinion it's perfect as you get to see both of his sides.Zac Efron is simply remarkable in the performance of Ted Bundy, just wow. Oscar worthy performance, so far he's the best of this year. He have truly developed as an actor and as a person and this role marks a highlight in his career, something different, something amazing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
44,joebloggscity,Surprised by this shocking film,7,6 May 2019,"I have to hold my hands up here and concede that this film has very much surprised me. Taking Zac Efron who is better known by the teenie mobs of the past generation or so, this was a gamble as a gruesome lead, the true life Ted Bundy. Yet it all works and Zac Efron is excellent in the lead.This could easily have been another crude exploitation move under a guise taking a moral high ground. Yet instead we have a gruesome themed movie that actually avoids (in general) any gruesome aspects and themes.This film centres around one women who falls in love with Bundy, and her experiences round that, following also the capture and indictment of Bundy. Also it creepily follows those women who just simply fall head over heels for Bundy, and are unapologetic for him, in the same way some were over Charles Manson.The real scare factor is the reality of it all. It falls down in part in that possibly it could have been more ambitious, but possibly needed more budget and some stronger names for this. However, it doesn't fail in what it tries to achieve.I found it mostly disturbingly fascinatingly despite being disgusted by many in it, but that's the point. Reality can be more frightening than fiction.I can't seem myself reading up more on it all, as I don't want to get into anything that builds up a legend status for what Bundy has narcissistically already achieved.It's a fine move, which will make you feel awkward, but there many good points of interest in it, and that's what makes it a mostly curious watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

46,kjproulx,A Great Performance in a Movie that Holds Back,6,3 May 2019,"True stories that revolve around a character who commits the worst kind of crimes isn't exactly something that people look forward to watching, but when the story itself is just so crazy that it makes for an engaging film, I think it warrants a production. Although one of Netflix's latest films in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile won't be getting a glowing recommendation from me by any means, this is a film made for the average viewer who would like to know there story, without being overwhelmingly disgusted. Here's why I believe certain viewers should be checking this film out.Following Ted Bundy (Zac Efron) as he plays it cool, marries the love of his life, and had a child, the film begins to reveal what he may have been doing behind the scenes. Being accused of countless murders of women in numerous states outside of his own, this is a story that has a lot more grime under its surface than most movies do. Where I feel this film falls short; However, is within the overall presentation of the movie itself. Being a narrative feature, it almost still feels like a documentary at times, and that's not really a positive.This is a film that focusses on a disgusting man, who comes off as one of the nicest people in the world, and the movie chooses to stick with that from beginning to end. Aside from a few images that insinuate certain things, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile is a tame movie in terms of what it could have presented to the audience. Just like news articles and documentaries about this man, this movie only tells you what he has done, rather than showing any of it. While I wasn't looking to watch a film that explicitly showed what he did, the story didn't have much of an emotional impact, because it was told from his perspective, without revealing anything he has done (for the most part).Aside from the overall choice to hide the events themselves, this is a film that showcases one of the best performances of Zac Efron's career. If for nothing else, I would recommend this movie for that alone. The way he plays it cool and finds comedy in terrible moments was very fitting for the title of the film. His performance sucked me in, even though I didn't find the film to be great overall.In the end, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile is a film that's light on substance, but very solid in many other regards. From the performances to even the screenplay itself, it's a film that's trying to please the sensitive viewers who still wish to experience this story, which I can appreciate in a way. Where I found myself most impressed was in the direction. Having only directed the absolutely dreadful feature film in Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, I was pleased to see the growth of director Joe Berlinger. This film made me look forward to his future feature film endeavours. Overall, this film didn't do much for me, but the story itself and the central performance have me giving it a passing grade.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
47,skepticskeptical,So Ted Bundy may have been innocent?,5,5 May 2019,"I was somewhat surprised by this made-for-tv quality biopic of Liz, the girlfriend of Ted Bundy. The entire focus was on her perspective, which holds some interest, I suppose, but had she been involved with anyone other than a serial rapist/murderer, no one would ever have heard of her at all. What I also found surprising in this sympathetic depiction was the suggestion that Ted Bundy may have been innocent after all, what surely is highly offensive to the families of the victims.The film provides absolutely no reason for believing that the charming lead male protagonist might be capable of sawing off the heads of his victims or biting their buttocks or any of the other things which someone obviously did--given the forensic evidence and dead bodies left in the perpetrator´s wake. Even if these types of murders came to a halt while Ted Bundy was incarcerated, that would not show that he was the culprit. See: the Zodiac killer for an unsolved case of a serial killer who simply stopped for one reason or another (he may have died?).To those who retort that the point of the film is to portray how Ted Bundy did get away with so many murders before finally being caught (because his girlfriend gave his name to the authorities--what?!), I must reiterate that the film equally supports the hypothesis of Bundy´s innocence.Postscript on the state of visual media in the twenty-first century: This was a Netflix production, and so I think that we can see that when a company starts churning out films about any- and everything, as fast as it can, there will be a return to television-quality production values. i have noticed this with Amazon Prime, Showtime, HBO, et al., as well. Maybe we were better off when movies were much fewer in number and more of a major event. Now there are so many movies and so many series, all said to be bingeworthy by their creators, but the vast majority of them are nothing but a way for the masses to pass time, just like the canned-laughter sitcoms of the past.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

49,maccas-56367,"Crazy and a bit all over the place, much like its main character",6,3 May 2019,"This movie was a bit all over the place and I spent most of the time amazed at the uncanny resemblance my friend has to Lily Collins. Zac Efron is well cast as Bundy, but I don't think his performance was mind-blowing in a Charlize Theron ""Monster"" kind of way.Still, by the time court proceedings rolled round, this movie had sucked me in - so it succeeded on that level. I also have the strong urge to finally check out Steve McQueen's ""Papillon"".I thought this would focus more on the family and home life of Bundy during his horrific crimes - but it barely did. It seemingly glossed over a lot of that, besides a montage towards the end. ""Extremely Wicked"" sometimes came across like a Lifetime movie and lacked focus. Malkovich and Parsons helped make the court scenes a high point - but what's the point in re-hashing events that were already broadcast in real-time around the world?It often assumes the audience already knows most of Bundy's story - because I didn't leave this film with much increased knowledge of the crimes. The final telephone scene was quite powerful. Good to see Efron in a serious role. Recommend for true crime fans or those interested in psychology - and perhaps others with a morbid curiosity like myself.Mixed thoughts on this.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

51,MrDHWong,"An interesting, well-acted film about one of the most infamous mass murderers of the twentieth century",7,1 August 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is a biographical crime drama based around the actions of serial killer Ted Bundy. Starring Zac Effron in the lead role and based on the memoir ""The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy"" by Elizabeth Kendall, it is an interesting, well-acted film about one of the most infamous mass murderers of the twentieth century.In 1969, young law student Theodore ""Ted"" Bundy (Zac Effron) meets single mother Liz Kendall (Lily Collins) at a bar in Seattle and the two start dating. Six years later, Ted is arrested for allegedly murdering several young women and is sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison, though in spite of this verdict he vehemently professes his innocence to Liz. Throughout the years, Ted manages to escape twice from different prisons but is recaptured each time, and as overwhelming evidence against him starts to pile up, Liz's mental state deteriorates rapidly.As attention-grabbing as it is thought-provoking, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile presents a fascinating look into the mindset of such a well-known serial killer and how his actions affected those who were close to him. Zac Effron gives one of the most chilling and frightening performances of a real life murderer ever put on screen, not so much due to how horrific Bundy's crimes were, but in that how charming and charismatic he remains during his accusations of said crimes, effectively coming across as the perfect psychopath. Lily Collins is also worth noting as Liz, who does a fine job showcasing the collapse of her mental well-being as the man she loves is being accused of such heinous acts. Unfortunately the film is brought down at times by some strange editing and pacing issues. At certain points, it felt as though the filmmakers were glancing over important parts of Bundy's motivations for committing his atrocious acts in favour of simply setting up for the lengthy courtroom scenes. However, this could possibly have been done as a means to show respect to the families of the actual victims, but it still felt as though some important information was omitted from the overall story, and the film does suffer as a result. While not quite as great as it could have been, Effron's brilliant turn as Bundy definitely makes this film worth a viewing on Netflix.I rate it 7/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
52,Alexander_Blanchett,"Extremely slow moving, shockingly mediocre and well acted",6,17 May 2019,"It was okay however had potential to be really great. Too bad that the film itself was rather uninteresting and even if it offered an interesting perspective... portraying Ted Bundy as a personality - a normal human being and not really focusing on his cruel crimes. Just showing the person behind the crimes, without glamorizing him.
The reason the film works is Zac Efron's really great performance. Did not know that he had it in him but he was fantastic and totally nailed the role.
Lily Collins was also fine - especially in the last third of the film where she delivered many outstanding moments. But the film itself was often slow moving and sometimes to the level of boring. I think the screenplay needed more work and so did the direction. And no I was not hungry for cruel slaughter scenes or anything and really found the fact to portray Bundy as a person outside of the crimes interesting but I guess he was not an interesting person enough to fill a movie with - neither did I think the relationship with Liz was outstandingly interesting. Still Efron really saves the film and gives one of the best performances of the year.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
53,bshaef,A Great one for Netflix,9,10 May 2019,"I've always thought that Zac Effron was a great actor and comes across well on television and in the movies but so many people stopped at his face which meant he never got his due. He is sort of a Marilyn Monroe of male actors. This movie is his time to put that persona to rest. The guy is just simply superb. The rest of the show, actors, scenery, clothes and story progression were great. This movie is why I subscribe to Netflix.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
54,TheTruthofItIs,"Extremely Wicked, but kind of boring",4,9 July 2020,"Given the horrendous rapes/murders/defilements Ted Bundy committed, characterized by the judge as ""extremely wicked, shockingly evil, and vile"" this was a tame almost boring portrayal of this story, more suitable as a Lifetime Movie than a feature film. I had a stronger feelings reading about his crimes in Wikipedia than watching this. In fact for the dozens if not hundred plus rapes/murders he committed, this presentation barely showed a couple of them, it seemed more focused on the conman side of the story, how he constantly duped those who trusted him, again more of a Lifetime Movie Network angle than what should've been a real shocker of a film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

56,Azanspy,Shockingly good.,7,4 May 2019,"After hearing the negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, I didn't expect much from this movie. But this surprised me. This is not an ordinary thriller about a serial killer. This is a drama about the after effects of his actions. The movie can be categorised into a court drama or a romantic drama to an extend. I'm not a big fan of Zac Effron. But he give his best performance of his career and we won't be seeing him in such top form any time soon. Lily Collins and other supporting cast members have also done a great job. This movie is perfect for people who love dramas and I won't suggest this for the one's seeking thrillers.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
57,saadanathan,Extremely good and vile,7,28 July 2020,"The true story of the serial murderer Ted Bundy comes to life in this epic film: ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"". This movie is brilliant with great actors and dialogue throughout it. Many close ups scenes that can be referred as moments of tension. Finally I get to see Zac Efron in a more serious role, he gets to show his acting skills and true talent in this movie. Lily Collins is extraordinary in her portrayal and gives a lot of emotion to the film. Even Jim Persons's and John Malkovich's roles in the film are perfect and yet small. I don't have nothing bad to say about the film but you can find other movies like this one that are more better in tension and drama. So it is an average drama movie based on a true story that is made well.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
58,bgar-80932,Made me want to watch a doc about Bundy,7,3 May 2019,"I think the biggest thing I can say about this movie is it got me seriously interested in Ted Bundy. I think Efron did a pretty good job of portraying the character but the clips at the end of the actual guy is far more menacing to me and peaked my interest. The whole thing was interesting though because it's crazy that someone can be so evil and still have a family life and be convincing enough that most people think he didn't do it. I think overall the script and such needed work but it was a pretty good movie especially by Netflix standards, most their movies are poor.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
59,danielmanson,Enjoyed it,8,4 May 2019,"What struck me the most was how good the acting of Zac Efron was. He was Ted Bundy in this film, brilliant choice of actor and brilliant acting.Having previously watched the Ted Bundy documentary, I also really enjoyed certain clips and scenes that matched the real life ones.A negative I have to offer would be that I would have enjoyed seeing more detail about how he killed the women etc. I could be sick minded, but I just would have liked to have seen how he went about it. Going to other states etc.If you have seen the Ted Bundy tapes documentary or know about his life then you must watch this film. If you know nothing about it then you may not enjoy it so much.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

61,FrenchEddieFelson,A nauseous human being with two faces,7,4 May 2019,"Even if the main particularity of Ted Bundy is indisputably a disconcerting desire for exceptionally barbaric murders, the movie focuses on an unusual seduction ability thanks to a charismatic eloquence and an extraordinary IQ, and then two women who loved him, Liz Kendall and Carole Anne Boone. Indeed, the film does not really deal with the police investigation and modestly eludes the macabre scenes of crimes, but, on the contrary, it highlights the duality of the monster: an odd mix of a successful womanizer and an accomplished serial killer, of Casanova and Jack the ripper, or an unexpected materialization of Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, the fictional super-villain appearing in comic books published by DC, a criminal obsessed with duality and the conflict between good and evil.Thus, although Ted Bundy appears or seems 'lovable' in some of the first scenes, the movie depicts us, during the second half, a pathetic seducer of any individual within his tiny environment (the journalists, the jurors, the judge, the audience, ...), able to arrogantly smile like a politician during an election campaign, and devoid of any respect for the victims. This guy will literally sent chills up your spine. The film sadly ends with an exhaustive list of known victims, and as many bruised families.Great cast, especially Zac Efron unjustly cataloged with movies for decerebrated teenage girls, and excellently supported by Lily Collins, Kaya Scodelario, Angela Sarafyan. The atmosphere of the 70s is faithfully transcribed, with a neat photography. At last, it's quite unique to observe a serial killer through the eyes of a woman who truly loved him and was absolutely not aware of his dark side until the media coverage of the murders.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
62,PyroSikTh,A Dramatised Version of The Ted Bundy Tapes,5,4 May 2019,"Extremely Wicked chose an unexpected direction in it's narrative, which is both the film's selling point, but also its biggest flaw. The movie is based on Elizabeth Kloepfer's book about her experiences as Bundy's girlfriend in the 70s, and how the aftermath of his killings affected her emotionally. This is a really interesting direction to take the movie, for sure, but ultimately it still falls into the background behind the Bundy drama itself. For most the movie, Liz is just a crying alcoholic watching the TV out of misplaced guilt. If they had doubled down on this element more, we could've gotten a really interesting perspective on a character left torn and confused for over a decade. She feels guilty for putting him on the authority's radar, and now, if he truly is innocent, she's put him through hell and ruined his life. The uncertainty as to his guilt at the time would've been a really interesting thing to explore on his loved ones, especially Liz. But as I said, instead she's just reduced to a crying, drinking mess.Extremely Wicked attempts to balance Liz's story with that of Bundy's himself. This is the movie pretty much everyone expected, but even here it disappoints, even more so considering the documentary that we've all just seen a few months ago. Berlinger had a fantastic opportunity here to really delve into the disturbed psyche of Ted Bundy. In the freedom of a movie, he could have taken the opportunity to play around with the facts a little, embellish certain events, fictionalise things that were never documented. Bundy is pulled over and arrested, and he escapes custody out the library window, but instead of showing his week missing, hiding out in a cabin in the mountains, we immediately cut to him having been caught. His second escape gets the same treatment. We see his planning and his method, and then cut to two weeks later with news reports in Florida of the Sorority killings. And then he gets pulled over and arrested again. This was the most interesting part of the entire story, and it's glossed over and ignored entirely. Rather than taking the opportunity to flesh it out, fictionalise what transpired, and delve into the real character of Bundy, we cut straight back to documented facts and real-life news reports. In the documentary this was acceptable and expected, but into a dramatic retelling of the events it just ruined the flow and pacing of the movie right at its most crucial and interesting points.The film opens with, honestly something I thought was complete genius. Liz and Bundy meet in a bar, he's depicted as charming, kind, and respectful. He becomes part of the family unit and helps raise Liz's daughter. We get a montage of fictionalised family footage interspersed and narrated by actual news reports of his escapades around Washington and Colorado. This juxtaposition, without any other context, created a real feeling of unease as we watch this kind-hearted family man become painted as a monster in media reports. We also get a fantastic close to the story with Bundy and Liz talking the night before his execution, where he finally gives her, and us, the answers we seek in the most disturbing and gut-wrenching way. The way this handsome, charming man, knowing the pain the truth would cause, gives in and finally gives Liz what she's needed for over a decade. It's as beautiful as it is harrowing. But these are the only two glimpses and embellishments we get to really dig into Bundy as a person. Other than that it's just a dramatic retelling of what was already filmed at the time.So here's what I would have done. I would have either doubled down on Liz's story, and focussed on her grief, guilt, and denial, placing Bundy, the escapes, and the courtroom dramas squarely in the background, or I would've doubled down on Bundy, the drama surrounding him, explored his character and his motivations, as fictionalised and embellished as they may be, to make an entertaining story out of him. Or I would've sought out a mini-series format, spread it over a season of episodes, balanced and thoroughly developed both perspectives and characters, and not felt the need to rush through the most interesting plot points. As it is, Extremely Wicked tries too hard to do too much all at once, leaving everything it tried to do feeling shallow and rushed.Zac Efron was great though. He absolutely did not disappoint. He had Bundy down to a tee. He's as charming and charismatic as Efron always is, perfectly embodying the personality of Bundy we saw on screens, but in those small glimpses of something darker Efron doesn't skip a beat. And this makes the film's decision to not even look at that darker side even more infuriating. The darker Efron we get is so small and quick it's not enough to savour what could've been a really juicy performance. John Malkovich was also great as Edward D. Cowart, the judge who oversaw the televised trial, again tapping into the subtle character layers that made Cowart both authoritarian, but also oddly likeable in those televised sessions. As for James Hetfield? He was barely in it. He appears at the beginning of the movie for not even five minutes, and then he's never seen again. 2/10. Movie ruined.Seriously though, this film is real mixed bag. There's a lot of great moments in it, particularly the beginning and the end, as well as every scene shared between Efron and Malkovich. Even Lily Collins impressed with her descent into alcoholism. But the film tried to have its fingers in all the pies, and the film loses focus as a result. Pacing is all over the place as plot points in the second act are rushed through. Depicting both escapes and re-captures, but having them both resolve within a couple of minutes was doubly infuriating (honestly at the very least I would've just cut the first escape out entirely; it added nothing to the film itself). Ultimate Extremely Wicked is just a dramatic retelling of the Ted Bundy Tapes documentary, and I would recommend that documentary over this movie any day of the week. I give Extremely Wicked an split-down-the-middle 5/10.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
63,socrates4,"Not Bad, But Could Have Been Better",6,10 May 2019,"For years I have been fascinated by the real life story of Ted Bundy and the terrible things he did. Here we get to see it play out in narrative form. While the story is told in a way that is mostly true to life, I believe it fell victim to a couple of big flaws in its making.Firstly, the film is made to entertain. I find entertainment value in watching things that fascinate me, so the true story should be good enough. But it felt like the makers here were going for pure entertainment points across the board and didn't focus as much on the fascinating story as they should have. Additionally, I felt the starts were too big. The film could have been done better with actors were not as well known but still just as good. That would have made it more believable and more shocking than the cast of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. It's still not bad though, despite all that. Recommend to enthusiasts.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
64,funtasticfour,"Interesting, but slow",6,2 September 2020,"I remember a movie about Ted Bundy in the 80's. Of course, I was a kid, and it was scarier then, so I guess I expected more from this. I didn't expect it to be a court case with barely anything else. There was a bit of mystery, but no real excitement. It felt like an overly long episode of any whodunit tv show.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
65,TwistedContent,A Different Serial Killer Movie - In a Good Way,8,3 May 2019,"It is indeed quite on oddball among the serial killer movies, but definitely not a bad one. Joe Berlinger's take on Ted Bundy doesn't rely on graphic violence, killing/stalking action or any of the usual, horror-ish tropes, instead it poses as a court-room & relationship drama. While, for the first half of the movie, it's hard to grasp the exact tone of it, the second half has established a rather sad, uncompromising atmosphere - in a very good way. The pacing is not slow, it's quite engaging and has a smooth flow, at least for drama standards. As for the cinematography - it's crafty & careful, camera work and editing is swift and dynamic. While all is good and decent, the main quality of the movie is the acting - I was surprised by Zac Efron, whom I hadn't really seen in a serious role before. Job well done, Zac, job well done. The supporting cast is also remarkably great & John Malkovich is playing John Malkovich as always. The story is mostly centered on Ted Bundy's relationship with everyone but the victims, love life, his prison time, media side of the whole thing & courtroom happenings.I have to say that, in my opinion, this particular movie about Ted Bundy does not serve much as an introduction to the topic, it's more for those who already know who Theodore Robert Bundy is. I've seen some reviews bashing the movie for not having any on-screen deaths or the usual, anticipated serial killer movie action, so, be warned. This is a different kind of a serial killer flick. My rating: 8/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
66,Lebowskidoo,Worst Boyfriend EVER!,8,4 May 2019,"Zac Efron looks a lot like Bundy, which supplies much of the creep-factor., and he basically nails the part acting wise too.The movie has its moments, but events are sped through or avoided entirely. This is because it's more from the point of view of Bundy's girlfriend, Liz, and how it affected her life.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
67,Mike_Devine,"Extremely lackluster, shockingly dull and tired",4,5 May 2019,"Since the introduction of cameras in the courtroom, only a handful of trials have managed to captivate society's attention to the point where those on trial became - in a sense - celebrities, if they weren't already at that status. The trial of Ted Bundy in 1979 Florida marked the beginning of this trend, as director Joe Berlinger brought to life in 'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.'But the film itself more or less feeds into the infatuation that many had with Bundy - a monster who is correctly characterized by this film's title. Zac Efron goes for the gold in his portrayal of the serial rapist and killer, and there's no denying that he has come a long way as an actor since he came onto the scene. But the likability factor given to Bundy here is not drowned out by the unspeakable things he did to 30+ women. Even if this is more or less a reflection of what the public saw in the 1970s and 80s, it's really unfortunate.The fact is, 'Vile' mostly focuses on the relationship between Bundy and his longtime girlfriend, Liz Kendall (Lily Collins), and how she cannot remove him from her life even long after his true identity is revealed. It's more of a psychological thriller than anything else - how a man so charming on the outside can be so evil on the inside, and the influence he has over people, whether it's Kendall or his eventual wife, Carole Anne Boone (Kaya Scodelario). In terms of other acting performances, Collins really is not convincing in her role. Yes, she's good at playing innocent, bruised characters, but it comes off pretty forced here.One good aspect of 'Vile' is it pays tribute to all of the known women who were Bundy's victims. Everything else about the film is extremely lackluster, shockingly dull and tired.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Another cash in on the star of the killer which has never been higher strangely this is a complete jumble of so many aspects of the story and a million different perspectives that all blur and complicate each other. There's too many plot lines that aren't touched upon or go nowhere and the characters were all bland quite frankly, Effron does his best but as the credits roll and real footage is played you see his shortcomings and Collins' part is minor in a grand scale.

69,SnobReviews,"""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile"" should be better.",6,6 May 2019,"""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile"" has the right approach to be a great and interesting biopic, but the film altogether falls apart in sequences.In this thriller based on a true story, a young woman tips information to authorities about her boyfriend; serial killer Ted Bundy.Thankfully Zac Efron (""The Greatest Showman"") gives us a killer (pun intended) and transcendant performance, which makes it a career best for the actor. The remainder of the cast are all great, but it's the story that's the issue here. It's not concrete and can be messy.

70,jamiedarlow-37510,A risk-taking but underwhelming drama,5,31 March 2020,"A thoughtful drama about the relationship between notorious serial killer Ted Bundy and the people around him, that would perhaps be better on further viewing. Zac Efron plays Bundy really well; incorporating the charm that many people around him fall victim to and the underlying insidious nature of him. The film is edited really well by Josh Schaeffer (Molly's Game), inter splicing real life news footage and still photographs with the dramatisation. Bundy's killings have been captured many times before through film medium and, as the title conveys, were truly horrific and incomprehensibly evil. The smart move by the filmmakers here is to spend more time on other details rather than exploiting the gory ones. The reason it's a bit of a lower rating for me is that there was this really uncomfortable air surrounding the fact that it's essentially a love story being told between two people and one of them is a real life killer, which I just didn't enjoy watching. In a way, it's successful it makes you feel that way considering it's subject matter which is supposed to be unnerving and it is based on the book The Phantom Prince by Liz Kendall who was in this relationship which I think will be worth a read; I was just not sure the romantic moments worked fully in the context of the film with the audience having prior knowledge of this man's acts. Two stand out roles for me were Jim Parsons (really cool to see him in a more dramatic role!) and Lily Collins as Liz; a lot of the film is told from her perspective and those sequences really work! Overall, a bit underwhelming mainly due to not delving enough into the psychological aspect but not bad and it's a breath of fresh air to see a film about a serial killer with hardly any violence on screen","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
71,Med-Jasta,Serial killer movie without the serial killing,10,14 May 2020,"I am pretty knowledgeable about Ted Bundy. I've read a book about him. And I'm from his home town. I live 5 minutes away from his childhood home. My dad went to high school with him and my mom worked with his mom.This movie was really good. Their approach was interesting and nice to see. Now, we know about everything that Bundy did and we can't look at him without seeing the monster. But for a long time people believed he was innocent. I think it's important to show how convincing he was. Psychopaths like him spend a lot of time watching and mimicking human behavior to manipulate people. It's important to see this historical event in the eyes of the people who lived it, because Bundy was that good at manipulation.Watching interviews now knowing what I know I almost feel for him. And that's exactly what he's trying to do, he's an actor. His most brutal crime isn't so much the murders but the apathy he has for all human life. Again it's important to remind us the power of getting sympathy that he had. So much of history is seen as pointless by the distorted and hindsight of knowing their outcome, but you have to look at things from the point of view from the time. With Vietnam we were trying to stop the spread of a dictatorship like with the successful Korean war. They didn't go into it with the intent of needlessly killing thousands of young Americans. But since the war was lost and that was the outcome, it feels like that was the goal now.I liked that we were in Liz's point of view, we didn't see Ted do anything bad until the very end, good directing choice. We didn't see it until she saw it. And even then Bundy doesn't slip and show his true self, he keeps it hidden. The only people that ever saw it are dead. Except for the only living witness, the name of the book I read by the way.Zac Efron was great. When I heard he was cast I was on board because he's good and I thought he had the essence of Bundy's look by being really good looking. But holy crap did he look like him! I don't know what they did with makeup but whatever it did was scary.He captured his arrogance and ego well. That's really what did Bundy in. He thought he was smarter than everyone else and that no one could see past his lies.Haley Joel Osmond was great. I hope we see more of him. And everybody did a great job. We didn't need to see the murders or anything because the movie wasn't about that. It was her story.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I mean you can watch other documentaries and/or read books about that. Instead I think you see Bundy from the perspective of his girlfriend, Liz. You see how manipulative and convincing he is towards her. How at the time it was hard for her to wrap her head around this charismatic man who was nothing but kind and good to her, but he was in fact a vicious serial killer. From her perspective, there wasn't any sign of what he was.He was all about denial, and full of himself. He was convinced he could finesse his way out of everything. He was a narcissist. He fooled Liz and a few other people, but I think in the end, he also fooled himself. There's nothing new here, but it's an interesting look at his personality.All the actors played their parts well. I don't think I've ever seen Efron in anything before. He did a good job here. I recommend for people that like true crime stories. Finally, let's not forget the victims.

We're only shown Bundy's public persona, so it's impossibile to watch the movie with feelings like horror or disgust for his double personality and his crimes. We just see a charming character that ""probably"" has something to hide. The contrast between his crimes and his happy family life would have been a punch in the gut, but is nowhere to be found. Other flaws include some bad dialogues and horribly staged dramatic scenes.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
77,pkpera,Usual Netflix product,5,10 May 2019,"I really don't see what else except making money was point of this movie making.
Big part was showing how Ted attracts young females - on street, in courtroom, parking place ... And no reason to believe that it was inaccurate. Actually, that was condition to be 'successful' in his vile activity.
Then, all what went in first 80-90 minutes was playing with viewer - is he guilty or not ? Police work was presented very marginally in that purpose. Sure, there are more attractive things to show: after several 'no touching' warnings came sexual act in visitor's room in jail - that's what people needs - shock, graphic sex, scandalism .(sorry for my word construction - scandal was not really good word :-) ) .
All this seemed pretty rushed on top of all it. I guess that big part of budget went to John Malkovich and Jim Parsons. And that they spent max couple days on shooting.
At the end we seen some textual info about 'real' count of his victims. With comment that it is probably more. Well, I rather think that it was less - our 'hero', Ted, when was close to death sentence still was true himself - wanting attention and some kind of fame.
Anyway, I hope that there was some positive effect in all it, and that especially younger female viewers learned something from. After all, human specie should be smarter than fishes.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
78,movieman6-413-929510,Biography of Ted Bundy is his last trial,6,5 May 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is a new film adaptation of a biography. The film is directed by Joe Berlinger, the director of Intent to Destroy. The film is about the biography of the American serial killer Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy is played in the film by Zac Efron.The film is set in the 70s, where Liz Kendall (Lily Collins) starts a relationship with the charming Ted Bundy (Zac Efron). If Ted Bundy is later suspected of murder, he eventually ends up in jail.
Thus the state starts a court case against him in the hope of proving him with enough evidence that he is guilty. Like his partner, Liz also gets attention, but Liz refuses to believe the truth about his crime and continues to deny everything.A biography or documentary about Ted Bundy has been made before, but with this new version they play into Ted Bundy's life and how his relationship with Liz Kendall came about and how it went. In addition, the film responds more to the case against Ted Bundy. They did this in a neat way without showing Ted Bundy's dark actions with details. The film also sets Ted Bundy without the viewer being sure whether he is really guilty. However, if you are familiar with who Ted Bundy was and what he did, you know what he really was and did.The film also shows how well Ted Bundy managed to play with words to get under certain things and how easily people believed him. The film also shows that love makes blind, with the hold of Liz Kendall, who despite some evidence and clues stubbornly continued to deny that Ted Bundy was guilty.The acting is done well in the film. Zac Efron appears credible as Ted Bundy. There are many scenes in which he appears innocent, but later you also see scenes in which he conceals a dark secret and devises dark plans. He knows how to act especially well by making good use of his eyes and his further postures. Lilly Collins also comes across as someone who stubbornly denies the truth.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
79,aminifatimaaa,extremely mild,6,2 June 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is everything but its title would suggest. While the film certainly benefits from Zac Efron's chilling yet charismatic rendition of the most notorious serial killer to have ever lived, the story as a whole is rather stale, generic & underwhelming that fails to truly engage, unnerve & alarm us.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
80,SamJamie,Zacs best performance yet.,8,12 January 2020,"I've seen Zac Efron in lots of films, from High School Musical to the abundance of slapstick comedies he tends to accept i.e Bad Neighbours, Bad Grandpa, Baywatch and the list goes on. This is the first time I really feel like he's gave his all into a performance, he takes on the role of Bundy marvellously well but still makes the role his own. I went into the film relatively blind, it's a slow burning, part court drama part mockumentary, with real footage from the real case including images of the real Ted Bundy. Another great performance is from Lily James as Liz - the grieving girlfriend. I would recommend the film to anyone with an interest in real-life murder cases as the film is respectful and barely shows any gratuitous violence or gore - it's a good film!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
81,kikiboo_8,Ambiguous but good,6,3 May 2020,"I'm not sure why did the people in these reviews feel bad for him or believed that he was innocent. He looks completely devoid of any empathy or remorse for all of his crimes. I highly doubt that he ever loved anyone, I think he's extremely manipulative and impulsive and that he thinks he's unbeatable and basically godlike - most intelligent, powerful, charming... I was a bit surprised when he refused the plea which would have saved his life, and it wasn't out of any remorse, but merely because he wanted to be in charge, in control of the situation and he thought he'd be able to manipulate absolutely everyone into believing him and letting him off the hook. It didn't quite work out that way.
I'm somewhat dissappointed because we didn't get to see the execution itself or the days before it, when he was trembling, sobbing and praying...
I'm not sure if this cold, manipulative persona is all that there is to him. It's pretty sad to see that and it's a shame such disorders exist. This movie gave me zero reason to empathize with him and it didn't give me any reason at all to see anything reedemable about him. Maybe it's realistic there, maybe not, either way I find that disappointing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

83,ivanmessimilos,Ok movie,5,22 September 2021,"I was not thrilled by the film. While this is by no means a bad film especially because of the good acting, I have to admit that I didn't like the perspective from which the story is told. You know who it is and who exactly Ted Bundy is so that's why the film didn't surprise me at all, and that's a bad thing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
84,meathookcinema,"Ted, Just Admit It!",9,17 May 2019,"When I first saw a still of Zac Efron as Ted Bundy I thought that whoever came up with that casting choice deserved an award. Not only do Ted and Zac look very similar but there was a sweet irony that the star of High School Musical had progressed to portraying one of America's most notorious serial killers.I first learnt of Bundy's crimes after watching the brilliant 1986 TV movie The Deliberate Stranger which was released on two video tapes here in the UK soon after it aired in the US. This production showed that one thing is vital to any depiction of Bundy and his history- casting. Bundy was as all American as apple pie. He also goes against the stereotype of the type of person most think that a serial killer is. He was educated, handsome and extremely charismatic. Mark Harmon was cast as Bundy and this choice was brilliant. Harmon had been the star of many TV shows (most famously St Elsewhere) and always as the dashing leading man. Harmon was using these very qualities to depict a man who used the same attributes for his own evil ends. It's also worth noting that the man (Harmon not Bundy) who was voted The Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine in 1986 (the year that Deliberate Stranger was made and aired) should be portraying the serial killer who had multiple female fans who decided that his good looks and sex appeal outweighed his alleged crimes.Since this TV movie there have been other movies regarding Bundy but none have been especially noteworthy in terms of either casting or content (it's a shame that the adaptation of Ann Rule's amazing book 'The Stranger Beside Me' wasn't either cast or made better. It's still, in my opinion, the definitive book on Ted).So when it was announced that Zac Efron was to star in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Wicked and Vile as Bundy I just wished that the whole film would live up to the genius casting decision. I resubscribed to Netflix in time for the premiere date of 3rd May only to learn that whilst it's being shown on Netflix, that isn't the case in the UK. The movie could either be seen on Sky Movies (no thanks, Rupert Murdoch) or at one of the few cinemas which were showing it.This, however proved to be a blessing in disguise. The film looks gorgeous and deserves to be seen on the big screen. In fact, there is plenty to like about this movie.I had never heard of the 1981 book The Phantom Prince by Elizabeth Kendall which was written by Bundy's fiancee about their life together. This book is still out of print- a golden opportunity for a reprint to coincide with this movie missed. Although there is an online copy available to read (Google is your friend...)The fact that this story is from the perspective of Bundy's partner proves to be a major strength here. This isn't a straightforward account of Bundy's crimes resplendent with depictions of them but rather what happened as seen through someone else's eyes. This is a novel take on one of America's most infamous serial killers and because of this feels fresh and original. Bundy is depicted as charming, charismatic and utterly human. It also means that when Bundy's partner (and the audience) hears the details of Bundy's crimes they appear even more shocking and appalling.Zac Efron's depiction of Ted is rightly garnering plaudits from critics. His performance is multi-facted, nuanced and utterly brilliant. He portrays Bundy as not only as the All-American success story but also as a human being wearing a mask or shell. Check out the scene in the courtroom as Bundy is rising to his feet to hear the first of many verdicts- the trumped up show of confidence is shown to be a facade by Efron as we see that this event is so traumatic that it has actually mined down into the darkest and genuine core of Bundy. The mask has slipped as Bundy is about to discover his fate. Also, check out the scene where Bundy has just had sex with his 'girlfriend' after Liz leaves him. Momentarily we see the revulsion on Ted's face when he has just shot his load and realises with whom. We see more evidence that Bundy doesn't love Carole at all and is just using her so she will extol his innocence to the outside world. His skills of manipulation and control have been brought to the fore and we get to see behind the huge smile and good looks. We also then see the shell come back into place as Bundy starts to recompose himself and falsely reiterate his 'love' for her. She's important to him but not for the reasons she thinks.But this isn't just a one performance film. The rest of the cast are great with Metallica's James Hetfield and The Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons also shining. John Malkovich is as ever brilliant in his role as Judge Cowart presiding over the Florida trial. He makes parallels against the fact that himself and Bundy have a great deal in common with Ted being a law student whilst he was committing his heinous crimes. It is one of the most poignant scenes in the film in which the judge mentions that Bundy had decided to use his considerable judicial skills for evil rather than good and that if he had decided to go down a better path Cowart would have loved to have witnessed these skills used in his courtroom.The film also brilliantly examines the celebrity status given to serial killers. Bundy's trial is the first in which cameras are allowed in the courtroom and so the trial will be transmitted to millions of homes across America. Bundy knows this and fully exploits it whilst using his charm to bewitch and enchant his audience. He puts on a dazzling performance, makes sure that he peers directly into the camera at multiple occasions to establish a bond with his viewers and even on one occasion, proposes to Carole live on air. It's showbiz, baby.The film also examines the phenomena of hybristophilia- the term used to describe the sexual attraction to serial killers. Ted always has a strong female groupie contingent in the courtroom. This will be multiplied many times over with the cameras catching the carefully cultivated performance and sexual charisma Bundy is having broadcast across America and indeed the world.Whilst the film isn't a straightforward chronological timeline of Bundy and his crimes we do get to hear about his alleged crimes throughout the film, especially the Chi Omega sorority house that he invades before going on a one-man massacre of several of it's occupants. But even with the details of these crimes being peppered throughout the movie, the ending in which Liz confronts Bundy is still a shock to behold. She has been given a photograph of one of Ted's victims by a detective that has brought home the true evil of his crimes. We get to see the picture of a naked female corpse which has had it's head removed. Bundy still protests his innocence as he has throughout the duration of the film up until this point. He even offers the flimsy explanation that wild animals could have inflicted that on the cadaver. Liz demands to know the truth. We then get to see Bundy take off his mask altogether. He argues that he couldn't tell her the truth as the phone they are using to communicate with each other is probably tapped by the authorities. He then calmly puts down the receiver he is speaking into and writes the word 'HACKSAW' onto the plastic screen that separates them. It's an immensely powerful scene as it shows that Bundy is 'Bad' and not 'Mad' and that he knew exactly what he was doing and that there are no multiple personalities at play here.This scene is also one of the movie's major aces up it's sleeve. Up until that point we had never seen Bundy commit one of the crimes he has been accused of or even admit culpability for them. Here he has. The whole celebrity status awarded to serial killers and that grimy culture has now been placed under the spotlight. We have been watching High School Musical's Zac Efron charm his way into our hearts throughout the film. And we have been duped. For all of his escape antics, winks to camera and good looks, he is a monster and knew exactly what he was doing. Just as Bundy charmed his way into Liz and Carole's lives for his own ends, he has done to same to us. The film has also done this without glamorising Bundy and his deeds or trying to substantiate them. The audience was kept in the dark regarding his crimes just like Liz was, which is fitting as this story is told from her perspective and not Ted's. We get to see the full impact of the full truth and how it must have felt for Liz.It also brings up the question of if he truly loved her or if that was just a well manicured and cultivated lie. The film also begs the question that what we have seen during the movie might not be the whole truth. One early scene involves Bundy being next to Liz in bed under the covers using a torch. When she wakes up startled he gives the explanation of reading a law book ahead of an exam and not wanting to wake her up. We later see the same scene replayed but the audience is awarded the knowledge of what Ted was actually doing- looking at Liz's dormant sleeping body under the sheets. Was he aroused by her unmoving form? Was he aroused by his victims in the same way? Was he planning to do away with Liz?The main question I had after seeing this film was whether Efron is eligible to be nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal with this film being a Netflix production. Now just imagine that- Ted Bundy winning an Academy Award.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
85,bpilato-08111,Very interesting take on Ted,7,9 May 2019,"If you knew nothing about how this story ends I can see how the audience would be going back and forth about the character the entire movie. I really enjoyed this movie, gave you a different perspective on who Ted was and how his personality was. Nothing over the top for gore or blood. Great thriller and thought Zac did a wonderful portrayal.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
86,Olicosmic,A pleasant surprise,8,21 May 2019,"After seeing and hearing about their being a Ted Bundy film all over social media, I was a bit iffy on the whole thing. A movie whom is solely about a monstrous serial killer and rapist, as well as Zac Efron of all people to play as the killer? That just sounded like a disaster and a half. I was scared that the movie would go overboard with how terrible the guy was instead try to tell a focused story, and I wasn't sure that Zac Efron would've been a great casting choice. Not to say he's a bad actor by any means, but Ted Bundy was one of the last people I thought of when I saw Zac Efron. Thankfully, neither of these worries came true, as this is one of the most shocking films of the year for me. Zac Efron was absolutely amazing as Ted Bundy and completely blew my expectations out of the water, as he was damn near perfect in his role. Everyone else did a pretty great job in their roles as well, and if you mix that with the overall fantastic setups, and what you've got is a movie that really feels alive. The story, itself, is pretty great, too, as it goes in depth into what Ted Bundy was like and how everything wraps itself up, and the way they did in this film was very well done. However, this is also where the problems start to arise. The story, despite it being good, isn't paced all that well, as there are some parts where it can go slow and then fast. A few scenes can feel like they end a bit too quickly, which can make it annoying when you're invested in that scene. This doesn't happen a lot, but it's still worth noting. The other problem I have is that the overall tone of this film can be a bit wonky. It's never really bad on its own, but the film can kind of feel unfocused at times. It's all still very concise, but I feel like this movie could've been an amazing classic if it had a better focus. Other than these flaws, this is still a film that is much, much, much better than I thought it would be. It's nothing that's going to light the world on fire, but with the amazing performances and well written story, this film is great in its own right, which is why I recommend anyone who wants to know more about the campus killer, as well as those who just want an entertaining and involving bio-pic to check this out. This was a pleasant surprise for me, and I'm sure it'll be the same for those who haven't seen it yet, as well.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
87,bastos,A strange angle to tackle such a powerful story,6,3 June 2021,"You only need to read the Wikipedia page on Ted Bundy to understand what an incredible and unbelievable story the man had. I always wondered why there weren't any mainstream movies on the subject as that story seemed ripe for a big screen adaptation. It even has the potential to be adapted in several different ways, like a monster movie focusing on the murders themselves, a procedural focusing on the investigation, a courtroom drama focusing on the trials. What I wasn't expecting was a love story focusing on the relationship between Bundy and Liz Kendall, his longtime girlfriend. It focuses more on the manipulative side of his personality and if you don't know the story it even tricks you into rooting for Bundy, which I can see was the intention of the director, but I wonder if this was the correct approach to tackle such a powerful story. It's even more baffling as it's directed by the man who created one of the best docs on the subject. The casting is very good, as Zac Efron brings that charm and charisma that Bundy possessed and used with such unfortunate efficiency. The movie feels a bit flat, though, and as such like a wasted opportunity to finally tell this story. Just compare it to Zodiac, a story with much less appeal, but done so much better. I did find the final scene between Efron and Collins very effective giving you a taste of what could have been, but, alas, the rest of the movie wasn't as captivating. Still this is such a bizarre story and the movie is well made, which is enough to earn a recommendation.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

89,carlos37andre,The only issue I have with the movie is that I think they didn't make me hate the guy enough,8,8 June 2019,"Don't get me wrong, I'm saying in as a narrative. We pass the majority of the movie seeing things by Liz's and Ted's ""perspective"", and since this was my first real contact with Ted's story, I felt that I finish the movie not hating the dude enough. I mean, we all know HE DID those things, and what a monster he was, but at almost any moment in the movie we see that, it's almost like it was just a dream, and as he says during the movie, ""everything is gonna be ok"" at some point. And I feel, this is mainly because of the perspective we are giving throughout it. We as a audience we know what happened, however, as a narrative, a film, it never really tells us fully that he did it, besides one word written in a glass, and the notes at the end.Besides that, the whole movie is breath taking, I feel that they manage to tie up the story (from their perspective) really well. Efron is a freaking star here. The dude is one of the most underrated actor out there. He's slowly going from genre to genre, and crushing it every time. Lily Collins is also unbelievable, throughout the whole thing we can feel her pain, we actually believe we are watching a real thing, I was truly without thinking it was a movie for like 40 straight minutes. I believe this is the highest praise any actor can ever receive.Looking at it from other eyes, they went for a approach (you might say) of showing in a certain way what he's victims felt, how convinced he was, how he could turn people to his side. And indeed, if you go (idk if this is possible) to the movie not knowing ANYTHING, you may actually believe him, and root for him to get justice and be release for most of the movie. It's something to pay attention too.Overall, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is a great movie, well made, and gives a different approach to a serial killer's story.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
90,GomezAddams666,"Extremely Weak, Shockingly Stupid and Idiotic.",1,19 December 2019,"Let me start by saying I knew from the opening minutes of the movie what they were trying to do, what kind of story they were trying to tell. But I also knew from the very same moment they were probably going to fail miserably at it, and they did.This is the story of a single mother, who refuses to believe the love of her life, the man that was there when she needed him could potentially be a serial killer. This is not a bad plot, and it could have actually worked if her perfect boyfriend was not Ted Bundy. And I realize that the story is told from her perspective, but there is no suspension of disbelief when it comes to one of America's more prolific serial killers.The film also tries its best to make the audience see Bundy from her eyes, but it no easy task for the reasons I have already mentioned. This formula has worked before in other movies, but it did not work in this one, and I think that casting Zac Efron in it was a mistake, because thou he is charming, he cannot act to save his life, he tries to fool the audience with his charisma but the audience is not that stupid nor are they naive.If this had been a movie that told or even showed his crimes it might have given resonance to what Ted Bundy's case highlighted, that the evil doers are not hiding in shadows, but they walk among us in broad day light. Yet this film wanted the audience to sympathize with Bundy and his extremely naïve girlfriend, and it failed astoundingly at that.I rate this mess a 4/10. It had a great supporting cast, and it was filmed well in a technical level. But story wise it was extremely weak, shockingly stupid and idiotic.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
91,tfminfl,"Hi, I'm Ted...",10,11 May 2019,"332. Extremely Wicked Shockingly Evil And Vile. The Ted Bundy tale told from a very different angle. The story picks up after the majority of Ted's murder spree, and his imprisonment for trying to snatch a woman from the mall pretending to be a cop, all told by Liz Kendall, Ted's girlfriend through it all, and her willingness to believe that he was innocent, and it was all a case of misidentification. I thought Zac Efron pulled off Ted's nice guy persona pretty well. We only really get a short glimpse at evil Ted in a pretty creepy scene towards the end where Liz begs Ted to finally tell her the truth. Worth the watch!

92,Bertaut,"An interesting approach to the story, but the tone is poorly managed",6,21 July 2019,"Directed by Joe Berlinger immediately after completing work on Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019), Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is worth seeing for Zac Efron's performance, but is a strangely muted affair, neither ghoulish warts-and-all carnage nor restrained psychological treatise. Telling the story of Ted Bundy from the perspective of a woman who was oblivious to his true nature is an interesting narrative choice, and had Berlinger stuck to this format, it could have made for a fascinating film. However, the longer it goes on, the more it seems to revel in Bundy's flamboyance, and what begins as an intriguing insider's look at living with a killer soon shifts into an underwhelming courtroom drama, only returning to its original tone in the final (fictional) scene.The film begins in 1969, the night Bundy (Efron) and nm10616856 (Lily Collins) first met in a Seattle bar. As a single mother with a low-paying job, she is surprised to find this charismatic, handsome, and intelligent law student so interested in her, but interested he is, with the duo quickly falling in love. However, six years later, when he is stopped in Utah for a minor traffic violation, the police find ropes, handcuffs, ski mask, leather gloves, and a crowbar in his car, and he is subsequently charged with and convicted of attempted kidnapping. He vehemently protests his innocence to Liz, and although concerned, she accepts his explanations. However, as police departments across California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Florida start to connect him to a string of recent murders, it becomes harder and harder for Liz to deny there's more to her boyfriend than she ever imagined.Very loosely based on Liz Kloepfer's memoir, The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy (1981), Extremely Wicked was written by Michael Werwie. The hook for the original script was that the audience is unaware the character is Bundy; the film was written as a supposedly fictional story of a young couple whose life is shattered when he is accused of multiple murders, with his real identity only coming as a final act twist. As Berlinger was completing The Ted Bundy Tapes, the script was offered to him, and although he found the twist distasteful, he loved the idea of looking at the Bundy story through the eyes of someone who thought him to be innocent.One of the biggest appeals of the movie, of course, is the unexpected casting of Zac Efron as Bundy (Efron also serves as executive producer). And it has to be said, he's excellent. Although he doesn't really look like Bundy, he has the mannerisms down to a tee. Especially if you watch the film after the docu-series, you'll really pick up on the depth of the performance; Efron's every movement and gesture, the way he smiles, the way he stands, the tone of his voice, everything is perfect. Of course, Bundy's good looks and charisma were his most formidable weapons as he proved that evil could fester under an attractive façade, and this gives Efron room to manoeuvre, playing every scene in such a way that the subtext is always apparent, although never allowing Bundy's mask to slip. Indeed, it's the absence of any obvious monstrousness in the performance which is so unnerving.One of the film's most notable components is that, apart from one brief scene near the end, there is no depiction of violence. As Liz's story, the idea is to present Bundy not with the 20/20 hindsight of history, but with the same degree of ambiguity with which she would have viewed him. It's an interesting way into the story and seems a genuine attempt to do something more than simply reproduce the salacious details of the crimes. Of course, if you're making a film about a serial killer which doesn't feature much in the way of serial killing, you're going to need to fill it with something, and in this sense, Berlinger focuses, at least in the first half, on how a killer can lie and manipulate, coming across as completely normal to all who know him. Berlinger has said that the film is about the mechanics of how a person can be ""seduced by someone capable of evil"", and it was his intention that the audience actually like Bundy, as he wanted them to feel disgust with themselves - just like Liz, he wanted them to be seduced by evil.However, as admirable as this approach is, the film has a lot of problems. For one thing, because it depicts Bundy not as we now know him but as his contemporaries saw him, it means we only see the performative side, never the monstrous underbelly. Sure, this means that the film avoids exploitation, but in doing so, it could be accused of sanitisation (to be fair, this is something of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario - show the murders and you're exploiting real-life suffering, don't show them and you're hiding the true nature of his crimes). And granted, portraying him as a possibly innocent man is part of the attempt to explain how Liz could be duped, but all the good intentions in the world don't change the fact that the film's Bundy is a lovable rogue who bites his thumb at the system, not a murderer, a man who raped and butchered a 12-year-old child, and who decapitated multiple women and had sex with their corpses.I understand that Berlinger wants to depict how Liz could have been blinded by devotion to a man that she thought (correctly, as it turned out) was too good to be true. But the problem is that she herself is never characterised enough for this to work; everything we learn about her is predicated on her relationship with him - there's nothing about her life prior to meeting him, and what we learn about her life after he was convicted is primarily fictional. Additionally, the focus shift halfway through as the film transitions from Liz as subjective focaliser to a more objectively focalised courtroom drama makes very little tonal sense. It's almost as if Berlinger loses interest in Liz when the sensationalist trial begins. This transition reduces Liz to a cycle of watching the trial, crying, doubting his guilt, drinking, watching the trial, crying etc, as she's effectively stripped of what little agency she had in the first half.Another problem is that we learn nothing new about Bundy himself; there's nothing about his childhood, for example, or how he got away with the murders for so long, whether he really loved Liz, or if he genuinely lacked the ability to feel empathy. Along the same lines, we learn nothing whatsoever about the victims. This was also a problem in the docu-series, but it's far more pronounced here, and because of this, the decision to put the names of his known victims on screen at the end of film is unearned, crass, and meaningless.The film also makes some strange changes to documented fact, many of which seem designed to make Bundy more sympathetic. For example, there's no mention of the fact that he tried multiple times to pressure Liz into rough sex, particularly choking. Another scene sees him forcibly restrained in his cell whilst a dentist takes impressions of his teeth. In reality, the impressions were taken in a dentist chair, and Bundy quite happily allowed the dentist to work. The film also shows him continuing to try to contact Liz throughout his incarceration. In reality, however, he lost contact with her in the early 80s, and there's no evidence he tried to find her.Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is by no means a bad film. But it could have been so much better. The shift from subjective focalisation to court-room drama makes very little sense, and fundamentally undermines what Berlinger seems to have been trying to do. The film initially looks at how evil can hide in plain view, creeping into our lives under the guise of normalcy, but Berlinger allows this theme to recede into the background as he hands the narrative over to Bundy. If this was supposed to be Liz's story, Berlinger takes his eye off the ball badly. And although the film certainly doesn't sympathise with Bundy, and although the decision not to show any of the murders is commendable, the fact is that, yet again, Ted Bundy has become very much the star of his own show.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
93,Lewis_Heather787,A story of this nature deserves better!!!!!,4,3 May 2019,"This is such a disappointment and a bummer for multiple reasons, that if were better, could have elevated this film so much more to the level that this story deserves and needs. This sort of story has award season written all over it, however certain key decisions have led to it ending up the way it did, so much potential for a great film.What's more shocking is the fact that this film is directed by Joe Berlinger, the same man who created, directed and wrote the documentary mini-series "" Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bunny Tapes"". Which is a fantastic mini-series that was released earlier in the year, showing an intimate look at Ted Bunny himself through recordings of his whilst he was in prison in Florida. Its only 4 episodes long but it is extremely fascinating and a wonderfully put together show that I can't highly recommend enough.However this is what I cant understand, why, Joe Berlinger thought he needed to make a film about Ted Bunny as well?? Especially because I cant get my head around the fact that the mini-series and this film were made by the same person........They are miles apart in terms of quality!!!Lets start of with the best positives I can give the film.....erm.........its not the worst thing in the world, its watchable however not very memorable. The directing from Berlinger is fine throughout and has got a solid-ish story behind his film. The cast for the most part are fine they do nothing wrong, however again they don't do much right. Lily Collins was good in her role and I would say she is the best part of the film and the more interesting story to follow, which is worrying, but she definitely shows an arc to her character over the years. Interested as to see what she does next.Now instead of just bashing a film and spouting hate, I'll try to make my points clear and fair as to why I really didn't like the film. Firstly and probably the biggest elephant in the room..........Zac Efron. Now I have no view on Efron as an actor, I will admit I haven't seen much of his work, unfortunately this doesn't make me want to search it out. Let me get this straight I don't think Zac Efron was terrible, I actually think he did the best he could with what he had. However I think he was miss cast completely!! Now I know this term is bonded around a lot and can see very elite-ist, but a more seasoned/method actor would have been much better. Someone of the level of a ""Christian Bale"" not him specifically but someone of that nature could have really delve in deep and transformed into Bundy. For me Efron was just playing himself.The other big problem is the story......its a little all over the place as skips certain moments in time, its as if the film itself doesn't really know what its narrative is or what its focusing on. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on the murders specifically, there sort of in the background. Instead it tries to focus on the relationship the of Ted and Liz......which......erm.......is quite boring. The films tries to cram in as much as it can without really full realising or developing one story line to a fitting conclusion.Overall its 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10, its just not that good....its fine maybe a film to put on in the background. However this film had such potential to be a great film, with a better director, better lead actor and a more compelling narrative that covers all the bases. With that it could have been to a better standard and maybe even Oscar gold. Its even more surprising and shocking considering how good the mini-series was from Joe Berlinger, such a shame!P.S - For me someone like David Fincher would have been more appropriate to direct. Also just cause you look like someone doesn't mean you can portray them on film, Efron a little out of his depth.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
94,d_m_s,Felt like it wanted to be Zodiac meets Monster but was not as good as either,5,8 May 2019,"I give this a 5 because it was entertaining enough to keep me occupied without getting bored.However, as serial killer biopics go, it's pretty poor. And no, that's not because it didn't show any killings. I was glad it didn't because I didn't want to see them.The reason why I thought this film was poor was because it didn't actually give you any insight into anything really. If you know nothing of Bundy then you will learn little from this film and may even leave feeling confused.Why/how did he choose his victims? Why was he killing? What was his childhood like? Why did he seemingly want to have an actual family? Was it a ruse or was there a part of him that genuinely wanted it? How did he charm everyone? Efron's portrayal of him wasn't that charming, I can't see how people got so easily taken in.The lack of insight into his character really let this film down. At times I felt like this film was trying to be like Monster (and the use of 'Crimson & Clover' on the soundtrack seemed odd, as it was so significantly used in Monster). Monster is a superior film though because Theron is so convincing in the role and it really delves into her character. I almost felt like I was watching a documentary. As noted in the tile, it also felt like this film was trying to be like Zodiac, mainly because it had a very similar look and feel. It failed there too, not least because it lacks the investigation and the enigma.So not only does this film fail to give us an insight into Bundy but it also fails to give us an insight into other important characters too, like his girlfriend. When did she decide to give his name to the police? What made her do it? How did she feel? How did she feel after he was arrested? Was she still in love with him? Was she ashamed? Disgusted? We don't know. It keeps cutting back to her and she's a major part of the story but again we don't get told much.This film also has no POV. Whose POV is it supposed to be from?I left this film with no more insight into Bundy than I had before (and I didn't have much then, I just had an awareness of him from a cultural point of view and from a documentary I watched maybe 20 years ago, from which all I can remember is one of the horrific killings).","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
95,Jester222,Zac did excellent job with a lack luster screenplay.,6,4 May 2019,"This had so much potential.
Guv n the title you'd expect at least some mention of the acts this sicko did........it almost went out its way to make you sympathetic to Ted. If people aren't aware of the facts and watch this I'm not sure what they'll take away.Seeing Sheldon from Big Bang Theory totally took me out of the film......James Hetfield actually surprised me and did really well with his small role, great job.It's a good watch though, mostly told from his girlfriend's point of view......(incredibly naive).I just expected more. Although seeing his murders would be a bit disrespectful......it needed something ......to justify the film title at least........
Great costumes, set design etc for 70's...... But a missed opportunity.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
96,RhapsodyReviews,Great Story About One of the World's Worst Killers.,7,16 October 2019,"Review:
'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile' is an American biographical-thriller film directed by Joe Berlinger. Who doesn't love a good serial killer flick that's based on a true story? This movie did a great job telling a true story, as well as keeping the audience engaged with what is being told. That's harder to do than a lot of us movie lovers realise.
The whole cast did a good job and taking all these true people and bringing them on the big screen. Lily Collins as Liz Kendall was amazing. You see her losing hope more and more throughout the movie and see her eventually know the truth of the monster she was with. She makes you feel sorry for what she was put through, even though there weren't 100% truthful in telling the whole story. Zac Efron shined in this film, I have always seen him as just another entertaining comedic actor after his High School Musical days, but this performance will elevate him to new heights.
This movie is different then others, because it doesn't focus on the murders themselves as much as it does the trials and the relationship between Ted Bundy and Liz Kendall. I enjoyed that aspect of it, but the film almost let too short. They didn't have enough time to get the audience all the information they need to understand what happened in the actual murders and what life was like for Ted in prison. That might not be a problem for most, but I was interested in learning more about that.
Overall, this movie had a story that I really enjoyed. I just wish they were able to tell more of it, as well as making it tighter. If you're crime junkie like me and like learning about killers, this movie is worth checking out.

97,nezbitkn2,Harsh reality,7,8 May 2019,"It's a good film and a good creation showing impact on all around such an evil person during a dark time. Efron is immense throughout and my opinions of him as an actor have gone through the roof since watching this film, merely put into perspective at the end of the film, when shown real clips of what we'd just seen and it was almost like watching the same person. Well done sir. These are stories that we all need to hear and this was produced and directed with great dignity and respect for all throughout. Good film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
98,PCT1970,"Shockingly Good, Efron Delivers",7,3 May 2019,"Joe Berlinger is known for his documentaries which typically address social injustice. His documentary, ""Conversations With A Serial Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes"" earlier this year was captivating. Efron has that ""It"" factor to go along with his good looks and charm which makes him a perfectly cast actor to play Bundy who was known for seeking the spotlight, being handsome and charismatic. In this viewer's opinion that is what makes this film succeed. Berlinger helms an exceptional drama. Werwie who pens the screenplay does a masterful job adapting the memoir, ""The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy"" by Elizabeth Kloepfer. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, costume, settings, score and acting. The entire cast deliver superlative performances which includes artists such as Malkovich, Parsons and Collins. It is Efron who commands the screen delivering a portrayal of the boy next door who was the most infamous mass serial killer in U.S. history. He does so with such ease, conviction and creepily uncanny resemblance. The plot is unique in that we see Bundy through his somewhat loyal and enamoured girlfriend Liz. Most other films focus on Bundy and his murderous acts. Set in the 1970's we see mostly the normal side of Bundy and are not exposed to the murder spree and grisly crime scenes. It starts with Bundy surveying a college bar when he meets Liz Kendall who becomes his soon to be girlfriend and then domestic partner. Ted fancies himself a ladies man and that is how Liz perceives him. She is in awe by the fact that he would want to be with a single mom with a small daughter who is an ordinary looking secretary. Ted manages to pull this off by, like the flick of a switch, turning on his good side which is warm, caring and loving. As a viewer it is hard to imagine knowing who Ted really is or better yet that these types of emotions even exist within him. Ted is attending law school in UT when he is arrested in connection with a kidnapping, but Liz brushes it off as the fact that Ted simply looks like the suspect. This incident however is what leads authorities to naming him as a suspect in a string of disappearances of young women in three states. The evidence they have on Ted boils down to his notorious VW and a vague sketch. The film takes us on a journey of Ted escaping a courthouse, escaping jail and then going on the run and continuing with his spree until he is eventually apprehended in FL and is put on trial for murder. All the while Liz sticks by his side even though she has her doubts, but drowns them away with booze and the true belief that this man she knows could never have committed such vile acts. Ted finally accomplishes his dream of being in the spotlight in the first nationally televised courtroom trial. In Ted's psychopathic mind he thinks he can turn the courtroom into his own stage portraying himself as the victim and trying to convince everyone, mostly Liz, of the fact that how could he have committed these shocking crimes. His inherent arrogance leads Ted to believe he can use his charm to represent himself so he fires his attorney and that's when the real theatrics begin. Ted has to play the role of pretending to be someone he is not. He thinks because he has been able to live a successful duplicitous life he can pull the wool over the eyes of Judge Cowart, the jury and the entire viewing world. He proclaims his innocence up until the very end even after his death sentence. The final scene between Ted and Liz is the most wicked part of the film. The plot is poetic, thrilling, mesmerizing, insightful, hideous, intelligent and cathartic. This film does an outstanding job leaving the widely known and seen before murder spree in the background and focusing on the monster. In this viewer's opinion the film explores, other than the obvious cliché love is blind, just how far good looks and charm go in relationships, the workplace, social status and in this case a vicious serial killer hiding in plain sight. This is a pronounced film in it's genre.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
99,HadiAriyan07,"Extremely Pointless, Shockingly Odd and Dull",3,28 February 2020,"I have no clue what this was trying to even be. You have to know the Ted Bundy's history and his crimes to understand what's going on, especially up until the trial starts and even then it doesn't really work.
I don't really know why this movie was made. I don't get the goal. It lacked a clear directive. I wasn't sure which tone it was shooting for. It felt scattered and in contest with itself. The performances were fine. The casting was questionable. Overall, it was just never clear what the movie wanted to do. It wasn't good.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
100,MichaelMRamey,"Long Title, Good Performance",7,18 May 2019,"Going into this I already knew a lot about Ted Bundy since I love Last Podcast On The Left where they go into deep detail about Bundy. What I was worried about was this film being the classic family man who also happens to be a serial killer and it began to feel like that. However I now see this as a directing choice in the we're seeing the events take place through Elizabeth's point of view. It's weird how even knowing the terrible and disgusting man Bundy is, you still felt a sense of relief when he reveals it to Elizabeth. That may have never happened but whenever Ted writes hacksaw on the glass, it was such a powerful emotional moment that I can't help but praise it, despite being false. Then there is also the fact he wasn't so sweet when he was with Elizabeth in real life.This is the first film that I got to see Zac Efron act. I've only seen him in comedies up until now and he impressed the hell out of me. His portrayal of Bundy is the highlight of this film. There were moments were he almost shows admissions of guilt in Justin his facial expressions which is really only noticeable if you know the fact he did commit these crimes going in. The only thing that is unfortunate is that anyone coming into this knowing nothing about Bundy, they don't cover the scope or degree of his crimes. Sure you can mark it up as being respectful to victims and their families but I felt it was important to show the audience how evil he really was which included necrophilia which is never mentioned. Efron's portrayal was so well done at capturing Bundy's charm and charisma that there were moments where I started to feel sympathy for him, only to quickly remind myself of who he was.Despite not being accurate like most serial killer or even biopic films, the performance and execution (no pun intended) of it was masterfully done and I can't help but give it a high rating.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
101,blauregenbogen,Master of hunting,10,24 May 2019,"After seen that movie at cinema I can tell Mr Ted belong to the high level of killer ,I think is top of the class. Efron is brilliant as a Bundy . The movie is about is persona ,how tricky he was and also how he could manipulate people around him . That's why he kill so many women. I think that was his hobby and interest .

102,pere-25366,Compelling film with a breakthrough dramatic performance from Efron,7,3 May 2019,"""People they liked, loved, lived with, work with and admired could the next day turn out to be the most demonic people imaginable.""This quote really sums up the existence of Ted Bundy; for so long, he was able to lurk among society as a seemingly normal individual. In truly his best performance to date, Zac Efron effortless oozes that charisma and charm Bundy was known for while being calculating and manipulative. The film is a character-study where we come to understand just how deftly he was able to disguise himself to loved ones, strangers and the media; it shows how smart Bundy was for so long but that, eventually, even the smartest bad guys get caught. Particularly notable performances as well from John Malkovich and Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019) but it's Zac who really stole the show. Hopefully more dramatic roles on the cusp for him after critics see this one. 👍","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
103,labng,What a loose and unorganized mess,4,11 August 2019,"If you've had an interest and a good working knowledge of Bundy and his compulsion for murder, you can probably follow along here. But with that being said, I'm not sure you'll want to or even think it's worth it. On the other hand, if you only have a vague familiarity of Bundy, you'll probably struggle to even follow along. This did no favors for any of the actors or the horrors perpetrated by this animal. 10 yrs ago this would have been straight to DVD. So go ahead, but hold your nose.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
104,calspers,Uneven and unconvincing Netflix mass entertainment effort,3,8 May 2019,"Netflix shouldn't be expected to make anything close to ambitious or good films. Their production strategy utilises machine learning to statistically predict what will catch most viewers, so naturally they have no incentive to pertain to artistic integrity but to mere profit for their broad entertainment audiences.This title discloses this approach to making a film effectively. It is clearly marked by a short deadline, uneven editing, cheap use of clips from Netflix' own Ted Bundy documentary, and in my opinion it is a mess of an unadequate portrayal.The writers could have taken so many other and more interesting approaches to this film focusing on the background for Ted Bundy. His character could have been fleshed out in a much more convincing and emotionally nuanced way. They really left out most of the central storyline of the case, and jumped incredibly much forward without informing the viewer.i thought the film relied on quite an akward use of bland scenes supported by misplaced 1970's music, in line with Netflix' flow TV productions.Although this was my impression, I thought Zac Efron's portrayal of Ted Bundy was very nice, and that the supporting cast was decent.I will not recommend this film - it is a cheap and entertainment-oriented depiction of the life of Ted Bundy. I will much rather recommend the quality Netflix documentary released earlier the same year, which seems to be much more ambitious. Perhaps the machine learning algorithm has informed
their executives that they should put a genuine effort into making these.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
105,bestford,Poor,3,6 May 2019,"This film was the basic story and I mean the basics. There was a lot of stuff missed out from this film.

106,chevolek,"Good acting but innaccurate movie. Therefore, dissapointing",4,19 May 2019,"I was going to watch first this movie and then the documentary ""Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes"". I am glad I watched the documentary first where I could really see what really happened in places like the courtroom or in other situations which in the movie they displayed them very innaccurately even though there is video evidence that proves what really happened. Makes no sense changing the story when people know and/or saw the truth (Is like the Bruce Lee movie Dragon which portraited him so innacurately and his story was changed. They did this, even knowing that millions of people worldwide know his story. Weird because his widow was behind the production).
So, this movie was dissapointing in that way, being innaccurate. Another thing you rarely see in this movie is Bundy (Efron) smiling while he was on trial. In the real videos you see the real Bundy smiling all the time, which I interpreted as an evil smile. The performances were great though, I think the production was great but they failed in so many other aspects like showing Bundy (Efron) as a victim and not portraying the real horrific crimes he did to those poor girls. I rated it low for being innacurate. I advise you to watch the Bundy Tapes instead.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I can see that they wanted to show his persuasive powers over his lover, but this just seems like a story about his most documented moments.I would have honestly rather watch a film over his internal struggle rather than his external struggle with relationships.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
112,gerry_barnaby,perfectly less focused on his murders and on the clever and manipulative evil nature he was.,9,12 May 2019,"You might go into this film thinking that they are just making another glorified film on Ted Bundy, but this is far from the truth as this film is done in such a way not to glorify his murders but to focus more on the man himself and who he was a person.The one thing this film focus on which is what the whole point of this film was about, begs the question of what made this man tick? what made him do what he did? was he capable of loving someone? The answer to this was no, this was a man incapable of love, the one thing this man showed was to look out for the little things because some people are so good at hiding who they truly are.This is Done Brilliantly By the acting from Zack Efron that nail the very manor and attitude of who Ted was in the courtroom to the way he was with someone he was with, even in interviews Zack Efron said he didn't want to play this role in a way to glorify Ted but to show everyone who this man truly was. This is a Defining moment in Efron acting career shows just how amazing of an act he is when given the right role in a drama, give him a diverse acting range in his acting skills.Lily Collins was perfect casting for this role show a wide range of emotions portraying a woman that was close the very dangerous man without knowing it at the time Liz Kendall, but had doubt and start to suspect him toward the end, who still alive to this day living with her family who help Lily Collins and the cast portray this film in the right way.Though the film lack in focusing on the perspective of law enforcement in the case of the people or the impact on the people affected by this man, while ive seen a few reviews complaining that they should've shown these murders and rapes by the man, I feel this would have Glorified this man even those the film does go into graphic detail of the murders with real footage, the film doesn't show it which was the best way to do this film which Previous films have shown.The best way I could describe this film was that it was less focus on showing what he did, more focus on his psyche. Though one thing this film failed to show was that Ted was exactly caught way before he was finally stopped, which due to the justice system and the lack of evidence at the time, they didn't realize that had a psychopath on their hand, he was set free which result in other 30 deaths.Studies on Psychology into the mind of someone like him, the more you understand and recognize the behavior of a person with the red flags which shouldn't be ignored, the better chance of recognizing it in your own life before a murder occurs and thus avoiding a horrible death. The more you Analyse the situation and certain people, you gain a greater awareness of the way people operate to better protect yourselves and the people love.Out of 69% of all Serial killers, Ted Bundy was one of the most shocking, not because of what he did to 29 women and 1 Child who was his last victim a 12-year-old girl, is because of people nieve nature in thinking there no way this person could've done it, because he came across charming, nice person, yet failed to see the red flags in his true nature it goes to show you can't truly know someone unless you see that person for who they are.Watching the old Footage of the Real Ted Bundy today the way he looks at the camera and smile, you can see pure evil behind that smile and darkness in his eyes. This film was about showing his murders or the brutal reality of what he did, this is a film that portrays how manipulative he truly was, showing how he used charm with a charismatic nature to lure you in to getting what he wants, you could see how easy it was for woman to fall for it and ultimately lead to their Brutal murder.This film if you set aside the Expectation and just immerse your self in the story, you will come to realize why so many women that were murder by him that fell for his tricks and the people around him effects by the way he was.Not a lot of people born after the 90s would know a lot about him as he was Executed on 24th January 1989, Florida State Prison, Florida, United States death by Electric chair. But from February 1, 1974, possibly more the early maybe late 60s Ted Bundy when on rape, murder, burglary and necrophile spree across America until he was finally caught February 15th, 1978 and sentenced to death after confessing for more than 30 murders which the Law previously thought was only 3.This was a great film showing that you should never trust a person full until you know who they truly are because people that are good at hiding the true nature are clever and manipulative. This is a film I highly recommend watching but waver your expectation and immerse your self in the film story you understand it better.Dislikes: The only thing this film as ive said doesn't really play into the account of the lives affected by him which I understand because they didn't want to glorify him but I think they could've shown this without doing that.Overall: Compelling storying from the perspective of the law, Showing the true nature of who he was, and understanding who he was around different people, a truly evil person in nature.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
113,PaxtonMalloy,Efron is in way over is head,4,23 June 2020,"There are two major flaws in this movie that just can't be overcome. The first one is Zac Efron. He fails again to show me that there is more to him than just being the pretty one. His performance lacks any nuance. I'll never get menace from him. The Only thing I new about Ted Bundy is that he was a serial killer. So if the scenes that are documented like the televised trial are played accurately I can't tell you. Maybe Bundy was that slick without any depth to him. But I don't believe him either when he is with Lilly Collins who he has horrible chemistry with. And I never believe him in any other scene either. There is just one tiny moment when the judge reads the verdict, where there is a slight glimpse that he can be more than a mediocre actor.Second thing wrong with the movie that it has no focus on anything. It can't decide if it is about Bundy, about his wife, about the crimes, about the absurdity of the trial the absurdity of his ""groupies"". So the tone shifts back and forth and the cruelty of the crimes which should be such a strong factor get just a brief window and you never get the menace that should make you angry.Lilly Collins and Efron like I said have no chemistry when they are together. At least when Collins is alone we feel her pain. I like her in general but after ""To the bone"" she should stop picking those roles of the constantly suffering character before it becomes the thing she is cast for. To end on a high note there is actually one good thing about this movie. John Malkovich plays the judge and that role fits him so perfectly that it is sad that the part is so small. The best actor in this movie has the shortest screen time. The worst but most marketable actor in this movie get's the most screen time. No coincidence.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
114,svhot,"If you accept it as an exclusively performance-based movie, then you will enjoy it",9,30 January 2019,"""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile"" has been inspired by the atrocious murders committed by Ted Bundy. The director Joe Berlinger has chosen a different style to tell viewers the charismatic murderer's story. Maybe all the viewers may not like his style of storytelling, but I am one of those rare viewers who loved and enjoyed it.The main reason I enjoyed it so much is because the director has not followed the so-called norms and rules of a clichéd serial killer movie ; for instance, showing all the murders in slow-paced and full details, repetitively confirming the fact that a particular character is really a sociopath by presenting 8 or 9 scenes of him/her in fits of violent anger, and so on . Instead, Mr. Berlinger has decided to show us how intelligent, charismatic, innocent-looking, and convincing a serial killer can be in real life.The first half of the movie is conveyed through the perspective of Liz Kloepfer (Lily Collins), who was the girlfriend of Bundy. The second half is mostly based on the trials / courtroom sessions of Ted Bundy (played by Zac Efron). I would like to mention the fact that Zac Efron has given a brilliant, powerful, charming, and darkly captivating performance as the serial killer Ted Bundy.Zac Efron's performance is the greatest highlight of this movie. He presents the killer's intelligent act of playing innocent so brilliantly. Other outstanding performances are that of Lily Collins, who plays his longtime girlfriend Liz, and John Malkovich as the sharp-tongued judge. This is a performance-based movie, and if you want to see great performances by good actors, then watch this one and ignore the negative comments that some people will make about flaws with the story, screenplay, and other excusable and unnecessary mentions of minor errors here and there.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

It's shot well, and acted mostly standard but Efron is not convincing at all in the slightest as Bundy. He does not embody the actual Ted Bundy in any aspect other than the looks. He could've at least tried to adopt Ted's dialect or personality traits in the portrayal. The soundtrack is obnoxious and the editing is way too rushed.

Every time there was an opportunity to expose the monster and generate a true chill or anger, the film falls back into what basically equals watching the slides of the neighbors' vacation.Basically, the movie tried to focus on the women Ted Bundy leaned on, diverted nearly ALL of his story as it bounced quickly through HIS story, and just gave me the ""meh's"".","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Zac Efron has never been one of my favorite actors, and even though he has a strong resemblance to Bundy, his performance seems forced. There is a great supporting cast here, but the direction is pedestrian at best, and the script is not much more than a superficial retelling of history.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

120,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Flawed but enjoyable. Definitely worth watching if you're interested in Ted Bundy.,7,5 April 2021,"I actually really enjoyed watching this movie. I thought Zac Efron and Lily Collins gave some very good performances, and i was genuinely intrigued throughout as I learnt more about Ted Bundy's murder trials and the absolute torment that his girlfriend was put through. Ted Bundy is an extremely interesting topic for me, and so this probably helped peak my interest in the movie. Although I did enjoy it, it won't be for everyone. It didn't totally capture how dark and sinister the period was, and it did feel clean cut and emotionless in many ways. There lacked an intensity that could have turned this movie into something much more harrowing and psychological. However, I still thought it gave a good run through of Ted Bundy's years in court, and the emotional strain it put on him and Liz's relationship. A lot of the movie focuses on Liz's denial of her relationship with a serial killer, and so in a way the movie is pretty clever in how it doesn't portray Ted Bundy as a complete monster on the outside, and so we understand why so many women fell for his charming personality. The film picked up more as it went on, with the film giving more and more away about Ted Bundy's character and the vile ways in which he killed his victims. There was a fast paced energy throughout which made it a lot more engaging. My favourite scene was definitely the final confrontation between Ted and Liz in prison, which sent chills up my spine. Overall, although not as intense or dark as it could have been, this is still a light and enjoyable watch. Recommend!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

126,chas437,Absolutely Worthless,1,26 June 2020,This film adds nothing to our understanding or perception of Bundy and his crimes. Efron isn't good enough to make this an interesting or compelling character study. This is nothing more than an incomplete retelling of well worn ground with pretty boy teen heartthrob on top.

128,Macleanie,Keeps you Interested,8,25 June 2019,"I must say I knew very little about Ted Bundy before this film. I was interested to see Zac Efron in a darker more serious role and he really worked it. He was captivating at times. Whilst I cant comment on the realism aspect to the authentic story (I believe parts are exaggerated) it does work in favour of the pacing and storyline. It's definitely a thriller drama I would easily recommend. Its just scary that this was a true story, but adds to its charm and aura.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
129,Benslie,An interesting movie that's also confusing to follow,7,4 May 2019,"First of all, I just want to mention why this film is really confusing in my opinion and that's because of the chunky editing. What I mean by that is that it would jump awkwardly from one scene to the next and it wouldn't flow properly. Right off the bat, you see this in literally the first minutes of the film. Due to the confusing editing, it makes it hard to understand what has just happened in the film. This does feel like two films were put together to make one film and I actually enjoyed it. The first part is just showing how he's an everyday man and then in the second half is the trail. This film needs that first part because if it didn't we wouldn't believe how people are saying he's too nice of a guy to do something like this. Some people may think that the first part is unnecessary because it makes him seem like the victim in this whole situation but really it is and for that reason. The second part I found the most interesting though. The whole seeing the trail take place and how he tries to prove his innocence is really intriguing to watch especially as somebody who knows the basic facts about this case. The acting in this film was really well done as well. Zac Efron as Ted Bundy was an excellent choice, even though I do wish they got somebody who looked more like him because he brings off the charm to this role and seeing how Ted Bundy was supposed to be a charmer this was perfect casting. Lily Collins as Elizabeth was great as well and just for her performance is worth a watch of this movie. In the end, Extremely Wicked, Surprisingly Evil and Vile is a good biopic to watch with an interesting true crime case to look into. I give Extremely Wicked, Surprisingly Evil and Vile a 7.5/10.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
130,arcanjl,Couldn't have said it better,8,22 May 2019,"The movie was really good, just disturbing. The movie was really good, just disturbing as F. Zac Efron hit it out of the park, enduring, and damn freaky!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
131,TheAnimalMother,Throw Out Your Preconcieved Notions,7,4 November 2019,"It seems there's a real mixed bag of responses to this film, and many of them not so good. However I thought the film was actually pretty interesting. If you go into it expecting a tense or gruesome thriller based on the well known killer, it's no wonder you may end the film being disappointed. It really isn't that type of film. It's more of an exploratory film that attempts to look into the mind of Ted, and his fiancé once the law closes in on him. In this respect, I found this project to actually be a fairly unique and worthy quest.Say what you will, but to me this was an interesting view on the true crime events of Bundy. Here in this portrayal, and you do also see it in real Bundy interview footage as well, it seems that Ted entirely disassociates himself from the crimes in his mind, and from the person who did the crimes. As if he has a totally 'Other' side within himself. Obviously a serial killer must compartmentalize themselves to a certain degree, especially if they are to continue carrying on relationships in society that hide their darker side. For Ted this was certainly part of his aim. Many believe that Ted maintained his innocence for so long mainly because it gave him some form of control, which was in a way his obsession. The film focuses on this manipulative aspect, and in my view, quite successfully. I think his day to day manipulative behaviour was overall captured and written much better for the TV film, The Deliberate Stranger. Nonetheless this film is still quite interesting in it's own right.To be honest, I never totally believed that his long time girlfriend with the daughter, had such a hard time believing it was him that did the murders. It's hard to believe that anyone would do the things Ted did, sure, in that way I understand her disbelief. However in reality, contrary to this film, she actually reported Ted to the police three different times. So to me, that says her suspicions were pretty firm. Truthfully, this film ignores a lot of facts, but to me it's still worth a watch or two.I've never been much of an Efron guy from what I've seen in the past. Though I must admit, here he does a very good job. Strong performance, pretty strong film. Lily Collins however is pretty much always a pleasure to watch. Her performance here was nothing short of excellent. I believe I also noticed that ""I see dead people"" kid in the film. Don't let any of this push or pull you. If you're interested in it, watch it, but I recommend going into this film, and in fact all films without any expectations. As the Buddha is often credited with saying, ""Think less, observe more."". 7/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
132,richarddillomes,"Movie first, book and/or documentary later.",7,10 January 2021,"Based on experience, it's better to watch the movie first before reading the book it's based on, that way you don't spend most of the time nitpicking what the movie changed or dropped from the source material. While Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is based on the memoir by Ted Bundy's former girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall, the same unfulfilling experience can be derived if you watch a documentary of the subject before the movie version, in this case Netflix's Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes.While obviously a 1hr and 50m movie will not be as comprehensive as a 4hour documentary, it will make you ask what the point was in doing so. One can say for money reasons, since there has been a recent upswing in the interest in serial killers, most notably Ted Bundy. The other, it's specifically the so-called glorification of these serial killers that's why this version from someone who lived with one was made, to take back control of the narrative: they may be charming and good looking, and it will be hard to get them out of your system, but you have to, for your own sake (this applies also to us, as consumers of all things serial killers.)It is understandable that most will find this derivative, if only because it feels like it just took some parts of the memoir, but the real story still is Ted Bundy. Which is a shame because the costumes and sets really transports us back into that time. Lilly Collins was great, and Zac Efron was really impressive. He could've gotten lost in it seeing how larger than life Bundy was, but he carried it well. This probably won't be the last material we've seen about Bundy, and it will get lost in the mix eventually, but if you want to see a serial killer aside from his perspective, this movie fulfills some of it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
133,petera00,Garbage,3,3 May 2019,"None of the murders are shown. Its a melodrama seen directly through the girlfriends eyes... If you know the story of Ted Bundy then there is no point to this movie.

134,jackson_ro,"Extremely Wicket, Shockingly Evil and Vile",6,4 February 2020,"A refreshing take on Bundy's story, telling from a different angle and how someone perceived so evil also had a different side that not many people focused on, and by doing so, I believe it is the only way to make a Bundy film that could be different from all the documentaries and movies out there. Zac Efron did a great job as Bundy but the beginning part of the film felt loose and unfocused. While Liz's character gave the film a different perspective, but at the same time it also felt insignificant. Perhaps the movie simply needed another 10-15 minutes to have a little more meat. Love the ending, which shows the film stayed true to facts and also showed what true evilness looks like.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

If you were, then what's wrong with you?Others have said it try's to humanise Bundy. I also think this is way off.

Script was a bit scruffy, but some scenes were so impactful and managed to be carried all the way by the cast ESPECIALLY ZAC. This has got to be his breakout role. The audience knows he's guilty, the people around him think he's innocent and the movie films itself in a scope where it grabs the viewer to actually feel bad and believe this mad man. CAPTIVATING AND GROUNDBREAKING. The way it was filmed seemed somewhat dull sometimes, but in all honesty when you see majority scenes it pulls you into believing you're actually living through the 70s and 80s.Acting 10/10

140,ernestsavesxmas,Shockingly Watchable,7,21 October 2019,"This movie shouldn't work. It seemingly functions as the tipping point of an odd Ted Bundy / serial killer cultural revival. ""The Netflix docuseries? That's the good one right?"" people say. ""The one with Zac Efron has to be trash, right?"" These fictional people also say. And yet it really isn't. It's a wholly competent movie and the former teen idol can actually act. Who knew? If our collective fascination with all this is strange, perhaps that's even stranger? From the always-nice-to-see Haley Joel Osment to the soundtrack which they spared no expense on to a John Malkovich appearance in which he does not for one second to attempt the deep southern accent of the character he's playing (a character's whose every line is pretty much lifted verbatim from archival courtroom footage, mind you), this movie is entertaining, if literally nothing else. (To which I will say, literally, nothing else: I won't comment on its exploitative-ness, etc. That's the difference between movies and docuserieses!) This is not some great work of art, but if you were on the fence about checking it out among the sea of endless content scrolling by on Netflix, I can assuredly recommend it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

144,makleen2,"Zac Efron steals the show as serial killer Ted Bundy, and that's the problem",6,5 May 2019,"Written by Michael Werwie and directed by Joe Berlinger, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019) is based on the memoir The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy by Elizabeth Kendall. While ostensibly about Ted Bundy's relationship with his longtime girlfriend, whose call to the police eventually led to his capture, the film focuses too much on Bundy's dark charisma and courtroom antics.The film opens at a bar in Seattle in 1969, where single mother Elizabeth Kendall (Lily Collins) meets handsome Theodore ""Ted"" Bundy (Zac Efron) for the first time, and the audience is mercifully spared the usual nods to 1960s counter-culture. Ted gets along well with her daughter, Molly, and seems to embrace the fatherly role. Things turn dark, however, when Ted is arrested at a traffic stop in 1975 and charged with kidnapping Carol Daronch (Grace Victoria Cox).Though conflicted, and despite the protestations of her best friend, Joanna (Angela Sarafyan), Elizabeth is in denial that Ted could have committed the horrible acts of which he's suspected. She grows increasingly distant as Ted's legal troubles multiply, and he is accused of multiple murders. In prison, Ted rekindles an old flame with Carol Ann Boone (Kaya Scodelario), while trying desperately to keep Elizabeth's affection. Can Elizabeth break this destructive emotional bond and move on with her life?Cameos include John Malkovich as Judge Edward Cowart and Metallica vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield as Officer Bob Hayward. Unlike previous Bundy films, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile focuses more on the psychological toll and courtroom drama than the actual murders. It reenacts scenes from real interviews and news broadcasts in docudrama style.Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile closely follows real events. Theodore Robert Bundy (1946-1989) was an American serial killer who maintained his innocence right up to a few years before his execution in the Florida electric chair. He eventually confessed to killing 30 young women in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His charisma, clean-cut appearance, and escape attempts made him a media sensation.In a sense, Zac Efron was the perfect actor to play this role. A conventional bro, disarmingly handsome, with a boyish demeanor, Efron basically becomes Ted Bundy. It's easy to see why women trusted him and why he passed under the radar for so long. He simply didn't fit the image of what most people thought a killer looked like. But Efron's performance is also the main problem. It distracts from what this film is supposed to be about.Although I haven't read Elizabeth Kendall's memoir, I'm guessing she didn't primarily focus on Ted Bundy, his trial, and his bizarre celebrity status. I'm guessing she focused on her own experiences, which is what this film should have done. Instead, Elizabeth's character becomes a melancholic shadow passively observing events.Like Netflix's recent film The Highwaymen (2019), which chose to tell the story of outlaws Bonnie and Clyde from the perspective of the lawmen who hunted them down, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile should have told this story entirely from Elizabeth Kendall's perspective. Bundy should have been a specter haunting Elizabeth as she tried to move on with her life.But the filmmakers couldn't help themselves when it came to giving Zac Efron maximum screen time. What results is a macabre focus on Bundy's attempts to manipulate everyone around him, from his personal life to the courtroom. As a result, critics and audiences have given this film mixed reviews, and I have to agree. The filmmakers just weren't willing to depart from a typical true crime narrative.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
145,MattyRich92,Overall dull,6,6 May 2019,"For a movie that's based on a true story it's full of clichés. Zach Efron is a tour de force of charisma.

However, the minute I saw that it got sold to Netflix I was like, ""Well, RIP any inkling I had of this being a good movie."" Very underwhelming because I expected a lot from the trailer and also after watching Ted Bundy Tapes which is more insight insighful, more rounded and far more frightening. Although the actors nailed it (Zac was magnetic), the lack of storyline engagement still can't save this. I mean, I definitely don't need to see gory murder scenes but the movie just doesn't give you the sense of the monster that Bundy was. I wish Ryan Murphy or David Fincher made this then at least it would have been more chilling and terrifying- I just wanted it to show how wicked, evil, and vile Ted Bundy really was. Two and a half stars because the acting was a top notch, another half because they tried (it's still watchable to be fair). Overall the film would get a passing grade from me because the origin of the story is already interesting... it just deserves better. Damn Netflix! They really do have reputation (at least for me) of producing bad films!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
149,xmdbx,Poor Execution,3,28 May 2019,I found this film boring. I understood that is was supposed to show how manipulative and evil he was but I don't think it did a good job of it. All of the characters besides Bundy come off as extremely unintelligent and inhuman. It seems to me that the film uses the weak characters as a way of propping Bundy up as larger than life when the narrative should have had the power to do that. He appears manipulative and cunning when compared to the rest of the characters because the rest of the characters are nothing characters. The film was unable to create an environment to make me feel any connection with any non-serial killer and that to me is a failure to achieve it's trying to do.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

151,flowerstardust1979,"Extremely Unfactual, Shockingly Inaccurate And Disappointing!",5,14 May 2019,"Very Minor Spoilers, that will not ruin your viewing or give much away. I will warn you before the point of *Minor spoilers* Maybe this movie is better viewed and received if you previously know very little about the story of Ted Bundy?! Maybe I knew too much beforehand, which made me critical and shaking my head throughout.Yes, I am aware, that this was based on the book and point of view of his girlfriend Liz. I was aware of this before watching.
But, the filmmakers couldn't seem to make up their mind, as to whether this was from Liz's point of view, from Ted's point of view, Carol's point of view or a story being told. It chopped and changed direction multiple times. Liz wasn't even present in 30% of the movie, and a good percentage of what was on screen, she couldn't of possibly of known as she wasn't in his life anymore. I wish they'd picked a direction and stuck with it!My main problem with the movie, were the inaccuracies, the factual errors, and the timeline errors. The time line was all over the place. In other words, the movie had parts that were out of sequence, as to when they actually happened in real life.Zac Efron did an okay job, he physically bares a resemblance to Ted Bundy looks wise, so that worked in his favour. He was able to pull off some of the facial expressions similar to Ted Bundy. But unfortunately, as soon as he spoke, he couldn't pull off the eerie cockiness and charm that Ted Bundy oozed. That was part of who Ted Bundy was, the way he was so confident, cocksure of himself, very narcissistic and very clever in the way he came across. Mr Efron sadly couldn't carry this off,(But to be fair, I am not sure any actor could, unless they were a true sociopath themselves) which kind of doesn't portray the story correctly in itself anyway. Especially in the courtroom scenes.**Minor detail spoilers ahead***So first of all, Ted Bundy escaped from prison/ custody twice. One being the court house, the other being through a tiny light fitting hole in the jail cell. In the movie, we are shown Ted jumping from his bunk over and over again, to prepare him for the jump from the high court room office window. Error! He actually jumped off his bunk multiple times as a form of exercise to lose enough weight, to be able to fit through the small hole in the ceiling.
Another factual error which was made, was the way a flashback was portrayed as to how the police managed to examine his teeth, to compare the bite marks on one of the victims. He was actually put in a van and taken to a dentist, they did not do it in his cell, as portrayed in the movie.A few other errors that bothered me one being that one of his victims who escaped from his car, was made out to be a liar in the movie, and Ted's Lawyer in court makes a song and dance about how she was coerced and given Ted's name and photo before she picked him out of a line up. This was incorrect, it was not said in court, she wasn't badgered by the defence lawyer.. It didn't happen! She specifically said in real life, that she would never of forgotten his face and eyes. Even if this all was from the point of view of Liz, these scenes in the movie were not all filmed from someone's point of view, especially the courtroom scenes. They were shot in part, as to how it actually really played out, and if you watch the Netflix documentary of the Ted Bundy tapes, you will see the court room footage of what is portrayed in the movie.There are other minor errors in fact and out of sequence.Overall, if you are going to make a movie about one of the most famous and well documented serial killers, check facts well and portray them correctly.It is an interesting watch, and not a totally bad movie, but it really doesn't tell the story completely factually. The actors did a good job portraying their roles, but it really could of been a whole lot better and less disappointing. The real life documentary tapes were an awful lot better at giving you a real idea of who Ted Bundy was, and how his mind worked. But it's basically a courtroom drama.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

The movie focuses on his relationship to his wife and how she doubted if he really did this or not even though she's the one who told the police his name. Throughout the movie Ted Bundy is seen maintaining his innocence even though he does things like try to escape.

This combined with all of the dramatic scenes featuring Ted and Liz are more human, and that sets to make this movie feel uncomfortable. That adds to its quality, as Bundy was never thought to be a serial killer type do to his charismatic public persona and intellect. This makes him all the more creepy, and it's all in Zac Efron's amazing performance which is straight up Oscar-worthy. It's a movie that sets out to be subtly conducted to making us think about the possible human layers that go around a person like this. It's also not too violent, mostly based around talking and courtroom scenes. It's a damn interesting film, also a damn good one.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

157,mc1382,Pleasantly Surprised,7,4 May 2019,"Going into this film, I heard mixed reviews and for a film about Ted Bundy, it seems oddly fitting. A man that charmed on the outside but was ultimately psychotic on the inside could make a great character study. For all it's shortcomings I think they succeeded here. For a good chunk of the run time, the film is very engrossing and keeps you guessing on what hijinks Ted is up to. The film subversively doesn't show too much of the actual murders. While the film does switch perspectives it mostly presents the events from Ted's warped perspective. This allows the audience (even if they don't want to) to have sympathy for Ted.Mind you, this isn't a glorification of Ted but more of a great narrative tool. Once the climax approaches it hits even harder when its ""revealed"" who he really is. It's crazy that I actually got emotionally invested into Ted Bundy of all people. This is due in part to Zac Efron who is fantastic as the lead role. He balanced the charming and off-kilter personality of Ted really effectively. It always impresses me when an actor can pull off such a good performance and not have to resort to over-acting. There are key emotional scenes that I think warrant an Oscar nomination. Especially the last 30 minutes which is hands down the highlight of the film.While yes, the writing could've been less on the nose, some scenes could've been cut, the film does fall victim to some biopic trappings and the cinematography is nothing to write home about I still feel the film made up for this well in other departments. This could've been a snooze fest but thanks to the unique storytelling and a great lead performance this was actually a very enjoyable watch. Definitely check it out.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
158,superfox_888,Not what I expected,7,4 May 2019,"This film humanised Bundy, which I found chilling. Until the final line of the film, over the credits, when a judge says that serial killers don't drip blood or salivate... they look like regular people.Zac Efron delivers an amazing performance. Who knew a sweet, former Disney Star could portray a cold blooded killer so effectively?This film is told through the eyes of Bundy's girlfriend Liz, which is why Bundy is humanised so.Great film, well worth watching!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
159,SkepticalSy,Not a bad take on the story,6,23 May 2019,"I'm glad this film doesn't glorify the gore or the tale of Ted Bundy. The man ought to be remembered as the con artist, manipulative, perverted monster that he was. And in many respects this movie looks at the human Ted Bundy, not as some type of legend, but as the human being he was. Charming to friends and family, and secretly a murderous psychopath, the movie shows us how difficult it was for those close to him to reconcile these contradictory features of his personality.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

In this film, we not only see that Ted was a completely normal man while around others, but very capable of being in love with someone and playing the role of a family man. Lily was great in this and ZAC deserves an Emmy!!!! We all know Zac isn't just a good looking young actor, but talented too. This role, he really is great.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
163,sala151183,7/10.,7,5 May 2019,"When you get a true story of such a real life character it makes for a compelling watch.
I knew of Ted Bundy before viewing this film, such charm of a man with the most evil actions.
It's hard not to be riveted by the man and the story.
Zac Efron May have done his best work to date, for most part he managed to Imitate Bundy really well.
I think with such a story it makes the film more interesting than the film actually being great that's why I think I liked the film a little more than I should, don't get me wrong it's a good film with some decent performances.
I give this film 7/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
164,timetopooptoday,Documentary Meets Drama,10,3 May 2019,"As an avid true crime and mystery film fan, I've been waiting to see this controversial film since it was in the discussion stages in 2017. So, when I finally learned the release date would be May 3rd, I stayed up the night of May 2nd just to watch it the moment it appeared. I wasn't disappointed.I'd read Liz's book 'The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy,' on which this movie is based. The plot is as expected if you've read her book. While there have been many Ted Bundy films and documentaries and even series made in the past, none have been based specifically on Liz's personal experiences, nor are the characters as accurate versus composite characters. While Liz was loosely portrayed as the character, Leigh, in the 2002 film 'Ted Bundy' starring Michael Reilly Burke (still a must see and one of my favorites) this version of Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is far more accurate by comparison regarding the people who actually were associated with Bundy. I recommend watching the 2002 Ted Bundy film before watching Extremely Wicked in case you haven't seen it. There was a good amount left out in Extremely Wicked historically and there are several jumps in time because movies are 90 minutes, but if you understand the Bundy history this film will make sense to you.The cast was excellent although the woman playing Bundy's mother was a bit off and I have to admit seeing John Malkovich in anything is a bonus, however as Judge Cowart it was a tad bit odd since Cowart was a larger, round-faced southern man. Overall it was a great film and I can see myself watching this over again without getting bored.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

This could have proven Bundy's innocence4) It's very disturbing that in Florida Bundy had a gagging order made against him. Why? Why was Bundy not allowed to speak? What were the police afraid of ?5) Bundy could have pleaded guilty to avoid the death sentence . But he didn't . He maintained his innocence6) . Bundy only said he was guilty a few days before he was executed as he said he was hoping to buy some time .7) There were 30, 00 VW's . That's a lot of VW's!8) Bundy's girlfriend gave his name to the police . Maybe it was out of revenge as she was angry with him at the time . She continued to be with Bundy so how could she believe he was the guy !9) The girl in the first trial admitted the police had shown her pictures of Bundy twice before the identity parade . She also admitted in court that the police had told her to say it was the same car as Bundy's she was in!. I wonder if DNA had existed at the time if Bundy would have been declared innocent .

168,kiowhatta,Too safe as usual,6,6 May 2019,"Americans have an endless bloodlust for horror and violence but are still as sexually conservative as they were 40 years ago.
10 of the top most banned novels all originate from early 80's suburban high school outrage at these now tame classics all for the same reason: too much sexual language, sexual violence or just plain sex.
But it's perfectly fine to show the most graphic violence imaginable.
The story of Ted Bundy IMO was best handled by Bright's 2002 'Ted Bundy' - You cannot tell the story of Bundy without showing both sides of his psyche- the charming chameleon and charlatan who wrestled with his inner demons and the Bundy who was addictively driven to greater and more extreme sexual crimes who often showed his high school girlfriend a glimpse of both.
This story would have been far better told by a more unconventional, courageous director.
'Lovelace' is another example of dumbing down the plot or making it safe which robs what ultimately is one of the points of film, theatre: Being drawn entirely into the story so as to be immersed in the experience, have a mirror held up to us and to prompt audiences to be affected in a way that inspires lively discussion.
This sort of posing can be left for prime time network TV and perfume ads.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
169,Jemae,Interesting,6,5 May 2019,"I liked the film, Zac Efron was amazing as Ted Bundy! I originally didn't know how I would feel about him being Bundy, but it was a good choice.
The only thing I didn't enjoy was the choppiness, they didn't show him committing the crimes. Even though I know the story and I know what he did, not showing his crimes actually left me not hating him...it almost left me feeling like he's innocent.Certain things like when they police were measuring his jaw size, were over dramatised but overall, wasn't an issue for the movie.The ending was good.
I recommend this film, it's easy to watch and is enjoyable.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
170,TC-Batsy,The Serial Killer,10,6 June 2020,"Ted Bundy was the subject of crime documentaries and movies over the years as he became one of the most notorious serial killers in America. Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile tells a story from the perspective of Ted Bundy's former girlfriend Liz and her love for the man who had a dark secret. It was great to see Zac Efron evolving from a teen heartthrob to a serious actor in this crime drama, he even captured Bundy's mannerisms and charm during the trial. This movie is a must see.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
171,idrincon,It's not about the crimes,8,13 June 2019,"Many reviews missed the point. This is not about the man or his crimes. This is the perspective of a (lucky) young woman that not only survived the monster but fell in love with him. With that lens, the movie is quite shocking and brilliantly done. There are missing opportunities to explore a bit deeper why she was spared by Bounty, perhaps because the producers had to give some airtime to the man to set up the final scene. I personally liked it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
172,matt_hew,Casting Doubt,5,4 May 2019,"This is a film that is very well considered but unfortunately having no clear focus or depth leaves it's audience with ambiguity and little satisfaction.It's issues lie firstly with it claiming to being portrayed from the perspective of his longtime girlfriend (based on her book: The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy) but what we get isn't Elizabeth's story more of a combination of her perspective mixed in with Ted Bundy's view, the authorities, the lawyers and other people (such as Carol Anne) whose lives he affected.And because of this there is doubt in what story is actually trying to be told. The use of such a mixed 'perspective' comes at the detriment of the crimes, victims and evidence which creates more doubt over who or what to believe. Whereas this could be useful given the convincing nature of Bundy (claiming innocence) it is something that is never utilised. At the point where you feel the film should be giving you answers (and a point) it instead is hastily wrapped up with a quick, flashback of him committing one of the crimes, a brief admission and a clumsy, discourteous list of his victims as part of the credits.There is also doubt in some of the casting choices. Zac Efron and Lily Collins portrayals of the two lead characters are both well conceived and acted, but even this is compromised by the random cameo of James Hetfield of Metallica and Sheldon from The Big Bang Bang Theory (playing Sheldon from TBBT unfortunately).It is an interesting perspective to take for a film, but if you're looking for the story of Ted Bundy, what he did or why he did it, then there is no doubt it unfortunately won't be found with this movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Zac as Ted was the perfect casting, his scenes were very powerful in getting across what Ted was & how he tricked his victims: A charming, attractive man. The interview & the court room antics were top notch, down to the facial expressions.

184,Yrrepk,60%,6,9 March 2021,"This movie is an okay way to spend two hours, especially for someone not too familiar with Ted Bundy, but it's not very memorable.For me, the best parts were when we saw the truly evil side of Bundy (eg, the dog scene), and I think the director made a mistake by not showing us one of his gruesome murders early in the movie. If he did, it would have made every scene where he's interacting with others meaningful/tense, as we would have feared for their safety. Instead, I almost didn't believe Bundy was even evil -- credit to Efron here. I know this is what they were shooting for; I just didn't think it was the right decision.This unique approach the director took would have worked much better for a lesser-known serial killer; for those unaware, it would have created an additional element of mystery (ie, the audience guessing whether the serial killer was guilty). Obviously, with someone as famous as Bundy, the ""mystery"" element didn't exist.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

However, if you already know a lot about Ted Bundy, you may find it a bit boring. There is a lot of court room recreation etc and it is done well but many viewers of this movie will have watched the footage before.
As others have pointed out in reviews: at the end I felt like it was a decent movie but it was missing something. As someone else asked, what was the point? It would have been better if it had more focus, for example taking a closer look at his psychology or how he was caught.

188,FlickChick82,Shockingly good,8,1 June 2019,"Zac Effron is disturbingly convincing as this notorious serial killer Ted Bundy. He completely embodies Bundy, especially with a menacing look in his eyes. Lilly Collins shines as a somewhat naive, with low self-esteem, single mother. What I like the most about this film is a chosen narrative, the way the story is presented. In a way it is told from an unsuspecting victim, his girlfriend, who later becomes his fiancee. Even though two women loved him, I don't believe he was capable of loving anyone but himself. The movie lacks showing explanation for his actions. Nevertheless, are we even capable of entering into the mind of any serial killer, let alone this one and truly understand those urges and impulses they seem to possess? I don't mind that those involved in making this movie chose not to show us all the gory details of his killings, but rather hint at it. After seeing a footage of real Ted Bundy at the end of the film, it is beyond me how any woman could have found him attractive, charming and appealing. While one stares at those dead like shark eyes, all one sees is the never-ending darkness.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

At the time I was a teen, heard the name, parents kept me away from the gory details, no interest until now. The movie was well done, keeping the focus on Bundy's inability to attach himself to his actions. Maybe a split persona, who knows? One feels for the woman in his life that he cherished, and at times she DID feel creeped out by him while living with him. And oh my... to carry her burden all those years. Great ending. Excellent acting from all, great sets, perfect intensity and focus on mental instability/ Zac and fellow actors along with great direction kept the focus on a human ""animal"" who may not have been able to even begin to understand his crimes, while staying away from gratuitous gross out scenes. The film helps one ponder humanity and mental issues as opposed to focus on the imagery of his heinous acts. IMHO discouraging copycats in this strange age.

When I heard this movie on Netflix I had to check this out cause I been trying to find this movie for so long and everybody was talking about it today on Facebook, and thats what made me watch the movie. Between these two former Disney Channel stars, to me, Zac Efron got first place then it would be Ross Lynch in second place.

The acting was good and you can see why Liz would have found him charming based on this depiction. You would even be forgiven for believing that ok, he was a serial killer but otherwise a nice-ish guy which is I guess what the film is trying to achieve until the last couple of minutes of the film.
But if you read about what he actually did to his victims, his story is a whole lot darker and sick and manipulative. The man was a psycho who didn't just hit his victims over the head. Including more of this information in the film would have made the ""charming"" side of him, public declarations of innocence and his defense in court far more chilling, giving the viewers a glimpse of his twisted mind.
What we see is a superficial view from the outside of what Ted Bundy would have wanted people to believe and it's missing the reality part of it all to show the psychological side and manipulation and masterminding.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
203,mossow92,This was surprisingly good. Thank you Netflix and Zac Efron.,8,12 May 2019,"This wasn't something that was on my list to watch, but my wife is a fan of anything Ted Bundy, so I obliged. From the moment the film begins, you are immediately engulfed in the amazingly twisted love story of Bundy and Liz. The movie is incredibly paced and enthralling. Efron is his normal charismatic self, but surprisingly gripping and believable in the serial killer role. He beautifully parallels the real life man he portrays. The film also does a great job of splicing in actual police photos and TV footage, leading to the gripping final act. To say the least, I was pleasantly surprised.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

206,nomi_waters,I enjoyed the movie... *no real spoilers imo but better safe than sorry*,8,26 July 2019,"I feel like zac Efron did an amazing job with this movie. It was nice to see him in a different role for once instead of party boy, comedy type we normally see. We got to see him in this new capacity which he did amazing with. I will admit that I do feel like this movie could've had some better things to It. For instance, I was expecting to see something extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile but alas I did not hence not giving It a 10/10. But I do love the way zac protrayed him. I got to see how someone could fall for bundy's tricks and how charamastic, charming, and smart he was. Like wow he was smart. And I loved seeing this story from this point of view. Zac did such an amazing job and had I not known the story before hand I would've believed Ted bunny was innocent asf. The cast did an amazing job. *claps for them* although I will admit seeing 'Sheldon Cooper' as a lawyer I couldn't really take him serious because of Big Bang Theory, I guess he's trying to get away from that. I will admit at times I was rooting for Ted at points then realized what I was doing. And I loved the judge sooo much. He was sassy and so serious.

208,blakestachel,Extremely Wicked and Shockingly Bad,2,13 April 2020,"The clichéd calamity that is extremely wicked shockingly evil and vile is worsened by the very fact that it is clichéd. It would be bad enough to see these well worn dramatic tropes scattered throughout yet another mindless Hollywood creation, but the normality that we see reaches another layer of unacceptability because these conventions are used to gloss over and normalize the horrible acts of an equally horrible man; so that Ted Bundy becomes yet another misunderstood and bland Hollywood anti-hero. The desperate and at times exceptional performance by Efron is hampered by and ultimately forgotten due to the screenplay which tells the most boring part of Bundy's escapades in the most boring possible way.There are many ways to ruin a motion picture and Extremely evil and vile has definitely found a few, most notably the incessant chatter of its score which is primarily used as an attempt to invigorate the catatonic direction and absurd and irresponsible perspective.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Highly recommended.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
212,mnagaditya,A story of a lover pleading guilty of and a serial killer pleading not guilty!!!!,8,3 May 2019,"The first hour will make you doubt if Ted is really a criminal or innocent (If you don't know anything about the case beforehand). And by the time he reaches colorado you start to sympathize for him. Also the analogy of ""papillon"" really helps for this. By the time he escapes Aspen court we are already rooting for him and feel happy when he escapes.when the case goes to public trial a reporter says ""each day, the courtroom is filled with spectators drawn by a fascination with the gruesome details of the crimes"". This in my opinion is most hard hitting set of words in the whole movie. If we are not provided with the climax where he writes ""HACKSAW"", we would have thought that he is innocent. Or maybe since this movie is based on the book written by LIZ herself, it would all have been a lie created by her based on some real events which makes it a semi-fiction. Or she is telling the truth but he is lying since she asked him to release her from the guilt. And this possibility looks a little cheesy. But since he himself confessed guilty of all those crimes, all other possibilities get nullified and he becomes the serial killer.Whatever may be the case, it is good movie. Zac Efron is fantastic in this movie. He's come a long way from 17 again, which I am very fond of. He portrayed both a lover pleading guilty of and a serial killer pleading not guilty, pun intended. I'll recommend it!!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
213,JasonXIX,Extremely Vile Exploitation,4,26 August 2019,"Ted would have loved this movie. Once again, he is the star and center of attention. Not only is Ted played by heartthrob Zac Efron, but he also gets almost two hours of screen time to manipulate us so we feel sorry for him. What more could a sociopath ask for?Meanwhile, the women that he murdered are treated as a simple plot device. We learn nothing about who they were, and what they might have become. Their names are on screen for 30 seconds at the end of the movie. A token gesture, after their deaths have been exploited and their killer humanized.Ted was extremely wicked, but you would never know it by the sympathetic, charming, and tragic portrayal he receives in this movie. Go read the actual details about his crimes, and you will agree he was pure evil and better off forgotten.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
214,j_co,"Good acting, good movie, they could have gone deeper",8,20 September 2019,"I watched this movie without much background about the story, I thought it was a solid movie and didn't understand why people disliked it so much.
The acting is good, the story is interesting, the movie is well done.
After watching this I watched the Ted Bundy documentary and I think I understand why people didn't like this movie.
1. The movie presents Bundy as a normal guy, and it makes the watcher uneasy, we like to think we can tell when someone is evil, and it's hard to deal with the fact we can't always.
2. The real story was very complex and Bundy was so fascinating that although the movie did a good job of showing the main events, it is missing some of the complexity and craziness, this should have been a mini series not a movie, since two hours is not enough to tell this story.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
215,screenotes,"Extremely Insipid, Shockingly Banal and Facile",5,4 May 2019,"In order to get the most out of Netflix's latest take on the Ted Bundy story, you should do the following:1. Be born after 1989
2. Be born outside the USA
3. Not watch Netflix's own Conversations With A Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019)If you fit this criteria, you may just be able to buy the films unusual through-line that Ted Bundy was an innocent man, wrongfully pursued, harangued and harassed by the Authorities due to their own political agendas.But this is only one through-line of a confused narrative which seems to have forgotten two basic principals of storytelling. That is, the answer to the questions:1. Who is the intended audience?
2. Whose story is it?The latter question seems to be answered within the First Act in that we follow the perspective of Bundy's girlfriend, Liz Kendall (Lily Collins). And this could have been an interesting take on a story that everyone but a technology-deprived Millennial orphan knows at least on some level. Yet bafflingly the story jumps a large chunk of time and the perspective inexplicably shifts to the point that we end up with a straight biopic whose mediocrity is reinforced by the tired technique of showing actual footage of the Bundy trial during the closing credits.Zac Efron is serviceable as Bundy, capturing in particular the charismatic charm of the chameleonic sociopath. Lily Collins' does well with what she's given but the lack of screen time provided for the relationship between Bundy and Liz is a major barrier to the suspension of disbelief required to support a seemingly central premise that Liz didn't know of her boyfriend's misdeeds.In choosing to keep the details of the Bundy's crimes to a minimum and in shifting between perspectives, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019) essentially only serves to portray the least interesting aspects of a sickening yet incredible story.Director Joe Berlinger's own limited documentary series, Conversations With A Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019) is a much more worth-while watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
216,bjelleybean-364-553679,Outstanding Performances and Storytelling,10,4 May 2019,"This is an outstanding story, not of serial killing, but of the struggle to jail and convict Ted Bundy. Having watched this trial on television when Ted was the star of the evening news, I can tell you this movie hits it on the head. Anyone who claims mistakes were made here wasn't actually there. Zac Efron turns in an outstanding performance (and bears a chilling resemblance to) as Bundy, and is supported by a phenomenal cast who brings humanity to this story of horror and human degradation.As a historical document this film is outstanding on it's own, but it stands as a cinematic achievement as well and is well worth a watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
217,asanchez44194,"Good movie, but Zac Efron is horrible.",8,14 January 2020,"The movie was overall good & interesting, but I have to say Zac Efron is not a good actor. He did horrible. It was cringing to see him act. Horrible.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
218,rightkeith,"Extremely Boring, Shockingly Dull and Monotonous",3,10 May 2019,"In a movie that will make you say, 'Oh crap, he's in this too?', Zac Efron gives the only memorable performance. Problem is, it was too much Zac. This was a movie about Ted's personal relationships sprinkled with details about missing women.If I hadn't seen the Ted Bundy tapes first, I'd be extremely confused how a man escapes from prison twice and both times ends up back in jail. The 'Tapes' do a good job of expounding on this, where the movie skips it all and all we know is that he's back in jail.I get the direction this film was trying to take, and it is a unique perspective on this infamous person, it's just not all that interesting of a feature length film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

The director did not really show their strong chemistry, and very quickly moved forward to court scenes. That's why I did not cry at the end when he released her. However, I can't argue that the movie is professionally set and high quality. Zac Efron is charming and his look matches Ted's. 9/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
220,TreasureHunterGirl,What was the point?,5,3 May 2019,"This movie had such potential, but failed to fulfill any of it.
It's a real shame because the costumes, sets and locations were all fantastic. It was shot nicely. The soundtrack was okay, but could've been better I guess. The acting was great. I think given better material Zac Efron could've done great things with this role. He certainly looked the part and he did well with what he had; the problem is he didn't have a whole lot to work with.
I think the main issue is it lacked a clear focus. Whose story was it? It wasn't Liz's, it wasn't Bundy's, it wasn't Carol Anne's, it wasn't even any of the victim's stories. It just waffled on showing a few of the moments/facts we already knew.
If you're going to give a movie a ridiculously long title like ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile"" then you kind of need to show some wicked, evil, and vile acts at some point in the movie. Okay, so I get that it's not considered acceptable to glorify the crimes of serial killers. I agree with this, but you certainly shouldn't try to make the audience sympathise with them while barely mentioning their numerous victims and the families of those victims. That list of names slapped on the end just before the credits made me cringe. Was that all the recognition these innocent victims deserved?
For me, the disappointment comes down to the fact that this movie was about one of the most prolific killers of all time and his crimes weren't depicted at all, nor were the stories of his victims. If you watched this movie, not knowing anything about Bundy, you certainly wouldn't leave it thinking about just how terrible his ""extremely wicked, shockingly evil, and vile"" acts were. You wouldn't feel the immense loss he caused. I'm really not sure what you'd take away from it. Maybe you just be confused as I was.
Very poorly executed which I guess comes down to a poor screenplay.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
221,Gorgorgorgoroth,Not a Slasher Film,7,7 May 2019,"Don't expect to see gore or bodies being chopped to pieces. The worst thing this movie shows is at the end where Elizabeth shows Ted the pic of a decapitated woman and the movie shows a flashback of Ted smashing a woman's face with a crowbar.This is not a slasher film. This film is mostly focused on Ted getting caught, running away from cops, and his trial, which is a little bit disappointing because I did expect the movie to show Ted attracting at least one woman and finally strike when they're alone and Ted has earned his victim's trust. But the movie doesn't show this at all.The title is unnecessarily long.Zac Efron's performance is good. However, I'll admit, at the very end where the movie shows a list of names of women who Ted murdered is cringy. Is that really necessary? All those women died 40-45 years ago. No one cares about the names of the women Ted killed. You can easily Google them.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
222,AngelFall1n,Few have the imagination for reality,10,19 June 2021,"Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile. Because there are not enough words to describe how evil Bundy was behind his facade. The same words spoken by judge Edward D. Cowart on Bundy's sentence trial;
""The court finds that both of these killings were indeed heinous, atrocious and cruel, and that they were extremely wicked, shockingly evil, vile and the product of a design to inflict a high degree of pain and utter indifference to human life.""Bundy was very covert in his manipulative ways and he was charming to the point where people really believed he was innocent and harmless. You can tell something is off when staring into his eyes - you can't unsee the evil. His entire persona and body language was deceiving and undoubtedly mistaken for charm and confidence.It's not a thorough life or origin story on Ted Bundy but more like a biopic, yet the character development was still satisfactory and well-paced. It didn't need gory scenes to get me at the edge of my seat. I actually think it's great that they didn't include his murderous acts because it can be triggering and overwhelming for certain people.Zac really did justice in portraying Ted Bundy, both psychologically and visually. It truly aims at making audiences live the same experience as the people who couldn't grasp the harsh reality of Bundy's horrid acts. However, I don't think Ted really cried or trembled when he was sentenced to death because it seemed different from the real testimony recording. I suppose that they improvised to show that manipulators can mimic human emotions, but will only cry for themselves in times of despair.Brilliant, chilling, and clever. Zac and lily's performances were truly amazing, as well as all the actors in the film. The cinematography and filming sets were also incredible. I've watched this film multiple times and it's possibly one of my favourites. Highly recommend.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

228,mateusolivotti,a misunderstood film,7,5 June 2020,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" tells the story of one of the biggest and most famous serial killers the United States has ever seen. I saw a lot of people talking badly about this movie because he ""didn't show the monster Ted Bundy was"" or ""romanticized a serial killer"", but the purpose of the film was to tell what Ted Bundy was like in his girlfriend's view, played by Lily Colins, so I think it is wrong for people to speak ill of the film in this respect, because his intention was never to be a film like ""Zodiac"", but to tell the story of a murderer in the view of a victim of his manipulation.
The film assumes that you already know Ted's story briefly, so maybe you don't like the movie very much if you are fast and don't know anything about it, I recommend you watch the series ""Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes"", which as well as the movie is available on Netflix.
This is undoubtedly the best role of Zac Efron's career, he is fantastic and he is the highlight of the film, Lily Colins is also very well, she can convey guilt, sadness and doubt very well and you feel sorry for her , technically the film is also very good.

This movie does not portray the reality at all, it is not close, it is not accurate and its basically a dumb version of the tapes.
I heard there was a lot of complaints in regards to the tapes, so who knows, maybe this was made to wipe away the failure of netflix.
I dont know where to start with this movie. The character of Ted Bundy in on way depicst Bundy at all.

231,redcanofevil,Serial Killer movie done right,7,28 November 2019,"The cinematic retelling of one of the most prolific serial Killer of US Ted Bundy is a fantastic movie manned by Joe Berlinger . From the fitting set pieces to accurate dress and costume design this film is peppered with 70's nostalgic delicacies all the while retaining a modern outlook for authenticity. A fantastic all round performance from the cast with special applause to Zac Efron for giving the best rendition of Ted Bundy on cinema.I'm not kidding a bit when I say he needs to be considered for an oscar nomination, he was simply that good. To put it more simply, he was a better Ted Bundy than Ted Bundy himself. Lily Collins herself gave a solid performance as did Kaya Scodelario. The cinematography is quite exquisite and is beautifully shot, I was afraid it would end up being too dramatic for the sake of selling few extra bucks but its surprisingly restrained. The script is well written and dialogues were sharp and to the point.The film is surprisingly toned down in violence too. For a film with a title like that it wouldn't be superficial to expect a lot more violence. But there is very little of it, in fact the movie could be described as too restraint. A lot of the killings are either depicted through exposition or few underlying evidences . But I loved the fact that the director went for the mental toll and psychological pain instead of dousing the set with ketchup or cgi blood, whichevers cheaper.And that's what really makes it stand out, emphasis on the psychological loss than glorifying body counts. It has some confusion regarding its approach to the story and picking a pivotal point of view character. At times its easy to be unsure of who the main protagonist is, Ted Bundy? his girlfriend? or his other girlfriend?Speaking of confusion, the score although mesmerizing also felt a bit confusing. It tries its best to relay that Bundy is actually innocent and wrongfully taking the fall. But we all know that's not the case. Also the fictional character played by Haley Joel Osment was totally unnecessary, this might just be the most unneeded character I have ever seen in a movie.Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile stays mostly true to its name.

So many important moments omitted and very little is seen of the crimes. If anything, the viewer cannot grasp the true evil of Bundy and instead we are forced to watch Lily Collins/Haley Joel Osment and so many scenes that do not add value to the movie. Nothing of Lake Sammamish and nothing of how Bundy managed to evade capture and travel to Florida without a cent to his name. And nothing of his gruesome crimes once he had arrived in Florida.Any positives? Absolutely. I thought Zac Efron was superb as was the performance of John Malkovich (as always). In fact, it was the performance of Efron makes it all the more disappointing that the film should want to focus on so many irrelevant characters. Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth Kloepfer (played by Collins) should have played a part in the movie, but not such a prominent part. Bundy was away from Kloepfer in Salt Lake City and acted as a lone wolf most of the time, especially in Florida. Perhaps those who did not know about the Bundy crimes may be left in doubt as to the true evil. For me, this could have been so much better.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

If you watched the documentary on the Ted Bundy tapes. This movie recreates scenes from the documentary. The characters were good. Wanted more of the murder trial in Florida. But we have the documentary for that. The storyline was good also. You get to see a different side of Ted and his so called love life. Now I thought this movie would detail his killings and how he survive his multiple escapes. But this is a good movie to watch. The last 5 minutes between Zac and Lily is great. Go check it out when you can. My rating is 7/10. #extremelywickedshockinglyevilandvile #tedbundy #zacefron #lilycollins #netflix","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
245,jonmurdock,A pretty picture of a murderous sociopathic necrophile rapist,6,5 May 2019,"I followed the Bundy case as it was unfolding, and while I am no Ted Bundy expert - I did read Ann Rule's book and quite a bit of documentation. I watched the trial, a couple movies about him, read online sites such as Murderpedia.Obviously a sociopath, Bundy could charm - and that is what Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (kind of a stupid title) focuses on. It does so to the extent that the viewer unfamiliar with the case is left wondering if this man could actually commit such horrendous acts because Ted's such a great guy.The best things about this movie is that Zac Efron actually resembles the real killer, and John Malkovich as judge Cowart. Not that he's actually playing judge Cowart, he's playing John Malkovich playing a judge, and it's gold. The worst things are that everyone in the film appear as though they would in say... 2018, and the film fails to accurately demonstrate how much of a monster Ted Bundy actually was.Two films that are far better than ""Extremely Wicked"" are ""The Stranger Beside Me"" (2003) and ""Bundy"" (2002). ""Bundy"", starring Michael Reilly Burke might be the best of the bunch.While I could (and have) watched ""The Stranger Beside Me"" and ""Bundy"" more than once, once might be enough for ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"". 6/10.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
246,krisboogie,A different type of serial killer series focusing on those close to the serial killer,6,16 May 2020,"The acting, and cinematography were done really well and Zac Efron and Lily Collins were great leads. I think the idea of focusing a story not necessarily on the killer but those he interacted with was a good idea but it wasn't executed well. I think the main issue is that they just didn't go deep enough and it felt very surface and repetitive at points.For example, we know his gf/fiance was the one who gave the police his name initially, that caused her a lot of guilt since she wasn't sure if he was guilty initially, and much more later on when she thought she could've saved more women had she said something earlier. What we don't get though, is why? If he was so charming, they had been in this long relationship, so much so he was heavily in her daughter's life etc there something deeper they could've and should've explored about what led fo that decision for her. Instead, the movie makes it as if she merely saw a sketch that resembled him on tv and reported his name just in case. There's no flashbacks or explanations of moments that caused her to be skeptical of his character, of moments she questioned his life because he took suspicious trips or was out late at night a lot, or had snapped in someway that wasn't violent but raised an alarm.They also didn't really get much into the investigation. While it wasn't necessarily supposed to be focused on the murders themselves, and we do get some of the details that connected him to the murders he was convicted of, it isn't really made clear why they become convinced it was him (prior to having his teeth mold etc.). There's a sketch, she gives his name and then suddenly he's in lineups and standing trial in a bunch of different places.There were also a lot of repetitive scenes where they could've used that time instead to go deeper into the story and background rather than repeat the same scene. The calling from jail to the gf/fiance scenes, the scenes where she's just drinking and arguing with her friend about whether she's spiraling or watching the trial with no real dialogue, etc.That said, I still think it's a pretty good watch if you're into these things.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

248,highnemonkey,This seasons must have: True Crime & Fashion!,6,11 December 2020,"It would be wrong to say I did not enjoy this movie at all. Yet, it had that feeling of being something straight out of the studios laboratory.
Murder mysteries have gained popularity in recent years, as well as ""period"" pieces that focus on fashion and lifestyle. This threw both together, as other productions have before to great success.
The acting is alright, the plot linear and engaging, surprisingly it opts to neglect the grittiness and explore the human and juristical dimensions of the case, which was nice.
I am sorry but still - it just feels like producers were trying to surf the wave of recent true crime successes and eyeing a GQ story for Zac Efrons wardrobe.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
249,JSirro,Treading lightly on a Not so Light Subject,5,7 June 2019,"If you are looking for a documentary about Ted Bundy, you may want to start somewhere else. Joe Berlinger (Director) takes Elizabeth Kendall's (Ted Bundy's girlfriend) book and portrays the charming and charismatic side of Bundy.When I first saw Zac Efron was playing Bundy I was intrigued, not my who I would have imagined playing a serial killer, but after watching it was a great choice. Efron gives us a hint of what woman in the 70's were feeling for Bundy. How could a man that is this charming be this psycho. Giving us an idea of just how one close to him could get caught up in buying everything he is selling to the people around him who have grown to care for him.There are some stories that, at least for me, you hear once and may never really want to revisit it again. The Ted Bundy story falls under that category. In this movie, which was a good watch, we get that completely different perspective from anything you have seen or heard about the Bundy stories. My take is its a good movie, great for Netflix, kept my attention but wouldn't need to re-watch it. If I went to the movies to see it I would be disappointed. It leaves you with feels that on a Friday night movies night I just wouldn't want.Who is this movie perfect for: Anyone who doesn't know the Ted Bundy Stories, doesn't want to do a deep dive into the cases of a sick serial killer but wants to know the high level story from the point of view of his girlfriend, who was completely fooled by it all...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
250,sweensa,Horrible to watch,8,6 May 2019,I felt for the actors this level of real acting eats you alive. Bundy was a monster to play him I dont know how a man can do it. You could see the pain in Effrons face but he did a great job. Thank God didnt go full tilt into the crimes families have seen enough,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

252,jacekstruski,Weak at best,2,21 July 2021,"I don't want to say it was boring, though it was, cause I know it was about his relationship and not his crimes. But even on that front it was flat. Acting was stiff, robotic. Lily Collins already looks like she's about to cry so she she rode that till the end, didn't make an effort whatsoever. Zac Efron was an absolute casting flop, his looks suggest his natural state is fist pumping so seeing him in this role was awkward.What surprised me the most was the fact that this movie was not boycotted by feminist groups cause it makes Collins' character look like utter gullible moron of a woman.All in all, if you want to see a great movie about a killer and his family life watch 'The Iceman (2012)'. Now, that is a great movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
253,Shewattsi,A solid film with great casting,9,24 May 2020,"Ted Bundy as a subject has (excuse the term) been done to death. But I think this film serves an excellent purpose, it casts an uncomfortable lens on this period of time.Many people criticised the film (even before it came out) claiming that it would romanticise him and his horrible crimes. It doesn't, instead it shows us how perceptions at the time allowed him to get away with murder for so long. We know from documentaries that he was afforded freedoms many other wouldn't have been, that his trial was filled with young women fan-girling over him. No one believed that this charming young college boy would commit those kind of savage crimes. It's a concept that seems so alien to us now.And in this sense I think that casting Zac Efron was a master stroke. They needed him to be played by someone considered attractive, and it evokes some kind of sympathy that when you realise you've been drawn in, you're disgusted. The film tries to help you feel how people did at the time, and for that reason I think it's done an excellent job.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
254,ixtasis,Nothing new... Move along...,5,6 May 2019,"You'd expect someone who was in an intimate relationship with Bundy to have something unique to add to the narrative, but it felt like a brief glossing over of just about everything, from their relationship to his crimes.

255,sahbahajali,"Extremely effective,Shockingly Impressive and compelling",8,8 February 2020,"This film mainly focuses on Ted bundy's relationship with his girlfriend Elizabeth Kloepfer and knowing the fact that this is from her perspective makes things a bit more scary.
Zac Efron was the perfect choice for this role since he is charismatic enough to portray how manipulative Ted Bundy was when it came to his relationships with other people.Efron is so convincing and smooth with his performance and dialogue delivery that it somehow made me believe in the character's innocence and I somehow found myself even sympathizing with him !
so the missing point is to keep your guards up since the murderers aren't always recognizable or don't have the most horrifying looks","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
256,lucy-82054,Completely inaccurate,1,3 May 2019,"Perpetuating the Hollywood version of Bundy. In my opinion not even a remotely accurate portrayal of him, his relationship with Liz or Carole. I dont understand why this film glosses over the majority of the most hideous things he did or that Liz had MANY warning signs and reported him to the police several times. I was incredibly disappointed by the vapid glamorisation in this movie, however, I was really impressed with Efrons acting in this movie and if you forget what it's about then maybe one could enjoy it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
257,browniechef88,"Wow, Mesmerizing",10,3 September 2020,"What a movie! Zac Efron gives Bundy so much humanity, he looks innocent. What a great portrayal of a complex human with a mesmerizing personality. This movie shows the tenderness Ted seemed to have for Liz and continues to ask: did he love her? Could he actually love her? If he is capable of love, was he railroaded as he claimed? Was Liz just a ""cover"" of some kind? Amazing movie.

259,robinparker311,Great acting by Zac Efron but quite 'off' the real story,6,4 November 2019,"I've always sort of considered Zac Efron just another (VERY) handsome face & never paid that much attention to how good of an actor he is because he's really never been in anything that I am interested in.
That being said, he plays the Ted Bundy part very very well & I have followed everything there is to read/watch/research on Ted Bundy for YEARS, including the Ann Rule book 'The Stranger Beside Me' (an all-time great true crime writer who happened to work w Bundy on, of all things, a suicide prevention hotline - and she considered him a friend). There really no need for all this extra information but my point is that I have always had a great interest in the complicated mind of Ted Bundy & when I came across this I was skeptical but although it's a decent movie, it's very 'off' factually. Not in the real important ways, but it's done from his girlfriend Liz's perspective & it doesn't even properly portray his relationship w her. It starts before anything was known about him as a criminal & portrays her to have been part of his life all the way into the Chi Omega murder trial & also portrays them as being madly/magically/happily in love when, in truth, Liz & Ted had a lot of trouble, not to mention the fact that Liz was skeptical & suspicious of Ted. For example, You find out toward the very end of the movie that she had given his name to the police - everyone knows this is the case so they HAD to put it in the movie but it sort of just 'didn't fit' w the Idealic relationship they tried to portray (which simply wasn't true, according to everything I have ever read or seen in documentary/bibliography type of media.
If you find the Ted Bundy story interesting almost everything else I've seen has been more true to life than this particular film. If you find the Ted Bundy story interesting almost everything else I've seen has been more true to life than this particular film. It's not that it's UNTRUE, It just uses too much 'artistic license' that it portrays a completely different story of Bundy's life & relationships which throws off a not very realistic portrayal of one of the most notorious killers of all time.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

264,loveminuszero000,"Extremely Sugarcoated, Shockingly Inaccurate and Vile...",2,3 May 2019,"This was a disgusting portrayal of Bundy. If someone watched this who had never read up on him, they might think he was innocent. This movie is a slap in the face to his victims' families. I don't know how anyone could think he was innocent back then when everywhere he went, bodies of women, all killed in the same manner, started turning up soon after he arrived. How much of a coincidence could that possibly be? He's in Utah- dead girls, he's in Colorado- dead girls, he's in Florida- dead girls that live right down the street. Not to mention, the disappearances stopped after he left Washington State. You'd have to be a complete moron to believe in his innocence. Liz Kloepfer identified him to police twice, also, not just once. She gave the police quite a lengthy interview at one point. She had very strong suspicions that Ted was the murderer. I don't know what this movie was trying to convey, but it was very inaccurate and completely sugarcoated.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
265,schofieldius,Weird,6,6 May 2019,"Was disappointed. Reasonably acted I guess. But I didn't get how Mrs Bundy was all oblivious and determined that her man warnt no monster, but then she'd grassed him in!? So the identifit picture is in the papers and on the telly, Mrs Bundy thinks ""oh that looks like my Teddy, I'd better phone the rozzers so they can rule him out.""?
Apparently she had clues it was Ted but they never showed them. That don't make sense since it was a film from her point of view so they didn't have to do crime reconstructions etc. They missed out a lot I reckon, I wasn't particularly wanting loads of grim details about his crimes, but the result of there being practically none throughout the film was that I started questioning whether someone were suggesting he was wrongly accused. Effron was ok","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
266,sarahbriggs79,Not what I expected,7,6 May 2019,This film does not really go into all the horrific things Ted Bundy did but more focuses on how he managed to fool people into thinking he was a normal human being. The main characters do a good job but if you are looking for action and and a reasoning into the mind of a killer look elsewhere. Jim Parson as a straight guy does not work as all I could see was Sheldon Cooper acting as a solicitor. All in all it is an interesting watch but the thing I will take away is seeing the names of the confirmed victims at the end and a disbelief that one man could manage to get away with the kills for so long,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

269,sagittarius-5,Spot on Zac!,7,5 April 2020,"People reviewing this movie seem to be angry and upset that the movie focuses on Bundy's trial and relationship with Liz instead of showing us the brutal murders or his evolution as a psychopath and these people don't understand the concept of the movie I think. This wasn't supposed to show all the gory details, it was supposed to show Liz's dealings with all of Bundy's evilness and how manipulative he really was, it was supposed to show us why some may have believed his innocence, 'cause he was that ""good"". Instead of showing us a horrific movie where Bundy's victims are used for some sort of shock factor they show us Ted Bundy the person that fooled a lot of people, managed to escape twice yet he got captured both times in a short period of time, which also shows his arrogance and that he was unable to control his urges. He had to kill again and again which ultimately got him captured again. I think this movie is supposed to show us the nature of the beast and his unwillingness to stop even if just to keep him hidden. I enjoyed the movie and it's premise and Zac Efron did an amazing job portraying Ted Bundy! There were moments where I felt like I was actually watching a clip of Bundy! It's a different role than what we're used to seeing Zac do and here he could really display his acting chops and it was great! I think this movie was also supposed to show us that serial killers even ones as depraved as Bundy look and act like normal people, they don't have horns on their heads and black eyes! Monsters live among us and are as charming and ""normal"" as they made him come across in this movie. Lily Collins also did a fantastic job at showing us Liz's descent into depression, alcoholism and all that came with being in her shoes. But as much as I don't really like that we're glorifying serial killers with all these movies and documentaries, I understand the fascination. People love to watch evil on screen. Serial killers will always be ""good TV"".","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
270,richardslily,True to real life,8,4 May 2019,"I don't know if it's a good thing I watched the Netflix documentary on Ted Bundy before this movie came out. I knew all the twists and turns coming, but I also knew how accurate some of the scenes were (especially in the courtroom).It was very eerie just how much Zac Efron looked like Ted Bundy in a lot of the shots. Aswell as the mannerisms and the voice. He did well in a serious role although I thought the star of the movie was Lily Collins. The emotion she portrayed was so raw and believable.If you are expecting a film about Ted Bundy and his murders, you may be disappointed. Although all of the courtroom scenes were shown and very true to how they happened, the film really did revolve around Lily Collins (playing Ted's girlfriend Liz) and how it all affected her.I shed a tear at the end! It's such a powerful story and definitely one that will stay with me for a while.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
271,Nahid_15,Zac Efron really nails it,6,16 April 2020,"Such an odd tone for a movie like this, although it is a bold move. This isn't just another conventional psychological thriller. Rather they approach the story differently. The story told from Ted Bundy and Liz Kendall's point of view. So right off the bat, you should know that this movie isn't going to deal with the gruesome aspects that everyone usually expects from these kinds of storiesI love the cast. Zac nails the character so well that for a moment I was almost convinced there might be a slight chance that Ted was innocent, despite knowing about him before watching the movie. Lily Collins portrays a damaged character really well. Also Kaya Scodelario gives a decent performance.This movie had potential. I'm a bit disappointed because such a story deserves better. I feel like they go for so many shortcuts unnecessarily. It has some pacing issues and a poorly managed tone, but I enjoyed the movie regardless. I would say this is worth watching for Zac Efron's brilliant performance.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
272,ythecreator-61401,How a vile but capable mind will work to cover its real nature?,8,12 May 2020,"Note: If you will vote this review, read it completely before. Judge the arguments and not the rating.I think that is, at the end, the point of this movie. It is obviously not about the crimes per se, it is about the nature of wicked individuals and how their personalities would disguise their inner evil to make them appear something
that they are clearly not: ordinary people. Thus, making others empathize for them, feeling something for them, and affecting their lives negatively.
It is just a take on other side of well known events. And some people did miss the point here.I speak from the perspective of those -few, I presume- people that didn't know about the actual events before watching this film.
And I think that it helped to the immersion of the story, and definitely to understand the approach they took on this. I was during most part, rooting for Ted and believing he was actually innocent. And it's because of this, in part, that I can say they did a good work on showing how unsuspecting a different perspective can take us, without prior knowledge, to fall for it.
Because even the more evil ones can have people supporting them as it's shown here.
So, the mood of the movie does not come close to be wrongfully chosen or done, since it's basically a representation of what Ted Bundy really was.
A wolf disguised as sheep, or even as a clown I could say. He was definitely a disgrace, but his acts would ever reflect that. But quite the opposite.Technically speaking, it's of a high level. Consisting with a great cast and really good performances overall. The settings, the overall design, atmosphere and the recreation of the footage were on point.
Also, I think it's a good the approach they took for the direction and the editing, maybe something different.Then well, the movie maybe lacks of development in certain areas just as the relationships and the actual events. Possibly because of the limitations of time. There's ton of material, but this is not a documentary after all.I think this film definitely deserves a chance stripped of prejudice.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

As a period piece, the use of news videos to compliment everything has been very well done.
Although I find the story a little lacking. There are a lot of known details of what led him to that life, and it would have been interesting to include. I'm glad they didn't sensationalize or dramatize the murders.
Finally, Zac Efron shows a lot of power. I actually forgot this is not Ted Bundy at times. Incredibly well done sir...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

When you have such a horrific and master manipulating lead character, why do you show him when he's ONLY in control of his temper and in the best possible light?!

276,christianolivarez-78828,Hack Saw,6,9 May 2019,"So here we go. Zac Efron as the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy. Now I know that we have all been waiting for this movie for quite some time. Fortunately, we were lucky enough for it to be released on Netflix last week and have easy access. The girlfriend of Ted, Liz, is played by Lily Collins and is a very important part of the movie. So let's get to it.The movie follows Ted's entire trial and the murders have already been done. The movie picks up at where Ted Bundy is accused of the murders. I'm not going to lie. I was disappointed right off the bat because we already have this. Netflix already aired Conversations With A Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes and we know what happens in the trial. Don't get me wrong, as a stand alone movie it would have been good. Zac Efron was able to portray the charismatic personality of Bundy in a way that was a home-run. I know there was some hesitancy for him to play the part, but I think he nailed it. Lily Collins also played the role very well as the supportive girlfriend that was completely smitten by his charm. So A+ on casting.I think what we were all wanting to see was the monster that he was. I totally understand the whole ""Innocent man"" theme but we know what really happened and, again, we already saw the trial in the Netflix documentary. I was also kind of confused on what the film was getting at in the sub-text. Were we supposed to feel sorry for Bundy because he was so good at pretending to be an innocent man? Were we supposed to feel sorry for Liz because she had to put up with all of this? The problem was that there was no development of any of the characters. We never saw the monster serial killer that murdered dozens of woman. All we saw was the denial and portrayal that he did not do it. There isn't much to discuss in regards to a storyline.However, there was a glimpse at the end when Liz goes to see Bundy after he has been sentenced to death. Now he does still claim innocence for a little while but after consistent questioning on if he committed the murders by Liz, his eyes do go dark. After Liz shows him a picture of a woman who's head had been decapitated. A sawing sound overlays a scene where Bundy bludgeons a woman over the head and stuffs her into his trunk. He writes in the fog of the window that he did it with a hack saw. I immediately wanted more of that. I wanted for the stories and murders to be brought to life and shown. I don't care if that sounds sick but Ted Bundy was a monster and if you're not willing to watch what he did then why are we really watching this film. However, the movie moves to the end and the end credits role.Zac Efron consistently plays the good looking, charismatic, charming character and this movie was no different. Again, as a stand alone movie it was good. It would have had the question and doubt if he did it. The acting was good. Casting was good, but we know the story. That ending, if there had been more, would have given Efron more range and the audience more of what we expected from a film named Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. Overall a good movie but I'd have to give this a 6/10.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
277,stevenhorr,Original and Effective,9,4 May 2019,"For me, this style of story telling fits perfectly with the Ted Bundy story. I would recommend watching the Netflix documentary series first, as I did, to understand the severity of the crimes Bundy committed and to have background information regarding his court case fresh in your memory. This new movie account is from an interesting, more subtle, and valuable perspective, that of the lovers of Bundy. Efron does an amazing job of playing Bundy. He is more attractive and charming than Bundy was in real life, but this works to emphasize the charm, intelligence, and charisma that Bundy regularly employed to manipulate people. The acting is superb. It is a tremendous performance piece. Well worth the watch. This is recommended viewing, especially if you are interested in psychopaths and the lengths they will go to deceive, manipulate, and have godlike control over others.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
278,pcrime-17089,A great performance in a film that doesn't follow it's own plot,4,10 October 2020,"Billed as a film told from Liz Kendalls point of view you see hardly any of the relationship between her and Bundy, it skips ahead six years almost immediately. It feels like you are watching a film that is being fast forward every now and again so you get very little sense of the relationship bar the fact that he called her a lot from prison. The second half of the film is the court trial by which point Kendall had broken things off.
It doesn't show her doubts and indecision to the extent that a film focussed on her could have. In fact she isnt in it that much. There is also a fictionalised meeting at the end which is at odds with a film that sticks close to the facts the rest of the way through.Aside from some strong performances, especially Zac Efron this film is a scattered attempt at what could have been a great look at Liz Kendalls story.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

The actors did a phenomenal job and I was very happy with the adaptation. I almost feel they coukd have gone more into detail and turned this into a series. I'd ignore the negative reviews. Thise reviewers missed the point of the movie. They just wanted to see gore and they don't care about the psychology behind the man. This movie dives into his extreme sociopathic behavior and really shows us how charming he was unfortunately to people. He really was a vile human being because he was so calculated and cunning and he could manipulate people so easily. Interesting to watch and the actors were right on par!! Zac Effron deserves an Emmy!,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
280,dsare52,Not just about the murders,8,29 July 2019,"I think a lot of people criticizing the film forget in this film, the focus is on Liz not specifically on the murders, but more of how she saw him. Since she didn't know about them until it all came out I think it's fine they didn't go into detail about them. It would probably have been better as a mini series though!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
281,orbcardinal,Essential to learning about Ted Bundy,9,20 June 2019,"From all that has recently been brought back to light about Ted Bundy, this was a story I thought was essential to tell. For most people interested in learning about him, much of the media we are given is about how he killed and how he acted as a serial killer. We have very little insight into how he was still able to blend into society, moreover how he was even seen as an attractive and accomplished individual. This movie does a really great job at showing his ""humanity"" (choice words) as he was in a relationship and seen as a father figure to his fiancé's daughter. This overall is important to Bundy's story as what make him exceptionally dangerous was his ability to be seen and act as a normal person in society. That's more often than not what makes a serial killer even more terrifying, which is there ability to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Many other serial killers often were not seen as normal within their communities and were more easily distinguished from the ""normal, everyday"" person.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

This thriller keeps you in suspense and keeps you watching all the way through you can't take your eyes off the throbbing Efron and his glooming costar Lilly Collins. If you don't know much about this case then this movie is perfect. You're heart will feel not only for the women taken by his heinous crimes but along the way you're heart will somehow seem to feel for the killer himself with such a masterful play with emotion, Zac Efron has truly showcased his skills for acting.

286,jokeritt,Zac nails it,8,1 February 2019,People forget that Ted Bundy had a plea bargain for only life in prison with no death penalty. He refused it at the last minute which shocked the judge.

The casting is superb all round, not just because of the considerable talent on display, but also because of uncanny resemblance. It tells the story without showing any of the details of the horrific crimes, and showcases how difficult people found it to believe that Bundy could possibly be guilty of these crimes. It's a psychological study, and it certainly doesn't glamorize or excuse anything he did. It's a difficult one to review due to the nature of the movie, but well worth watching and superbly - and very carefully - done!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Therefore, the movie was easy for me to follow, even though it does flash back between his courtroom situation and real life events. I would recommend watching ""The Ted Bundy Tapes"" (also on Netflix), before this movie, if you are someone who does not already know the case. The 70s rock was a great addition and many of the songs stayed in my head for the remainder of the day. Zac Efron played Ted seamlessly. I have only seen Zac play heartthrob/frat-bro roles, so this was a fantastic role for him to expand his talent. His piercing blue eyes reminded me of the real Ted, especially in his jailhouse interviews. 7 out of 10. Was hoping for 10/10, but no matter what, I'm never a fan of flashbacks.

I believe the scene at the end, where he meets liz and finally confesses to her, did not actually happen but was added to give the audience closure and leave us in no doubt about what a monster bundy was. Listing the victims names was also very nice and respectful touch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

294,adisgolos,"Empty, Boring, Misleading, Pointless",2,4 January 2021,"If I didn't know who Bundy was, If I had not read about him, and watched documentaries, and If I had to make a conclusion based only on this film I wouldn't be sure that he committed any of the murders. Most of the film is about his relationship with 2 women, 99 % of the time he is nice, clever, educated young man. Even during the trial not much is said about his brutal murders and torture. Court scenes are just about a few cases where there is no single hard-direct evidence about his guilt. We don't see any of the murders, it was just presented in court that some witness recognized him (but it was also said that she was shown his photo before that). So the strongest evidence is one bite mark on one victim??? It resembles the shape of his teeth. Really? And shape of teeth of 10 million other people. Not a single of other 30 murders is even mentioned. We do know from other sources that he described in detail, many other murders with locations from which it is obvious that he DID kill all of them and probably many more. However this film did not mention any of them. What we are left with is insinuation that he was sentenced because of one bite mark and because he vaguely looks like a police sketch. What about other 30 murders? Well, since he is sentenced to death it is obvious when day of execution comes close he will be very motivated to admit any other murder just to postpone the execution with new trials which may last for years. And police would be happy to solve 30 murders at once. That is what this film vaguely insinuates or at least pushes us in that direction. Bundy might be innocent. In reality we do know that Bundy confessed in detail about many other murders in gruesome detail, mentioning victims, locations, MO etc which is a real evidence much stronger than one bite mark. However all of this was not even mentioned in this film. The direction is bad, many pointless trendy flashbacks, strange yellowish color, totally wrong selection of music...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
295,amelie_jones,Small changes could have made it a much better movie,4,13 October 2021,"I'd just watched the four part Netflix documentary before watching this movie. So I'd come in quite fresh with all the history and footage of Ted Bundy.The movie tries to show only the side of Bundy that himself was willing to show in his day to day life. I get it, but it falls flat. Zac Efron does an OK job but he mostly fails to capture the touch of madness that always transpired from TB's movement and manner of speaking. He doesn't forget he's Zac Efron, which became distracting. There's also the element of the movie trying to trap you into empathising with Bundy but on me it only had the effect of making me think ""wtf"" repeatedly.Lily Collins's part is bland considering how much of the movie it takes up. They didn't make Liz interesting at all. Her close ups and reactions are a bit pointless as they don't convey much of any feeling. She could've done more with the reaction shots and other scenes at her house.The music choices especially in the first half of the movie are baffling setting up a way too cheerful atmosphere for scenes that could've been used to build his creepy aura instead. He's not an art thief making a daring escape to our amusement. He's only one of the worst serial killers who sent the country into panic!One especially poorly worded scene is when Liz's friend speaks on the phone with Ted and tells him he needs to stop calling because ""you're killing her"". Worded in extremely poor taste.There's one scene towards the end where both Collins and Efron are utilised a bit better. But it's short lived and quickly dissipated. Liz just received some very disturbing information and we saw disturbing imagery but still she walks out to her friends smiling and saying she is OK. Girl, if ever was a time you were not OK, this is probably it.All in all with some tweaks this could've been a much better movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

297,carriemcsmith,Why oh Why do producers try to show an empathetic angle to these killers?,1,6 May 2019,"So I thought that Zac Ephron did an excellent job as Ted Bundy, and I did like aspects of this film, however I find it disappointing that this producer took a school girl view of Ted Bundy and portrayed him as a handsome man who was getting railroaded into these crimes that he didn't commit. We know he confessed to killing over 30 women in horrific ways, so I find it appalling when producers act as if they are Brad Pit getting wrongly accused of horrific crimes.
I just want a little outrage and sympathy for all the VICTIMS and their families who lost their daughters before their life had begun. He deserved to be roasted on a stick so it is disappointing when every one including the movie producer is awestruck by a serial killer.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I think that could be easily overlooked because of how handsome he is. Lily Collins was very good also.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
304,laurengamble83,Too Slow,6,3 May 2019,I gave it 6 stars for the fabulous acting but the film is far too slow and lacked depth. Disappointed.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
305,marielledeheij,Documentary is better,6,3 May 2019,"After seeing Joe Berlinger's incredible documentary and all the buzz around Zac Efron as Ted Bundy I was really excited to see this movie. I was hoping it would shed some more light on why Bundy did what he did and how he got away with it, as well as all this thing with girls being in love with him while he was on trial for murder.
After realizing the movie was based on Liz Kendall's book about her time with Bundy I expected the movie to focus on their relationship and how she found out that something was wrong. Also in the documentary it is stated that she found women's lingerie and other strange items in Bundy's appartment.
Instead, the movie sort of mixes both storylines. The crimes are only very briefly shown, the fact that he kept some of his victims heads and belongings isn't mentioned and it seems more about Bundy claiming his innocence. We all know he wasn't, so even though he did state he didn't do it, giving it so much time in the movie seems wrong.
Overall this movie left me pretty unsatisfied. The casting of the movie is really good, I already knew Zac Efron could be Bundy's long lost Son or something, the resemblance is kind of scary, the costume design department, locations and camera work are very good, it is just the script and storytelling that really put me off.
If you want to enjoy Zac Efron in seventies clothing though, go watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

If you didnt get it, the point of this movie is to make you like him and hate him at the same time. His evil acts make you want to see him fried, but his extreme charisma makes you root for him.

So the movie tries to do it for you, where half of you hates him and half of you love him. Effrons best performance i've seen.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

313,meanmrslinky,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Misunderstood and Vile",8,26 September 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile explores the double life of serial killer Ted Bundy and how he kept his dark secret from those closest to him; mainly his girlfriend, Liz. You rarely see the dark side of Bundy throughout the film. He appears to be a rather charming and witty young man with a nice girlfriend and bright future, but that all goes south (literally) as the law catches onto his gruesome crimes and he begins to flee across the country, earning himself a spot on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted.Zac Efron delivers a chilling performance as the manipulative killer, and is easily the highlight of the film. There are times where you want to believe him. That's how convincing he is. Lily Collins portrays Liz, who is, at first, oblivious to it all. That is until she sees Teds face in the papers, and grows skeptical. Collins displays the characters hesitancy and gradual realization of her lovers secret very well. Jim Parsons plays as the lawyer up against Bundy, and is excellent in revealing the shocking detail of Bundys crimes.Many have pegged this film as disrespectful to the real life victims of Bundy, but really it's just a brutally honest depiction of what the public believed him to be before he was proven guilty. It shows how one man can lie to and manipulate so many people, even with all the evidence piled against him.If you're looking for a movie filled with killing and violence, you will be disappointed. Again, this film mainly shows the friendlier side of Ted Bundy, and rarely shows his true colors. It is to represent the mask serial killers effortlessly hide under, and Bundy was the most convincing of them all. I recommend this to anyone who would enjoy a biographical film about a murderous psycho hiding in plain sight.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
314,macakanobi,"8/10 what to say,",10,6 May 2019,"I must start by saying I don't understand the bad reviews to this film..? I really think some audiences didn't get this movie. It wasn't about the crimes, it was about the man, the animal the monster and the effects from his arrest.In no way does this glorify Ted Bundy a name I believe no one should ever forget not should we forget the crimes he committed. It show how we truly do not always know the people we are around and maybe there's a lesson to be learnt from this. Ted Bundy was a charismatic, intellectual and handsome man.., on one side..! The other he was a crazed, dangerous and sick individual who committed horrific murders, this wasn't the gorey movie of his crimes we've seen done numerous times before, this was a portrayal and an insight into how the monster manipulated the people around..!I studied criminology, psychology and a little law over the years and I needed this film if I'm honest..!
I personally believe that it was refreshing seeing this point of view and brave..! Amazing performances all round I strongly recommend it for anyone who knows all about the crimes but nothing about the man. Some reviews stated it made you feel sorry for him and at the time that's exactly how he wanted people to see him, I would have liked more reasons behind him doing his crimes but I personally don't think we'll ever really know what drove him to do such evil..! I would put this film along side ""to catch a killer"" the John Wayne Gacey story..!Hope this helps","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

It's unfortunate that Zac Efron's and, other notable actors talents, were wasted on this project.

321,elliot-75668,Bundy Focus betrays movie's Core Aims,4,8 May 2019,"There's a morbid and macabre aspect of humanity that enjoys true crime, particularly that of serial killers. You can probably name quite a few from John Dillinger to Harold Shipman, but almost everyone in America, and most parts of the Western world, can name Ted Bundy. Ted Bundy's name has found itself back into the public consciousness following two highly publicised films/documentaries on Netflix about the notorious serial killer.This of course has been a subject of discussion and criticism as these two films have been accused of needlessly publicising and sexualising the killer but that is undoubtedly why so many of his victims fall prey to him (that and pretending to be handicapped). Portraying this without making Bundy seem appealing is a trap filmmakers have to avoid. They also have to avoid making this story about Bundy and despite assures from cast and crew to the contrary this movie does exactly that.To see this movie as a Ted Bundy (Zac Efron) tale as told from the eyes of his girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer (Lily Collins), is a lie. This is a Bundy movie because there is so much Bundy. Sometimes it's even just Bundy (taking away from the Elizabeth POV). There're times you almost even feel sympathy for him because of the sadness and anger he feels as the couple grow further and further apart. It's fact it's a long time before Elizabeth is the focus because the film is so dominated by Bundy. Inadvertently this movie gave Bundy the attention he would have wanted especially considering he's stealing the limelight from somebody else.I like to think that this film was made with the best possible intentions and it was one for the victims, but it doesn't feel that way. It doesn't feel like a film for the victims as it focuses too much on Bundy, treading familiar ground that anyone with a working knowledge of Bundy and his crimes will already know. The tone of film is odd (it's like a fun crime caper in the mold of Catch me If You Can), but the film avoids being grossly exploitative by focusing on Bundy's charm and charisma (which Efron captures very well) rather than depicting his gruesome murders in detail.Even despite that, it's far too long into the film before we begin to feel sympathy for Elizabeth. Lily Collins is fine in the film but the film's dedication to Efton's Bundy at the expense of Elizabeth (despite assurances that this won't happen) becomes the movie's downfall. As does the fact it's somewhat dull and the terrible cinematography during one of Bundy's conversations with Carole Ann Boone where the camera wouldn't stop circling the two for the entire duration of the scene. I hate that and always will.2/5","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

329,heldriver,Horrible editing,4,20 May 2019,"This movie isn't getting great reviews for a few reasons. Some reviewers want to see more gore, more action, but in my opinion this movie fails miserably in one aspect above all; the editing.
Right from the start it jumps from one thing to the other. It feels more like watching a trailer rather than a final cut of a movie. They also try and cram all kinds of music into the movie, and I don't mean original sound track. Sometimes it feels like the editor's only reason for throwing a song in there is because it's his/her favorite song and he/she really wants it in the movie. A good example of that is a part of a Metallica song, which doesn't even fit the period of the original story.
Talking about the story. The story is definitely there, but I for one probably wouldn't make much sense of this movie if I hadn't watch the documentary series ""Conversation with a Killer: The Ted Bundy tapes"" before watching this movie.
I do get what the film makers are trying to do, focusing on the people (Bundy and the people in his life) rather than the actual events, but I'm sorry to say they fail because of bad editing.
The 4 stars are for good/adequate acting and an interesting story, but honestly you're much better off watching the aforementioned documentary series.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

That it could be your family, your lover, your friend... that we must not close our eyes to the reality that theyd can be good looking or rich and that doesnt excuse them from murder. Or from violent acts or abuse.
Zac efron still couldnt reach the essence of ted bundy, but he approached much. Still doesn't satisfy me. I was more pleased with lily collins, but still always impecable and never risked more. It was a good movie, doesn't drive me crazy but good.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
334,d_cancelliere,Joe Berlinger's Best Movie,9,9 April 2019,"Saw this the other day at the CIFF and enjoyed every moment of it. Berlinger (Director) does an excellent job telling the story with flashbacks and real time moments alternating between the two. Love how this wasn't like the typical murderer movie, he has a different take on it, showing different viewpoints than the typical, don't want to say too much about it. Zac did a great job as Bundy, very hard role to pull off but he delivers a great performance. He may be too good looking and innoncent to play such a evil Ted Bundy, but that shows how good this kid can actually act. You have to look at him as a actor you haven't seen before to not be biased, forget that he was a Disney star and see him for a actor you pretend not to know of. People who are complaining that they fantasized Bundy too much do not know what they are talking about because Bundy was EXACTLY how they portrayed him. This world is just too sensitive and will raise a stink for anything that slightly offends them. Great movie will be a hit next month.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I liked that the director Joe Berlinger chose a different route and told the story from an out of the ordinary perspective. Zac Efron and Lilly Collins also did an amazing job at portraying their incredibly complex characters.

Bundy was a handsome well presented well spoken man who did attract women even drawing a fan base during his televised trial for his murderous activities. Not knowing like his long time girlfriend the full horror of what he did even believing he might even be innocent. Zac Efron earns his acting chops and does a fairly good job, the film is well made but those looking for evidence of the true horror of the crimes are better off with the 2002 film Ted Bundy.
Very watchable but leaving little impression once the titles had rolled.Nice cameos from the really nerdy one from The Big Bang Theory and the kid from The Sixth Sense (who is twenty years older rocking a great beard) and that Malocovich actor bloke.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
339,rebeccarage-11322,Shockingly unbelievable.,4,3 May 2019,"Ok as much as it pains me to write this I am extremely bored, shockingly disappointed and sad. I may have a different view to some of you as I've been super into the Bundy story for decades (yes I'm that old) Bundy was the person that got me into true crime in a big way, so to say I'm very familiar with the story is a huge understatement. So to start, I couldn't get passed the Efron, apart from his similar looks, all the while being way too buff to properly emulate Bundy, he also didn't nail any of his characteristics or charm. I felt like the pacing of the film was all wrong, I understand that Berlinger tried to get across that it was coming from Liz's point of view and complete denial that Ted had done anything wrong but he seemed to abandon that half way through and if you aren't Familiar with the Bundy crimes and timeline you aren't quite sure what he's really done and the magnitude of his crime, e.g the Carol Derauch story just being explaining as ""attempted abduction"" but that was nothing to how quickly they brushed over the Chi Omega massacre. I didn't for one minute get immersed into the story and forget that it was Zac Efron, it felt like watching a lifetime movie on channel 5, it was also a strange to show actual Bundy pictures when he was on the TV instead of Efron. Compared to the performance of say Cameron Britton as Ed Kemper in mindhunter where I actually feel that he embodied every part of him, this was totally amateur hour. The four part documentary that Berlinger made was bang on the money, as was his paradise lost documentary about the west Memphis three, so I know Berlinger has serious talent when it comes to showcasing true crime it's just a real shame that he couldn't transfer that to film as I really feel this didn't work on any basis.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
340,TorsoDahlia,"For Bundy beginners only, a boring mess",4,11 May 2019,"As a true crime buff Ted Bundy has always been the most interesting figure in my book. The term serial killer was coined by how he operated even though such killers were nothing new MO wise despite not have a definitive description. Ted Bundy changed all that. The difference with Bundy was he truly hid in plain sight and was a good looking guy, highly intelligent, manipulative albeit impulsive. He fooled everyone because then we were stupidly taught it cannot be the handsome guy with a seemingly bright future. How truly wrong we were.I went in hoping for a good portrayal and was severely disappointed. Perhaps, it is because there have been much better portrayals over the years by Mark Harmon (yes I am actually serious) for one in The Deliberate Stranger where he did not try to look like him completely but nailed the person. I felt Efron trying to be Ted by making faces. It highly annoyed me, I guess one could also note his limited acting chops contributed to the failure that is this mess.I will give Efron credit for Ted's crazy eyes. It is all he nails as his portrayal is dull, hollow and not very effective in anything besides trying to act like he is Ted Bundy. Inspired by Bundy's real life ex-girlfriend Liz Kloepher who wrote the great book The Phantom Prince under the pseudonym Elizabeth Kendall, this film is aimed at showing Ted from her point of view. Berlinger's shotty direction fails her as does the script. It feels like a bad B movie or Tv movie without any direction where things are rushed and not thought out.I recommend reading Ann Rule's classic The Stranger Beside Me, The Deliberate Stranger mini-series with Mark Harmon, or even a side view at Bundy when he was trying to help catch The Green River Killer from his jail cell which was played quite creepily at times by Cary Elwes in The Riverman. Still, if you want somewhat lookalike performance there is Efron's hollow Ted and over the top creepy Ted in the film Ted Bundy with actor Michael Reilly Burke who actually acted in that film and is much more believable despite how far they go into Ted's real depravity. To each his own, but avoid this one unless you want the quick, incomplete version without the feel.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

It's a film that literally makes you doubt something you know is true. Instead of showing how he did it, it shows you how he didn't. Which makes Zac Efron the perfect cast. I'm not a fan of his but he was great.Check it out not for an answer, but for the question.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

343,ladyamysta,Absolutely amazing!!,10,19 January 2021,"First of all, I want to start off with the observation that I have seen many negative remarks, and I happen to be among those who LOVED this film! The story seems disconnected at times, but this is by no means a documentary about Ted Bundy. This is a film about just how charming and insidious Ted Bundy was. It portrays how he can seem completely normal, yet at the same time he is utterly without conscience and is a sociopath. Zac Efron absolutely nailed that charming, handsome, intelligent side of Ted Bundy, and Lily Collins was completely convincing as Bundy's completely clueless girlfriend. I urge you to ignore the negative reviews and watch this film. It is literally one of the best films I've seen in years.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

One of the greatest aspects to this film is that it is able to put some humanity on a subject where it seems absent. The ending dialogue between him and his wife is both terrifying and tear jerking. The only real problems with the movie is the beginning was aqward editing wise and some of the song choices in the first half felt unessessary except to make room for the soundtrack. Other than that, this is a great film in the life of a ""unique"" individual.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
346,zender8584,Worth a watch,8,20 May 2019,"It's worth watching one of the many docs on Bundy first so you have a good sense of the history. I think the script presupposes you have at least a passing knowledge of the details. The acting, sets, art direction and atmosphere are top notch - it's really amazing how far streaming services have come attaching big name talent to even relatively small budget pictures. The drama really captures the charisma that Bundy was touted to have, and his power over women. It does not get into his psycopathy.Two minor things that take me out of period pieces in the 70s and early 80s are (1) anti-reflective coating on people's glasses - I realize they make film making easier. (2) women with perfectly shaped eyebrows. Again, I know the film was made in 2018 not 1978 and these actresses are not living in the 70s.

When watching the tapes first, all the holes are filled in, in the movie, but if you watch the movie first, some details might seem confusingFor people who think that Zac is not fitting in the role, I must disagree. When you watch the documentary, Ted Bundy was a charming and handsome man. He was this type of guy, and he charmed his way to most of his victims.Overall i think both the Ted Bundy tapes and this movie are a great representation and view on the Ted Bundy Crimes.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

To be honest even though I knew that he did do it, Zac Efron played him so well that I started to believe that he didn't do it, just like the real Ted Bundy tried to do, and then the ending when he writes the word 'hacksaw' on the window made me feel sick and I instantly started to hate him.

It is neither sugar- coated nor disrespectful to his victims. It focuses on the relationship between Bundy and the only women he attempted to live with as a ""normal"" man. I found it fascinating to see how the public foolishly falls for charm and good looks , willingly disregarding evidence to embrace notoriety with a wink and a nod. No slasher movie here; just a well-acted glimpse at the lives touched by Bundy's madness in ways other than murder. Lily Collins is excellent, and Zac Ephron is the best actor yet to portray the twisted personality that charmed even a seasoned judge into praising the damned and doomed Bundy.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

357,solomonmethod,Did He Really Love Her?,10,29 March 2021,"Ted Bundy was a textbook sociopath. By definition he couldn't possibly have loved Liz Kendall. Sociopaths collect trophies. Liz and her child were nothing more than that to him. Ted only cared about his own self. His entire purpose in life was to stroke his own ego. At best Liz and her child was an experiment to see what having something normal would be like. Maybe having certain people in his life that he could hide something from gave him a rush. If anything though, they were an object that was in his grasp, not people to be adored.Just like a true sociopath, Ted said and did whatever he felt he needed to in order to make the gains that he wanted. He may have looked and acted like someone with feelings and attachments, but trust me, he'd never cry over your loss. If he ever shed a tear, it's because he didn't get what he wanted.Thus movie perfectly depicts what a sociopath's behaviour is like. It also shows how the police and judicial system tended to railroad and manipulate suspects. Police leading witnesses, media circuses in the courtroom, inept attorney representation, yet he still was convicted.I could watch this movie over and over and never get sick of it. The direction, the acting, the art direction, editing, all of it was spot on.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

How he was truly unique and how he fooled everyone until up to his death. How even after he admitted to killing 30 people he is suspected of killing many more that will be cold cases until technology allows.
This movie is not about the murders but how he fooled the public as he murdered. This portrayal from Zac Efron is absolutely amazing. Ted Bundy was handsom, intelligent, charismatic, charming, and able to fool everyone though beneath that exterior was a true monster.
I know that most would want to see the murders but to see and even feel the way the director makes you feel throughout the movie is a wonderful experience one I truly recommend. Even if only once to see the growth of Zac Efron into a mature actor.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

362,erinmlandry,Had potential.,6,6 May 2019,"This film is pretty decent. Zac Efron does a fantastic job at portraying Bundy. He is charming and charismatic- you almost find yourself feeling sympathy for him throughout the film (which is a good thing- this is the effect Bundy had on people in real life).The film was a little choppy and poorly executed at the beginning. It was hard to follow what was going on and it felt like a poorly edited YouTube video, cutting every 5 seconds to something different. The ending of the movie was pretty good.I felt this film lacked a lot about the story of Ted Bundy and his victims. It focused a lot on his relationship with Liz, which was nice to see a lot of her side of the story. But, that being said, there were a lot of details that weren't mentioned about the actual case. The film barely, if at all, touched on the actual crimes he committed. The Utah court scene was way too rushed. If you aren't familiar with the specific and gruesome details of this case, you may feel a little confused or taken back because once again, this movie focuses way too much on the relationship of Ted and Liz.If they would've made it less choppy, and added coverage on the crimes he committed and what happened leading up to them- where he was, what he told Liz, etc... this would've been much better.Kudos to the actors in this film. They all performed stunningly. The actual story just wasn't told the way I was personally hoping. I mean, this is one of the most brutal murder cases ever seen in the US and how long Bundy got away with it stills blows everyone's minds to this day. It lacked in that department.Good watch overall. If you aren't familiar with this story, read up on it or listen to a true crime podcast first.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
363,jmateog,You better see a Ted Bundy Documentary,4,7 May 2019,"This movie created a lot of expectations however I don't think anyone would expect Oscar buff on it. Zac Efron is just ... bad ... I really like his career but when he tries to perform serious and challenging characters he just can't. His performance in some scenes contradicts the tone of the movie, he didn't even try to do the Ted Bundy real accent, he was just performing himself with strange faces. I didn't even feel attracted nor scare by him, which was the kind of reaction the real Ted Bundy took out of people. I was thinking by his 30's, Zac Efron would be able to carry a movie by himself but he is not ready yet, he is still living with the High School Musical shadow. Even the talented Lily Collins wasn't at her best, the same goes to Kaya Scodelario, Jim Parsons and Haley Joel. The director and the writer well ... they made the movie which is something! Sometimes the dialogues were stupid but other times were nice, specially those 20 final minutes were the director really made a great work alongside the script which was very good at that final scene when Zac and Lily confront themselves, because of that I give a 6/10 to this movie and not a 4 or 5. As a conclusion, Ted Bundy story is better to examine it by reading books or watching documentaries, this film will probably win some teen choice awards but hasn't but nothing more ...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Zac Effron was quite the revelation in this role,which is as far removed from High School Musical as it gets.
He was a stand out performer in this film and you actually forget that it's him you are watching .
It's a very up close and personal adaptation without all the gore and violence of the murders and more of a veiw into the psyche of Ted Bundy,his personal relationships and his narcissism and the follies of his over estimation of his intelligence and abilities as a lawyer representing himself
So dont be put off with your preconceptions about Zac Effron, because he smashes this 1 out of the park and it is indeed a very good thought provoking film about a very charismatic and despicable human being who pulled the wool over everyone's eyes","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

366,admtech69,Accurate portrayal of the 70s but with a 2019 attention span,6,3 May 2019,"The movie is extremely disjointed and seems to be a series of set pieces versus a coherent story line where we slowly realize the depth of Bundy's depravity. Yes, we know in real life Bundy was a charming psychopath but it would have been more enjoyable to watch him slowly unveil himself as the monster he was. We know pretty much at the outset that he is a 2-faced psycho with cops and detectives hot on his trail from the first sequence. The cinematography and sets capture the look of the 70s but the pace is too frenetic with too many jump cuts and pseudo cinéma vérité camera work. The entire atmosphere is strangely cheery with upbeat 70s pop music in light of the dark and heavy material. Bundy's ability to charm his actual victims isn't really given much exposure versus his immediate family and the legal system which he manipulated. Zac Efron, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Bundy, gives a decent performance and was a good casting choice. The courtroom scenes that make up the third act are where the film finally finds it's feet. If you are familiar with the actual case, you may be disappointed with how the plot unfolds. If not, you should come away with a better understanding of the case but with little knowledge of his many victims. Recommended with these caveats.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

They tried to cram all of these decades long events into a little less than 2 hrs. What is the result - a fragmented view on of one of the worst serial killers and psychopaths in the recent history. The movie is all over the place; I don't know if they wanted the focus to be on the girlfriend, on the murders, on his psychopathy, or on the trial. That's because they had no focus. This is one lousy movie from beginning to end, storytelling-wise.I always hate it when they make crappy movies out of true events which were documented in detail both in video and in writing. And Zac did a really good job in portraying him and would have done an even better job if the script was better.
Their resemblance is uncanny.This should have been a miniseries. You can't cram 30 years of someone's complicated personal and criminal life into 2 hrs and expect a well-rounded, fulfilling story.Very disappointing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Harmon nailed the chameleon persona 40 years ago. I was sure then, & I remain convinced, no one will ever be able to duplicate that performance. Harmon had the benefit of Bundy still being alive. Efron was born 2 years before Bundy would be executed & only had historical footage. There's nothing like working with an egotistical narcissist.

Bundy's wove his deceitful tapestry driven by the self-centered belief that he was superior in intellect to all those around him - this delusion was a result of his own falsehood about his self-worth, somewhat fueled by his studies - Chinese, later psychology and then later he was accepted into law school - but also his political career as he was serving assistant to the republican party in Washington. None of this is outlined in the film, which is a shame, but this is Hollywood.Still, the message is clear; never trust those who cast doubt in you because they seem to good to be true. Because there is a good chance you are right. In today's world of social media, it may appear easy to check someone out before dating them. and those who do not leave an online footprint are also easily sussed out too, so nothing to worry about right?Wrong.

They make him seem innocent even to the audience watching the movie. They in no way make him seem menacing or threatening in anyway. They should have made some attempt to make you see he was putting on a farce to trick people. Maybe even show him stalking women or even tricking one to his car and leaving it to our imagination. You might as well just watch the Cuba gooding OJ movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

376,cbcollins,Lacking,5,5 May 2019,It's a good film in a 'shall we grab a movie' sort of way. However the story of Ted Bundy has far more too it than this film suggests. Not sure why it was made.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
377,reellysayingsomething,A Compelling Must-See,10,12 May 2019,"Ok; so first off, this movie was going to be an extremely difficult movie to make but I think that they got the balance just right as right as can be at least. Ted Bundy the serial killer is extremely iconic, the whole universe is aware of what Ted Bundy did, so it was extremely difficult for this movie to tell the Ted Bundy story from the angle that they did because to be honest just from what I saw in this movie, I for one was most definitely questioning the guilty verdict cause the evidence that's presented in the court scenes is highly circumstantial. By the way, this movie does not show any of the gruesome murders taking place (well, nothing worth talking about anyway). I thought that this movie was extremely well made. It focuses on as I said Ted Bundys girlfriends perspective And it also focuses in on the court case which was the very first case to be televised right through to the verdict and the then outcome of the verdict. This movie is extremely riveting, enthralling & so interesting. Now this movie is not perfect in that it leaves an enormous amount of questions unanswered but for whatever reasons weather they had to obey the confines of a book or maybe for legal reasons couldn't highlight certain aspects; never the less, it is a must-see.
Zac Efron who is normally attached to Jackass American comedies does an extraordinary job here, he is extremely credible & most certainly worthy of an Oscar nod And I for one would like Zac Efron to take on more serious roles in future And I've always said for years now what an extremely talented actor he really is. Lily Collins delivers the most exceptionally outstanding performance. It must have been an exceptionally difficult part to play playing second fiddle to Zac Efron ie in the shadow of Ted Bundy, but being extremely instrumental & relevant at the same time; the same way as Alicia Vikander shadowing Eddie Redmaye in The Danish Girl. I hope that Lily Collins gets the recognition she truly deserves for delivering such a remarkable performance. Worth mentioning also is Kaya Scodelario as Ted Bundys other love interest who is extremely credible. In the mix also is John Malkovich as John Malkovich, and watch out for an all grown-up bearded Halely Joel Osment.

378,ferinkyra,"Superb acting, shot wonderfully, boring",4,7 May 2019,"I can appreciate that the director may have been trying to highlight Bundy's seemingly ""normal"" appearance and life and his charisma, but the plot fell flat. While they didn't need to get into gore, they basically skipped the severity of the crimes he committed and how he got away with it/moved from place to place. Having seen the Bundy Tapes, I was expecting more, especially since the acting was SO GOOD. Efron's Bundy was on point. Sadly, it was just really boring to watch and it felt rushed. The last 15 minutes was probably the most compelling part of the film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
379,T0mmj,Great,9,25 March 2021,"I really like this movie, it does a good job of showing that a seemingly normal and charming person could in reality be horrible. You can see Ted unintentionally revealing how narcissistic he really is as people discover more and more about him and his crimes. Some things in the movie didn't really happen or were exaggerated but that's to be expected in a movie. If you want to see something more accurate I recommend Conversations With A Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes
I recommend this movie for anyone interested in serial killers.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
380,HitsMan1307,Excellent Portrayal of Bundy's Charm,8,18 May 2019,"Having heard of Ted Bundy before and seeing various documentaries, the great thing about Extremely Wicked, Shocking and Vile is that it does something none of the others have done, and that is make the audience believe Bundy didn't do it.Throughout the movie, I was taken in by Ted's charm, almost to the point where if I didn't have any prior knowledge, I would have believed he was innocent. Such was his charm and intelligence that Zac Efron did an excellent job of bringing those traits to the core of his character. Having watched this with someone who didn't know anything about it, they were stunned as they were on the fence until the very end.The slight disappointment I had was with the reveal and lack of scenes which really showed the gruesome side of Bundy that he so expertly covered, but also my main gripe is with the Marketing team who delivered a poor trailer to the movie, seemingly making it look like a comedy when in actuality, the movie was anything but.It's actually a very intense but enjoyable movie and Efron and Collins were formidable throughout. All in all, a brilliant performance.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
381,semper-fi-3316,Mediocre at best,6,5 May 2019,"Don't look for gruesome images in this movie. It's a psychology rapport of a serial killer, and onley from his charming side, and not his sadistic side.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
382,digitaljon2000,"Not bad, could have been better.",6,6 May 2019,"Not as good as I thought it might be, although Efron played a very good part in it. Whilst it brushed over his heinous and gratuitous crimes, it focused too much on his life before and during the trial.It should have at least included parts where he admitted the remaining murders. 6/10 a stretch to 7.Furthermore, his attempts and success to escape custody was not really shown well in the film, other than time scales and a brief showing of how he did it.The talk between his first love (Collins) was quite tense, and well done when she was finally relieved of her pain.It was certainly worth watching, but I preferred the Tapes over the film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
383,coffeegato,"Superbly Acted Drama, Overview of Ted Bundy",10,9 September 2019,"This is a chilling look at Ted Bundy from multiple perspectives. It is not a biopic, a case study, or a blow by blow account; it is an overview of the events and a cautionary tale about how easily we can be fooled and that is what makes it truly terrifying.
My husband and I lived through these events like the millions of other Americans who had no personal involvement in this case. You would see things in the paper, on tv, and your heart would sink for the victims and their loved ones.
You would see this charismatic, intelligent man who was also a manipulative, narcissistic socio/psychopath and start to understand how he could fool people for so long.
What this movie does brilliantly, because it is based loosely on his long term girlfriend's book, is show just that. It does not glorify him or disrespect the victims, imo. In fact, when you see the 30 known victims names on screen and realize how small the letters are in order to fit them all in one shot, and also understand authorities believe there are more, it drives home the scope of this man's heinous crimes.
This film is basically 2 parts and unfolds in the way it did for a lot of us. We didn't have every detail, but what we did know was gut wrenching and heart breaking. When you watch the first half, an ordinary women meeting a charming man, falling in love, living a life with him and seeing his (unbeknownst to her) crimes being revealed through the media, it is a startling juxtaposition of her perception and what actually is. I kept thinking how horrifying those memories must be for her and her child in hindsight. They don't go deeply into the ""offness"" she saw in him now and again, but stick with the rose colored glasses view she had of him because he was a master manipulator, which they drive home with the second part of this film. You see him lost in his arrogance, trying to use and fool everyone from the people in the courtroom, to his new girlfriend, and us - the tv viewer.
Zac Efron absolutely nails the multiple facets of this man's deeply disturbing psychopathy hidden beneath masks and a handsome face. The cast delivers spot on performances, even if they don't always physically match the real people. They portray the essence of the people and in the end if you watch this film understanding you are getting an overview, basically what we saw unfold in the press plus some fly on the wall moments from his girlfriend's perspective, I can't imagine you will feel disappointed. Again, this is not meant to educate you on his crimes or the lives of his victims that were cut so brutally short. There are many other films that do that, so this is a new and different approach. This is an interesting and chilling drama that reminds the viewer how easily any one of us could fall prey to a master manipulator, a monster with a handsome face. Truly terrifying.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
384,Prex_28,Ted Boredom.,6,18 October 2019,"First, I have to say that I'm an italian guy and the title has been translated in total different way: ""Ted Bundy - Criminal Charm"". I just remebered now the original title of the movie and I have to say that it's inappropriate. There's literally nothing shocking, not even a single drop of blood. I felt like the film has been ""censored""; the director has chosen not to show us a simple act of the protagonist that it's really vile, that would have shocked us. Zac and the whole cast have done a marvelous job but the film is lacking in something. It's not just the violent part, but even the mentality of the serial killer. Okay, I have to say it, I'm fresh from Mindhunter so my expectation are quite ""high"" but I found this depiction of Ted Bundy really corny and censored.The only good thing is the soundtrack.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
385,mikaylareinert,Wonderfully Done,10,6 May 2019,"This movie was very well done. I highly recommend watching the documentary that Netflix put out a few months ago before watching the movie, it made the timeline and the characters in the movie much easier to follow and identify. The comparisons between Zach Effrons performance and the actual interview footage of Bundy is so spot on I can't even believe it. Great job casting.The point of this movie in my opinion was not to make a terrifying movie showing murders but more the relationship between Ted Bundy and the public and details of the trial itself and how incredibly backwards it was. I think people were expecting more of dark twisted murder movie but I love how they decided to highlight how his case was handled instead and showing all the mistakes that were made.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
386,sarahbdrymon,Missed opportunity,4,4 May 2019,"While this movie is watchable, the acting is good, the story progresses, if you know anything about Bundy and his crimes and life you will be scratching your head wondering why they didn't truly show the evil of this man. Very misleading title in the least eh?There is already a great 2002 movie about Ted Bundy so if they wanted one from his girlfriends perspective they could of really showed just how he was able to be the chameleon he was so famous for being. The many faces of Ted Bundy. They only slightly touched on that. While going through their relationship they could've shown what he was really up to and just exactly how easy it was for him to do and just how damn clueless she was to him doing it.All in all, watch it if you just want Bundy content because it isn't terrible but you won't learn anything new. Zach Efron is a good actor though. I enjoy him. What a waste!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
387,elissonvrp,This movie is not about death,8,11 December 2019,"This movie is not about death or murderes.
The movie is about how persuasive he was and i think he acomplished this objective.
Zac Efron was really good, probably his best performance. Lily Collins is great.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
388,Sakura_Cyborg,Felt something was missing,7,1 August 2019,"I enjoyed this movie. It is well made and the performances are strong. However, there are a few points that kept me from giving the film a higher rating. First of all, I think that ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" fails to sufficiently portray Bundy's contradictory character. Instead of really showing his ""extremely wicked and shockingly evil"" character, the film primarily focuses on his role as a sweet boyfriend and charismatic ladies' man. Unfortunately, the viewer never really sees his diabolic side. Not that I'm a fan of horror or gory images, but I think that this would have made Efron's portrayal of Bundy's character even more fascinating.I also think that the movie sometimes felt a bit too light-hearted (comical almost), which didn't really match the subject of the film. In fact, I sometimes got the impression that this is the story of a conman in the likes of DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can, but not the story of a mass murderer. Furthermore, the first part of the film feels rushed and seems to have no clear focus. The story jumps from scene to scene without ever examining any aspect of Bundy's life in detail. It was particularly strange that his mother suddenly showed up at the end of the film for just a brief moment. I have no idea why they included her as she didn't seem to be important for the development of the story at this point.In my opinion, they should have either shown a broader spectrum of Bundy's actions (including at least some of the crimes) or just focus on the court scenes. The later scenes in court are in fact great, and it saved the film for me. Overall, ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" is a good film in my opinion.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

390,cindygrenchhoff,Exceptionally Well Done,10,11 May 2019,"Complaining about the movie not showing actual murders means that you're complaining about not having rape scenes to watch. I'm glad they portrayed the movie the way they did. It focused on his devilish ways of seduction and how he had his girlfriend and everyone else fooled till the very end by his good guy demeanor. The movie gives a strong message to always keep an eye out because murderers don't have sharp claws or blood dripping out of their mouths, they are just like everyone else.
10/10 I would recommend this movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
391,Lycangeist,"Well acted, but a bit dull.",5,8 May 2019,"Its not a terrible movie, Effron and the other members of the cast are great. It feels more of a drama, so if you're going into this hoping to quench your bloodlust, you'll be disappointed. It concerns itself more with the manipulative behavior of Bundy, and the people close to him. As opposed to detailing his actual crimes.Id probably also recommend doing a bit of research on Ted before watching, its bit easier to follow if you're familiar with the story already.Decent film, well acted, just a bit of a slow burn.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

393,mitane,It's based on.. NOT a documentary;,7,14 May 2019,"But it's freaking close!
It's always important to remember, that these kind of movies ISN'T a direct documentary, but only ""based on"". This movie ISN'T based on Ted Bundys life, but the book ""The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy"" written by Elizabeth Kendall.Back to the movie review;
I like Zac Efron. I love Lily Collins. And what a couple! Zac Efron was insane. In the start, it feels like it's going to fast, and I really hate that! But it works here, because they wanted (at least i think) to focus more on the (let's face it) interesting stuff. It really make sense, but I think it ended up, focussing to much on the courtroom scenes.
And I really LOVE when these ""very highly based on reality"" movies end with a ""follow up "" like this.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
394,mounirbousadik,Not enough,4,4 May 2019,"The movie was not powerful enough emotionnaly despite the huge potential, it's rushed and very important details are missing. I think a 4 or 6 episodes series would've been more relevant","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
395,andrewhuk,Efron astounds in a sadly messy affair,5,22 February 2020,"It's hard to believe after all this time there hasn't been one defining dramatic retelling of the Ted Bundy story, given we have an extraordinary story here that couldn't be more perfectly suited to the big screen and couldn't be made any more shocking with fiction (something I think the recent Netflix docu-series demonstrates very convincingly). Perhaps the problem has understandably been the sensitive nature of the tragedy, still, even now, all too real and painful to those most directly affected and perhaps a reluctance on the part of the most respected of filmmakers to be seen as holding a torch for Mr. Bundys continued legacy. Whatever the case may be, if this harrowing and twisted story is to be retold at all, it needs to be retold properly, with the gusto and conviction and horrifying realism that it demands. It simply deserves nothing less. The victims and those whose lives were smashed into pieces deserve nothing less, if it is to be retold at all.You get the feeling watching Extremely Wicked... that this kind of ambition was never there from the start, and perhaps the weight of responsibility to tell this story in the right way was either distracting or devoid, and the film certainly suffers as a result. We find ourselves being thrown between characters, never quite establishing exactly whose story is being told here or who we are supposed to be rooting for (which really shouldn't be so unclear at this point). This dizzying lack of focus is the one flaw that lets the film down the most and ensures you are never fully immersed in the unraveling events.The film is all too often let down by a script which should be razor sharp, given the amount of real life testimony and footage we have, but feels so awfully fluffy that you have to wonder what the writers were thinking. Several moments caused me to physically cringe at how bad the dialogue was. It's something which seems really hard to forgive, given the subject matter. There's also a B movie quality that runs throughout the film which I don't believe is a stylistic choice. It just isn't quite where it should be, technically or otherwise, which is a real shame.Thank goodness for Zac Efron then, who (alongside Lily Collins) saves the film from completely disappearing inside itself. Let's be clear, Zac Efron is really good as Ted Bundy. Unnervingly good. Every moment he's on screen he has exactly the kind of hold on you that you don't want to believe Bundy himself would have had, which is how you encapsulate a character. Sadly though the supporting cast put in less than convincing or absorbing performances at best, and are just bad at worst. Without wanting to go into specifics, some of the cast look about as disinterested as you possibly could without dropping off to sleep. It's a shame then, in a film where Efron seems to be giving it his all, and is so very good, that everyone else seems to be going through the motions.What the film can be commended for is not shying away from portraying Bundy as a human being, living some kind of normalised life. If anything the film probably over relies on that device a bit too much, as if to be making the ""he just seemed like one of us"" point to excess. What is lacking as well, regrettably, is any kind of attempt to poke beneath the surface.Ultimately, Extremely Wicked... is a very perfunctory telling of a story that is anything but, and that's a real shame.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

400,eivindtoft,Extremely confusing storyline,4,4 May 2019,"So you have Ted Bundy. One of the worst serial killers of all time with over 30 victims on his conscience.. We all watched the intriguing documentary and we all thougt the same.. This is fantastic-movie material. From his early years, charming everyone, through increasingly psycopathic behavior and countless murders, before eventually ending up in the chair..This is NOT a movie where jump-scenes should appear frequently, but unfortunately it does.. The movie starts promisingly in a bar in Seattle, where Liz meets Ted for the first time. They hook up, and the foundation is set for a morbid ride through a serial killers perspective.. But insted they jump right to the trial, and from there jumping back and forth in meaningless matter..If people for any reason, didnt know about Ted Bundy and his crimes, they would have left this viewing with a question mark.. ""Is he innocent?"" I havent seen him killing anyone""? I understand that the director wanted to focus on Bundys relations, but its just a big mistake in this landscape..This could have been a fantasic thriller with extreme suspense! Insted it rolls out to be a forgettable and frankly boring movie with a confusing storyline.. If you still want to watch it, dont get on the toilet without pausing it.

402,melnanwil,Victims are not plot,3,7 August 2020,"I am only rating this movie with three stars because the actors did a great job. I cannot condone, however, the blatant disrespect to bundy's victims. I watched the full film hoping that maybe the women who died horrible and harrowing deaths at his hands would be paid more homage. They absolutely were not. The only times they were mentioned, was for plot devices. I get it, the friends and families of these heinous criminals are not the perpetrators, and should never be treated as such. Their pain is great in different ways, but they did not die at his hands, they did not feel the strangle as he tightened their nylons around their throats. Their absolute suffering should not have been. Pushed aside... but the ignorance the writers gave to the women that suffered so intensely, and directly, from his crimes were done an horrific injustice in this film. Never have I felt so sour after the end of a movie. I was repulsed by the lack of respect to Ted Bundy's victims. The showing of a crime scene photo at the end, and The ""heroic"" undertones of the score while his ex hugged her friends outside the prison upset me greatly. The Mark was so incredibly missed. I sincerely hope the writers can take an iota of advice from this review, and never use actual victims of unspeakable crimes as plot drivers, ever again.Do not watch this film if you have ever craved justice for the victims of Bundy's violence. This is only a film glorifying his intimate relationships with women he did not brutally murder.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Well, Zac Efron did an incredible job portraying this character who was dangerous and evil but masked with a ""good guy"" facade. It really shows you how anyone could be a killer, anyone.. no matter how they look or how well you think you know them. I also appreciated how they respected the victims and the victims' families by not showing graphically how the murders happened.

409,RosieKeogh,Beyond Disappointed,1,27 May 2019,"If I wanted a film with a stupid love triangle that is extremely frustrating, repetitive and disappointing I would have rewatched 'Twilight.'This is not factually accurate, it plays out as more of a romantic drama than a thriller. Zero justice for any of the actual victims of Bundy's horrific crimes. It's just one very long, boring version of court room events where Zac Efron flirts with tonnes of girls and denies doing anything. I don't think Efron was able to portray this monstrous man accurately. Efron is a good actor it just isn't a true portrayal of Bundy. Bundy was cold and emotionless, he did not cry or show any emotion other than his smug, arrogance in the courtroom. It's clear from the real footage in doco that this films depiction of Ted is completely contrived.Maybe if I hadn't seen the documentary I would have been able to sympathize more with Ted. Once you see what this man did it is VERY hard to unsee that. The only reason I gave one star is because the last five minutes was okay. It's a shame the rest of the film was not depicted in a more accurate way, this could have been a great thriller.If you haven't already watch the documentary of the Ted Bundy Tapes, please do. If you have and you are considering watching this, avoid at all costs. It will only leave you frustrated, angry and extremely disappointed.If you watch this before the documentary, you will probably finish the doco very confused. You also might think ""Why on earth did they alter events and change facts in the movie to make this guy more likable? I don't get it, he's a monster who raped, killed and had sex with corpses."" I hear you, I hear you.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Shows a different perspective that at first I was unsure off. Kinda comes in slow but the last few acts end with a bang. The acting was absolutely fantastic. Not just from Effron but from all actors and actresses. Overall, particularly if you know the back story of Bundy this movie will leave you satisfied. Even if he was a monster. Which he was.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
411,surfie_chick_101,Not what I expected,6,3 May 2019,"Hmm. This movie was not what I expected. Nothing was developed and it was more a series of events which focused on the love story. It didn't show Ted's evil side until one scene about the hacksaw. I can understand the writer's point of view of wanting to do this affect to show what a liar he was, and him not admitting until the end that he was guilty. I was disappointed it didn't show his relationship with any of his victims or how he killed them, it just showed photos in a court case. I think if it portrayed more of what happened to the victims and how he did it, it would depict his double life and be more shocking to watch. Overall I wasn't gripped in the story and think it could have focused on certain scenes more instead of jumping from scene to scene. This man was evil and the movie should portray how evil he was.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
412,filip-scherhaufer,We've seen this already,7,6 May 2019,"While I'm impressed with Joe Berlinger's directional choice for this film, it ultimately lacks many elements that would make this retelling spectacular. Don't expect to go inside the mind of a killer. Berlinger focuses here on a public perception of a charming man, that is somehow accused of a lot of awfull crimes. That brings out amazing atmosphere that fantastically culminates in the third act. Zack Efron is magnificent and definitely stands out the most. Just a bummer, that the script couldn't give him a bit more to do and to really show what the title of the film represents. 7/10","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
413,anadani98,Shocking.,9,5 August 2019,It has been a while since I left the movies this shocked. The movie is very well done and I liked the fact that it was not a typical serial killer movie showing the actual murders. The confession at the end is what makes watching the movie worth it.

It's a good movie to watch if you're interested in the story of Ted Bundy. This movie takes a different angle and focuses on his life with his girlfriend and the trial around the murders.Some factual errors and poor casting decisions hurt the movie in my opinion.I'm not sure I should mention what facts they got wrong but I'd like to say, John Malkovich played John Malkovich being a judge and not the judge from Ted Buddy's case. It's was quite annoying and distracting.Otherwise some great scenes and enjoyable.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

420,Lt_Columbo_007,"If I'd wanted a courtroom drama, I wouldn't have paid my rent this month",6,11 May 2019,"My expectations were about as high as Danny DeVito going into this film. The last Efron feature I suffered, 'Baywatch', brings back harrowing memories of evenings spent over the toilet bowl, whilst the idea of Jim Parsons as a prosecution lawyer had me excitedly reconsidering my own chances in the casting director field . And to top it all off, a 'Sky Cinema Original', which normally has me running for the hills at a pace Usain Bolt would be proud of. But hey. Lily Collins is hot and the chance to see John Malkovich in anything is nothing short of a miracle, following 'Johnny English'. So what the hell.The first thing to know about this film is that it is slow. And when I say slow, I'm talking Adam-Sandler-box-office-gross slow. No hyperactive slasher here, those hoping to be scared out of their skin should instead reacquaint themselves with their choice of Steven Seagal's body of work. Instead, this is a character study that evolves into a courtroom drama - who saw that coming? Can someone remind director Joe Berlinger that the plot twists are supposed to be IN the script?It does get better as it goes on. I noticed my yawns were becoming more spread out as the film entered it's final act, with a really powerful final scene that managed to tear my eyes away from 'Angry Birds' for five whole minutes. After ten years of movie-making, Zac Efron finally establishes some acting credentials. I look forward to the next addition to his portfolio in 2029.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Maybe Ted bundy was innocent,all we see and we know for sure is that he was a good man and he loved Liz.

424,nm3160113,A entertaining psychological thriller without a twist,8,12 May 2019,I like the way this film focuses on the people who were close to him who had to come to terms with who he really was rather than focus too much on the crimes themselves. It makes for a more interesting and original murder film as usually it is done from the killers perspective or more commonly from the detective's perspective.The acting is very good through out especially the lead and both the 70s look of the film and shooting style made the film an easy watch. Only problem is its essentially a thriller without a twist so the plot is actually just a straight line. All the interest comes from the characters around Bundy and how they react to everything.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
425,louiefanatic,Great film shown from a different perspective,9,3 May 2019,"Ive seen a lot of negative reviews, all focusing on the fact that this film doesn't depict the crimes and shows Bundy's nice side and is about the love story. Yes, it's about the fact that he was charasmatic, that he continually denied his crimes, his intelligence and his showmanship that resulted in his downfall as much as his crimes.This is not a gore film, if you want you see pictures of the crimes or recreations of the truly disgusting things he did, watch the documentary or go online.
This film was a fresh take on a well known story. A lot of ppl have also pointed out that there are factual inaccuracies, well this is NOT a documentary, so poetic licence will always be taken.If you watch this film expecting it to be more about people and court room drama, you can't go wrong, if your expecting a blow by blow account of his atrocities you will be disappointed. The film was a little slow in places, but paced well and i thought everyone acted well.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

430,damariscmontufar,Kind of Bummed; Except with Zac Efron.,3,3 May 2019,"I was quite excited about this film, but unfortunately, it fell flat. Firstly, the film had no idea what sort of maritime it was going for. It wasn't a graphic retelling, but it also didn't shy away from certain imagery. It was more so about his girlfriend and her constant crying instead about Ted Bundy. Zac Efron did great, he really was mounting for a great performance that was sadly cut short by the necessity of showing Lily Collins and her subpar performance.
The shooting style was all over the place, attempting to do cut always for intensity that didn't do anything for anyone.
Overall, it could have been a lot better if it had better direction and a clearer vision of what the end product should be.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
431,Jonimckenna,Quite disappointing,5,4 May 2019,"I feel like I have waited forever for the release of this movie but for me unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.
The movie took a different angle to the usual serial killer film by viewing the case through his relationship with his girlfriend. This in itself is fine and could have brought an unusual edge. The problem for me was that by taking this route the film relies mainly on performance and I don't think that was there at the level it needed to be. I quite like Zac Efron but I felt he was quite 2 dimensional in this role and didn't really capture the essence of Bundy. John Malkovich was his usual John Malkovich playing a John Malkovich character. Overall the film was distinctly average.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
432,rich-grindell,The documentary that wasn't.,6,7 May 2019,"Whilst Zac Efron does a good job portraying Ted Bundy it did feel as though I was watching a dramatisation that you'd see in something like Forensic Files.

But we really see only the time of his life when he was in the light.. We never see when he goes dark, or even during a stalking mode. Malkovich was so-so as the judge. The real judge had a Southern drawl and was morbidly obese. Worth watching to be sure.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
435,danrayson,Completely disrespectful to the victims,1,6 May 2019,The film leads you to almost believe Bundy's innocence. All victims are an afterthought in this senseless and curt film.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
436,kunmeg-957-512721,Good but not the best,7,28 February 2021,"Luckily, I saw Ted Bundy tapes first, which really said the most about a brutal killer. Ted Bundy does not deserve to be portrayed as a gentle man with empathy and consideration for others. He was simply a brutal murderer who thought only of himself without thinking of the consequences of everything he did to his innocent victims, family and relatives. That's why I liked Ted Bundy tapes the best, here you get served absolutely everything that Ted Bundy was guilty of. Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile only shows Ted Bundy's nice sides, if you still are able to see his good sides after you've seen it all.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
437,jus-read14,Good Cast and good adaptation of the true story,8,17 June 2019,"I think this is one of the best movies Zac Efron and Lily Collins have done. The Ted Bundy story is very twisted, wicked, tragic and interesting at the same time. I know there were some details about the movie that didn't really happen in real life; But over all the script is very faithful to the true events. Also they made Bundy likeable (like many thought he was back in those days ) but at the end you can see for a second the ""Monster"" within him when he talks to Liz.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
438,soccerstar92997,I'm torn,5,13 May 2019,"I would rate this movie 5.5 stars. While there is an element of accuracy, there are also several elements that are falsified to fit the film. I am somewhat of a strange savant when it comes to serial killers, and through many of my deep dives, I've read statements that talk about how we should remember the victims and not the killers. However, people are drawn to heinous things people-such as Bundy-have done; we want to learn about the psychological mayhem going on inside the heads of these people. So, while I have a problem with the falsification of certain aspects of the movie and a slight issue with the portrayal of the shear attraction Efron has (because while Bundy was considered handsome, many accounts say that the general people didn't think he was a drop dead hunk), I think the movie is a great dive into the inner psyche of a serial killer and those associated with him.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Zac Efron is a phenomenal actor, his talents are properly showcased in this movie and shows how much potential he actually has. I was super super impressed by ALL actors and their performances, They were so good. No one could have done it better and trust me i DO nitpick.The thing that fell flat for me was the actual story, I was lowkey disappointed because I wanted more. To see more. This movie humanizes Ted Bundy, shows him as a real person and as much as you try to block out whatever sympathy you may feel towards him during this movie, you realize afterall he was still a person with a life, family and friends. The crimes he committed were so horrific, abhorrent, disgusting and I don't want to imagine the turmoil the people around him felt. His family, knowing someone that they knew and loved was capable of such things. My heart breaks for his victims and the unimaginable pain they went through before passing, may their souls rest in peace.The only complain i have is it lacked depth, they could have explored so many elements, but alas.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
444,fayesayers,A different story perspective,9,4 May 2019,"I was so looking forward to this coming out. I saw another Ted Bundy film years ago which was very gruesome in the way the story was told. This film is entirely different. If you're looking for gruesome killings of what Ted Bundy did then you won't see it in this film, there are explanations which are horrific in description but no actual scenes of him killing, all apart from one which is right near the end of the film and it is short. I found this film tastefully done. Zac Efron is brilliant as Ted, he's believable and charismatic. I'm a fidget when watching films but I didn't while watching this.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
445,realgaryh,A different side of Bundy,8,9 May 2019,"If you are looking for blood, gore and cruelty, this is not the Ted Bundy movie you want to see. This is a move about the other side and the other lives destroyed indirectly by his actions. The women that flock to serial killers and the women that stick with them til the end. I am continually impressed with Zach Ephron's versatility and Lilly Collins put on an award worthy performance as well. Good, good movie!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
446,zarinablue-20350,Brilliant psychology and storytelling.,9,29 December 2020,"I will try not spoil anything, but if you are looking for a factual account of what it is like to accept that someone you love is a monster, this is it. If you are looking for a blow by blow of his crimes you might want to pass. (But you will be missing out on some amazing POV takes on Bundy.)This is one of the best takes on Bundy I have ever seen. Most people go into this story understanding that Bundy is guilty, but here we are given a glimpse of what it was like, at the time all this unfolds, of what it is like to hold onto doubt for as long as humanly possible. The brilliance in this film is that unlike most Bundy films, is that they don't focus on the brutality of the crimes as if you are there, but the doubt that would be instilled if you didn't have the benefit of time and evidence. The cast is wonderful with Zac Efron surprising me as both charming and insidious at the same time. He manages to nail the self pitying aspects of Bundy that most portrayals miss. And when he turns up the creepy, you feel it. Pitch perfect performance.
Lily Collins carries most of the emotional weight in the film and her character's resistance to the truth is supposed to be frustrating. And it is... But her flashes of doubt are just enough to keep you sympathetic to her emotional turmoil.Also a shout out about Haley Joel Osment. While his role is that of the ""nice guy"" this particular nice guy has a backbone and lends a lot of sensitivity to a role that could have been a throw away.This movie is smart about keeping you in the dark about details until Liz is able to access them, through the media or by some other manner.Out of all the films about this particular subject I have seen, this is probably the best character study type of film that I have seen.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
447,gpittaway-67296,Something you'd expect from a Ted Bundy biopic,9,5 May 2019,"This was a mixture. I enjoyed it a lot, the movie had me believing that Ted Bundy (Zac Efron) hadn't done any of those things to the women but by the end, I was incredibly shocked by ""Hacksaw"" on the glass during the final scene. It was quite impressive and there were consistent court scenes which added to the mystery never showing any of the killings until the one at the end. Would recommend.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
448,cherylrosee,makes me ashamed,7,26 February 2020,"Ok I don't know anything about the real ted bundy (except that he was a serial killer) or any of the true facts. I watched this out of my morbid curiosity of serial killers and because I had just finished watching Baywatch and was looking for some more efron eye candy.
true to real story: i have no idea
storyline in itself: very good (probably because it was real lol)
acting is pretty solid. Efron has the opportunity here, and took, of transcending his disney, cute heartthrob personna. he pulls off a very convincing sweet ""friendly kid loving stepdad"" figure. he doesn't portray any creepiness though. throughout the entire movie, though police descriptions, apartment sightings, he Efron himself remains a good looking, bright, unthreatening, even charismatic man. - which i know was the point. so he did it well.
the story played out well enough - getting drunk at a bar then bringing home a guy you'd just met into your house with a young daughter leaving the two of you completely vulnerable aside -.
Liz's character is the 'too loyal for her own good' type. She herself was the one who had a gut feeling, and gave Efron's name to the cops. Yet, she remains in denial, adamant that he could be innocent. Why? All because of the memories Bundy/Efron had planted in her mind, strategically or not. We all know Bundy didn't feel the same depth of love he made his girlfriend to believe. As, as soon as he was alone with a faithful lovestruck female by his side, he brings up the next low self esteem girl and f-cks her behind a vending machine in the f-cking jail's visiting room. to which immediately after, ignores his new woman's concerns about their relationship.(this is where I lost faith in my gender. or at least desperate naive white women.)ANYWAY.
this movie is a good psychological thriller, tugs on your heart strings a little if you're naive enough to empathize with the pond pieces of women.-chess reference. it is entertaining and i do not regret watching it.
acting, writing, productions, shooting were all well done.
my only complaint is not towards the movie itself, but I assume the actual factitious events.wait also.
the title is horrid. i don't know if those particular words contain a reference or underlying meaning. but if not, it is the utmost pain in the fking a.ss to retpye, hashtag, etcetc.
Bundy confessed to 30 murders before his execution - probably more, as stated.
There are no doubt many more serial killers who have killed far more people, in worse ways, and maybe be alive or uncaught. I always knew the name Bundy, and wondered what exactly it was for this particular killer to earn so much hype. I watched this movie hoping to get some insight. I still do not know.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
449,bowdidgecatherine,Incredible. Storytelling at its finest.,8,6 May 2019,"Joe Berlinger you are incredible. It was beautifully directed and beautifully written. Zac Efron's performance was also incredible,the story,with Efron's help, truly portrays how so many people thought he was innocent.Before I watched this movie, I thought it would show us about the killings. Instead Berlinger takes a different route and focus' on Bundy (Zac Efron) and his wife, Liz (Lily Collins). Storytelling at its finest. He highlights Bundy's charm with help from Zac Efron, who's performance was outstanding, and it makes us realise how Ted was seen as innocent and how he lured all his victims in.I will also mention the incredible score, it will make you feel all sorts of emotions; scared, sad and uncomfortable and really draws you in.There is a scene that focus' on (Efron's) eyes and it is my favourite scene, you can see the emotion in his eyes and the emotion behind them. Brilliant performance and an incredible shot.Well done to Joe Berlinger. I loved it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I was initially surprised when Zac Efron was announced in the lead role but he was perfectly charming as Ted, which leads me to one of my big problems with this film. They skirted around some of the things he did, I guess to give it the 15 rating that it has. It plays on your sympathies a LOT, there were times when I felt sorry for him and I had to catch myself and remind myself that Ted Bundy was a POS who did awful, awful things. I have no problem with Zac Efron, he was amazing in the role, but I think on the whole they could have just done away with all the heart string tugging moments and just stuck to the facts.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I guess people who didn't really have seen the Ted in the court or the Ted talking in interviews .Had high hopes for this movie but just a big disappointed . When you have seen the killer in tapes the way he talk the way he moves the way he tries to play a different persona so people will like them or when they try to play a innocent soul and then you see a movie played by questionable actors you just get disappointed .Lily was as bad as Zac . I don't suggest to people that are real into crime to see it.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
462,colddale,Missing the point (a lot).,7,31 October 2019,"So I read some of the negative reviews on here. I wasn't surprised that they completely missed the point of the movie. I heard the hype about this Zac Efron guy, how it was supposed to be glamourising a ruthless serial killer, or that it was Efron's attempt to break away from his stereotyping.
I wanted to see for myself, having never been convinced by hype. I approached the movie with no expectations, either of the star, or of the story. As far as his performance was concerned, Efron (I felt) did a good job, given the subhuman monster he was portraying.
I definitely do not think the intention was to glamourise Bundy, or his history of abhorrent, appalling murder. I think the intention was to tell the story straight. The fact is that Bundy, like other serial killers, was intelligent and could be charming.
Many sociopaths/psychopaths are. They also have the distinction of having no moral compass whatsoever. They do what they do because they like it (as much as they like anything) and because they can get away with it. Some (Kemper for example) tired of outwitting the authorities and handed himself in. He was frustrated that nobody gave him the attention and recognition he felt he deserved.
The only fly in the ointment was another actor. One who is gifted and engaging. Sadly, however, he has, by virtue of the sheer longevity, been very much typecast in his most famous role.
When Jim Parsons appeared I was jolted out of the movie. I couldn't see or hear a prosecutor. All I could see and hear was Sheldon in a suit, conducting a legal case in exactly the way I imagine Mr. Cooper would do. That aside, I thought the film was a quite dispassionate, sober retelling of a nightmare of our time.

We only see his charm failing. Which I get this man is sadly infamous but I am just talking about from this directive stand point. This movie just sort keeps on going.

The costuming and set design was spot on, especially the Miami court room.Now the not so good, there is just too much to unpack with Ted Bundy to cover in 110 minutes. The movie has to gloss over so much material to fit time constraints. We only mildly see Bundy's manipulative skills. We never see the psychopathy. Without more detail and more insight into the crimes, the movie is really just flabby and flaccid.To me, this movie would have been better served as a mini series so we could see the beginnings and evolution of Bundy and his relationships.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

478,laura_d-01685,Not the movie I was hoping for,4,23 February 2021,"If you read that it's based on the book of his girlfriend Liz ""who refused to believe the truth for years"" then you are expecting a movie about her. But the director ALSO wanted it to be about Bundy, because that is nice and gory and spectacular. And the time really is not long enough to do both, therefore not doing either story line justice.
The result is a movie that is utterly unimpressing, telling you nothing new.

479,Robinshallrestoreamends,Like a Disney Channel movie of this story.,1,13 May 2019,"Like a Disney channel movie of this story. Zac Efron is completely wrong for this part and made no specific acting choices to inhabit this character. This is one of the greatest roles for a male actor, and a better one would have done more justice to the part. Ted's voice and mannerisms were much more specific and Zac didn't bother with any of that. They showed no scenes of his crimes taking place. The story is done from the point of view of a girl that he briefly dated and really did not have a big role in his life. The movie did not go anywhere near as far as it could have and the casting is terrible.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
480,unwiselywords,An interesting movie but I think they missed the mark.,4,14 May 2019,"The storyline felt rushed, and unfocused. Particularly the escapes. For example I fully expected them to go into more details like how he sprained his ankle jumping from the second story, before breaking into two different hunting cabins. There he stole food, clothes, and a rifle before getting lost and wandering through the woods for a couple or days. He was later caught. His second escape he actually had to shed significant weight to fit into the crawl space he cut via a smuggled in hacksaw and he ran multiple explorative 'missions' into said crawl space before actually staging the escape. People will argue the point was to show how easily people fell for Teds charms however...

It's clear that they put a lot of effort into this film to make sure that it was as accurate as possible. A lot of people seem to be a little bent out of shape about the film not showing any of the gory details, but I'm glad they went a different way because we have seen all that before. Seeing this from the perspective of a victim rather than from the killer really makes this film distinctive and interesting. The film does an excellent job in showing just how convincing a psychopath can be. Exemplary work.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

484,Jexic1,Textbook Biopic Pros and Cons with Worse Pacing and Script Choices,4,11 May 2019,"Let's get it out of the way: Efron is great in this movie.Now to the bad:
This movie comes in with a tough position - you know who Ted Bundy is. He is a monster and deserves no favorable portrayal. But at that point you wonder, then how can we have an entertaining film when we know to not like the main character? Fair question and a skilled writer can find a way to make you care. Or, they can throw together a bunch of scenes in a brisk pace to go through some key personal moments of the main character, show that he is handsome and deserving of the public eye to exonerate him because of that fact, and he seems to keep mysteriously getting arrested for ""unrelated crimes"" leading up to a ""huge climax where he turns out to be a serial killer.""
Again, we know who he is. I don't understand the choices made in this movie to act like a forensic files episode with a strong lead actor.
Follow the romantic life, show him as a womanizer, show us a reason for the girlfriend to care, show us him win over the public, then own the closing line of the movie and start to show us through a longer trial (make that the focus of the film and spend serious time on it) that your average charming neighbor can turn into a dark, heinous figure.This isn't the character/case study it could have been, this isn't the court room drama it could have been, and this isn't the tell-all it could have been.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Cramming 20ish years of infamy was a tough task and you can tell.

489,katiehardinger,Somewhat shocking and vile,6,12 May 2019,"I will start with the praise. I was impressed with Zac Efron's performance as Ted Bundy. Going into the film, I wasn't sure if he would be able to handle a serious role, given his classic casting as frat boy type characters. However, he was clearly dedicated to the role and captured the uncomfortable charisma and manipulative charms that Bundy had. Along with his physical likeness to Bundy, he absolutely nailed Bundy's swaggering sex appeal and ability to sway and woo people. I spent about half the movie almost wanting to believe Bundy was innocent.I thought the content was a little weak. I liked that the story was from Liz's perspective, in order to show what a monster Bundy was. I thought we almost could have been given more wickedness from Bundy. I appreciated that the film was sensitive to Bundy's victims and did not give us tons of grisly murder scenes or disturbing crime photos. The film was definitely written assuming the viewer knows the general history of Ted Bundy, his crimes, and his victims. We did not get backstory on Bundy, such as how he met Carol Anne, or information on his mother, who just randomly shows up in one scene with no prior context to their relationship. While I understand that the point of the movie was Bundy's effect on Liz, more back content would have strengthened the film and added to a strong performance by Efron.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
490,kmyoutube,Extremely charming monster,8,23 August 2019,"Excellent film. It nailed the concept of Bundy (a cruel and vicious monster) being able to seduce almost anyone and everyone.

That is the point of the film and it succeeded wildly.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
491,jen-97547,10/10 To Offset Misunderstanding,10,20 August 2019,"I never leave reviews. This is my first one on this site and my first review about a movie anywhere. I felt the need to explain and add what so many are trying to get across about this film: it's not about watching his gory murders, you can see that in a dozen other movies. This film portrays who he was, how he handled his life and his relationships according to those who knew him best.I agree with many others here who understood what this movie was portraying. Not just the actual crimes, but the person behind the crimes. The mask. Everyone knows about his court proceedings and everyone has seen the horrific crimes this man committed.
But some of us are curious: How do these psychopaths operate on a day to day basis? How does their mind work while navigating a world of normalcy? What do their personal relationships look like behind closed doors? How do they get married, have children, become children's party clown, run successful businesses, hold highly educated positions of employment, church leaders or Boy Scout leaders?
Some psychopaths are highly intellectual.
This movie takes an in-depth look into the life of a notorious serial killer and from all accounts looked and acted normal, not unlike many other manipulative psychopaths. It was very interesting to see how his daily life with those closest to him evolved because we only know him for his crimes against humanity, and not his humanity (if that's what you would call it). Seeing him (onscreen) manipulate his way through life was mind blowing.
Efron went above and beyond expectations considering I had already labeled him and put him in a box. I'm glad he stepped out of his stereotyped acting and did a bizarrely sinister role-and it worked. Hook, line and sinker.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
492,eric-97495,What a boring take on the Ted Bundy murders,3,4 May 2019,"Since when do Hollywood films not depict violent scenes? Since when is that considered ""glorifying murder""? That's news to me. I'm frankly baffled why they would make a movie about a serial killer and not show any of the killings. Kind of lame.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
493,cathy-06918,The wolf in a sheep's clothing,10,6 May 2019,"The point of the movie, which many seem to miss, is that you are supposed to be taken in by Ted Bundy's charm. It is showing you why so many fell victim to his charm. While watching, it is hard to belive that this is not an innocent man about to be convicted of terrible crimes. He is charming, has a long-term girlfriend (fiancé in the end) and a step-daughter. He lives a family life and shower them with affections. He is, on the surface, the perfect boyfriend.However, underneath one of the most wicked and evil serial killers of all time. He is merciless, cruel, and consistent in the type of victim he chooses. He is manipulating and intelligent, he is a human venus trap. The movie is trying to show how people rarely looks like monsters hiding in the dark. It could be anyone and only the occasional red flag appears. It makes you reevaluate human nature and the depth that could hide within a person.The performances in this movie are fabulous and it is a movie worth watching. Don't expect the usual serial killer type where you are led to realize what a terrible person they are through their crimes. It is a movie that makes you realize the terror of charming looks and intelligence coupled with a thirst for killing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
494,tablebythegym,A Good Film with a Major Drawback,6,7 May 2019,"BAD STUFF:
First lets talk about why it gets a 6/10 even though I liked watching the movie. It seems to me that I wouldn't want to be a family member of someone who died due to Bundy. I felt a certain level of grime watching the film. Even though I liked the acting and the story as it was laid out I still felt that they were commercializing murder.The way they have Efron portray Bundy is about as good as they could have. They noted how violent and horrible Bundy was but laced in between that is his speeches and his defense which are fantastic and really gives you a feeling more than just what the movie wanted. It wanted me to feel icky watching Bundy. It didn't want me to feel icky watching Efron flawlessly deliver the lines that serial killer did years before. We have the film of his trial do we really need a reboot?This wasn't a PSA with Zac Efron looking into the camera and explaining the tactics that he was using in every scene. You have to know and recognize them whenever he is speaking. I think most audiences will note the abuse in all of his relationships and how he manipulated people around him. Some won't. They will come out thinking that this was glamorizing murder trials and they won't be wrong.GOOD STUFF:
This film might be one of the best portrayals of a serial killer. I won't get into spoilers but the ending is great and saves it from being a pure profit off of murder situation.You have the question if the film is trying to make him seem innocent the entire time which seems bad but is great for storytelling. It makes you wonder about the evidence just like the people at the time did. Then it nails it with the acting in the judges chambers. Every actor in those scenes gives it their all, and with the actual script of those moments available they do a great job making it seem real when recreating it.I had no idea that Efron could act in a serious role, but everything he says and all of his looks make you do a weird shiver as the movie goes on. Anyone could have fallen for a killer like Bundy and that is made clear from the entire experience. You trust Efron because he is a good looking guy who seems so sincere. Even though you know the ending you think, of course the law is against him, of course it's a conspiracy. That's what it wants you to think. He was charismatic, that's who he was and that is why Bundy was so deadly.All in all a 6/10 and I wish I could have given it more. Hope I explained myself well.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
495,mjorsborn,4 stars for the cast,4,4 May 2019,"The movie felt disjointed, and didn't include anything wicked, shocking, evil, or vile. John Malkovich was great, Zach Enron was very good, the actors were the good thing about this movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

497,bobbypappas,"Well written, well acted",10,27 May 2019,"What I liked about this film is that it didn't focus on the savagery; the fact that almost all of the gruesomeness was left to the imagination was actually a major plus for me; to feature gore would've been easy and lazy. This film focused on the humanity, or lack thereof of Ted and the emotional torture that he imposed upon Liz that was juxtaposed with the physical torture that he inflicted upon his victims. Zach Ephron did a fantastic job and was very convincing in playing Bundy and Lilly Collins was superb in the role of Liz. Not to be left out was the performance of Kayla Scodelario who played the pathetically hopeless devotee of Bundy's, Carole Ann Boone, who would and literally did anything that Ted asked of her.I suppose the one minor complaint, if there needs to be one, is that some may find it a bit slow and in the age of instant gratification and rapid fire social media addiction, it may lose some viewers but the story is the story, and it was a darn good story. All in all, excellent emotionally compelling movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
498,katey-01719,Could have been better,5,6 May 2019,"I thought the movie was fine, but it could have been better. My favorite part was the ending when they showed original footage that the movie events were taken from. I'm very glad that they stuck to the facts and made the movie as accurate as possible. My issue is that I feel like the movie was watered down, probably to avoid triggering people. Ted Bundy was vicious, and while I appreciate that Elizabeth only saw the trial part of the case, I think they could have put more emphasis on the horrific things he did. I feel like an emphasis on the relationship didn't do much for me, especially since the relationship seemed healthy until she randomly started drinking after he was arrested 10 minutes later. I wanted to see more into how she saw Ted acting during their relationship, but it ended up being her binge drinking after his arrest with very little insight into how he treated her, and how she felt about it; because the actual memoirs tell a very different story. In conclusion, the movie was alright and somewhat factual, but there was so much detail left out that I wasn't able to get invested or feel any unsettling emotions that I expected. Bit of a let down.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

His acting was on point too. I really feel like they should've shed more light to what he did because now you kind of have to watch the documentary series about him first if you havent really heard about the case before.

500,LittleMissGlitter,"Not as extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile as I expected.",5,5 May 2019,"I expected this movie to be a little darker and a little bit more psychologically disturbing. As someone who watches and reads a lot of true crime documentaries and books based around serial killers, I wanted this movie to show me something I didn't already know.I, however found myself actually liking the 'character' of Bundy. They portrayed the charming and funny side of him, the side which made women swoon and young ladies want to sleep with him. I wanted to hate him and to sympathise with his victims however the movie did nothing to make that happen.I can imagine that for someone who hasn't heard of Bundy before, to watch this movie wouldn't exactly understand why he was one of the most prolific serial killers of all time. They would just see a charming and seemingly innocent man.I wish this movie had paid more tribute to his victims and made the film a lot darker in order to match the name they chose for the title. I feel had it focused more around his crimes and the way he evaded justice for so long then this movie would be perfectly titled.
It lacks in any new information, doesn't give an insight into why he did what he did nor does it shock you.Overall I did enjoy the movie, just not in the way I expected to.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
501,alisonhawthorn,The acting is top notch. However....,5,4 May 2019,"A film about someone like Bundy could take many paths: What made him so twisted, the devastation to the victims families and the community or the manhunt that finally brings him to justice, for example. For some reason, this choppy film seemed to focus a lot on various sniffling, dewy-eyed women who blindly love Bundy interjected with Bundy showboating around a courtroom. It made for a very odd and a very unsatisfying film. No great insights, no new angles and the victims seem to have been whitewashed away.The five stars I give it are for the actors. They do the best they can with what they have. However, if anyone were to ask for a recommendation, I would stay watch the Bundy Tapes instead. More insight, more rounded and far more terrifying.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

The movie has a purpose and it's a good one, if you start it watch it through! I still don't feel they managed to portray how monsterous he really was which is why I can't give this a higher score.

510,cokerben,"Conpacted, pretty faithful with a little ham.",8,30 March 2020,"As a true crime nut with specific interest in serial killers, I was definitely interested in this. I was concerned about the casting of Zac Efron, but for the most part I was pleasantly surprised.The acting, over all, was great, especially from Efron who at times nailed Bundy perfectly, even with just a look. But I also felt that alot of the acting was hammed up for show, as if the contrast and desaturation had been turned up on the performances.The aesthetics of the film are pretty accurate to the time, especially Bundy and Boone who look very faithful to their real counterparts, albeit like hd remastered versions.
There are a number of details that were changed, things like when he escaped through the light in his cell, he had actually spent months starving himself in order to fit. But due to continuity and time restraints, I understand why things like thay were changed.
As for the other criticisms; To quote another reviewer further down, people are missing the point. The reason why it feels like a humanization of a monster, is that Ted Bundy wasn't a monster, he was a man, a very intelligent cold calculated evil man. This film pulls you in and then by the trial you begin feel what people felt at the time, watching his putrid pantomime unfold, with Bundy centre stage as the show's main star and director, and for a moment you wonder how this man could have done this. But the fact we are still talking about him, consuming media about him, mythicizing him into this monster, would delight Bundy to no end. Bundy didn't want to die, this evil man wanted to be remembered and we are still, to this day, obliging him in that.I think by focusing more on the women that loved him, it better shows the power and the effect he had on people, and the levels of manipulation he would sink to to get away with he wanted, and it executes the cold glibness in the way they manipulate very well.However this is where I also have a problem, I would have liked to seen more of his life outside of the trial, which has been shown time and time again in documentaries, despite there being some pleasing additions to the cast at that point. In that respect I feel like it would have been better suited as a mini series, with the finale being the trial, giving the film makers more time to delve into the effect Bundy had on those around him, which I feel is what the film makers were aiming for, but were limited by the fact its a film.If it had been a mini series, there is so much more they could have told. For example, despite what the film might have you belive, it wasn't the sweetness and light between him and Liz, but again this was omitted for time and continuity reasons. Then there is Liz's daughter, who has her own horrid part of the story to tell. Also perhaps given a little insight into Carole Ann Boone's troubled past. Even and maybe shown more his adoring parents and his effect on them.But as it stands I found it enthralling, and well acted, it's just a shame that it was all squished into and hour and forty five minutes.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
511,wills-18,Superb acting.,9,4 May 2019,I really like that they did not glorify and focus on the murders. Efron's Bundy was brilliantly terrifying.

512,cloudwalker-18321,A extremely mixed bag that could've been better but could've been worse,5,12 September 2020,"Now the way I see it, there are two pitfalls that can befall a movie about a real life serial killer; you could either make a sleazy and absolutely tasteless exploitation piece with zero regard for the victims OR you can have a boring sterile drama that completly fails to add anything new with the subject. Such is the case with Ted bundy. While there's the exceptional Deliberate Stranger, there's also slimy horror like Mathew brights movie or, in this case, the incredibly unextraordinary joe Berliners extremly wicked. While I think zac Afron & the cast all did fine jobs and did NOT romanticize Ted, the script does nothing beyond showing the basic events we all know and dosen't add anything new (like how Elizabeth knew some of the victims or that Ted abused her daughter) becoming nothing more than a boring courtroom drama with a couple of brief escapes thrown in. What I would've done is prolong the run time & also include the pov of investigators, ted's colleagues, his family, & defense to help add more life to the story. I would've also included the testimony of witnesses and survivors and show ted's facade begin to crack as time goes on and reveal the beast within. But then again, that's just my view and I'm sure someone else will say differently but I stand by my opinion. And that's that it was extremly mixed, shockingly banal, and boring.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Wholly disappointing direction.,4,4 May 2019,"Although Zac Efron was creepily good as Ted Bundy, and if it wasn't for such an interesting topic, this movie would've been terrible. It was essentially a very impressive dramatization of the documentary (directed by the same guy), with a very weak side plot following the first girlfriend of Ted. Hardly any plot/character development. Some impressive camera work, but not much else. If that was the director's intention, then why even make the movie? To add a great performance to Zac's resume?The director has a ton of research on Ted from the documentary, enough to dive deep into both the man and the monster and to give some depth to the story, but he blew it. Very disappointing. Also, the only crime we actually see Ted commit is an assault on one woman? Give us all or give us none. Weak stuff.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Unfortunately the movie for me felt so bland and a wasted chance. Re-enactment of the terrible murders committed definitely were not necessary but some darker tension to give the audience a feel for how evil Bundy was would have in my opinion made the movie better. The past movies such as Private Ryan and Schindler's List although hard to watch embedded the terror of the time and situation perfectly, shame this movie did not allow the audience to experience the magnitude of these crimes and the truly evil side of one terrifying human.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

526,matthewparratt009,"Extremely wicked acting, shocking evil pacing and vile camera work.",7,4 May 2019,"""Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile"" directed by Joe Berlinger, is inspired by the live accounts of the murders committed by Ted Bundy during the 1970sGoing into this film I thought it was going to have a lot of similarities to the cliched ""real crime"" films where it would go into great detail through visual and verbal description of why this person was bad and how you as the audience should react, which I don't think is always a bad thing... however, in this case it would've been.Ted bundy has always been portrayed as this horrendous guy who's done these disgusting things, but on the surface he was an extremely handsome man who exuded charm and confidence. This is an important quality which I think both the director and Zac Efron display throughout the picture.The director decided to go at this from a different angle to the norm, which I actually enjoyed a lot, however I do think that he did a bad job of really selling the fact that this guy was a serial killer, we'd hear news reports about these crimes that we know Ted has done, but I never really felt a sense of hatred towards the guy, in fact I was never sold on the fact that he'd really done them.
Now if I want to look at this with an artistic view I'd also say that this was perfect, as the director did a briallaint job of making us see Ted through the eyes of the female audience back in the 70s. It's up for interpretation.The first act felt far too rushed and escalated quicker than it needed to, The scenes jump with little explanation to how we got there. Now I know this isn't a prison break film but on two occasions Ted escaped the law, once in a court house and once from prison, just a little bit more context there would've made those scenes fit better, especially considering on both occasion he gets caught and just take him back like it's nothing. Despite my dislike to this, the prison break was pivotal to the story as he ended up in Florida where he'd commit yet another crime and be convinced with the death penalty.Zac Efron is hands down what sold this movie to me. He plays the character as he should using Teds wicked intelligence to deceive the viewers to believing he's a decent man by playing the innocent role so perfectly. Lily Collins also puts in a stellar performance, playing Bundy's girlfriend. After the film had ended her pain from the situation she was in really resonated with me, knowing all this time she had a massive burden over her and seeing it lifted when Ted confesses was a huge relief.Now I know this film will get backlash and I think wrongfully so. Even though Ted Bundy was the main focus point of the film and it wasn't overly gritty and disgusting, it doesn't mean he's being glorified. This film is about the conviction and sentence of Ted Bundy and how he used what he could, for instance his charm and manipulation to try and get out of it. Nothing in my eyes makes me think he was wrongfully sentenced.In the end I think not knowing anything about Ted Bundy actually may have harmed the experience, it's primarily a performance based film which really carried it and with the exception of a few shots and over use of shakey cam it was directed well and somewhat an more artistic view than I'd normally see. Definitely worth a watch if you're interested in his story.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

It's not the worst film ever made but I did have a lot of major issues with this movie. I was really looking forward to watching it and thank god it was on Netflix so I didn't have to waste my money on it in the cinama, which I probably would have done! The story itself has so much potential for being a good movie but it's not. I didn't know a lot about the whole Ted Bundy case before watching this movie and apparently you need to because they will just skip through all of the actual events to rather focus on Bundy's girlfriend, but they also forget that it's more her story throughout the movie. Why? Because that's just not the real interesting part of this story.
I read that this is the best work from Zac Efron ever. And yes it might be because he has in the past taken on more basic kinda roles but he's not even that good in this one. Watch a couple of tapes with the real Ted Bundy, he's hella creepy, you can just see it in his eyes. Not so much with Zac Efron. Too charming, not enough craziness!
The best part of the movie is the ending and if they had just incorporated a bit more of those scenes then this movie could have actually been really good...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
533,gabywaby1,A Story That Needs To Be Told,10,5 May 2019,"I am old enough to remember the years leading up to the execution of Ted Bundy so I was interested to see this movie. A LOT of controversy has surrounded the method of telling the story & it's understandable that people are disgusted by the mere notion of throwing any kind of favorable light on an individual like Ted Bundy. However the movie needed to address the media attention, the weird people that came out of the woodwork for Ted during his trial, and frankly the suave persona that Ted fed to the public and his victims (which include the women he formed attachments to during his crimes.)
Also important to note, this film benefits from very strong, well done performances from other high profile actors (many of which you will recognize.) It's commendable that this movie addresses the horror and frustration the public felt at the time when Ted was both victimizing people and then later attempting to turn his trial into a mess.
The beautiful undertone to this film is the people on the periphery of Ted's life eventually work through their suffering and horror, or help other to do so. I really enjoyed Haley Joe Osment's portrayal of a man reaching out to a person who is reforming their life after being exposed to the madness and sickness that was Ted's calling card.
I would not characterize this film as being anti-woman, I feel (at the time of his crimes) American women tended to be a bit more innocent about the hazards of life and offenders like Ted. (& Ted's ability to befriend women and acquire things he sought out is well documented.) Also keep in mind Ted was offending when the American public had an understandable distaste for police interference in their lives so him latching onto the ""unfair treatment and railroading"" claim as his defense was a move that did grab people's attention & give him an edge in mounting his own defense.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Although I don't like Ted being portayed as only a handsome mysterious person (because he was extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile) I did enjoy the movie.

The shoel thing is the tension between him and his girlfriend- her not knowing if he is guilty or not. Not only did it stray factually, but it missed a lot of key points that really would have made the stroubcome across better. 6 stars just for the acting.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

563,rmyers-88696,PRECISE REPLICATION OF TRUE EVENTS!!!,10,20 May 2019,"Amazing!! I totally disagree with the people who are saying the movie portrayed him as charming, as opposed to focusing on how he got away with it. First of all, I was 10 when this happened, and I still remember the trial to this day! He WAS extremely charming ... Exactly as Zac Efron portrayed him. And they could hardly focus on how he got away with it because nobody really knows. He under estimated the amount of women he truly killed, and he wasn't honest about anything, ever! So the movie could hardly focus on how he did it without speculation. The movie is bone chilling because it was a perfect replication of how the event went down. Anybody rating this movie low because it was boring, is too young to understand and grasp the concept of how REALISTIC this movie really was.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
564,loredanadicu,Boring,1,17 December 2020,"Zac Efron is awful here. I didn't buy for one second nothing from him as Ted Bundy. That's a shame, because the others were great. This movie could heve been good, but it isn't. It was a waste of time.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
565,riktaylor-01315,Glamourous Ted,4,3 May 2019,"I feel this movie somewhat glamourises Ted Bundy and only makes you feel sorry for him and not his victims. No murders or victims are really shown or detailed (understandably, I suppose) and therefore it is more of a look at him and his personal relationships.
If you haven't watched the Ted Bundy Tapes or read about this monster of a man then you may miss how clever and evil he was and this movie will make you feel as though he may have never actually done anything wrong.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
566,joeyg-23688,"Extremely Boring, Shockingly Dull, and Vapid",3,3 May 2019,"This movie could have been much better. Zac ""Pretty Boy"" Efron looks the part for sure, but just isn't convincing enough as the lead role. Zac's portrayal of Ted Bundy has far too much confidence and swagger on-screen, lacking the crucial weirdness and overcompensating mannerisms the real Bundy possesses. As a result, unfortunately you don't care enough about the character in any way, to hate, relate, or even sympathise - and not just only Bundy in this movie, for that matter.Many characters' roles were trivialised in this movie; more cardboard cut-outs of the real people they were failing to represent. This movie felt more like a very dull, very biased documentary, with a strange goal in mind to sympathise with Bundy as he realises the monster that he really is, with very little pay-off when ""the big reveal"" is shown.Overall, disappointing. Unfortunately not even down to simply poor casting, as it also seems that the script had poor focus and depth, and the movie seemed far too trimmed to truly capture a villain of this magnitude.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
567,jbailsathome,Must see!,9,4 May 2019,"Would honestly recommend watching ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" - the Ted Bundy film on Netflix starring Zac Efron as Bundy. Was really a great depiction of how even someone seen as so attractive, smart and charming can get away with so much.The only criticism I have is how they didn't really show how he ""helped"" the police; in the Netflix documentary series it showed how whilst still killing people he was literally working with the police and slightly throwing them off, this movie didn't show that. Still a great movie nevertheless... If I had to rate it I'd give it a solid 9/10.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
568,beainsteadofbri,"Weird pacing, and didn't show a single murder...",4,4 May 2019,"I honestly wish this movie could have started earlier in Ted's life, but that's not even the biggest issue I have with it. The timeline was too fast-paced and felt inconsistent, to the point of feeling like a cheap TV movie. The sets were good, the costumes were fine, and the music was okay, but certainly could have been better. Most of the movie's story consisted of Ted Bundy being in jail and on trial, so we didn't get to see what we truly wanted to see, and that's how Bundy carried out his murders and hid them. As far as violence goes, this movie shows very little, and as a result of the absence of murder scenes, it
almost paints Ted out to be a ""good guy"". As for the actors, I guess Zac Efron has some resemblance to Ted, but that overall creepiness just wasn't there. His voice and mannerisms felt off for some reason, and I felt like the characters im general just didn't talk like people in the 70's did. Another thing that ticked me off about Zac's portrayal of Bundy is the fact that he showed genuine-looking emotion in some scenes. This was probably just for dramatic effect, but as most people know Ted was a psychopath, therefore incapable of experiencing emotion. I suppose Zac just worked with what he had and isn't to blame. Plus, his performance was good, whether accurate or not. I just don't think this movie did Ted Bundy's ruthless, barbaric killings any justice. It should have made you hate Bundy, but it simply didn't have that affect. This movie is overall very cliché, script-wise and story-wise, and didn't leave the impact it should have.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
569,kaereira-41156,Liz's POV,8,4 May 2019,Many people probably don't understand this movie is mostly focused on Liz and her point of view of Ted Bundy. And that is why I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. He only seemed innocent because that was how she viewed it for so long. The hold he had on her until he was found guilty. It was a different spin to such a devastating part of history. Very well written and great acting. I definitely recommend this to watch.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
570,zoiebednasek,Wonderfully done,10,4 May 2019,This was a fantastic movie. Zac Efron did an amazing job with the same facial expression and charisma as Bundy had. They didnt go into much depth on the brutality of the murders which I really appreciate. It was more about the emotional damage put on Liz and her perspective of it all. This movie is amazing,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
571,haydenscommentary,A Must Watch,10,4 May 2019,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile gives you a whole new perspective on Ted Bundy's absolute evil and how he tortured not only his victims but also loved ones around him. Often times the media shows the charming, ""handsome"" and every day man that is Ted Bundy but when you see a glimpse of what he did to his victims as wells as Liz, her daughter, Carol Ann and his mother, it reveals just how horrifying and pathological that disturbed man was. Many people have been criticizing Zac's performance because he was so charming and likable in this film and how it is not appropriate to show a cold blooded killer in that light; however he was only portraying the real Bundy, who was a charming psychopath, and that is what was so terrifying about him. What a harrowing film. Amazing performances by Zac Efron and Lilly Collins. Good job Netflix, you've done it again with an astounding film.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

573,amberschmidtahom,No point,3,5 May 2019,"The acting was phenomenal as expected with this cast. However, the writing was terrible. If this was supposed to be from the POV of Liz, then it is missing a lot. What made her suspect Ted? How did she come to the conclusion that it was him? We saw nothing that painted a picture of the events or circumstances that lead Liz to tip off the police with his name. If you didn't already know about the case, you'd think it came way out of left field. This film didn't do justice to the victims, their families, Liz's story, or the actors who put in their time and effort on this project. A list of victims at the end is a crappy way to honor them.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
574,jasonrgon,Unshocking,5,6 May 2019,I preferred the 2002 film called Bundy. This is a good courtroom drama and how it is advertised I think is misleading.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
575,Benisman69,Misleading title but decent movie otherwise,7,8 May 2019,This movie is structured in a wierd way. The entire film you are believing he is innocent until one 30 second scene where the truth is revealed aaaand then he dies. It's a rather abrupt ending but nonetheless a decent movie about the man Ted Bundy was and his personal life issues rather than a movie looking into the actual killings. It has alot of drama so if you like that then check out this movie,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
576,kellywevans,Missed out on fascinating character arc. Cheesy and superficial.,3,8 May 2019,"Based on this movie youd think that Ted Bundy maintained his youthful charm up until his execution in 1989. The film never shows any aging in the title character, and doesnt portray the cracks that started to show in his facade after his second escape and arrival in Florida.If you look at the actual video from the public reading of Bundy's indictment in Florida, he looks pale and somewhat deranged. But in the movie he looks just as tanned and rested as he did in the early 70's. Same with the trial. It totally glossed over the creepy questioning over the details of the murder scenes, which Bundy was clearly taking pleasure in reliving, or the his unhinged outbursts. The outbursts that are shown are still portrayed as the performances of a charismatic showman, which in some cases was the case, but many times he appeared deranged and not in his right mind.This movie is disappointing because it just continues the trend of glorifying and romanticizing Bundy. Yes, what makes him so fascinating is partly how well he hid his dark and ghoulish nature and managed to fool so many people. But only portraying that side of him while only hinting at his true nature and ignoring the cracks started to appear in his facade in Florida does a great disservice to a surreal and fascinating story that seems like it could be a Hollywood screenplay. In this case, the Hollywood version is far more dull than the reality. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the picture.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
577,kirrilyjw,"Extremely well-acted, shockingly devoid of crime",5,13 May 2019,"If you were a minute or so late to joining your partner on the lounge to watch Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile, you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd accidentally walked into a rom-com.In fact, the new Netflix film is the story of the life of notorious serial killer Ted Bundy. Or one version anyway.It's based on Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy written by Elizabeth (Liz) Kendall, Bundy's ex-girlfriend, and knowing that the story follows her perspective is key to how you view the film.We open on Liz (Lily Collins) waiting to visit Ted (Zac Efron) in a high security prison. Sitting behind the glass, wearing a shade of orange that looks almost identical to that of Ted's prison jumpsuit, Liz could easily be mistaken for the prisoner.This, of course, is exactly the point. She is a woman held captive by her own longing to hear her husband admit to crimes that she desperately wishes he didn't commit.With some editing that is a little too choppy, we quickly diverge into the boy-meets-girl beginning. It started one night in 1969, they met in a bar and ended up going back to Liz's place where they fell asleep beside each other. Ted didn't pressure her into sex, and more importantly, didn't kill her. What a gentleman.Liz was a lonely single-Mum with an infant daughter that he instantly accepted and swiftly played step-Dad to.While whipping up morning-after breakfast, there is some light foreshadowing as the camera makes a pointed focus on the large kitchen knife in his hand. That aside, the bright scene portrays him as not only harmless, but almost angelic as he, lit-from-behind and dressed in Liz's frilly apron, serves up Cheerios to her daughter and coffee to the quickly-smitten Liz.This scene encapsulates the film's approach to Ted's character- something is slightly off, but it's nearly imperceptible when wrapped in so much charm.It is not until six years into their relationship, in 1975, that Ted is first picked up by police.
We learn through a The Wonder Years-style happy family montage that in this time Liz has fallen in love with the snow-ball making, cookie-baking version of Ted that taught her daughter to ride a bike and completed her broken family.The montage, however, is spliced with cuts from evening news reports about startling recent murders of young girls. From there, the film more-or-less diverges into a series of trials and with each one Liz loses another chunk of her hopeful heart.With this performance, Efron has officially put the last nail in the coffin of his High School Musical character, Troy. May he rest in peace. He is outstanding as the manipulative, composed killer who, when the script allows, slides from charming to chilling in a heartbeat, and holds the interest of the audience even at times when the story itself is waning in suspense.Collins is equally impressive as his tortured girlfriend and perfectly captures the arc from young and optimistic to bleak and broken. The film struggles to stick with her perspective though, instead getting caught in the charisma of Ted, just as the public did during the televised trial.
Despite the award-worthy acting, the characters feel incomplete.Director Joe Berlinger, who also brought us the documentary Conversations with a killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes made a bold choice omitting the backstories of the characters and including so little (read: no) crime in the film that it ends up a courtroom drama rather than the true-crime thriller viewers would be expecting.It's effective in making the audience feel the confusion and mistrust that Liz experienced for so many years. Since Ted's evil acts are never shown and the motivations behind them are never explored though, the gravity that this is a man who killed at least 30 women across 7 states is never felt, and while the result may be intentionally unsettling, it is ashamedly unsatisfying.Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile is anything but. The film's misleading title, a famous comment made by Judge Cowart at Ted's sentencing, betrays its contents. It never attempts to reveal the wicked, evil, vile side of Ted Bundy that we know to be true and were all waiting for.Before you see this film, do yourself a favour and watch the Berlinger documentary, because as is quoted at the start of Extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile ""Few people have the imagination for reality"" and, unfortunately, this is true of the film itself.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

Now don't get me wrong Zac Efron's booty looked great in that one scene and they did achieve what they wanted to be shown about this story, but it was just too boring for our attention to be captured for the whole hour and 49 minutes.

580,landenreplogle,A greatly told story of a monster of a man.,8,21 May 2019,"This movie was a work of art in descise. Past all of the disgusting topics over ted bundy they had the film very well made. Although ted Bundy was a real person and did horrible unspeakable things to these poor woman, they told the story of him very well. This also brings up a moral dilemma, do we ever talk about this guy and what he did? Do we immortalize him with movies and documentaries about him. There is another moral dilemma with the realism with the movie. It was extremely accurate to the proceedings of what happened with this man and his case that lead him to the chair. This is a bit of a taboo subject when it comes to serial killers like Ted.
In the film itself was entertaining to watch on several levels. The story being enticing and taking you in and almost making you sympathize with ted at some parts. The audience for this movie i think is rather limited. Many people would not even what to here the name ted bundy let alone watch a movie about him. So that limits the audience a bit but i don't think it hurt is all that much comparative to that amount that wanted to see Zack Efron.
The educational value of the movie was of the charts. So many interesting things that went into the movie and how accurate it was to the real events that went down with Ted. another movie that goes wonderfully in hand with this movie is the documentary about Ted Bundy. If you watch the movie i highly suggest you watch the doc as well. But once again it's hard to say this was a good movie because it is such a taboo of a subject.
The literary value is a tuff one because the plot and theme are based around a real serial killer and paints him as the protagainsed. Making him look like the good guy up until the very end of the movie when he admits that he was the killer. It was done very well but because it's so controversial it's hard for me to say that is was really good.
And lastly the artistic value was done very well with the camera work and sounds and shot choice. The camera work was extremely good. There is a certain scene that comes to mind when it zooms in on his eyes and his wife's eyes that was a really cool shot.
The movie was a great movie over all. But because it is based on real events and people i find it really hard to call it a good movie when it comes to Ted Bundy. He was a truly horrible person with what he did to the poor young girls. And what scares most people the most about this is it could happen to anyone. Which is maybe why the movie was so freaky.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
581,m-56699,Extremely Wicked Lives Up To It's Name,8,3 June 2019,"The Netflix original film Directed by Joe Berlinger with no doubt lived up to its title. It delivers so much more than just a story of a man and his crimes, but how he was so manipulative and swerving in his life.
Ted Bundy is the most famous serial killer that America has ever seen. The man went on a streak of murder, kidnapping, burglary, and many more crimes throughout America for five years. You might ask how did he do it, and Extremely Wicked provides all of the details in successful fashion. With Zac Efron starring as Bundy, the actor really displays how Bundy was seen as so innocent and handsome to many. He was not your typical serial killer who was a creep or lived on the streets, and Bundy used that to his advantage. He manipulated many including his girlfriend, to believe his lies, and Efron showcased that perfectly through great acting. The camera work was very exceptional, especially the low angle shots hinting Bundy's evilness.
Extremely Wicked also goes along with the Ted Bundy Tapes on Netflix, where there are four biographical tapes that are live recordings of conversations with Bundy by journalists Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Directed by Joe Berlinger, these tapes give information that is crucial to understanding certain things in Bundy's crimes. The tapes also show real footage of Bundy when he was in court and it is amazing how comparable Efron is to Bundy. The details of the movie are all right, especially the scenery in some of the real footage, the time Bundy escaped from the court house was almost identical.
This wasn't the best movie in the world, it had it's disappointments. The perspective of the movie was from Bundy's girlfriend, Liz Kloepfer. It was to show the viewers how Bundy tried to manipulate his girlfriend and then one crazy scene at the end. That was all that you could take from her perspective because the rest of it shied away from that. The other thing that should have been more in the movie is that it isn't ideal to have a bunch of crimes being committed and then have no action to it. If your a director of a movie and you want to persuade people to believe he was a serial killer, you need more action then just in the courtroom. They needed to show a bit more of Bundy throughout his five year rampage.
Overall, this movie was an excellent movie that proves how Bundy really tried to manipulate many to believe he wasn't the one who did it. It also showed his mental issues and how he couldn't resist to commit murder or any crime. He was a very two sided person, a very crazy man. Zac Efron did a brilliant job and was the right actor to example Bundy and how he really was. Yet the movie had it's disappointments, it wasn't anything to wreck the experience. Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile deserves a good representation.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

583,JoyLynn74,A chilling reminder that evil can be beguiling,8,16 June 2019,"I just finished watching this for the second time. I will be honest, the first time I felt it started off slow, but eventually it captivated me. The second time through, I picked up on subtle nuances I missed the first time, and felt it wasn't as slow to start.The performances by the lead actors, Zac Efron and Lily Collins, are phenomenal. Since this film is largely told from the perspective of Ted's girlfriend, Liz (Lily Collins), it provides an alternate view into the psyche of Ted Bundy, and the manipulative hold he had over others. Lily excellently portrays the life-altering destruction of someone's faith and trust in the person they loved and thought they knew - in the most horrific way possible. The way Ted was able to twist her suspicions and fears around and turn them back on her so she doubted herself was classic manipulation. Lily Collins brilliantly portrayed the roller coaster of emotions from infatuation, love, and being spellbound by this man, to fear, doubt, suspicion, and finally confrontation.Zac Efron's portrayal of the sadistic madman of Ted Bundy is absolutely chilling. I realize there were doubts about the decision to cast Efron in this role - if it was romanticizing Ted Bundy or if Efron was ""too handsome"" to play such an evil man. However, that is exactly 100% the point. Part of what made the entire Bundy case so spine-chilling is the reaction of young girls who were captivated by him ... found him charmingly handsome, and simply refused to believe someone so ""dreamy"" could commit such heinous crimes. We may not see it today, looking back with the undeniable evidence and knowledge we now have, but at the time, he was viewed as a very attractive, charming, and beguiling man that many young women trusted completely. They simply did not believe what unspeakable horror lurked in the mind behind those ""kind"" eyes. Zac Efron absolutely nails this in his portrayal. When he is with Liz, he is completely charming - winning her trust with his gentle, loving nature - caring for her daughter, playing the father figure, behaving as a true gentleman. However, as the film progresses, we are given glimpses into the real Ted ... the dark eyes that flash with anger when he is confronted or contradicted, the arrogance, the complete narcissistic disregard for the feelings of others. This handsome, charming, beguiling man turns into a monster ... and the true genius, I believe, is that this is revealed not through blood and gore and re-creating the crimes - that would have been too easy and predictable - it is revealed through Ted's relationships with those around him, and the jarring, chilling perfection of Zac Efron's performance. His ability to make the hair on your neck stand up WITHOUT the gore is a testament to his incredible talent and ability to communicate the pure evil of this man. That being said, the final 15 minutes of this film are the true jaw-dropping, chill-inducing exclamation point. Zac Efron proves in this performance that he has perhaps long been underrated in his acting abilities, and he is more than a ""pretty face"" and shouldn't be judged as such.In addition to the brilliant acting, the story choices and character arcs, directing, and cinematography all combine to make this a film that leaves a haunting impression and make it, in my opinion, an Oscar-worthy success.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

He seemed too quiet. I do however know for a fact that this representation of the story was an excellent portrayal. It is enjoyable, and actually quite magical. Lily Collins gives this movie such an incredible performance, while watching this movie it was almost impossible to peer away from her performance instead of Zac's.There were characters popping up for no reason at all. Carole did not receive a satisfying entrance. It was utterly confusing why she was even there. I would naturally guess her occurrence to be plot convenience, her only purpose served was to have someone crying in the courtroom when Ted is sentenced to death.Quick note, there is a documentary series on netlfix called 'The Ted Bundy Tapes.""

He thought he was being careful with it and he though he wasn't gonna get caught but at the end no matter how carful you are with you bad action you will get caught and figured out and will be punished because that's how life works.The movie starts off with a guy in jail but then goes back in time to a single mother and her friend going out to a bar so that they can meet guys. One of the women is a main character, Elizabeth. She meets this guy Ted at where they are and she starts talking to him, they are hitting it off. While the movie is showing them talking it also shows Ted behind the cell bars in prison and Elizabeth talking to him while crying. Thats when i was very interested in the movie because i really wanted to know why the guy was in jail. The movie shows how Ted and her get super close and he meets her daughter and basically showing how his trying to be a father figure to her. Through out the movie Ted seems like a super gentle guy who is caring and loving and does everything for Elizabeth and her daughter. It also shows that Ted only lives with them part time and goes to studying in another state far from Elizabeth but still continues to see her when he can. As Ted is driving one night he gets pulled over because he has a car that is similar to a suspect's car who has been killing women. It shows how Ted is confused and has no idea what is happening, Elizabeth gets a call from him at jail and she's also confused too. Later they let me go free then during that time that Ted is free another woman is killed, so they arrest Ted again. Then Elizabeth finds out about all the women that are going missing and being found dead. The cops and investigators accuse Ted of doing such horrible things to these dead women. Ted says he didnt do it and Elizabeth believes him but she also still has a feeling that he might of done it but because she loves him so much she stays talking to him. Before Ted went to jail, he and Elizabeth went to look for dogs and that's when they ran into carole, an old friend of Teds. It seems though Carole likes Ted and isn't happy seeing him with another girl. Elizabeth decides to move on with her life and forget about Ted while Carole steps in and supports Ted through it all and tries her best to set him free. Ted told all the same things he told Elizabeth about their future life to Carole, showing him a liar and just trying to get people to trust him. While Teds in jails the cops have much more evidence on him and can prove that he did murder women. While Ted goes through all these courts and such they finally sentenced him to death. Ted plays Innocent the whole time but when it comes to the day where they have to kill him he tells Elizabeth all the things he did and how he killed those women. One of the movie's themes was that you can't ever trust anyone in your life until you are sure Elizabeth always had her debuts, and she was just very worried all the time. But at the end she makes a good life for her and the child. This movie also showed how some people manipulate people into falling in love with them and using them to give yourself a better life, and thinking that they are a good person while they are still doing such bad things. Also tells how loving someone a lot makes you trust what they say.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

I understand the the producer was trying to seem as though that Ted Bundy did genuinely seem innocent. But we all knew he wasn't, so let's see some gore. At most of the points i was bored.

I really never knew much about it, just the basics my mother told me. I didn't get curious about it until she passed and I was older. I came to discover he was convicted of murder after three trials. He was accused of murdering a twelve year old girl.It hurts horribly to know he was most likely guilty and that I am related to him. I did research about the trial and his past. Something I probably really should not have looked into. But human curiousity and the hope perhaps he wasn't guilty keep me looking.

The story is not just about Ted homicides, it's about that even psychopatic killers have they own story and love stories, and for me, this movie was very good experience. Unique in it's own way. If there will be some more gory, the whole concept will be different RIGHT? GO WATCH IT. Whole movie i felt empathy for ted's girlfriend. Movie Rating? UNDERATED.And daaaamn actors performance??

Someone said they saw him in a different light? Like he was a person capable of love?
NO!
You saw him in the light HE CONVEYED to others. That was the point. It's teaching you to look out for the little things, because some people are so good at hiding who they truly are. All throughout, there were red flags she ignored.
Someone else made a valid point, that the perspective of law enforcement isn't recognised in the cases of these people. And I agree. No one ever stops to consider how it would impact the lives of the ones forced to deal with them.
The ones who were annoyed that the murders weren't shown? Grow up.
It's a true story. Which means the murders stemmed from his psyche. The more you know about their behaviour, the better chance of recognising it in your own life BEFORE a murder occurs, and thus avoiding a horrible death. Analyse the situation from different perspectives, and you gain a greater understanding in to the way these people operate. To better protect yourselves and the people around you.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
607,KarlinaD,Solid performances by Effron & Collins,8,22 June 2019,"If you aren't familiar with Ted Bundy and simply looking for a serial killer movie, you may miss the the stunning likeness that Effron takes on to embody this character. The movie also takes care to be as accurate as they can. Unfortunately, true stories don't always have the plot archetype and closure that many crave. I could see how this might leave viewers wanting more. I think a tiny bit more into Ted's mindset - his lack of ability to have empathy and create emotional connections-things he discussed in his final interview-might give the average viewer who doesn't understand antisocial personality disorder more context, in a way that they might be able to better understand how someone could be capable of the unthinkable acts he committed. I think giving that type of understanding -from Ted's perspective- to the viewer would have elevated the movie to a different level.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

609,child_4,Entertaining but lacking what most of the audience wants now,7,14 July 2019,"I really enjoyed watching this picture. Zac is charismatic, professional and tries his best. However, while watching him I have a couple of times thought to myself how cute he was in High school musical. And that was my problem. But perhaps it is everything what it should be: Ted was a mystery and this movie is. It doesn't really catches you or brings a thrill to you and you end up searching on the Internet the true story of Boundy. This movie leaves you unsatisfied and you want more of the story. How would I picture this story to my liking?
1. Do it in a True Detective/Mindhunter mini series way
2. Bring 2 perspectives together: killer's and investigators
3. More blood (sounds awful, but you cannot show a monster until you show what he'd done).
4. Ryan Gosling as Ted.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

611,rjewkes15,Viewing a Serial Killer Through the Lense of His Lover,8,5 May 2019,"Unlike past movies about serial killers, ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"" twists the genre, allowing the viewer to see the killer trough the eyes of his lover. The pleas of innocence, the lies that he was set up, and the overall charming demeanor of Ted Bundy (performed practically perfectly by Zac Efron) leave the viewer in the same situation as Liz, Bundy's lover: do you choose to believe Bundy's claims or the increasing evidence against him? Joe Berlinger does an excellent job at accurately portraying the true events on a very compelling and psychologically deep story line.As I've already briefly touched on, the performances by Efron and Lily Collins are phenomenal. The rest of the casting was also very well done. The cinematography was different, but accurate in capturing the emotions of both Liz and Ted through the entire movie. The erie 360 degree continuous pan around the two at a crucial point of rising action gives the film a deeper element. The slow zoom-in closeups of Bundy at the climax help portray his evil character and realization of his impeding death.The only con with this movie is the fact that Netflix owns the distribution rights, so you have to pay for the whole monthly subscription just to watch this. But that's not really on the film crew at all, just the producers and production company. Ignore the petty reviews by people that think they know how to create better films than academy award nominated directors. This film is worth your time and does not portray the overly graphic elements that most filmmakers feel compelled to toss into the storyline.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

613,yahtike,Incomplete,5,15 May 2019,"I can agree with many of the comments I read below. Both the good and the bad ones. I agree that there is no reason for this movie to be gory or to show all of the disgusting details of his murders. But I did expect a more complete story, to me the movie felt incomplete. I was disappointed and waiting for the clue as I saw the movie was going to end in the next 10 minutes. I wanted the whole Ted Bundy story, I watch many true crime shows on television and what makes them interesting for me is the whole story, what happened before, how they did it, and why they did it. I was left with so many questions! The movie focused only on the part that Ted Bundy was a manipulative charming man that fooled everyone, but what is interesting to me and what I wanted to learn about this case was how he eventueally did admit to these crimes and what drived him and how he justified his crimes. This person was sick, I was wanted to learn more about both his Jackyll & Hyde personalities, but I feel we only saw one side in this movie. I was so curious to learn how he eventually admitted it, THAT was the spectaluar moment right? We see him in this movie for over an hour maintain his innocence, and in real life I don't know how long he said he was innocent. So that crucial switch, that moment where he finally admitted his crimes and explained how his mind worked. THAT to me was the interesting and fascinating part, and that was just nog present in the movie and that was such a shame. I ended up having to google this part of the Ted Bundy case. I also agree that there should have been more attention to the victims and his murders. It's important not to hide these parts, we need to know the monster he was, so we can learn from it ifor the future! A shame, the Ted Bundy case is unique and I would have liked to see the whole complete story in this movie, to me that is where it failed. That being said, the actors were GREAT! It was the writing that was poor.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
614,b-honigman1,Told from a Bundy point of view.,1,14 May 2019,"Most people in today's culture have no idea what a horrible piece of garbage this guy was. If this is the portrayal of 1970's serial killers lets make a movie about John Wayne Gacy and how he was just a lowly manager of some KFC's and he just really wanted to love his family and it was all societal faults that brought him down. Or BTK and his public service with code enforcement and his commitment to his church. It has NOTHING to do with their lives outside of brutally killing people. It all has to do with the fact that Bundy, along with every other serial killer in history, is a manipulative piece of human garbage that doesn't even deserve to breathe the same air that most people do. People give this a 10-10 because Zac Effron was in it. If it was the same film attempting to show Gacy as a likable guy with some fat dude playing him and his overt manipulations people would have a different opinion. He's garbage. He stole daughters, sisters, and moms from their families. I have no sympathy for him.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

-Most of the court room speeches are totally wrong or never even happened
-They didn't have to force him to have his teeth molded. He let them after some discussion

If you are going into this movie as your first insight to Bundy, you may be left feeling some compassion for him and confused as to how he became one of the world's most infamous and brutal serial killers, as the atrocities of his crimes and his disturbing nature isn't truly showcased.On the other hand if you're going into this well versed you may find it a little stagnant at times. Especially the trial scenes where a lot of famous quotes were repeated and all the meaty details were left out.It was interesting to watch Liz's experience and it did create a fresh perspective and dimension to the whole Bundy era.

I am a young woman and watching this, although I am well aware of his crimes, it was hard to believe he was guilty. The fact that Zac Efron was able to portray that is Oscar worthy (although we all know he won't win cause it's a streaming service movie). Lily Collins is also phenomenal. Personally, I find true crime documentaries repetitive and annoying, and the Ted Bundy tapes were no exception (although maybe I'll try to rewatch them).

Or manage to make the character of Bundy especially interesting or complex. The story do fail to communicate what horrors this man really did, or how deluded he often acted towards those around him included his lawyers, but make him seem like a quite regular behaved guy in almost all situations. Bundys victims seems completely forgotten in the movie. Unimportant and minimized to some newspaperclips. I do seriously not know what the point of the movie is, or what the director/writer of the story is trying to communicate to the audience. It feels like someone have made a movie cause they know that as soon as they use the name Ted Bundy, people will be watching. A movie made just for the purpose of entertainment, and to generate money. And I think that can feel like a slap in the face, for those still touched by-, or victim of this mans crimes. I strongly recommend to watch the different documentaries about the case instead, if you wish to learn something about this unique historic and terrifying case. And if you are looking for a movie just for entertainment sake, this will still be a waste of time.

Well this movie changed my opinion about him. He actually nailed the role. At one point in the movie his look was so intense that it made you feel something on the inside (the scene with the dog). I hope for his acting career that he will take more roles like this one.

However, if you are looking to see the accounts of those influenced and tricked by him; This is the film for you. If you knew nothing about Ted bundy going in the director may have you believing he was actually innocent. And that, is the point of this movie.

Yes, I get it, it basically showed Bundy as Liz, the long-time girlfriend saw him, what she heard about him during the investigations, how she felt about him and their relationship. Plus it listed some fresh and surprising faces like James 'Master of Puppets' Hetfield, Haley Joel 'I see dead people' Osment, Jim 'Bazinga' Parsons and of course the great John Malkovitch. But honestly, who is interested in Bundy as the lover, or the guy who gets picked up by police and sits through his trials? I bet most people would have wanted to see the attacks and murders, that is the real Bundy. Are there movies about that? Sure, probably a lot. Was there a movie about Liz before? Probably not.

It seemed like I was watching a movie about a man who was wrongfully convicted and under the thumb of authorities. I know he made claims to being framed, but I felt the film tried to make you think there was potential for it to be true.

637,zackroszak,Full of Potential but Ultimately a Bummer,6,15 May 2019,"Americans love their true crime stories. A number of recent documentaries like Making a Murderer and Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes have received praise for being some of the most entertaining hours of media in recent memory. Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile attempts to be just as entertaining as those stories with the added flair of a Hollywood film, but ultimately can't serve as a standalone journey through Ted Bundy's horrific crimes. Classified under biographical movies in the Netflix queue, this movie would've been better served as a dramatic re-telling instead of attempting to strictly follow the perceived story of one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.The timing of release matters. Conversations With a Killer may have done more harm than good for Extremely Wicked considering the vast majority of the audience watching this Netflix film has likely dabbled in the amazing documentary prior to sitting through Zac Efron trying to convince us that he's a psychopathic killer with a dual personality. Granted, playing the role of a serial killer who is playing the role of a normal guy isn't an easy acting job and you can tell Efron gives 110% to the part. I believe he could've convinced us he was a serial killer, but he was never given the chance considering the sporadic nature of the film. I didn't quite get to the point of believing I was watching Ted Bundy, partly because I just listened to the actual Ted Bundy via the documentary but also because the movie doesn't have a solid grasp of what it's trying to portray. You get bits and pieces of really good stuff, but ultimately the movie never took a direction and went with it.To be transparent, my expectations were for us to take a journey into the mind of a psycho, exploring his mental state and his difficulty dealing with a dual personality rivaled only by Two-Face. Unfortunately, Bundy's mental illness is never really touched on, save for a glimpse of struggle towards the very end. One of the best parts of Conversations With a Killer is that you can literally hear Bundy referring to himself when describing the heinous acts that got him fried, similar to how Bruce Banner refers to the Hulk as ""the other guy."" It's clear that this movie was never going to be that, but instead tried to be a twisted love story between Bundy, his tortured former girlfriend Liz and his lover Carole.The performance of Lily Collins as Liz is where the film shines. She's portrayed as the ultimate victim in the story, and the filmmakers even went to the lengths of throwing in a ""suffocating"" metaphor in her final confrontation with Ted before she finally gets closure on her horrendous past. This is another spot where the film dips its toe into something really interesting but never fully commits to being more about Ted's ancillary victims instead of Ted himself.Sadly, the most uninteresting parts of the movie were the scenes with Bundy himself. Efron does his best to portray a pretty boy who wants everyone to think he's the victim, but we never get a full sense of the objective. Was this a story about the glorification of a serial killer or was this a sadistic love tale between a psychopath and a lady in distress? I can't really tell, but I know I would've been more entertained if the film would've picked a lane.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"

643,oliviamartin-16569,Extremely disappointed,3,6 May 2019,"I have been looking forward to this movie for a very long time and I honestly can say what a waste of my time waiting for this movie to come out. I would at least thought they would of made it like the original movie but maybe a little bit better and updated.The only good thing about this movie was that it had Zac Efron in it but that is about it. It didn't really show what Ted Bundy was really like, like in the original movie.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
644,rmwood-92346,Zach captured Ted Bundy,8,7 May 2019,"If you watch this film and haven't seen any video of Bundy.....do it! He captured him perfectly. Having seen many documentaries on TB, I can honestly say I was shocked how well ZE portrayed him. I went to YouTube immediately after the film ended and compared the two.
The movie was very well done, instead of showing the gore he inflicted on his victims, they speak of it......just hearing of the vile things he did.....is enough.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
645,bapgar-17341,Trash,3,5 May 2019,"Absolute garbage film. Decent performance by Zach. My girlfriend got excited 90 minutes in when he flashes his glutes. Outside of that we both sat there bored for 2 very long hours.
3 stars is generous.
The movie jumps all over entire time. Nothing climatic ever occurs. No profiling of the murders. Nothing on his messed up childhood. The most boring serial killer movie ever while missing out on such a huge opportunity to chronicle one of the most infamous of the millennial gen X generation.
Proof of what 90% of Netflix Original Movies are - huge hype, solid cast, poor writing and directing.
The only was this movie could be more trash is if De Niro was Bundys lawyer.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
646,nikolsorrentino,Feels severly cut down,7,3 May 2019,"I oddly feel like there is so much that was cut because I felt like there were so many gaps they skipped.
Class performances that earn the rating alone but i found myself alot of the time wondering if I missed something. If there's something of a directors cut or a longer edited I'd be really interested to see that.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
647,jeffsrachel,"Great acting, interesting view from Liz's perspective and able to emote without being too graphic",8,4 May 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. Zac Efron, Lily Collins and Kaya Scodelario are great at portraying the roles and really connected with the audience to show a different side to the story of Ted Bundy. The horrible truth to Ted's crimes wasn't shown through actual gory scenes but still managed to show his eerie side by the way he put on a 'normal' face to people around him. I thought some of the scenes between Ted and Liz were really creepy and the ending scene where he confesses to Liz without having to use words was a really nice end, it gave me some sort of closure as he finally broke character which we didn't get to see in the film. I thought the story was respectful to the families by not including scenes of the victims and focused more on Ted's mentality in subtle ways. I was dreading the film glamorising Ted but it accurately portrayed his personality and mannerisms which was so interesting to watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
648,kaitlinfalatovich,Surprisingly Unique.,9,5 May 2019,"I read a lot of reviews before watching that said this movie was a glamorized account of Ted Bundy but I think it's more than that. Personally, I thought the film focus was more Lizs struggle to come to terms with the fact that the man she loves is a monster all while try to navigate his lies. Is it a perfect film? Not nearly. Does it show how Bundy tried countless times to control his narrative and failed? I think so. I really like it.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
649,heyshagen,Finally...a powerful...WHOLE...well acted...beautifully edited ..fantastically directed movie,10,13 May 2019,"""EWSE & V"" THANK YOU!!
I have not seen anything that has been this completely solid and whole for so long.Quite frankly.. almost give up on anything new and different ever being made.Between the constant pummeling of the social justice/injustice meets political correctness being rammed down our throats... well, its a little much. 24/7 telling us all how rotten we are- yep...""such fun""...Sorry.. back to my review...It is dark but all too human. It is so well paced and these actors whom, (with the exception of Malkovich who is an American Treasure), have never been anything more to me than teenage fluff .I apologize.Mr Efron... What a powerhouse.. So incredibly controlled is his portrayal of a sociopath. Never over the top.. never hungry to show us the ""evil"". It takes patience and a real maturity to push the ""humanity"" out of the monster.By the way.. I want to respond to this idea that this movie is making the real Ted Bundy look like a sympathetic guy. These people have not bothered to take the time out to see the movie. They are simply talking out of their asses. We all loathe these people. Moving on...All the actors did such a fantastic job. All took risks I think. This is not an easy subject matter. It would have been so easy for any of these actors to have been over the top... none were. They played it straight. And it worked. You will all recognize the actors.. Jim Parsons and Haley Joel Osment, for instance were just terrific. Terry Kinney had a minor role you may remember him from Fargo.. just a solid performance... And even James Hetfield from Metallica has a small role.. again sober performances.This film gives the viewer a unique point of view- rather than get caught up in the sensational and salacious aspects of the story.. the grotesque...the monster... we see a chameleon We see the manipulator..a man that knew how to connect with people by creating what that specific person wanted to see. And each person would see an entirely well formed Ted Bundy..but which Bundy was real?... which was not. Were any of his connections with the normal world real...or was everything a lie. THAT is why this film is so intriguing because it reminds us that the real danger is NOT in a monster who is easily seeable....Rather it is the monster we cannot see.. the one who walks by us at the supermarket..the one we say hello too dropping off our kids.This film should also leave us with this discomfort..MEDIA.. They are portrayed aptly and without mercy..GOOD.I hope this film, the director and Mr Efron are nominated for Oscars. It would be well deserved!!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
650,anderssohman,Absolutely tasteless movie!!,1,5 May 2019,"How can anyone make a kind of ""lovemovie"" about the totally evil Ted Bundy?? What is the next project? Musical? Maybe a childrens cartoon? When you know the backstory about Ted Bundy and his extremely Evil crimes, cant you understand the purpose of this movie. Do the director want to show some kind of ""human"" side of this monster?Dont watch this movie!!!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
651,tjuks,Shockingly evil,9,4 May 2019,"I Think that this movie really captures the reality of how charming ted bundy was. It does this through the idea of the viewer (us) kind of teams up with Ted Bundy and taking his side, with us Well aware knowing that he did these horrible crimes.Very good movie about a horrible man.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
652,inkblotintimates,Portrait of a Killer,9,28 May 2019,"When portraying the story of a serial killer onscreen, most people would imagine a gory flick filled with jump scares and closeups of instruments of torture.I was so pleased to watch this movie, which delved deeper into the humanity of Ted Bundy. The ability to twist others emotions, his raw confidence, and constant advocation for innocence were almost sickening to watch. I've heard his story a dozen times, but not in this way: as a character study of a real man, who was a real monster. Throughout the film you are never treated to a definite deceleration of guilt, not a scene showing you the deeds (until the very very end). You almost find yourself wondering ""Did he really do it? How could this handsome, charismatic person be guilty?""Zac Efron surprises no one by being fabulous, he has been and will continue to be a good performer. I am so happy to find a new-to-me face in Lily Collins, and see some of my favorite like John Malkovitch and Jeffrey Donovan. Having seen Hayley Joel Osment onstage in 'Red' I knew his chops were just waiting for more dramatic work like this.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
653,plrussell-40306,Poor portrayal,1,5 May 2019,This film seems to miss out the fact that Ted Bundy was an evil sadistic brutal serial killer and rather paints him in a good light.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
654,Michellestardust,Romanticization of a serial killer,6,29 March 2020,"The work of the cast & crew is magnificent. Zach, Lily, Kaya and John were absolutely amazing and entertaining. It was so refreshing to see Zach in a different character, he portrayed it very well and I believed him. Costumes, Art and Set design were amazing! Very accurate and sticks to reality.
However, there is a moral issue that appears in the movie, the question whether Bundy actually did the actions attributed to him or is he just an innocent victim that the law system saw as an easy target to blame?
We (as viewers) are uncertain and hesitate if he's guilty or not: which in fact, in real life was never a question. Ted Bundy's guilt was never in doubt. From my mother's and I PERSONAL experience, there were moments in which we were 'rooting' for Bundy and hoping he'll get 'justice' - something that should NEVER happen. The movie, just like Bundy himself, was manipulative and made us unconsciously pick a side, it emphasizes his twisted personality and mind and makes us, the audience, his victims - we're being deceived. That way, the movie IS indeed clinging to the original form in which he wanted to engage in, the memories of a woman who was mislead by him and believed his innocence. The movie's focusing too much on the question ""did he do it"" and not ""what motivated Ted?"" Who was he? What about his resume? In order to realize WHO WAS Ted Bundy we must know his biography, which can be used as some explanations to how he ended up in his position and could fill some holes in the plot line.
In my opinion, the movie's not reaching it's full potential and lacks some depth.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
655,ataberkayakyuz,Zac killed it!,8,6 May 2019,I recommend you to watch this movie forgetting who Ted Bundy is. If you do this you can find yourself watching a movie about a innocent man trying to save himself from false charges of murder. Zac really did an awesome job here. Just try to watch this film from this perspective. Even though clearly you know who he is and what he has done. Act like you don't know anything about Ted. And the movie will show it's magic for you.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
656,jcheshire-22530,Extremely Wicked and Shockingly Good,10,5 May 2019,This movie was simply outstanding! Zac Efron nailed the role of serial killer Ted Bundy. It was nice to see James Hetfield with a small role. Everyone in the film was on point. Watch this movie.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
657,wgreene-47108,My first Ted Bundy movie,5,12 March 2020,"First of all, the title of the movie does not fit the description of the film, fact. The title fits Ted Bundy as the character he was but apparently that's not the way they wanted to film it. Why name the film like that then?However, five stars out of ten is average so it wasn't completely bad. Zac Effron acted Ted Bundy spectacularly with his chrism and charm.Personally, I would have liked the movie to be longer and add the scenes of his brutal killings so we get the best of both worlds. His charming self and the freak he really was. It would also test Zac Effron too which would have been interesting. I probably won't watch it again even though I find Ted Bundy very interesting.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
658,skm-91597,Great film,8,4 May 2019,"Great acting, great story, people are forgetting that this was not from the view of bundy but from the view of his fiancée, I think zac was the perfect person to play bundy also","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
659,kristalrice,A Twisted Love Story,10,5 May 2019,People seemed to be taken aback by the plot of this film but I have anticipated this film for over a year. I am very familiar with the story of Ted Bundy I did need another murdery-stabby-slashy Ted Bundy film. This film was an amazingly beautiful twisted love story. I have never seen Zac Efron act in anything prior to this. I'm 28 years old I'm beyond high school musical. So I am pleasantly surprised by Zac Efron and his acting. Lily Collins was also very great in this film.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
660,burakkaner-42395,"Good biography, not thriller",6,17 August 2019,"I have never watched the documentary about ted bundy, so this movie was interesting for me as a biography movie. But the material is much more than that, this could have been a hell of a thriller-biography movie. There is no scene of murders and this makes the movie more like a documentary. It is a still good movie, I recommend everyone to watch this especially if they haven't watched the documentary. Zac makes the movie more watchable, his play was really good but he could have add more sociopathic features to his character because the audience didn't buy it that he was a serial killer. Overall this is a interesting 6/10 movie but it could have been easily 8 .","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
661,chrisruizice,A Captivating Narrative,9,3 May 2019,"Throughout the film, Zac Efron's performance as Ted Bundy being cool, calm, collected and charming was spectacular. His overall performance was chilling as he provokes you to feel as though he is innocent. This movie is a look at how serial killer movies should be done. They aren't just crazies out on the street, they're your coworkers, your friends, your family. Sit back and contemplate every relationship you've had as you watch a captivating narrative on Ted Bundy's trial and later life.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
662,annefourie,Excellent!,10,12 May 2019,I watched the Bundy Tapes afterwards and the similarities and acting is really great.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
663,vanessagraf,I love the Movie,8,22 November 2019,"A good movie with very good actors, that was the first time I saw Zac Efron in such a role but he did a really good job.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
664,vickijacobson,Brilliant! Sad so many people misses the point,10,10 May 2019,"First off, even I was worried that I wouldn't be able to see Zac Efron as anything else but Troy Bolton running around trying to be a serial killer, I was so happy to be proven wrong. Zac was brilliant in this part, very convincing!Without giving away the movie, I'm sad that so many missed the point and gave it such a low rating because they expected more gore. First off, this is based of a true story, with families still suffering from what Ted did to their beloved ones. I think that putting Liz perspective as the main story was a great choice because Ted wasn't the type that anyone would suspect due to his charms and manipulation. Imagine spending years of your life with someone this vile and everything you know about him is the opposite. I'm glad they chose to share Liz's side of the story.Other than that the movie was everything I wanted it to be. Actors where beautifully casted, the resemblance is sometimes scary on point. The costumes and settings were great, I was never bored even though it wasn't much action or gore.Only thing I could complain about is questionable camerawork at some scenes, (especially the scene where Ted and Carole Ann talks and the camera moves around them in an unsteady manor) but it's not enough to lower the over all score! Bravo!","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
665,brenzuk,Biggest let down of the year,1,10 May 2019,"There is no violence, murder, bludgeoning, rape or any ounce of excitement in this film. It is little more than a court room montage to Zac Efron. Boring unless your a 12 year girl with a crush on Zac...","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
666,kaykorbel-54649,Rushed,4,13 August 2019,"I felt this movie was very rushed over all of the incidents that took place of Bundy's reign. It seems to me that a dramatic love story is what they were going for and didnt even focus on his actual self and the things he did. The movie was made from his girlfriend Lizs perspective however I think it would have been much better from Ted's perspective instead. They left out so much, including the little girl that was murdered, she was only mentioned for a second by the girlfriend. I feel they could have put more thought into this.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
667,sarahosseinpour,Not what I expected,6,4 May 2019,The plot was boring and I missed some thrills and excitement,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
668,wmturner-50993,UNDERWHELMING,5,3 May 2019,"Very underwhelming , expected a lot from the trailer however majority of it is Zac Efron in a prison with very little explanation of what's going on. Dissapointed","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
669,jentrymoore,People are missing the point,10,4 May 2019,"By now, people know about Ted Bundy and what a monster he was. But people who are saying this movie is boring, I believe they are missing the point. It's not about the Gorey details of his crimes, it's about Bundy's relationship with people and how manipulative he was.I am a true crime fan and have always considered myself ""too smart to fall for such evil"", but I have to admit, there were times when I found myself rooting for Ted Bundy and then realized what I was doing. If you let yourself be fully submerged in the movie and toss out any expectations and what you think you know about Ted Bundy, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what you are able to feel about someone who was a living nightmare. It made me realize why so many women could have actually fallen for Bundy's tricks.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile"
