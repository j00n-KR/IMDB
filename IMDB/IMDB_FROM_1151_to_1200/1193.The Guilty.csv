0,SnoopyStyle,great thrills,8,29 September 2019,"Policeman Asger Holm is answering calls at Emergency Services. He's been forced into desk duty for an unknown reason but he expects to get back to the streets tomorrow. He's callous towards the callers until he receives a call from Iben. She seems to have been kidnapped by an unknown assailant.This is a thriller on the phone. It's very effective with shocking twists and turns. I also really like the change in Asger along the way. This needs one small change in the movie. A call center like that usually has a supervisor walking the floor. As soon as Asger gets the licence plate number, he needs to hand it over to the supervisor so that he could stay on the line with the kid until the arrival of the policemen. I don't like it whenever he hangs up on the callers or put them on hold. I don't think it would be done like that. He needs a supervisor helping him out. Of course in the last act, he could still go into that room to isolate himself and heighten the tension. Overall, this is a great character thriller where all the action happens off screen.",The Guilty
1,Horst_In_Translation,Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat from start to finish,8,30 October 2018,"""Den skyldige"" or ""The Guilty"" is a new Danish film that runs for 85 minutes and was written and directed by Gustav Möller. He already received a great deal of awards recognition here and it is well-deserved. Impressive job by him, but also by his lead actor Jakob Cedergren and I find it a bit disappointing he has not received that much praise and recognition. But maybe it will still happen, we will see. It is basically a one-man performance from start to finish. Yes, there are supporting actors visible, but their impact is minimal. The impact of the voice actors portraying the characters you don't see, just hear, is considerably bigger, but Cedergrean stays the heart and soul of it all. I think it was also a very challenging work. The premise with the camera on one man and the story he finds out about (and we find out about with him) may seem small, but it is never an easy movie. Keeping the audience interested was as big of a challenge as drawing them in as the crucial moment, the first phone conversation between the emergency call operator and the abducted woman, is one that will have to spark gigantic interest in the audience as if they had missed out (""they"" means Möller in this case), then there's no way to get them back in. But luckily did they not only not miss out, they even completely nailed this part.The story stays thrilling afterward and the film never loses its tension or appeal. It is easy to feel for the character. The only reason his own story about the crime he may have commited did not have a huge impact on me is because the other story line that is much more in the center of it all is far more breathtaking. Of course, we also find out a lot more about that one. And there is a big plot twist that works very well, also because, if you pay attention closely enough, you will see it coming the way I did. Why would the man care about his daughter's well-being when he just killed his son? Why does he allow the woman to talk to somebody in a scenario in which he should realize quickly it is not her daughter. Why does the woman say she does not want to be imprisoned again. And there was one other crucial quote I don't remember anymore. But you could see it coming for sure. At least in the sense of the father being innocent and not judging him too quickly because of his previous offenses. This is also a trap that the main character falls into. But you cannot really blame him. Even if he does basically everything wrong, he still somehow does everything right. He manages that the woman escapes from the man, even if it may result in her suicide. He manages to calm down the daughter while she is standing next to the boy's corpse. And you could mention two or three other crucial moments. The title is also very interesting as initially you may think it refers to the abductor, then you may think it refers to the abducted and finally you know that it is our protagonist as there is no way out probably for him, out of the arms of the law, after what he did and the argument he just said it to calm her down will not make sense at all. He may have saved her life eventually, but he probably destroyed his own. Also he is far from a hero himself, he disobeys orders, has blood on his hands and is not scared of convincing friends to commit illegal offenses. He is more of an antihero than a hero, that much is safe. But it's impossible to move your eyes away from the screen with how well the film was made and how convincingly the main actor plays the part, even if he did not have me glued to the screen initially. All in all, this is the best 2018 film I have seen so far and I highly, highly recommend checking it out. I see it is Denmark's official Oscar submission, but I am not too sure style and subject will be appealing enough for the Academy to choose it as one of the five nominees and it may not get in the footsteps of Denmark's success in the last years at the Oscars. It sure would be deserving for the film to get in, but oh well: If it doesn't, it doesn't make it a worse movie. Don't miss out on this one. See it on the big screen.",The Guilty
2,kosmasp,The Room - and outside,8,3 May 2019,"This is really tense - and all that with the viewer not having the full picture. You are with a guy trying to figure out what is going on. Being on the phone and navigating the police and the victim(s) is not an easy task. Taking it all to heart and not letting anyone else take over shows dedication, but maybe also a human trait that's not that good.Not being able to let go can work but it can also backfire. The movie really goes into detail and therefor might not be for everyone. We're talking about a drama/thriller playing out in a room and the real stuff happening elsewhere. Now if you think that is something interesting go ahead and watch, otherwise you should not bother.",The Guilty
3,evanston_dad,The Guilty,8,6 March 2019,"""The Guilty"" is one of those one-man show movies that revolve around a single character in a single location working through some sort of dramatic situation. In this film, the character is a cop who's been put on 911 call center duty while he awaits trial for misconduct on the job. The way he handles the emergency that falls into his lap and the way he goes about making decisions, most of them bad ones, tells us a lot about him and how he probably ended up on trial in the first place.Movies like this are always going to feel to a certain extent like gimmicks and will have to deal with the distractions that come with that (How will it maintain dramatic tension? How will it remain visually engaging?) This one uses a plot twist that serves to both throw the audience for a loop and reveal much about our main character, namely that he makes a whole heap of assumptions when dealing with a crisis scenario, not the best attribute for a police officer.A slick, effective little thriller that's well worth your time.Grade: A-",The Guilty
4,ferguson-6,tummy in knots,9,26 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Some people prefer their movies to be light-hearted escapes from the real world - two hours of mindless entertainment that distract from real life responsibilities. Then there are the rest of us: the movie-goers who thrive on having our emotions and nerves mangled and twisted, leaving us drained and strained as we stumble from the theater after the closing credits. For those in the second group, meet Danish writer/director Gustav Moller.It's a remarkable first feature film, and Mr. Moller shares screenwriting credit with Emil Nygaard Albertsen, and it's what we might call a one-room or confined-space thriller. Others in this claustrophobic category would include the classic 12 ANGRY MEN (1957) and more recent films like BURIED (2010), the underrated LOCKE (2013), and the Oscar nominated ROOM (2015). Most, if not all, of the action in these films takes place in a single setting, and the filmmakers creatively use that limited space in a way that elevates the story and tension.Jakob Cedergren is stunning as Asger Holm, an officer frustratingly on ""desk duty"" at the emergency dispatch center. Asger has been so assigned due to an unspecified internal investigation, and he takes out some of his irritation on callers he quickly judges to be responsible for their own situation - drunken brawlers and those looking to exchange commerce for companionship (wink-wink). However, a breathy call from a woman who claims to be kidnapped immediately ignites Asger's instincts and street smarts.Iben (the voice of Jessica Dinnage) informs Asger, through a series of yes-no questions that her ex-husband has kidnapped her, stranding her two young children home alone. Asger cleverly uncovers that Iben is being transported via white van on a major highway. It's at this point that he remains calm and reassuring to Iben, while expertly juggling other phone calls for assistance: dispatch, highway patrol, even his somewhat intoxicated and disinterested former partner. Rather than route this call per protocol, Asger takes control with technology, experience and instincts as his only tools ... likely sensing both the need for urgency and his shot at redemption.The film is mostly just a series of phone conversations, yet somehow my stomach was tied up in knots! The isolation and desperation is evident on both ends of the line between Asger and Iben, and some outstanding sound design with ambient noise provides our only other link outside the barren walls of the call center. Cinematographer Jasper Spanning makes creative use of cameras to enhance the claustrophobic setting and story - often using tight shots and close-ups of Asger's remarkable face. Every viewer is likely to jump to conclusions without having full details, emphasizing human nature's quick trigger for assumptions. Still, in only 85 minutes, we experience a tension-packed, nerve-wracking, yet artistic presentation ... one that leaves us in awe of Jakob Cedergren's performance and Gustav Moller's future.",The Guilty
5,morrison-dylan-fan,Hanging On The Telephone.,9,2 December 2020,"Since becoming aware of the title after Roth Cornet picked it as her second favourite film of the year on Screen Junkies,this is a title I've been wanting to see, but have kept missing the chance to catch it. Searching the Thriller section on Netflix UK,I was happy to spot the movie,but shocked to find it was going to leave the site in two days,leading to me quickly joining the jury.View on the film:Taking the calls with none of the people he speaks to appearing on screen, Jakob Cedergren gives a astonishing performance as Holm.Listening to the lives of others whilst only getting the odd aside comment from fellow staff at the call centre, Cedergren records across his face the increased urgency of Iben's calls,who takes Holm from a passive, counting down the hours until his work shift is over void, into raw anguish, responding to revelations made over the line.Connecting to the idea for a film after being taken by the amount conveyed from audio without any images, of a report on a kidnapped woman calling an emergency dispatcher while her kidnapper sat nearby, the screenplay by co-writer/(with Emil Nygaard Albertsen) director Gustav Moller wisely hold back from any cutaways either to those ringing up or to a partner, instead sitting for a intense character study of Holm.Calling up the slow-burn sharp twists of the Thriller in splintered info coming from the various phone calls, the writers curl the twists along the bitter pessimism of Nordic Noir, in Holm's gradually revealing himself, as he is horrified to discover that the images/ assumptions he had made about Iben, have now become disconnected.Sitting right next to Holm for the whole of the film, director Moller makes a feature film debut that turns the dial on a excellent use of sound, subtly ringing out changes in dial tone, clarity in vocals from differences in signal reception,and crackling sound effects creating a chilling impression over what is taking place at the other end of the line.",The Guilty
6,deloudelouvain,One of the better Danish movies I saw.,8,29 December 2018,"A couple years ago I saw two movies where the main character doesn't do anything else than phoning. One movie was called Wheelman and the other I just can't remember the title. The only things they both had in common was that they were extremely boring and that I absolutely hated those movies. I couldn't understand what could be interesting about a guy phoning during the entire movie. In Den Skyldige (The Guilty) it's again about a guy phoning all the time, so you basically have one main character and all the visable others are not relevant to the story or you barely notice them. But the difference this time is that this story is very captivating, and that with just the same shot for almost the entire movie. Credits to Jakob Cedergren, playing the main character Asger Holm, for his very convincing acting, just by the tone of his voice and his facial expressions. Credits also to all the actors playing the narrating voices of the invisible callers. The story is full of suspense, so getting bored this time was just not possible, and on top of that it took me completely by surprise as there is a nice twist to it. A subtitled Danish movie just about a guy phoning, never thought I would enjoy it that much. What a difference a good story and an excellent actor can do with the same shots like the other two movies I saw before. Let Den Skyldige be an example for those two other directors on how you can make a movie interesting with just one shot and a very limited budget.",The Guilty
7,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,The Europeans once again do us proud with another fine thriller,9,11 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJakob Cedergren (Asger Holm) is a former cop, who's been demoted to working answering emergency calls after something went terribly wrong whilst on frontline duty. But he is thrust into a terrifying situation, when Iben (voiced by Jessica Dinnage) calls to say she has been kidnapped. As the call wages on, Jakob learns there may be more to it than he ever could have expected.The 'real time' technique, used in Joel Schumacher's excellent Phone Booth and John Badham's not-so-impressive Nick of Time, is used again, and to great effect, in this Continental offering from feature length debut director Gustav Moller. Euro cinema doesn't tend to get the exposure it deserves, except at various film festivals, and so goes largely unnoticed except by the arthouse crowd, leaving the mainstream minions to suckle on the next Transformers movie. Which is a shame, as it means they miss out on tight, impressive work, such as this.Moller skilfully shoots each scene without a soundtrack, adding an eerie, claustrophobic overtone to the proceedings, as they stay in the same isolated location, moving only from room to room, the story propelled along only by the dynamics of the writing and the plot developments. Its a refreshingly approached work, that relies on genuine progressions and unexpected twists to make it work, rather than all the cheap tricks pulled in your average Hollywood tripe. In the lead (and pretty much only) role, Cedergren adds an understated compassion and quiet determination as the accosted call handler.Although I have now seen it, and written a review, I don't think I picked up everything (or, in fact, quite a lot of it) and it's definitely one that will require a second viewing. I wasn't aware of its existence until the night I saw it, but I'm glad I did, much more than the inevitable naff American remake you know will end up getting made. ****",The Guilty
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A great film? Guilty.,8,13 August 2019,"'The Guilty (2018)' is about bias and prejudice, about abuses of power, about doing wrong even when trying to do right and about how assuming the truth can be just as harmful as lying. Most importantly, it's about perspective. This is keenly represented by the fact that we never leave the protagonist's side, forced to experience the story through a series of phone calls. It's not an unprecedented conceit, but I've yet to be seen it done so successfully; rather than feeling like an experiment or, even, gimmick, it feels like the best - perhaps only - way this story could have been told. It's as exciting a thriller as recent cinema has produced, one that effortlessly escalates with a series of natural-seeming twists (or, perhaps, revelations) that constantly ratchet up the tension and perfectly play with our expectations. In a way, it's difficult to explain why the thing is as utterly riveting as it is. It's literally a 90-minute series of phone conversations but it seems like so much more. I suppose that's because it is. Our hero is fully crafted character, clearly shaped by the events he's told about by the disembodied voices that make up, essentially, the rest of the cast. His initially enigmatic backstory is slowly extrapolated as he undergoes his character arc, which actually makes the inevitable 'exposition dump' incredibly impactful. By tying his personal journey into the wider plot, the piece takes what could've been an impersonal tale and makes it the absolute opposite. You empathise with the protagonist because you share a perspective, which is what makes those aforementioned twists - and some late-game distancing - work as well as they do. It's also interesting that the plot doesn't necessarily get bigger as it goes along; in some ways, it gets more intimate. Rather than introducing stakes via silly conspiracies or world-ending plans, it focuses on domestic horrors and tangible characters. Basically, it always stays realistic. The film is an emotionally-affecting, edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride that's as compelling as it is technically impressive (indeed, it's remarkably well shot and acted). It's unique, exciting and entertaining. 8/10",The Guilty
9,dromasca,not just another Scandinavian thriller,9,7 February 2019,"Novels, television series and movies belonging to the thriller or police investigations genres, coming from Northern Europe, have conquered in the past two decades the interest of the amateurs of these genres. It was a matter of time before one of these films crossed the thresholds of the national selections and of the nominee juries to reach the top list of the Academy Awards. That's what happened with the Danish film 'The Guilty' (the original title is 'Den skyldige'), which reached the short list of the nominated films for the best film award in a foreign language, after having gathered many awards at festivals like Sundance or Toronto. Danish films are, of course, always serious competitors, but it is the first time that a thriller reaches the final of the race, and 'The Guilty' is far from being just another Scandinavian thriller.Unlike in many other series or movies in the genre, there are no endless frozen snow-covered landscapes or any urban jungle of the Scandinavian metropolis in which violence is hidden behind the quiteness and apparent calm of the inhabitants in the film co-written and directed by Gustav Möller (at his first feature film!) Better said, we do not see them, as a violent story does exist in the film but it happens outside, while the camera is always in the same room of the police telephone dispatcher. This is where police officer Asger Holm, suspended from his usual activities as a street cop, gets the calls to the police emergency number, has to sort them out and act, in most cases distributing the cases to police stations widespread in and around Copenhagen. As the action progresses in real time, the audience begins to know Asger, not a model policeman, not always playing according to the rules, a man who can make mistakes, who quickly judges people at the other end of the line and who has to make life and death choices in a matter of seconds. Are his decisions the best? Are his appraisals about those with whom he speaks accurate? As time passes, the case gets more complicated, and the questions get a more general character, the kind of questions we can ask ourselves in everyday life. Do we sometimes make rush judgments? How exact is our first impression of others based on our experience of life, but also a few words exchanged with an unknown (or a few lines read on the Internet to generalize a little)?I confess that I was stuck in the chair and I watched captivated this movie that fascinated me as much as a good action thriller, one with the most spectacular effects, gun shots and car chases. Surprising twists in the plot and thrill elements exist here as well but they take place outside, while what we see is happening in the neutral space of the police station. For 99% of the time we see Asger, his phones and his computer screen. He listens, talks, makes judgments, takes decisions. The quality of the film certainly owes much to Jakob Cedergren's exceptional performance. The actor is in close plan for almost the whole movie, he lives into his role under our eyes that captures every expression of the face, every eye movement, every tremor of the lips, every drop of sweat. The emotional quality of 'The Guilty' even exceeds the boundaries of cinema. It could be just as well a play, it could be a short story or a novel. It is, above all, a shared human experience, a meditation about prejudices and empathy, about the price of mistakes, and about assuming responsibilities. When the hero finally comes out through a lit door, we, the spectators, go out with him from another universe where we have been transported for 85 minutes.",The Guilty
10,Cineanalyst,One Angry Man,8,5 October 2021,"""The Guilty"" is an effective, intense series of phone calls involving an emergency dispatcher. Reportedly, it's inspired by a true story as seen by writer-director Gustav Möller in a YouTube video, which does get at the ensnaring quality of such audio clips--perhaps because we just instantly recognize, being very familiar with them, how it raises the stakes of a situation. That's why ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012) began with just the 911 calls during the 9/11 terrorist attacks against a black screen. There's something both gracious in it, that it spares us from the filmmakers displaying gruesome visuals, and horrifying, in that it confronts us with compensating for that lack of visual depiction in the movies by imagining it ourselves and thus removing even the sense of safety we might have felt in the distance between our eyes and the screen, putting it instead in our heads. This is the first major reason this crime thriller works. It's great sound design. Shortlisted for the Best Foreign Language Oscar, I'm OK with it ultimately missing out on the nomination compared to the tone deafness of not nominating it for the sound awards. I mean, looking over those that were nominated, I like Queen songs and superhero movies, too, but make some room; this is more impressive.The other major reason the intensity here works is the claustrophobic camerawork. The antecedent here is ""12 Angry Men"" (1957), but with the armchair detective in alternating states of isolation between adjoining rooms in relation to the severity and relative hopefulness or hopelessness of the drama--i.e. The worse it gets, the more he's alone. This does largely depend on a compelling performance from Jakob Cedergren, but the camera framing and production design shouldn't be taken for granted. I wonder how much effort they put into getting the beads of sweat rolling down his brow just right, too. It's a heightened situation that is both intensified by this claustrophobia and that calls attention to its artificial parameters, of not only the dispatcher in an office, but of the film style in staying there, as well. There's almost something deconstructive in it--just as the plot twists unravel the narrative. Indeed, eventually, Cedergren's Asger, after constructing his confinement, shades down and isolated in a room, starts deconstructing it by breaking stuff in a fit of anger--just one angry man.Time now to see if there's a reason for the 2021 remake besides to serve illiterate Anglophones.

12,eddie_baggins,A sweat inducing thriller,8,19 May 2019,"Proving once more that you need very little to create an engaging, thrilling and nail-biting feature film, Denmark made The Guilty (soon to be remade with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role) is a fine example of a minimalistic narrative made into something that is well worth your time.Very much similar in tone and construction as the brilliant Tom Hardy starring Locke from 2013, The Guilty literally takes place in a singular office building of Jakob Cedergren's recently demoted police officer Asger Holm, who towards the end of a shift answering emergency phone calls finds himself caught up in a horrific domestic violence and kidnapping case that is taking place in real time as he talks to various players over the phone.It doesn't sound like a particularly enthralling foundation for a feature film but thanks to Gustav Möller's pinpoint direction and Cedergren's commanding lead turn, The Guilty is the type of film you won't be able to look away from as its relatively brief 80 minute runtime flies by.Saying to much about how this seemingly clear-cut but life-altering event takes place over the brisk runtime would be a disservice to the film but rest assured if you go in blind, The Guilty will surprise you with its emotional power and narrative deviations that combat a wide range of hefty topics that will often leave your jaw on the floor as twists and turns come thick and fast.It's a genuinely nail-biting ride and one that's been wonderfully bought to life by Möller and his screenwriting partner Emil Nygaard Albertsen who barely waste a single spoken word as the story unfolds, it's the type of script that will be studied for year's to come thanks to its sharpness and increasing high stakes movements.Much credit must also go to Cedergren who plays his flawed but clearly good-hearted serviceman with aplomb. We never learn too much about Holm other than the fact his got increased pressures on his life and has been more aggravated than usual but Cedergren often through nothing more than subtle character ticks or even dialogue usage creates a well-rounded character that acts as a fine central figure for the film to take place around.Final Say -It's hard to see where an English language re-do of this tale could better what has come before as The Guilty is a sharply observed and brilliantly written thriller, reminding us all that when a film is done well, you need very little flashing lights around it to make it enthralling.4 white vans out of 5",The Guilty

And don't get me wrong, it does have its suspenseful and strange moments, but this film is almost more of a character study. It's a pic that tackles themes of redemption and doing the right thing. And what's also impressive about this film is that all of the action happens in one room, which leaves the viewer imagining himself what could be happening on the other side of the phone.",The Guilty
18,myriamlenys,good thriller / drama,7,4 July 2019,"Actor Jakob Cedergren gives a fine, credible performance as a policeman ""transferred"" (read banished) to the police dispatch centre for emergency calls. When an unknown woman involves the policeman in a pseudo-conversation meant to mask the real intent of her call, he quickly realizes that there's a serious crime going on. Will he be capable of saving the woman before it's too late ?""The guilty"" is a decent movie with a clever, twisty plot which appeals both to the emotions and to the intellect. Unfortunately I saw one of the major twists coming from a mile away. This selfsame twist constituted an error of logic or judgment so serious that few well-trained policemen would make it, even during moments of stress and confusion. It contrasted with the rest of the story, which implied that the policeman involved was a pretty smart individual.Still, a decent movie - and a tribute to the immensely difficult work of the men and women performing similar assignments all over the world.",The Guilty
19,truemythmedia,Intense and Emotional,9,17 September 2019,"I'm a fan of the so-called 'bottled' storylines, where everything that is happening takes place within the confines of one location. Stories like ""The Guilty"" are interesting because they really showcase how a director's craft; if you're a bad director, turning a single location into a dynamic space can be an impossible task, and sometimes the film can eventually turn into boring tests of patience (""Buried"", ""Phone Booth"") but if you're a great director, you can turn a single location into a landscape that feels as diverse as any other film with dozens of locations (like Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" or Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel""). This is one of the better bottled storyline films that I've seen, and while the storyline itself isn't entirely unique (Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin starred in a movie called ""The Call"" which was essentially the exact same premise), the way that the storyline was handled in this particular film was done with far more class and finesse than I'd ever have expected from a thriller with such a schmaltzy premise, and the overall result is undeniably gripping and also surprisingly emotional.",The Guilty
20,AudioFileZ,One Man One Room Show That Transcends It's Humble Staging,7,14 February 2019,Here's a different drama. It's foreign with excellent english dubbing hardly feeling foreign at all. Revolving around a police officer temporarily assigned to emergency services for what appears to be some kind of review - pulling him from his regular patrol duties. The situation the officer finds himself in on the eve of what he hopes will be his restoration to his regular duties events spiral downward when he takes a call from a woman in a kidnapping situation. Slowly the tension builds and the officers behavior veers toward very unconventional methods in which the woman's life and his career will certainly be on the line. As events unfold there is palpable deadly tension and the unknown exact location of the woman adds tremendous frustation in saving her life.The film itself further distinguishes itself by solely focusing on the officer in the police call center. The limiting factor of a one-room story actually adds gravity as it further limits what can be done to resolve the situation. The situation takes twists and turns too as nothing is as it initially seems. The viewer is in the middle of a real cluster it becomes increasingly apparent. This different movie rings one out in a simple excellent way. It slowly throws a hook and sets it enthralling along the way. You simply must go for the ride and it's a come-apart mess with a excellent ending you must see.,The Guilty

To be fair, the premise and unfolding of ""The Guilty"" seemed implausible. Would the Danish 911 service actually let the dispatcher behave that way? I know in America such behavior wouldn't fly at all, but this is Denmark, so maybe they're a little looser with their laws there. The acting was top notch especially considering it was basically a one-man show. Could've been dull but it wasn't. This is one of those flicks that a film student could learn from, that is, how to create an intriguing movie with VERY limited actors and settings but still be interesting to watch.

Unfortunately the plot isn't flawless. There are a few times (and one really big instance) where the emergency dispatcher learns vital new information and doesn't immediately relay it to the police. It also seemed very odd how reluctant everyone was to help him do his job or for his supervisor to never even wonder what he was doing.The flaws (and already knowing the resolution) make it unlikely for me to watch The Guilty a second time, but it is a perfect example of how to keep an audience entertained without action or changing scenery.",The Guilty

38,Just-A-Girl-14,Good but could be much better,7,29 November 2019,"For a low budget movie, with basically one main character, it's a good movie but I think it could have been much much better if it wasn't so slow paced and if we had a few shots of the other characters. The script is good! I loved the idea of showing the audience the perspective of the 911 operator. It was great to realize at the end that things are not always as they seem and what you thought was obvious turned out to be something else completely. Showing the other characters/callers shouldn't ruin that, on the contrary, it will make the movie more interesting and thrilling.My main issue with the film is that it doesn't look like the 911 operators have enough resources to deal with an emergency case that requires multiple actions made at the same time. For example, it took the operator over four minutes to give the license plate to the officers on the field because he was talking to the little girl. Four minutes is along time and if you count the time since he actually talked to the victim, it over ten minutes! A lot can happen in ten minutes, especially when someone's life is on the line. Seems to me that the system isn't working right! Important information should move faster between the people working on the same case and the 911 operators should work together so one wouldn't have to hang up the phone on a scared 6 y/o girl. It's great that the film focuses on the main character but an emergency case like this shouldn't rest on the shoulders of one officer. From this point of view, The Call (2013) was much better made!I'm also not so sure that the background story of the officer works. We don't really know what happened when he shot the young man he talked about except that apparently he was in the wrong and he feels guilty for killing him and making his partner cover for him. I'm not sure if it added much to the film. A ""simple"" case of self defense guilt could have worked just the same. The only reason I'm mentioning it is because his whole behavior was weird at times. For example, you're not supposed to destroy your workplace when you are frustrated and an officer shouldn't asks for favors from other officers (or break the law) to rescue a victim. The system should be ready to all sorts of emergencies and so are the 911 operators working on them. It's obviously a very stressful job.I'd love to see an American version made. A bigger budget and more action would make it a 10/10 instead of a 7/10. Hollywood take notes!",The Guilty
39,markgorman,Utterly compelling and gripping thriller.,9,26 July 2019,"This had completely passed me by until my son and I took a chance on it on Netflix last night. We didn't choose with great conviction. (Subtitled, slow looking and only really one character - could it possibly hold our attention?)The movie consists of essentially one character on screen, a disgraced police officer, who is serving a 'punishment' as a telephone dispatcher/call operator in a Copenhagen police call centre. However many characters are brought in through multiple phone calls to drive the narrative at breathtaking speed and in real time.Virtually the entire movie takes place in two rooms in real time as he deals with a call from a woman who has been kidnapped by her husband. It becomes something of a whodunnit as the initial call, and the reasons behind her kidnapping, are expertly sleuthed by our hero, Jakob Cedergren, in a commanding performance that is expertly directed and written by Gustav Möller and filmed by Jasper Spanning. Bravo to both.Nordic Noir you could call it, but it is an electrifyingly claustrophobic and intense tunner of a story that you cannot possibly predict each twist and turn. It turns out it was Denmark's official foreign language Oscar entry and it's plain to see why.Magnificent and highly recommended.",The Guilty
40,euroGary,Plot-holed but enjoyable,6,16 October 2018,"Grumpy police officer Asger, awaiting a court hearing on what for most of 'The Guilty' remains an unspecified disciplinary matter, has been sidelined to the Danish equivalent of '999' ('911' in the United States): he spends his shifts taking calls from people who have been mugged by prostitutes, or are having bad drug-induced trips, or are getting into punch-ups with nightclub bouncers. But things get more dramatic when a woman, Iben, calls alleging she is in the process of being abducted.All of the action takes place in the call centre, and the camera is rarely off the angular features of lead actor Jakob Cedergren. It is thus his responsibility to carry the film, and he copes with aplomb: he makes Asger remote, unforgiving and not particularly likeable - in short, realistic.What are *not* realistic are the plot holes in the film. For instance, although it is easy to believe none of his colleagues like Asger, when he shuts himself in a separate room - even closing the connecting blinds so none of them can see him - it is hard to believe that not even the shift supervisor in what is, presumably, a disciplined organisation thinks to ask him what on Earth he's playing at. Similarly, why does the man who has abducted Iben - and who plainly does not like her talking on the telephone - not, y'know, *take her 'phone away from her?!* Another flaw is that I guessed the plot twist - not due to any cleverness on my part, but simply because the viewer is given far too much information pointing towards a particular solution very early in the film - it *had* to be a red herring. (Interestingly, the true solution is similar to the plot in one of Cedergren's earlier films, 2013's 'Sorrow and Joy'.)With most characters being merely voices on the end of Asger's telephone line, the actors have to convey their parts in what is for their characters a terrifying, emotional situation (Iben and her abductor) or routine (other police officers) using only their voices. Some are more successful than others. Big credit must go to Katinka Evers-Jahnsen as Iben's young (""six years and nine months"" daughter). At first I assumed an adult actress was simply putting on a child's voice, but I think Evers-Jahnsen is indeed a child actor, if not as young as the character she's playing here. Playing a confused and terrified young girl who has seen her mother violently abducted, she is bloody fantastic - not something that can often be said about child actors.Seen at the 2018 London Film Festival.",The Guilty

The whole movie takes place in a call center at the police, and is about telephone conversations between the character played by Cedergren and an emergency event. No scenes beyond that.

And what ensues is his personal crusade to do what's right and necessary in the situation.This story had so much potential to be emotionally riveting. To make you sob and yell and clench your fists reacting to the events on screen. There's nothing little about a movie where one person basically sits on the phone all time, and Tom Hardy's Locke is one prime example of that.But instead, all I could think about was ""Don't they have any special protocols to handle situations like that?"". American films have taught us to expect an almost inhuman coordination of special forces when it comes to emergencies like this, from escalating the event to a properly trained team in a blink of an eye to a real-time multi-layered cooperation between various units to lead the situation to the least dangerous outcome possible.The Guilty, however, tells a barely believable story of a cop put to desk work during a trial, who has to deal with a serious crime literally alone, wading through bureaucracy and indifference of people who may receive a call about a possibly life threatening situation but shake if off because their shift is over. And even the super-responsible protagonist acts like a superhero gone mad, smashing things into pieces in helpless rage.The film's story has several secondary levels that give the plot a rather unexpected twist towards the end. That's a great way to spice up the writing - and it might make the whole difference under other circumstances. But for The Guilty it only rubs more salt in the wound, showing that the suspense turned into sour disappointment cannot be turned back into something gripping just by adding more shocking details.Well, maybe that's sheer reality of the Danish life. Maybe their community services do work like this. In this case, all the quality of life ratings must be terribly rigged. Otherwise, the only real guilt of The Guilty is trying to be artistically dramatic, but failing to be realistic and believable.",The Guilty
50,deadbull-95171,Gigantically better then the American remake,10,21 September 2021,"I have seen this happen so often. And oddly I guess. With Danish films. In the 3 cases that immediately come to mind. All 3 were remade and savagely ruined by the American plagiarists. Why?I suppose the production and directorial assumption is that we (USA victims) don't have the intellectual depth to look at foreign films and so they just copy and spit out this intelligent work,
sign a few Hollywood names and get a ludicrous budget, a ravaged script, and roll the dice with a quarter billion USD on the line.Except it never works. If it doesn't make sense as a whisper, a million decibels won't help. I like Gyllenhaal well enough as an actor, but he simply cannot in any way compare to the job Jacob Cedergren
does in Den Skyldige. I like subtitled films and sometimes, even if the movie is in English, I leave them on. I know a friend who learned to speak English that way. Anyway I'm fluent in German and a little French so I more or less got it without help. But that isn't the point.The point is subtlety is often far more powerful then over the top histrionics and goosed up plots. The USA is founded on theft and murder and commercial brainwashing, all in the name of god or some fascistic hogwash and the movies, Hollywood, is our greatest ""cultural"" achievement, along with the hot dog. It's better movies realize all that, and incorporate that sim[;e intelligence into the substrate of whatever plot.But this film is a good example, having seen both, of exactly how stupid and greedy and manic and inflated and gross our ""culture"" and its products are in comparison with most of the rest of the our broken
world. It's sickening to live here. OK see how
and incorporate it. Spoorlos becomes The Vanishing, or how. Lat den Ratte Komma In becomes Let Me In or how.....forget it. This practice is even more repulsive then the serialization of our 'hit' movies, or movies suspected of becoming profitable in there original; forms. There are rare exceptions, but the Euro stuff, whether its film or literature or pornography is 99% of the time patently trumps its American
stolen version . We ruin things here in so many ways, this is just one example, but no need to worry, the pandemic we engineered, will sort things out when there are no audiences left.",The Guilty

He takes a call from a clearly distressed woman who tells him that she is abducted and she is on the car with her capturer. Asger tries to help her and the plot begins to thiken in this suspensful, Hitchcockian thriller. The movie is shot exclusively to the police call center and Asger is the only protagonist, so it relies on its great script and wonderful dialogue.

59,IamROCKAS,Simplicity at it's best,9,17 May 2021,"If someone told me that I'd be enjoying a movie that only takes place in pretty much one room with most of the action happening behind the scene, I'd be skeptical. This movie got me engaged in the plot unlike anything else I've ever experienced. The way it happens to create tension is so simple in theory but the execution of these simple things is unreal, making it one of a kind experience.One thing that staying in one room did is it made it easier to focus on a single point - I had to listen to every line (well, read the subtitles, as I don't speak Danish) to follow the expressions on Asger's face just to keep up with the plot and that meant I didn't miss anything else that the director planned to display. This movie is built in a way that you capture exactly 100% without missing anything vital in the process. The only mystery that remains is how Asger's trial will go. The B-plotline with Asger's personal issue is something that has been brought up early on with only hints of it being brought up in the movie until the culmination.Speaking of the plot, it's remarkably good, even without showing too much. There are barely any time skips, meaning the plot takes up as much time as the movie. A lot of it is left to the imagination and the twists and turns it takes are remarkably well constructed. I don't want to go too far into them as it's kind of hard talking about them without spoiling anything to those who haven't seen the movie yet. And I don't want to give any spoilers because my thoughts about the movie would be completely different if I knew some of the details from the beginning.I'm somewhat fascinated when kids are included in movies that have a bit of a darker nature to them. I don't know but a lot of movies I've watched these past few months featured the same theme of a child or teen/pre-teen actors playing mature roles. Well, Mathilde is a bit different as she's just six years old and we only hear her voice, but, just audibly witnessing that she was a victim of a traumatic experience of such magnitude makes me include her in the same list with the others. And as this was done by a European director, Gustav Möller, it made me think about another European director, Michael Haneke. Both of the movies that I've watched by Haneke, Funny Games (1997) and Caché (2005) also featured child actors. This is just a connection I made when watching this movie. It didn't take in any more or less enjoyable, I just found it to be a cool fact about my watching experience as of late.The Guilty (2018) definitely impressed me. It provides a unique watching experience and, prior to watching this feel, I couldn't imagine that I would ever like something like this. The dialogues, the emotions, the path that this movie takes... it's just all so impressive to me. Art is subjective but I really find this movie to be of the likes of art that I enjoy. Perhaps that it's just so different from the rest that I find it so appealing. It is the first movie of such display that I have watched. Perhaps just being new and ""shiny"" for my eyes and ears is what got me to enjoy it so much. Maybe I just needed something to take me out of my comfort zone and this movie came at the perfect time like a perfect storm. Whichever it was, I enjoyed it and I'd definitely recommend it to someone when given the chance.",The Guilty

Phone Booth is centred on one man on the telephone throughout, this movie is centred one man on the telephone throughout. Cellular is centred on one man trying to help a person on the phone who is in danger, and again this movie focuses on that.There are no boring parts, the storyline is well scripted and keeps you engaged.

The 'b' plot with the protagonist upcoming court date that makes very little sense. And a huge gaping issue with a kidnapper who seemingly never realizes his victim is on the phone for an hour and half.There are also big post prod issues.- the grading on walls suddenly shifts in hue for no reason, the ISO on some shots is so high the mpeg artifacting overcomes the image, the colors are off half the time, the depth of field is so razor thin characters come in and out of focus if they shift by one inch on their chairs, etc etc. The usual 'indy movie' errors basically, but considering this was not a fly by night production it's not really forgiveable.6/10, fans of '12 angry man' will like this one, others not so much.",The Guilty

Through its 90 minutes the movie takes place in the exact same set following the main character in this unexpected night, yet it keeps us engaged and glued to the screen.It's amazing how much psychological horror they can convey with simple phone calls, the movie is not graphic at all yet they are able to terrify by teasing our imagination.Very solid performances and a definite must seeI didn't see the remake but given the possibility of its popularity on the raise on Netflix, I would strongly recommend to watch this original, speaking from experience, American remakes of other movies don't usually work (not matter how good Jake Gyllenhaal is)",The Guilty

You're going to have to enjoy the telling of an interesting, tense story.Our main actor is very good in his role as an emergency operator who cares too much about those in need (at times, lol) and goes beyond the scope of duty - both for good and where he needs to know he must respect the boundaries for good reason. He is also very depressed about a number of things in his life that aren't going well and sometimes it shows - but the stress (and sometimes disdain) seems to show its wear on others.For much of this film, it's excellent although at times it suffers from escapes from what reality should seem to be. Without ruining the film, I can say that I doubt that emergency operators always need to handle calls alone and put people on hold because no one else can help assist with a case concurrently.There are parts to this story - it's twists - which are uneven and I am not totally convinced were good choices and creates some plot holes.

Experimental, as an experiment to test audience attention span with only one actor on screen talking on the phone most of the time in response to emergency calls.

102,mbruce007,Suspense thriller with Orwellian undertones...,9,3 December 2020,"The Guilty (2018) is a Gustav Möller film about a police officer called Asger (Jakob Cedergren) who is coping with routine problems at an emergency services call centre when he is jolted into action by an inordinately disturbing call by a woman calling herself Iben (voiced by Jessica Dinnage). Pretending to be calling her child, left alone at home, Iben alerts Asger to the fact that she has been kidnapped by her estranged husband, Michael (Johan Olsen) and is on the road in his van. Balancing the task of talking to the Copenhagen police while keeping Iben on the line and counselling her, is Asger, against his better judgement, investing too much emotionally in this incident?The Guilty is a tightly-woven piece of suspense in which the action uniquely takes place in the minimalist surroundings of the call centre, forcing the cinema audience to rely heavily on its aural abilities to decode the mystery, much like the protagonist himself. This film put me in mind of Peter Strickland's equally taut British thriller, Berberian Sound Studio (2012), about a sound engineer from the Home Counties (the ever-reliable Toby Jones as Gilderoy) who comes to the offices of a schlock-producing Italian film company in the 1970s. Much like The Guilty, this film is also set entirely in one environment in which the psychological tension is amplified by the fact that it is impossible to tell day from night, coupled with the ungodly horror sound effects, and the repugnant objects used to make them.If we go even further back, I'm reminded of Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 spy drama, The Conversation, starring Gene Hackman as an emotionally frigid man, Harry Caul, who is paid to eavesdrop on people's private exchanges and pays the moral price for it. The film reaches a great crescendo in which the hunter becomes the hunted and Caul turns his own apartment upside down as he tries to find a concealed bug, his suppressed emotions running to the fore. It is interesting how, despite the intervening years, all these films are incredibly current. With frighteningly fast advances in technology, we are now all acutely aware of the Orwellian notion that someone is watching and, indeed, listening...",The Guilty
103,Lalpera,No guilt watching this movie at all!!,8,13 May 2019,"The Guilty could have been an exceptional movie if it was not for few faulty pieces in the plot. Hence my 8 out of 10 or else it would've been 10/10.Let's take a look at the positive side first.This movie which runs nearly for one and half hours is entirely shot just inside two rooms. And 90% of the entire movie time is centered on the main character Asger, the Police emergency call center operator distinctly portrayed by Jakob Cedergren. Just combine these two scenarios and imagine how boring it could be to sit and watch an 85 minute movie? Pretty horrendous, right? But it is not! Instead, you will be glued on to the screen, oblivious of where you are or who sits next to you. The movie tells a flawless story, takes you to crime scenes, offenders, culprits, victims and all, but you see all those things on Asger's eyes, mouth, chins or in his body movements and in his words only. You are actually deeply engrossed in a crime scenario, created by your own imaginations! Such is the power of cinematic techniques used by this outstanding director, Gustav Moller. The power of dialogues and the quality of sound recording enrich the fabric of the plot and complement the acting skills of Jakob to do a great job. The other surprisingly noteworthy characteristic is that the movie does not have any kind of background music. It's just the sound of eternal phones ringing, dial tones, connecting noises, human voices and noise of gestures and expressions that play the role of music. Yet so amazingly, you don't feel the void of music until you get back home and rewind your memories!Now the negatives! The plausibility of the plot is damaged at few places. As a low pay grade call center operator, how Asger takes law on to his hands and use one of his drunkard colleague to do unlawful home intrusions without being objected by his colleagues is a huge dent on the validity of the story line. Except for Dispatch Officer who tells off Asger to stop crossing the line, anybody else seems to care less about what he does inside a room with all curtains down! The other unbelievable thing is how Iben keeps talking to Asger within a very disturbing kidnap scenario or even why Michael wants to keep a conversation going on with a Police officer. And Asger's confession in the end that he killed a person seems quite odd because Police dont hire people with criminal allegations.However, The Guilty is an exceptional movie enriched with advanced technical skills blended with clever movie making talents. Gustav Moller takes us on this really extraordinary yet worthwhile journey filled with suspense without an iota of boredom.",The Guilty

113,BlueFox94,The Pressures of a Confined Protector in Den Skyldige (The Guilty),7,27 October 2018,"(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""No one is going to kill your mom, okay?"" ""Do you promise?"" ""I promise."" - Asger Holm (Jakob Cedergren) and Mathilde Østergård (voiced by Katinka Evers-Jahnsen)""Was it snakes?"" ""Yes...Yes, it was snakes."" - Iben Østergård (voiced by Jessica Dinnage) and Asger Holm (Jakob Cedergren)Potential spoilers belowFor any budding filmmaker, making a feature debut is a daunting task. Since Orson Welles had already set the insurmountable gold standard for feature debuts with a little flick called Citizen Kane, it is best to start as simple and minimalist as possible and build up a career from there. Danish director Gustav Möller seems to have taken this route with The Guilty (Dansk: Den Skyldige), a thriller he co-wrote with Emil Nygaard Albertsen. Reminiscent of recent films like Locke and The Call, The Guilty and star Jakob Cedergren succeed in taking audiences to the bare extreme of cinematic tension.Until their shifts end for the day, emergency dispatchers face an endless duel with time and Danish officer Asger Holm (Jakob Cedergren) is no exception. Holm normally works in the field with fellow officer Rashid (voiced by Omar Shargawi). For reasons soon revealed, however, Holm is temporarily stuck working as an emergency dispatcher while his boss Bo (voiced by Jacob Lohmann) substitutes for him in the field.One call comes from a woman named Iben Østerård (voiced by Jessica Dinnage), who does not sound like she is in immediate danger. Holm realizes as the conversation progresses that Iben has been kidnapped. Further calls to Iben's home, where her daughter Mathilde (voiced by Katinka Evers-Jahnsen) and her infant son Oliver are alone, reveal that Iben's captor is her ex-husband Michael (voiced by Johan Olsen). When Michael cuts off their phone conversation, Holm must dive into the police database and dial more numbers in search of Iben before she and her captor disappear for good.Isolating Asger Holm's journey to just two drab emergency dispatch offices challenges writer-director Gustav Möller to deliver without one word wasted. Möller and co-writer Emil Nygaard Albertsen first draw audiences in with the volatile pace of the dispatchers. Everything spoken or unspoken can mean life or death for the people on the other sides, so the dispatchers must practice steady nerves. Though he too had to master this, star Jakob Cedergren also had to have those nerves chipped away over 85 minutes and it greatly fascinates to watch his breakdown. Möller and Albertsen also leave room for comic relief: Early on, Holm amuses himself when a caller located near a red light district hesitates to admit that he got robbed by a prostitute he hired. Later on, Holm tries to call back Iben in a panic and he keeps answering and declining multiple calls from an injured bicyclist.Production designer Gustav Pontoppidan makes the dispatch station feel confining, Jasper J. Spanning's cinematography probes into Asger Holm's business with stark lighting and a few well-focused long takes, and Carla Luffe provides the sharp cuts characteristic of a taut thriller. Yet perhaps the one technical craft worthy of top billing next to Jakob Cedergren is Oskar Skriver's sound work. Skriver and his crew masterfully adjust the voices on the opposite end of Asger Holm's calls to sound as clear and present as Holm hears them.While Iben's kidnapping predicament unravels to horrific degrees, Möller also draws audiences to the pressing matter on Holm's mind. Themes of mental health and police brutality creep into a thriller that does more than follow an emergency dispatcher's shift. With these, Möller and Albertsen are less successful, choosing ambiguity over detailed clarity, especially for the latter theme. Increasing the context of the heavy issue on Holm's mind would have helped The Guilty avoid losing momentum, and thus making the 85-minute runtime feel a tad longer than it should, right before locking onto its home stretch.With his feature debut The Guilty, writer-director Gustav Möller reminds us all of a peculiar tendency found in our broken human nature: Those in trouble try their best to cover their embarrassment and guilt by overdoing good. When their excessive good acts go haywire, they end up worsening their situation. Möller's thriller, though it could have benefited from greater detail regarding its protagonist's worries as they are slowly revealed, does not fail to highlight that such human behavior even affects the most hardened among us. The Guilty deserves its status as Denmark's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the upcoming 91st Oscars and it will not surprise me one bit if it becomes one of the final five nominees.(Parental Note: The Guilty has been rated R by the MPAA. It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""strong language"".)R.N.B.",The Guilty

He is in the waiting room of his police career and that is all we need to know.The acting is so powerful, so extremely convincing, I had to take a deep breath several times to remind myself I still could, but forgot to. It is a story so grippingly told, you will sit on the edge of your seat, literally, forgetting to breath, literally, with eyes, ears and your brain racing for priority access to your tears and that pain in your chest to activate, literally, and you will understand, what this man is going through, literally, and viscerally.

A cop who's temporarily relegated to emergency calls in the call centre takes a call from a woman who is being abducted. All he has is the dispatch team, a colleague and a phone to help him find the woman. It's a simple plot by excellently executed. Along the way we find out why he's in the call centre and not on the street and how his partner helps him catch the guilty.
This film can be so easily ignored but do so at your peril. It's a superb film and worthy of its awards. The pace of the film is impeccable and how it's script portrayed is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it. I also love it's simplicity in regard to setting - two rooms, cast -5 actors, and it's idea, it's essence. I became immersed in the story and was hooked. What's more, is the empathy you feel, not just for the cop, but also for Michael and Iben. You feel what they feel and hear what they're not saying. Very few films can do this but it is achieved with staggering accuracy in this drama. It is edge of the seat stuff. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. This is a must for cinema aficionados.

It's mostly word-for-word the same as the Danish version. And it's free if you have Netflix!The Danish version is £2.99 on Amazon. It's less stylish and less melodramatic, but much more believable and affecting. I cared more for all the characters, and despite knowing exactly how it was going to play out, I was hooked throughout. At times I couldn't look away.The Netflix film adds an unneccesary personal arc, some wildfire-related melodrama, and a set more like a James Bond MI5 office than a 911 (or 112) call centre - all of which reduced the impact and made the film less engaging.If you're definitely not going to watch the Danish version, the Netflix one is a good bet.

It would be for me as well but thankfully I did not know anything about this movie prior to watching it. However, saying that, the location serves and fits the narrative and direction of movie very well and this should not hold you back from watching the movie at all.Pros:
Story: Well executed, nice surprises.
Characters: We only get to see one of the four main characters in the movie, but the all the actors do an excellent job. The child actress who provided the voice over for a character stood out the most to me and she did a wonderful job.Cons:
It is definitely slow going, and takes its time to get to the ""meat"" of the story.
I personally think that the duration of the movie could have been a little shorter.
It can be a little difficult to maintain the proper attention the movie deserves during the first 30 minutes or so because of its pacing but if you stick with it, it will not disappoint.Overall:
A surprisingly great movie that is certainly unique in its approach in telling its story and thankfully it gets it right. RECOMMENDED!",The Guilty

What makes it even more brilliant is that the story actually takes place in the viewer's mind. You find yourself multi-tasking as you watch Asger on screen at the same as building up a crystal clear picture in your mind of what is being described. It's so clever.

137,ioannesp,Dark og klaustrofobisk,4,26 November 2018,"Dark and claustrophobic
It's a thriller and nothing more, a dramatized film, an attempt of scriptwriter and director to grasp a confession from the leading actor for a crime that attributed on police violence. Leading actor appears to be taking the law into his own hands on will, he doesn't hesitate to act against the law and to urge others to do the same, either with pure or fraudulent intentions in order to achieve his purpose which happens do good as evil. From time to time he is an angel, he is a procecutor, or a judge, he tries to do what he believes is right. Director entraps him in the dark world of nemesis and clinch him with passion to grasp his apology. This case could stand in no court. Scriptwriter or Director are obliged to substantiate that this is a real incident! If not is just another social experiment crafted and as such it is considered failed. Social experiments don't prove truth or give direction, are just hypothetical thoughts!
It is obvious that the scriptwriter and mainly the director are unaware of the controversy of tragedy with comedy. They should study the work of Graham Green and Oliver Reed and then perhaps they might create a few lines of laugh-friendly atmosphere somewhere deep in their dark world...

It starts normally with a typical storyline. As you watch it through, you feel that you know this story, someone trying to help someone under duress but, then the story, brilliant acting, cinematography, direction reels you in and you get glued to the monitor and then you realise, this is not what you expected.Watch it with a headphone to feel closer to the characters. A brilliant groundbreaking take on a thriller with just one headphone in an Emergency Service centre.Watch it. You will not regret. And I am going to follow the director and actor, both! :)",The Guilty

166,movieMaoam,The Guilty is an ... interesting experience,7,2 June 2019,"After a friends recommendation I got myself this small scope indie movie at Prime and watched it with no particular expectations.
The scenario of a police officer, working at an emergency call station, is swiftly introduced as two unrelated persons call and confront the protagonist with different situations to brief the viewer on the tools and characters we are dealing with. Soon he recieves a call from a kidnapped woman and is suprisingly overambitious to help her.With the events and investigation processing, we get insights on Asger, the police officer, and begin to understand his motives to help an unknown woman at all costs. There are always enough bits to keep to story fresh anf ongoing, while Jakob Cedergren manages it to run the movie singlehandly by great performance and interesting character depiction.Considering the movies daring 1h25min runtime, you expect something fast paced and sweet n' short, don't you? But it's kind of the complete opposite. We slowly get pieces of Asger's past and future, his emotional urge to solve this situation and are often left with enduring silence, to stay close to our main character. But after 30 minutes you start questioning the whole concept of this movie. All you do is watching an officer making calls, taking conclusions and being under stress here and there. There is nothing much this movie purposes as a movie, as the cinematography becomes repetitive and visually nothing happens, except our protagonist making phone calls. So I started to close my eyes during the calls, which make about 70% of the runtime, and just listen to them. The sound design and voice acting is so superb and immersive, that they're elevating The Guilty to another level. In combination with a clever connection between the events and interesting subtext this movie turns out to be pretty exciting to watch and listen. Maybe try out this method of watching The Guilty by yourself and experience a diffrent kind of movie.",The Guilty

186,Bertje-Bertje,"Gripping, great twists, essential questions",9,22 November 2020,"I had recorded this from TV, but was hesitating to watch. In the description it seemed too one dimensional, both in format and story.Both impressions were wrong. And that's because it's a very clever movie.Asger gets to handle a couple of calls about different cases too. The way he handles them gives his character more depth, makes him more human. Not just a police robot, but with personal judgment, even ridicule.Also clever is the background story that is slowly filled in. About why he is there, and what is about 'tomorrow'. It gives the movie an extra dimension, while it also adds to what turns out to be the central theme of the title. Who's guilty, and why, or why not?Even more important is the 'game' of interpretation. Our flawed way of handling scarce information. Falling back to earlier patterns, assumptions.What has happened? By who?
'Of course it is THAT again...'What is happening right now? On the other side of the phone.
And when the connection is lost. Has she..?Then there is that brilliant twist, that leads to a NEW case of guilt. 'Did my interpretation lead someone to do something horrible to an innocent?!'That twist also suddenly makes sense of previous events, that at first seemed flaws in the plot. 'How strange that...' And throws us back at our assumptions. 'Aha, I didn't think of that. I just assumed... I should have questioned that. I already acted.'The back story also involves Asger's buddy. How loyalty, and maybe understanding, entangles someone else in unlawfulness. And throws him into doubt and sorrow.Then there's the evolvement in which Asger's empathy throws him back into real trouble for 'tomorrow'. And his buddy too.The end scene is one in which he seems to freeze. One can imagine him realizing all the things that suddenly have gone wrong. By slips of his tongue. Asking himself what on earth he can do now. Or should he do now. He's making another call. We can only guess that's to his buddy, and what he's going to say.People remarked this was not realistic for a dispatch centre. I couldn't know, but just was thinking it would be odd if someone tried to solve a case, instead of 'dispatching' it to someone.But that does not matter to me. I could IMAGINE the situation.It is disappointing to see Americans simply state they 'can't' watch or understand a subtitled movie. What implies a movie 'has' to be thrashed and done all over again into a stupid remake.Come on!You CAN read (I hope), you CAN watch and listen yo the acting. And if you open yourself, you can probably make out some of the language.Oh, and maybe start some foreign language course? A WORLD would open to you.",The Guilty

There is really no point of filming a guy, sitting in a dark roomPolice officer Asger, who works at the emergency police call center of the police gets phone call from a woman who is hold hostage by her husband. She pretends to call her daughter, and so the cat and mouse games begins.Unfortunately the movie lacks any logical foundation. The cop retreats to a dark room in the office alone and tries to solve the crime as a lone wolf, building up a dark tension. Meanwhile his colleagues one room afar have no clue what he is doing.The main actor (police officer) has no charisma and his actions make no sense.

The theme of the overwhelming calls to a character obviously unfocused, is not bad, but (in my humble opinion) is a bit tiresome.
The main character (and practically, the only one) gives game, but it does not finish convincing; It has virtues, but in the end, it has a point of bad person, with incorrect attitudes, from the legal and ethical point of view.

206,jacob-253,Had to stop watching,2,1 November 2018,Had to turn off the movie after 30 minutes.Having worked in Copenhagen Police for 7 years patrolling and with almost daily visits to dispatch I got so annoyed that apparently no research was done on how emergency service and dispatch works. If a case like that happens there would always be several people involved from the get go. The emergency caller can always stay on the phone and he's writing updates on a computer that dispatch can see (they are also in the same room). There's always a good and helpful vibe between colleagues as it's in everyone's best interest to solve the task given. The way the colleagues communicate in the movie is simply so far from reality.I'm obviously fully aware that this is fiction and drama.

Even though the entire film is set in two rooms with the plot circulating around a single person, one is enthralled by the thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere which the director has created. The main role is exquisitely played by the Danish-Swedish actor Jakob Cedergren and the plot is masterfully constructed. At first, I was a little bit unsure what to think about the movie because it starts in a very slow and unclear sense but step by step, with unexpected turns, the film develops itself in a way that completely blew me away. I am astonished that it is possible to create a film which can be so frightening, suspenseful, brutal and thoughtful with virtually no other plot containment than only a few actors, a limited environment and a phone.

220,souravjoy,Powerful,9,19 July 2020,"Despite being a single location drama, and focusing on a single individual sitting in a Danish emergency call centre and speaking into his headset, The Guilty emerges as one of the most twisty, heart pounding crime thrillers that I have ever seen. It is gripping and motivating at the same time.
The story revolves around a guy named Asger Holm, who is definitely not a good cop. It is made abundantly clear in the opening moments of the film, after all why else would he have to appear before a judge in a misconduct hearing the very next day. But he was very good at police work, decerning within seconds the dirty little secrets behind every single caller. All of this is overturned in a call from a woman named Iben, who he thinks has been kidnapped, though only from his early assessment. The who, what, where, and why of her abduction is what drives Holm and the story, with one added wrinkle: He can't leave the station. Everything he does is by phone, whether it's trying to get what little information he can from Iben, or dispatching other agencies, or calling in favors from his partner, Rashid, who is also his prime defense witness in his upcoming misconduct hearing. Despite or perhaps because of these constraints, it's one of the most cinematically alive movies I have had the chance of viewing.
In his debut as a director, Gustav Möller strikes a perfect balance between the quiet intimacy of the phone calls and the claustrophobia of Holm's increasing desperation. Without ever feeling stagy or boring, The Guilty is a reminder that in order to make an absolute nail-biting thriller all you need is four walls and a great performance. A must see for everyone who has the maturity of following a gripping crime story.",The Guilty

230,sathyaoct-80769,Another Danish masterpiece,7,2 April 2020,"A well-crafted script and an up-close and personal journey into the disturbing world of Asger, a Police Officer at an emergency call centre. As this well-subtitled movie unfolds, with the camera never leaving him during its 1hr 25min running time, we realise he has been stood down from his formal role on the beat and that a backstory may lurk in the motives of his responses to a desperate woman's kidnapping call. But, all is not as it first seems - either to him or to us, as we too become emotionally involved as each desperate call is made, and he mistakenly takes it upon himself to go beyond his official remit. This is a movie that certainly proves how Emergency Service personnel must remain dispassionate, yet cope with the tricks of morality and acts of human instinct that they have been faced with at the end of a harrowing shift. Particularly if it leaves them feeling as drained as I did at the end of this brilliantly directed and solo-acted emotional cesspool of a movie. Don't miss it!",The Guilty

235,duskojovanovic,Intense but...,6,19 January 2019,"Even tho I do appreciate the main actor's performance and the drama around the plot with him being sidelined from the field to phone operator, this movie has way to many plot faults. You don't need to be a police officer (I am, btw), to know that the after the first call there is a chain of command to follow, especially in a kidnapping scenario, where time is of the essence. Here, there's is no detectives involved, nobody even thinks of going to Iben's and Michael's homes other than Asgar, and it looks like he's doing some illegal activities so everyone are suspicious and don't trust him. Instead, he's sending a drunk off duty police officer to dig through mail. Too many thing that bother my common sense.",The Guilty

Wonderfully tense little film with a brilliant central performance ably assisted by a great supporting cast. It's basically 85 mins of an emergency services officer on a phone but I don't think it could have been more gripping. I won't give any other details as it is best to let the story unfold. One of the most enjoyable films I've seen for some time.,The Guilty
253,luki-naef,Hanging at the edge of my seat.,9,8 October 2018,"Had the chance to see the movie weeks prior to its official release on ocotbre 18th here in Switzerland at the Zurich Film Festival.I'm usually not a fan of crime/thriller movies but this one has earned a special place in my heart. The simple premise (police officer with troubling past, has to work at the emergency hotline, just when his shift ends a woman who is being abducted reaches his line, the chase begins) took me in immediately and didn't let up until the end credits showed. The movie has two main plots: The abducted woman and Asger Holm's (main character, police officer) past. In the beginning we do not know much about either plot, but as the movie goes on more and more secrecy is peeled off. Both stories have their climax at the very same moment and make that moment in the movie all the more dramatic.So much about the plot, on to the cinematography and other technicalities:The whole movie takes place in the emergency phone central of Kopenhagen Denmark and is filmed in two rooms, the main office and a smaller one desk room. Lots of closeups of the main character let us really get into his head. The story of the movie is told only through phonecalls that he makes to a number of people all involved in the abduction. The movie was shot in only 13 days, which makes the cinematography even more impressive; all the shots have a purpose and hit their beats excellently. Feelings and character development is mostly conveyed through facial expression and dialogue. The sound design is on par with the acting, exciting at highpoints and subtle in quiet moments but always present.The plot stays quite unpredictable for a long time and even if you have a hunch, some details about it may still come as a surprise.Very good first time experience, however I am unsure about the rewatchability. On the other hand I still like to rewatch Fightclub, Memento and Shutter Island as well.",The Guilty
