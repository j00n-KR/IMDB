0,TheLittleSongbird,"As much as I love comedy, this film didn't engage me",4,13 July 2011,"I do love comedy, some of my favourite films/shows are comedy based. But I have seen There's Something About Mary three times now, and I didn't like/wasn't engaged by it either time.I do like how it looks, the film does look striking, I like the soundtrack, there was one joke that I was amused at(the one in the bathroom) and the performances of Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are good.However, apart from one joke, I just didn't find There's Something About Mary funny. The Farrelly Brothers I know are notorious for their lack of subtlety, but I was expecting something funnier considering the reputation it has. The script is full of dialogue that is rather juvenile and tasteless and the gags are puerile and fall flat more than they score. I know people will say this is what makes the film funny, I respect that, it's just not my kind of humour, that's all. The premise is simple, I have no problem with that. When the story is this thin and this predictable, I am not so kind. The film feels unevenly paced too, then again it probably has a lot to do with the lack of laughs from my experience, and the characters I don't care about.Overall, I wanted to like it, but it didn't work for me. Maybe I'll see it again some day and pray that my reaction will be different then. 4/10 Bethany Cox",There's Something About Mary
1,SnoopyStyle,One of Farrellys' best,8,24 November 2013,"From the Farrelly brothers, this is their highly inappropriate entry. After Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin, they're going further into outrageousness. Has there ever been another zipper incident filmed like that? That was some visual of those twig and berries. Who could forget the hair gel? Ted (Ben Stiller) is a nice guy who come to the defence of Mary (Cameron Diaz)'s mentally handicap brother. She agrees to go to the prom, but something terrible happens and they don't see each other for 13 years. He still pines for her, and hires sleazy PI Healy (Matt Dillon) to find her. Only Healy falls for her too, and he uses all his underhanded skills to get her.If there was one problem, it was that Ben Stiller couldn't get involved with Cameron Diaz sooner. For a long while, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon were doing their dance all by themselves. A more tougher write could have integrated everybody. That is a minor problem which is soon forgotten with the craziness. I remember as we got up to leave the theater, I hear a little girl bugging her big sister about what was behind his ear, and the big sis who couldn't shut her up. That's when I knew that it was mission accomplished.",There's Something About Mary
2,kosmasp,Simply the best,8,21 July 2009,"The Farrely Brothers are still struggling to make another hit movie, that comes close to this effort. But they haven't succeeded (yet). And while everything seems to fit here, you can't but wonder, if it only was a fluke? Are the Farrely Brothers any good or were they just lucky with one movie? Well let's leave this question open and grab a hold of this movie. Ben Stiller is top notch casted as the male leading role. His ability in physical and oral comedy, can't be matched by many. Cameron Diaz and Co. willing to go extra miles (especially the ""hair"" scene is pretty memorable) for any joke. It get's as politically incorrect as it can be, without losing it's touch with the viewers. A great movie indeed, a shame the directors couldn't follow up to that success though ...",There's Something About Mary
3,classicsoncall,"""Oh man, this is like group therapy or something.""",6,30 May 2018,"When I initially saw this film twenty years ago, it was my first look at Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, probably Matt Dillon too. Frozen in time, I don't think Diaz ever looked better. The story then proceeded to throw in some scandalous moments, like the zipper incident and the 'hair gel' scene. I recall getting embarrassed in the theater, not so much for myself but for the actors involved. This is one of your lowest common denominator pictures that will appeal to prepubescent young males and perhaps a slightly deranged adult or two. Adding even more to Stiller's embarrassment was that lame wrestling bit with Puffy; not even a pretense that the thing was a stuffed animal. There's only one legitimate recommendation coming out of the movie, and that was Mary's (Diaz) advice to watch ""Harold and Maude"". Check that one out for some real laughs.",There's Something About Mary
4,gavin6942,"I Dislike Raunchiness and Diaz, But Still Like This Film",7,22 January 2011,"""There's Something About Mary"" is definitely one of the funniest films of the last twenty years. I am not a fan of Cameron Diaz, and I do not care for the trend of raunchiness in films (such as the ""American Pie"" movies) but this one has enough wit and charm that I can look past that.Also, the cast is pretty incredible to have all in one movie: besides Cameron Diaz, you have Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Jeffrey Tambor, Keith David, Sarah Silverman, Jonathan Richman, Richard Jenkins, and Harland Williams. Holy cow! There is no substitute for watching a film unedited, but if it is playing on FX, you may want to catch it there. The editing is hilarious: they keep the drug scene and the semen, but edit the heck out of the cursing, including dubbing in the phrase ""frogging ashbowl"".",There's Something About Mary
5,lee_eisenberg,"Released in the same year as the Lewinsky thing, how could anyone not think about ""hair gel""?",10,17 October 2005,"You may not be prepared for some of the scenes in ""There's Something About Mary"" (not the least of which is the zipper scene), but you're sure to like them nonetheless. The plot of course has loser Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) trying to find high school sweetheart Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz). However, EVERYONE wants to find Mary, and a number of whacked-out incidents ensue. Most famous is the ""hair gel"" scene, but that's just one of many. With great support from Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Lee Evans, and others, this is one gross-out fest that you can't afford to miss. Those Farrelly brothers are truly something else.",There's Something About Mary
6,jboothmillard,There's Something About Mary,7,22 September 2005,"The first time I saw this film, I didn't think much of it, then I watched it again and thought it was much funnier, and I'm glad I watched it again to recall than just the obvious scenes, from directing brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, Shallow Hal). Basically, it opens in 1985, where awkward 16-year-old high school student Theodore ""Ted"" Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) is asked to the senior prom by the beautiful Mary Jensen (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz), the girl of his dreams. Unfortunately, Ted gets his scrotum stuck in his zipper and is hospitalised when it bleeds, cancelling their date. Ted subsequently loses contact with Mary. Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love with Mary. His best friend Dom Woganowski (Scary Movie 2's Chris Elliott) suggests he should hire private detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. Healy finds Mary living in Miami, she works as an orthopaedic surgeon, continues to look after her mentally disabled brother Warren (Scream's W. Earl Brown), spends time with many friends and neighbour Magda (Lin Shaye), and is single. Watching her for a few days, Healy is attracted to Mary himself. He returns to Providence and lies to Ted about Mary, telling him that she is overweight and has four kids by three different men. Healy quits his job and returns to Miami to pursue her. He resorts to lying, cheating, and stalking to win Mary over. They spend several weeks dating before Mary's friend Tucker (Lee Evans), a British architect who uses crutches due to a serious spinal injury, exposes him as a fraud. Healy is enraged after listening to Tucker lying to Mary, claiming he is a serial murderer. After following Tucker, Healy finds out he is a fraud himself: he is an able-bodied American pizza delivery boy named Norm Phipps, who is also attracted to Mary. Years earlier, Norm intentionally injured himself to get closer to Mary, hoping to become patient. His injury healed long ago, but he pretends to be disabled to gain Mary's sympathy, and he uses his friendship with her as a ploy to drive away any potential romantic rivals. Meanwhile, Ted finds out from one of his old classmates that Healy was lying about Mary. He decides to drive down to Florida to see her. During the drive, Ted picks up a hitchhiker (Dumb and Dumber's Harland Williams). Due to a misunderstanding, Ted is arrested for a suspected lewd act in a public place, unintentionally getting caught with a group of gay men. He is interviewed by detectives who wrongly accuse him as being a killer, finding a dead body in his car. Eventually, Ted is bailed out by Dom and cleared after the hitchhiker, real killer is arrested and confesses. Mary is amazed when Ted approaches her, and suggests they reconnect on a date. On the night of their date, Ted masturbates before Mary arrives, and inadvertently ejaculates on his ear. Mary mistakes the semen for hair gel and takes it to put into her hair, this ""gel"" sticks her hair up into a huge quiff. Ted and Mary spend a good amount of time together and he is happy that he seems to have won her over, but Healy and Norm watch them together and are jealous. The relationship disintegrates when Mary receives an anonymous letter exposing his connection with Pat, so she breaks up with him. Ted confronts Pat and Norm, but they confirm that neither of them sent the anonymous. Meanwhile, Dom goes to visit Mary, he is revealed to be her ex-boyfriend ""Woogie"", whom she has a restraining order against, and was the one who sent the letter. He wants to reconnect with her as well, which she refuses, so he tries to steal her shoes to satisfy his foot fetish. Ted, Norm, and Pat arrive, and Mary is finally together with all her deceitful suitors. Ted realises that the only one who did not resort to lying or manipulation to win over Mary was her ex-boyfriend Brett, who is National Football League quarterback Brett Favre (himself). Norm confesses that he lied to Mary about Brett insulting her brother Warren, which was why she ended their relationship. After reuniting Brett and Mary, Ted leaves tearfully. But Mary runs out to catch up to Ted, saying ""I'd be happiest with you"". Mary and Ted kiss while singer/songwriter Jonathan Richman (himself), periodically narrating the story in song throughout, is accidentally shot by Magda's boyfriend, who was trying to shoot Ted as he was also infatuated with Mary. Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Sully, Markie Post as Sheila Jensen, Keith David as Charlie Jensen, Sarah Silverman as Brenda, Khandi Alexander as Joanie, Willie Garson as Dr. Zit Face, Richard Tyson as Detective Krevoy, Dumb and Dumber's Rob Moran as Detective Stabler, and Richard Jenkins as the Psychiatrist. Stiller is as the hapless still obsessed guy does well, Diaz is beautiful and likeable, Dillon is amusing as the sleazy private eye, and Evans with his recognisable physical humour and accents is good fun. The film is probably most memorable for the over-the-top gross-out visual gags, with genitals caught in trousers, the dog electrocuted, wrestled, thrown out a window and in a full body cast, to gags about physical and mental disability, and the iconic spunk in hair joke. The plot is perhaps questionable, with a queue of fellow misfits all stalking the lead female character, but you can let this go over your head and just concentrate on having a good laugh, a funny and worthwhile romantic comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Cameron Diaz was number 65 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 9 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",There's Something About Mary
7,ccthemovieman-1,Modern-Day Comedy Sleaze,2,26 August 2006,"Sorry, but I didn't think this was as good as most people did. Many moviegoers thought this was hilarious; I didn't. Oh, I laughed hard at a few scenes, of course, but the main attraction for me was Cameron Diaz' face more than the comedy. The humor is a little too sleazy for my tastes. I love comedy and own a bunch of DVDs of that genre, but I don't need excessive profanity and sex to make me laugh. Why would they put so many f-words in a comedy? Just asking. There has to be at least 40 in here plus a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain. You know, if it's a crime movie I can understand, but a comedy? It's another sad comment on the movie business and our society that a movie like this can be a box office success, and that so many young people enjoyed this. A woman with semen in her hair? Wow, now that's classy entertainment!",There's Something About Mary
8,rmax304823,Raunchy and funny.,7,26 October 2007,"There are these three guys out after Mary (Cameron Diaz), or maybe four or five or six, depending on how you count. The most important are, first, Ben Stiller, the shy nobody who has had a crush on her since high school in Providence, Rhode Island. Years later he learns Mary lives in Florida, and Stiller hires a sly and self-promoting private investigator (Matt Dillon) to track her down and bring back a report. Then there is a faux Englishman (Lee Evans) trying to insinuate himself into Mary's life space by posing as a victim of polio or something. Even more devious in his obsession is Stiller's friend Woogie, crippled by a nervous rash. A football player is tossed in at the end, and an older guy who has been cultivating Mary's neighbor in order to get a crack at Mary.It's understandable. When Dillon brings back his intelligence on Diaz, he tells Stiller that she weighs several hundred pounds, is confined to a wheelchair, has had four illegitimate children, and lives in a housing project. But the fact is Cameron Diaz is radiant. She's tall, slender, a little goofy, morally upright, and a doctor to boot.The movie is anything but politically correct or delicate in any way. The writers have dived head first into the energetic gags, which follow one another almost instantly and range from silly (the masturbation scene) to merely reckless. (Dillon learns that Mary finds pearly white teeth sexy so he has his teeth modified, giving him a toothpaste-ad grin and a slight lisp.) I don't know how much I want to get into this because, inasmuch as the movie is a series of jokes, any description of unfolding events or character will give some of the jokes away. Well, let me say at least that I laughed most at the scene in which Matt Dillon has tranquilized Diaz's little dog so that it doesn't reject him on their first meeting. The problem is that the dog ODs and goes into cardiac arrest. With Diaz out of the room momentarily, Dillon is forced to perform CPR on the dog. When that doesn't work he yanks some electrical cords out of a lamp and tries to revive the animal with electric shock. The dog begins to sputter with sparks and his fur catches fire. I'll leave it at that.Comedies about ""romance"" generally call for a sobering statement at the end, in which all is explained and the moral spelled out for the viewer. The Farrelly brothers have included such a scene but it's mercifully brief. ""They were only after you because you made them feel good about themselves."" You'll hardly notice the pain.You know how some comedies are toned down, subtle, and require attention to be fully appreciated? This is the opposite.",There's Something About Mary
9,Tweekums,A crude but amusing romantic comedy,7,3 December 2014,"Sixteen year old Ted can't believe his luck when the beautiful Mary invited him to the school prom but things go disastrously when he gets caught in his zipper and ends up in an ambulance rather than going to the prom! Sixteen years later he is still obsessed with Mary even though he hasn't seen her since that dreadful night. His friend Dom says he knows private investigator who can find her; Ted hires the man, Healy, and he soon reports that she is now living in Miami, has four kids by three fathers and looks like a whale only one of these details is true; she is in Miami but she is still beautiful and childless so beautiful in fact that sleazy Healy sets about wooing her. Having eaves-dropped her conversations he presents himself as the perfect man for her. There are problems for Healy though, a friend of Mary sees that he is a fraud and Ted decides that he'd like to see Mary again whatever she looks like.This is probably not the rom-com to buy your mother for Christmas unless she enjoys jokes about blokes getting their genitals caught is their zips, a woman accidentally using semen as hair gel or dogs being drugged and nearly dying. If that sort of crudeness offends then it is best to avoid this but if not there should be enough laughs to be had. The story itself is standard rom-com fare; boy loves girl but she is in love with the wrong guy it is just that the laughs along the way are often in poor taste but some of those poor taste moments are the films funniest; although dog-lovers may disagree. Ben Stiller does a decent enough job as nice-guy Ted, even if he looked ridiculous when playing him aged sixteen. Cameron Diaz shines as the eponymous Mary but it is Matt Dillon who steals the show as Healy making the sleazy character almost likable due to the shear outrageousness of his actions. Overall if you are looking for some lowbrow humour you could do a lot worse than watch this.",There's Something About Mary
10,dbdumonteil,"Yes, she only causes torments!",4,3 June 2003,"One of the most successful movies launched in 1998 and as far as I'm concerned, I find it hard for me to explain the reason of this enormous success because this movie is devoid of interest. I'd like to speak well of this comedy but I can't succeed in. However, the main idea of the movie was interesting. This is the story of a young man (Ben Stiller who wish to pick up the trail of a girl he loved, Mary (Cameron Diaz) when he was in high school. For this, he hires a detective (Matt Dillon) but it's not easy: not only falls Dillon in love with her but the competition is very hard because Mary's got other admirers, notably a so-called architect (Lee Evans) and even an elderly man!Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers obviously felt like introducing a crude and even disgusting humor which is everything except funny. When you think about ""Toto le héros"" a fantastic movie made by Jaco Van Dormael who succeeded in introducing a quiet and ironic humor even in dramatic sequences, you can't help feeling dismay towards ""there's something about Mary"".  Not only, its humor lacks of sharpness and subtlety but it's also completely irrelevant and it doesn't lend itself to certain sequences in the movie. This major flaw spoils it and it's a pity because it enjoys a good performance, especially Matt Dillon and Lee Evans. At last, a predictable and convenient happy-end comes to crown it all.For me, ""there's something about Mary"" is a movie to forget",There's Something About Mary

These characters include the Pathetic detective (Matt Dillon), the 2-sided personality (Lee Evans), the real one who's in love (Ben Stiller) and the apple of their eyes Mary (Played nice by Cameron Diaz).

14,sunwarrior13,An Unforgettable Comedy Made In The 90's,10,6 December 2014,"There's Something About Mary is a comedic film that features Cameron Diaz in a star-making title role together with Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller.It is a film by the Farrelly brothers that combines romantic comedy and gross humor.The film starts when an awkward and shy 16-year-old high-school student named Ted Stroehmann lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen.Unfortunately,it was cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident. After he suffers from the ordeal of pain and embarrassment, Ted end up in the hospital after the incident and loses touch with Mary.Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love.He hires a private investigator to find her and tries to win her once more now that it would be more challenging considering that he finds her a successful orthopedic surgeon residing in Miami. This was definitely an unforgettable film.One main reason is the fact that we here see a great looking,sexy and charming Cameron Diaz who is on her way to stardom before she changed into becoming the premiere actresses for bitches in movies such as The Counselor,Vanilla Sky and Charlie's Angels.Probably,it was also a time wherein she still signs autographs from fans.Anyway,she definitely portrayed the charm and appeal of Mary extremely well.As for the story,it was also able to handle romantic comedy and gross out humor together magnificently.While it maybe offensive and raunchy in many scenes,it also was able to become insightful when it comes to romance.Viewers will definitely feel the love that a romantic comedy rarely provides.Ben Stiller was definitely in top form during the production of the film.And most of all,give credit to the Farrelly brothers for arguably making their best film ever.In it,the movie makes fun of manners,political correctness,moral values and being polite but nevertheless they only made the viewer aware that we are capable of great sense of humor only known to us - human beings.The three reasons stated above makes it deserving of all the accolades and commercial success that it received during it theatrical release.",There's Something About Mary

Ben Stiller is perfect as Ted while Matt Dillon is absolutely outstanding as sleazy ( And boy do I mean sleazy ) private investigator Pat Healy . My only criticism is of Cameron Diaz who`s slightly bland , but she is attractive and that`s all that matters
I suppose how funny you`ll find this film is down to your own subjective opinion of what should or shouldn`t be made fun of . I`ll be honest and say that jokes featuring stalking , serial killers , semen , spiking doggie snacks with drugs and learning difficulties are all fair game ,and perhaps I`m being too honest in saying I laughed out loud at these serious subjects being made fun of ?Sorry if this review has been very short but I find it difficult to write hundreds of words about a film I love",There's Something About Mary

Mary is played with breezy style by CAMERON DIAZ (a throwback perhaps to Carole Lombard's wackiness in this sort of thing), and, of course, BEN STILLER gets to play the lovesick fool who ruins his first prom date with her by getting stung by his zipper.There are too many sight gags here to enumerate, but the funniest have to do with Mary's dog and the other is the famous scene where hair-gel takes on a new meaning.MATT DILLON is the sleazy friend who agrees to find the missing Mary after many years have separated Stiller and Diaz, only to find that he's instantly in love with her too. Naturally, he tells Stiller that she's turned into a blimp in a wheelchair--and you can predict that when Stiller finds out the truth there will be hell to pay.Hilarious moments dominate the breezy comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, full of visual and verbal gags that are non-stop until the last moment.

It set the new standards for comedy and also became a much imitated movie. Movies however very rarely reached the level of this movie ever again, including all of the Farrelly brothers own later work.It's the sort of raunchy comedy, that makes some completely inappropriate jokes and makes for instance fun of both psychically and mentally handicapped people, among many other things. This is the foremost reason why some people can't really stand this movie but luckily most others are able to see the talent and effort that were put into making this movie and why the movie works out so well.As strange as it sounds, it's actually a real subtle done comedy. It's not predictable in any way and the build up and execution of it is spot on. It even makes all of the moments, that usually seem like something totally lame and forced, work out as something hilarious.It also has a great, yet very simple premise, of a bunch of guys all falling for the same girl. It's the sort of story that provides the movie with plenty of silly comical moments, in which the characters lie and constantly are backstabbing each other, all to get the girl in the end.Cameron Diaz forms the perfect centerpiece for this movie and the movie is filled with plenty of comical characters, all played by some capable genre actors. This movie is still from the time when it was cool to like Ben Stiller and yes, he also really is perfect in his role.

In 1985 Ted (Ben Stiller) is a geeky teenager who has a crush on beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). He asks her out to the prom, and she accepts. But before they can even go on their date disaster strikes in every possible, unintentional, and humiliating way for Ted, and the date never happens.Thirteen years later, Ted still can't get Mary off of his mind and decides to hire a detective to look for her. What follows is a hilarious and rather gross tale of deceit between Mary's suitors and between the suitors and Mary, all carrying things to the point of the ridiculous to win the love of Mary. And then there is the mysterious ""Brett"", Mary's old boyfriend, who doesn't make an appearance until the end. All the time Mary is delightfully clueless to be so smart - she's an orthopedic surgeon.There are supporting almost cameo appearances by Markie Post of ""Night Court"" fame as Mary's mother, Keith David as Mary's rather angry stepfather - at Ted not Mary , W. Earl Brown as Mary's mentally handicapped brother, and Lin Shaye as Mary's neighbor with the shoe leather tan who is playing the same kind of ""gross out"" role that she played in the Farrelly Brothers' film ""Kingpin"".Along the way is a stalker with a shoe fetish, the shooting of a minstrel where the bullet was meant for Ted, a mass murderer, a yorkshire terrier with the engine and fortitude of twelve rottweilers, and a great music video of the song I will forever associate with this film - ""Build Me Up Buttercup"".Highly recommended for people who know when not to take things so seriously.

Mary is the obsession of several scheming males but only one poises sincerity. Cameron Diaz plays Mary, the dream girl of Ben Stiller. He was set to take her to the prom until an accident involving his zipper prevented it. After thirteen years he seeks her whereabouts through a sleazy investigator who does find her but deceives Stiller with wrong information when he decides to pursue her. This leads to a road trip of embarrassing mishaps. Vulgar yet sincere storytelling by Bobby and Peter Farrelly who previously made the excellent Kingpin as well as the hilarious Dumb and Dumber. Both directors not only pull off great comic writing but also the ultimate date movie since it can easily appeal to both genders. Stiller is a great foil as the lovesick hero but it is his sincerity that is the heart of the movie. Cameron Diaz glows as the free spirited Mary even during a tasteless hair gel scene. Matt Dillon is hilarious as the investigator deceiving his way into Mary's life. Lee Evans plays the handicapped Tucker detecting competition. Chris Elliot plays Dom, Stiller's best friend who has a fetish for womens' footwear, and a problem with hives. It regards our intentions in relationships resulting in pure comic fun.

This one focuses on a guy who wants to find the girl he almost had a date with in high school, but do to a very funny accident it wasn't meant to be. He has to compete though with numerous other guys who also really want Mary including the private investigator he hired to find her.  This movie has a lot of funny scenes, but the ending wasn't all that funny to me.  There were other times in this one that weren't that great as well, but it still plays very well.  All the actors are good, especially Stiller and Dillon.  Cameron Diaz, the title character though is rather bland with her funniest moment being what she wipes through her hair.  She is only marginally better in this than is Rene Zellwegger is in ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" as the title gal in that one.  All in all though it is a very funny movie, it just may be a bit to long and the ending isn't all that funny especially compared to the rest of the film.",There's Something About Mary
23,mm-39,Just Ok,6,13 May 2004,"Spoiler!!! Toilet junior high humor.  I like this sort of humor, but such humor is either hit or miss.  The grandma on speed was funny, along with the cops part.  Other stuff was gross, or like the dog scene stupid.  I heard so much hype and found the movie not able to live up all the praise.  I hated the band, I was wondering if the bad singer getting shot was ment to be funny or relief? I will let you the reader decide.  Rent it, if there is nothing else left in the video store.  Better than being stuck with Ishtar; I still never had the nerve to rent that one.

24,SimonJack,Scraping the barrel to find funny,2,11 October 2019,"Many years ago, I read a comment by a past great comic (I can't remember who it was) who said that modern examples of toilet humor just meant that the writers couldn't come up with real comedy. That might apply as well to writers of raunchy, distasteful and demeaning material. One hesitates to call it humor or comedy. I am aware, though, that there is a market for such material, so there are those writers (and producers, actors and others) who would want to cash in on it.Thus we have this 1998 film, ""There's Something About Mary."" The cast leads in this film all have shaky records of success with comedies. That goes for Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, especially. Matt Dillon's career is most promising with drama. Most of these comedies have not been box office hits. And for most such films, the efforts for comedy are primarily situational, along with the crude and crass dialog. There is minimal clever or witty dialog. It does seem that the writers for this film checked their minds at the theater doors.Other reviewers noted the newness of the comedy approach in this 1998 film. And, while it was a big box office hit (probably because of the interest in the new comedy method), the brand didn't stick as a huge success. For that, there have been more failures (losses) than successes (profits). Most movie fans, it seems, still prefer intelligent, genuine comedy and clever scripts over the obscene and crude. The two stars are for a couple of funny instances in this otherwise dreary attempt at humor.",There's Something About Mary

It moves seamlessly from an awkward teen movie straight into middle-aged depravity. Just an array of sleazy characters, and they are hysterical; chiefly Keith David, Matt Dillon and Chris Klein. As if the one-liners aren't enough, you've got the story of Ted's prom night from Hell, or the story of Mongo the special kid on a leash.This had me in stitches back in the '90s and it still does today.

28,StevePulaski,Something about this seems off,7,29 March 2011,"The Farrelly Brothers always try to include at least one gross out scene in their movies. In There's Something About Mary the scene is when Ben Stiller is masturbating before his big date with Cameron Diaz. When Stiller finishes, he goes to the door only to find out the sperm is on his ear. Diaz mistakes it for hair gel, puts it in her hair, and that leads to one of many comical situations in There's Something About Mary.While not all of the film is hilarious, many scenes to squeeze out a bad or a good laugh. Ben Stiller plays Ted Stroehmann who was a geeky braceface in High School who had a date with Mary (Diaz) for Senoir Prom. Because of an embarrassing accident Ted was unable to accompany Mary to that prom and has never seen her since.Thirteen years later, Ted hires Pat (Dillon), a sleazeball private detective who falls head of heels when he finds Mary who now lives in Miami. Pat lies to Ted about Mary's life so he can have her all to herself. Ted believes something is up, and it becomes a game for Mary's love.Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite female leads because she is one of the very actors/actresses that can go crazy without getting carried away. Unlike Jim Carrey who is so over the top and ridiculous he is unwatchable, but Diaz has smarts and clever wit behind her gags which makes her a joy to watch on screen.There's Something About Mary is way more clever than Dumb and Dumber, but it still has things that bother me. Mainly the ridiculous and obnoxious scenes of Ben Stiller fighting with Mary's roommate's dog Puffy that goes on and on. Obviously the dog fighting is not real, but I've always felt squeamish, uncomfortable, and just upset by anytime of animal harm in films.The scene is around three minutes in length, and it's unnecessary. I don't see the humor of a grown humor wrestling with a dog on a floor bending, squeezing, choking, strangling, and harming a defenseless dog. Major downfall in the quality just because of an unnecessary scene.Besides the mean-spirited clip, There's Something About Mary not only charms in humor but it's characters are strong. Stiller and Dillon are a great on screen pair even though Dillon makes you hate his character the whole time he is on screen. Not to mention Chris Elliot is great as well. The true highlight is Cameron Diaz, but the whole cast is just perfect in their own right.There's Something About Mary is a few points shy of being ""the perfect comedy"" film.Starring: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliot, Lee Evans, and Lin Shaye. Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly.",There's Something About Mary
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Over rated, but it still has it's moments",6,1 November 2004,"What haven't I heard about ""There's Something About Mary""? It's funny, cute, and a great movie. That's what everyone said pretty much. I even checked out IMDb, and at a 7.2, this seems like a movie anyone can enjoy. While there were some good laughs, I wasn't quit thrilled. I got more than a few laughs from ""Me, Myself,& Irene"" and ""Shallow Hal"". So, I'm not sure why I wasn't that big about this. It seemed like in some ways the humor was a little dry at times. Or something that was supposed to be funny I couldn't laugh at because I've either seen it before, or it wasn't in my humor. Ben Stiller is a great character in the movie. I really enjoyed watching him and his ""comedic"" type of performance. Cameron Diaz is alright. I was never a big fan of her's. Matt Dillon has his moments in the film. I would recommend for a couple laughs. But don't expect too much.6/10",There's Something About Mary
30,MovieAddict2016,There's Something About Nothing...,7,12 December 2002,"I don't understand all the hype about this film. Okay, so it's irreverant. That doesn't always mean funny. The film starts out in the mid-eighties, when geeky high-schooler Ted Stroehmann (played by Ben Stiller) finds the girl of his dreams -- Mary (Cameron Diaz). After being nice to Mary's mentally deformed brother, Ted is asked by Mary to go to the prom with her. But due to some ""unfortunate incidents,"" Ted is unable to take her, and we warp to 1997/8.
 Ted keeps thinking about Mary, so his friend (Chris Elliot) gets a Private Investigator (Matt Dillon) to track down Mary. Pretty soon, everyone is heading head-over-heels regarding Mary, and a predictable ending sums up the film. Okay, here's the review: the film started out great. I enjoyed all the jokes in the beginning, and was not bothered by the politically incorrect jokes that most people who hated this film were offended by. But, once we warp to '97, the jokes start to fall flat -- and plain disgusting -- and I wondered why audiences and critics around the globe loved this film. Another big turn-off for me was the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene. We didn't need visuals, Farrelly brothers. I did chuckle throughout the film, but I expected ""Mary"" to be the best comedy of the year. What a let-down. I was the rare person who enjoyed ""Dumb and Dumber."" It rides along the line of crude and normal, and never passes the line. ""Mary,"" however, crosses the line shamelessly, and never gets back on track. It just keeps slipping farther and farther into immature, eighth grade, gross-out humor. The fact the Peter and Bobby Farrelly have to subject audiences to such disgusting visuals and gags is disappointing, and I think they should be ashamed of themselves. I like Ben Stiller, but this film was just too raunchy and unfunny to enjoy his performance. I could tell he tried to make it funny, but it just failed. I saw on AMC that he didn't want to do the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene because he was afraid it would ruin his career. I don't blame him.""Mary"" overall has some laughs, but not enough, and despite being crude or not, it still is not an outrageously funny film, and not the best of 1998.

32,ElMaruecan82,We all had a 'Mary' in our life ...,9,4 July 2013,"They're beautiful, they embrace life with an extraordinary optimism and wherever they come, it's like sunshine blossoming all over the place. The world is full of girls like Mary, pretty to both eyes and hearts, whose beauty never nourished a snobbish attitude that we'd have forgiven anyway. Cameron Diaz is the titular Mary, and Mary is not just a name, but a concept.We all had a Mary, a 'prettiest girl' in school, one that melted the hearts of studs and athletes as much as geeks and losers; all boys devoted their admiration for Mary like embracing an inaccessible dream. I was in love with a 'Mary' during almost ten years. Needless to say that it wasn't reciprocal, but I never cared, if she smiled at me, she'd had made my day, if she talked, I would spend one minute thinking of the best response, and if we had a date , well, only my dreams involved me as the 'lucky one'.""There's Something About Mary"" is a cinematic tribute to this eternal lovely figure that either enchanted or indirectly ruined our memories.And Cameron Diaz, with her blonde hair, communicative smile and eternally positive attitude, embodied the most fascinating traits of these dream-like creatures. Her performance is perfect because she is genuinely sweet, tender and funny beyond her sexiness. She's such a good person, she even asks Ted (Ben Stiller) to be her cavalier for the prom. Granted movies have their shares of geeky escapism, but Cameron Diaz makes believable that such a girl would not feel indifferent to an awkward braces-wearing schmuck like Stiller. It's believable because these girls are so often labeled as inaccessible by average guys that no one dares to seduce them, which makes them inexperienced enough to fall for the one who tries, inviting the other adulators to come off their holes.Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, ""Mary"" is about a confrontation between men who have all in common, their obsessive fascination for 'Mary'. Since, it's not a game with a win-win situation, it's up to the most sincere, the most clever or the most malicious to win her heart. And this simple premise leads to one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, a laugh riot from beginning to end. For the trivia, the film made the last Gene Siskel's Top 10 before his death in 1999, it was in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of 1998, and holds a honorable 27th spot in the American Film Institute Top 100 comedies as the most recent film to make it in the list.And there's a reason why the film meets with such popular acclaim: it IS funny to a level of slapstick that could have only been possible in a spoof movie, which ""Mary"" is not, but it's beyond labels and no gag is taken for granted, they're all pushed to their extreme limits. And for its risk-taking approach to humor, the film succeeds. Take the unfortunate 'zipper' accident that ruins what could have been Ted's life highlight (and turned out to be the whole opposite), showing the reactions of all the community was already hilarious, but the film doesn't hesitate to give us an 'explicit' idea about the state of Ted's genitals. We never know what we see exactly, but we know it might hurt like hell.After the incident, Mary moves to Florida and Ted loses touch with her, for several years and determined to find out her new whereabouts, in order to exorcise his unfulfilled obsessions, he hires Matt Dillon as a private-eye. Even more brilliant than his casting, the idea of putting this villainous old-fashioned mustache in Dillon is a stroke of genius, because only a naive guy like Ted could have trusted him. But that's what makes Stiller one of the most defining losers of the 90's, what his subsequent series of misadventures never contradict. I won't spoil all the gags, but some have already penetrated Pop-Culture forever they deserve more than a mention.Yes, I'm speaking of the infamous hair gel. Before his date with Mary, Ted's friend, played by Chris Elliot, advises him to pleasure himself, because ""the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load - now that is a medical fact"". Kudos to the writers for such a line full of wisdom because it is true! The whole 'blowing' process is a nice gag, the mysterious disappearance of the seminal liquid, is intriguing and funny, but the final punch line is enough to give the film its ticket in the ¨Pantheon of great comedies"", much more for Mary's reaction which, as silly as it is, keeps her in character, yes, she's still the well-meaning and innocent Mary.And that's the film's secret beyond its crude and raunchy humor, forgive me the cliché; it has a heart, incarnated by Mary. She's the Pandora box or Helen of Troy, inspiring her little fan-club the most deceitful ways to win her. Stiller, Dillon and Elliot are perfect, the other cast features a disabled close friend who's not totally blameless, a roommate named Magda who seemed to have spent her whole life in a UV oven, and naturally, there's no comedy without a scene-stealing animal, the dog in ""Mary"" reduces the one from ""Mask"" to the level of ""Benji"". There's also a weird guitarist playing the 'Greek chorus' figure, and whose final shot will be a double satisfaction for viewers, the second being the nice twist on the happy-ending, perhaps the only forgivable bit of unoriginality.But it's still funny, warm, touching in fact, there's something about ""Mary"" that touches your heart, because it's still about two people learning to love each other without lying or stalking. It's all about honest love. What was wrong with these guys? They idolized Mary, and maintained their passion on a love-at-first-sight level, while it takes more to win a girl's heart, especially a girl like Mary ...",There's Something About Mary
33,bowmanblue,Still outrageously funny,8,20 September 2019,"There are few films as well done as 'There's Something About Mary.' Of course that doesn't mean that it's for everyone, as there are some scenes there that some may find 'offensive,' but, apart from those few who are easily shocked by scenes of 'adult humour,' it should be appreciated by most.The 'romantic comedy' format of film-making is as old as the hills: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. Now, without wishing to 'spoil' the story too much, 'There's Something About Mary' hardly breaks that rule, but it's all about the way it's told.I've already mentioned the humour. It's NOT for all the family. There are plenty of jokes that could be considered (a) bad taste (b) adult in nature or (c) both. However, don't go thinking that this is going to be some sort of raunchy adult comedy with bawdy characters constantly engaging in slapstick comedy and who you won't care about. Somehow, this film actually gives us some rather touching moments which go a little deeper than your average 'boy meets girl' film.It's probably something about the cast. Sometimes everything (or I should probably say everyONE) just falls into place. It's hardly an 'ensemble' film, but there are a few different characters to keep track of and therefore some different story arcs to follow. Most of the marketing of the movie was focused on (then!) Box Office goldmine Cameron Diaz and you could be mistaken for thinking that she was practically starring in the film all on her own. However, it's worth mentioning that Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are both excellent in their roles. They provide some great conflict and male insecurities which contrast Diaz's sweetness.The other two characters that are worth a mention are Chris Elliot and Lee Evans. Elliot isn't given as much screen time as the rest, but whenever he's in front of camera he's worth every moment. If the film has a weak spot - in my opinion - it's Lee Evans. I don't know why, but I've never been a fan of his manic stand-up and I find his performance about as enjoyable as his 'gags.'Perhaps the best thing about the film is that - even after over twenty years - it's still as funny as it was when it first came out. It doesn't seem to have aged at all and, whether you're just looking for a 'boy meets girl' film, or something a little more outrageous and adult in nature, this one should tick all the boxes you're looking for. And, if your only knowledge of the film is that off picture of Cameron Diaz with the funny hair-do, then the scene that you'll be waiting for is very much worth the wait.",There's Something About Mary

35,secondtake,One of those comedies where you groan or cringe as much as you laugh. But such laughs!!,6,9 January 2010,"There's Something About Mary (1998)A goofy, mixed bag of a film, but with a few gut-ripping hilarious scenes that you can't miss. You have to like silly stuff. You have to put up with some padding here and there (I don't recommend the longer version unless you are already love the movie). And you have to turn a blind eye to political correctness (it has none, though not like Borat, which feeds off it, more just incidentally).Ben Stiller is great in his own way, lovable and dull at the same time, which is the idea. The other supporting male actors are comic regulars, and not my favorites, but they do what this kind of movie needs them to do. Even Bret Favre is as stiff on camera and as beefy as a quarterback is supposed to be.But there is, naturally, something about Cameron Diaz, that clicks with audiences--her cute, perky charm, most of all. That fact that all these guys like her for her looks is not the most enlightened approach to love, is it? But then, this isn't a high brow movie, or one with scruples in particular. It's a pretty clumsy movie, in many ways, just a series of gags that sometimes are just too funny for words.

The humor is sophomoric, which is fine if the gags are funny but for the most part they are not. Diaz displays a fine flair for comedy.

38,The-Sarkologist,Started to cross the boundaries of decency,4,6 December 2013,"I guess the first thing that I must say about this movie is that it is disgusting. I will warn off all of you who do not like explicit sexual jokes. This movie is not pornographic, nor are their any ""sex"" scenes, in the narrow meaning of the word, but there is some sexually explicit scenes. Secondly, I probably only laughed about five times in this movie - it was not all that funny. Even though, I cannot say that I hated the movie because the plot was decent and the characters were reasonable. There were two disgusting scenes I did not like, but I have come to a point where I do not judge a movie purely on two scenes (unlike my sister).This is a romantic comedy about a boy named Ted and a girl named Mary. Mary is such an attractive woman that everybody wants to go out with her, but nobody is willing to reveal the truth about themselves to her - that is nobody but Ted. Ted meets her when he steps in to protect her brother Warren who is intellectually disabled. After walking her home, Mary asks him to the prom, but on prom night he has an accident (the first disgusting scene - they did not have to show you) and is incapacitated for two weeks. During this time, Mary's father is transferred to Miami and they are separated for thirteen years.After this time, Ted is still thinking of Mary and his friend Dom tells him of a detective that could find her. Ted decides to get this guys help, but he is not that helpful, falling in love with Mary and going to Florida to court her while telling a load of lies to Ted. After finding out the truth, Ted travels to Florida to try and court Mary himself. In the end, Mary has five guys all trying to court her and all trying to undermine the others chances of attracting Mary to them (actually, six guys).I guess this movie is moving comedy forward where it is telling dirtier jokes as the older ones become old and used and more things become acceptable. Unfortunately I do not find the dirty jokes all that funny, and then being caught in an uncompromising position is pretty old in itself. I guess the movie sets itself up though, saying early on that homosexuals hang out at highway rest stops and then having the main character trip over a whole hoard of them when he stops to go to the toilet.I also like the romantic aspects of this movie - being a bit of a romantic myself (at least at the time of writing the original commentary). I do admire Ted for his nobility at the end, but it also portrays the adage that if you love somebody, set them free - and if they love you they will return. The deceitful parts of the movie are interesting, where people use their knowledge of Mary to gain her affections.Beyond that I guess that there is little that I can say. The movie was okay, but the disgusting parts of it do drag it down a lot in my opinion.",There's Something About Mary

The film is well worth the effort when the humour revolving around a case of two separate instances of deceptive identity is in full flow; other things, such as dramatic reveals and twists feel present more for the absurd pomp and circumstance of it all, do not work as well. Irregardless, the film's odd air of genre hybridisation, as classical Hollywood-era noir appears to crash head on with latter-part 20th Century gross out comedic laughs, is infectious at the best times and only moderately annoying at the worst – it boils down into something worth seeing.We cover a perilous and injustice-ridden quest involving Ben Stiller's rounded and generally bang-up guy, Ted Stroehmann. At the core of the film are his desperate attempts to first get back to the girl of both his youth and of his dreams in the titular Mary, before then proceed to try and win her heart all over again. Along the way, narcissistic and unpleasant men try to sabotage his chances. Mary is the woman in question, and she's played by Cameron Diaz; a woman we observe cycling in the prologue when it was still the 1980s and the main players were all still at high school. She trundles along to said place of study donning a radiant smile; beautiful hair and bright attire - her scopophilic qualities reiterated by all of those whom gaze upon her, and she blots out the unglamourous looking other women as she peddles along.One of those eyeing her is Stiller's aforementioned Ted; a guy revealed to be a little different to that of the rest of the ogling kids, even if he begins out on a similar plain. This differentiation occurs when he steps in on a situation in which a boy at the school with special needs is undergoing a bit of a trauma. Helping him out and bringing calm to the situation, it transpires the boy is Mary's brother and upon thanking him for intervening, poor Ted's feelings for her are implemented to the point that the rest of his life will be largely defined her presence (or lack of) in it in some capacity. The fact the film takes Ted from sharing a domain built on voyeurism as well as an unadulterated lust to know Mary more personally before, most likely, move onto the next woman, and then onto the places he eventually ends up helps move the film away from accusations of it being crasser than it actually is.Things kick off when Ted scores a date to the school-ending prom for his actions involving Mary's sibling, although it all goes spectacularly wrong when he heads over to pick her up and ends in such a disaster that he does not see her again for the duration that allows him to get to the age of being the late-twenty-something-year-old author he is. Desperate, he hires Matt Dillon's private detective Pat Healy to find her and report back. Dillon plays a man with a big gold watch; a little tickle moustache; nudey calenders on the walls of his office and a set of general characteristics that just scream ""avoid"". What Healy does is bend the reality of Mary's looks and situation to allow for him to advance on the unbeknown Mary himself, something made more complicated by the presence of Lee Evans' character: a paraplegic English academic. Acting out of fondness, Ted takes to the road and goes to find her anyway.From this premise, The American filmmaking duo of The Farrelly brothers spin an often humorous film within which we are surprised by how much we actually come to care for what transpires. The Farrelly's actually do well to demonstrate their credentials as filmmakers and prove their ability to time a joke, thus moving the film away from just a flurry of cheap puns more suited to a secondary school playground, during the set up wherein there is a particular edit so well timed that the laugh is in the cut itself and manages to draw attention away from what was otherwise meant to be an instance in which the reveal of a man's semi-veiled genitalia filling the frame was designed to induce giggles. Most of the film's energy, though, does indeed derive from these early segments when we will Stiller on to get to where Mary is and in Dillon's laughable facade. The film could almost certainly be recommended on a level of laughs, in spite of its often veering sources for these laughs; but it is the bends and curves in the narrative as things develop, twinned with one of the more likable leads from memory driving a film of this ilk, which keep it treading water.",There's Something About Mary

One of a kind.,8,16 January 2020,"The story: Ben Stiller had a HUGE highschool crush on the gorgeous Cameron Diaz. 15 years later he still secretly loves her and decides to go look for her. Will love blossom again?There aren't many comedies which make me laugh so hard (at certain moments), that it starts to hurt. This movie ""There...Mary"" even makes me laugh simply thinking about it. It has so many iconic scenes that are to die for, but what is striking is that this movie is NOT a non stop silly comedy. It's a slowburning comedy, which lasts over 2 hours. Such a long length is unheard of for a comedy, but it never becomes boring, despite this length. On the contrary the many scenes that are not full blown jokes do contribute to learning to know the characters. I wouldnt call it character devellopment, but this movie is a fun story about LOOSERS, who are being portrayed in ALL their weaknesses and shameful anxieties. Sometimes gross, sometimes absolutely silly, sometimes endearing, but ALWAYS HILARIOUS.Really, really good acting and a terrific story.

Now grown up he tries to track her down by hiring a Private Detective played by Matt Dillon who also falls madly in love with Mary along with a couple of more guys and Ted has to wonder will he ever be with Mary or not?
Overall from start to finish this film was hilarious. The opening with Ben Stiller wearing braces and getting his privates caught in his zipper of the trousers cracked me up and Keith David(who plays Cameron Diaz's stepdad in this film) with his reaction to it was hilarious. Another was about the dog who took a sleeping pill and the Private Detective had to try and bring him back to life again. The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz was very well played as I love both actors having grown up watching these two evolve(I think this film introduced me to Ben Stiller,while The Mask was the film that introduced me to her as that was her film debut with Jim Carrey in 1994).Now I know what your saying is it as funny as Dumb & Dumber.....not quite but it does come in a close second to that film.

Playing the object of every man's desire, no wonder she's so irresistible! Ever since the prom night accident, Ted(Ben Stiller) wants to see here after all those years. Zipping up his ""franks and beans"" was embarrassing enough, but seeing Mary(Diaz) fixing her strap didn't cause him to wonder. I knew from the start this movie was good. Then when Mary was living in Florida, Ben hires Pat Healy(Matt Dillon) the sleazy detective, not only to find her but to have her for himself. I think switching binoculars wasn't that important when Mary was unhooking her bra. But seeing that overly tanned lady top was a riot. All these characters, all the laughs, this movie got it all. Brett Farve as himself, that boosts the NFL big time. I laughed till my insides hurt, ""There's Something About Mary"" is a must see movie. And The Farrelly Brothers did a fantastic job at it.

The film is a romantic comedy setting up elaborate gag after elaborate gag. I had of course heard of some of them over the years. Maybe they would have been funnier if I had seen the movie fresh. As it is, I found it amusing, but not big-time funny. Matt Dillon's sleazy character really didn't ring true to me. I doubt it was supposed to, but I found it distracting. Like the fake dog in the scenes where it was being ""injured"". Amusing, though. What can you say about Cameron Diaz? So pretty, such ingenuous sincerity.

When Ted (Ben Stiller) had that little incident on the night of the prom, I got a little uncomfortable. I don't want to say why. Also, when he found Mary in Florida, I felt happy for him. This was because it had been 13 years since the last time they saw each other. There was only one person I couldn't stand, and that was Healy (Matt Dillon). This was because he told Ted lies about Mary. Plus, he wanted her all for himself. Also, I liked the songs that Jonathan Richman sang throughout the movie.

Lin Shaye is great in the role of Magda, I enjoyed her funny whacky performance. As for Ben stiller, he did alright I suppose, but personally, I would've preferred a different male lead actor. The comedy works just fine, although it was a bit too crass for my taste at times, like the ""hair gel"" scene for instance, didn't really need to see that LOL. The movie is well paced too, the pace isn't too fast or too slow, it didn't drag, but didn't really feel rushed.

52,slokes,"Funniest film since ""Blazing Saddles,"" only sweeter",10,4 December 2003,"Did you ever see those annoying pop-up online ads about looking up old high-school friends? Did you ever stop to think that this movie is probably responsible? Really, there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.Ben Stiller is a sad-eyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams, Mary, who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway, to see if he can be helpful to her, but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mail-order bride.Ted: What are they, desperate! She's a whale.Healy: It's a sumo culture. They pay by the pound.Actually, Healy is not being entirely truthful. Mary is single, ambulatory, and quite the fox in the form of Cameron Diaz. By the time Ted learns the truth, Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this, without himself being exposed as a `stalker,' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old near-flame? And what will happen when she learns the truth?A winning romantic comedy with gut-busting boundary-breaking bathroom humor and a sly sense of what makes people tick, `There's Something About Mary' is impossibly optimistic and reassuring even as it buries your head in the gutter for cheap laughs. That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again, the fact that this proto-`American Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work, and they are right.Frankly, I could live in a world without `American Pie' and so many other stupid raunch-fests of its ilk, but `Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance (I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich, CT cinema), it's also a very cleverly put-together film, with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the bad-taste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place, the `hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems, but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film, with minimal comedy of any kind, and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version, however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ick-meter, a large part of what makes it brilliant.Diaz and Stiller blend very well together, with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players, major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the six-minute abs guy and, of course, Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie, with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the all-time best. I still smile when I hear `Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio, don't you?",There's Something About Mary

Since then, the Farrelly's have gone onto doing films the way they want with other not so popular films like Shallow Hal and Say It Ain't So. Still, the 1998 comedy blockbuster put Rhode Island on the map once again. Scenes shot on the East Side of Providence and downtown are still talked about today by the locals.

Seriously, I can't help myself because this might just be my favorite comedy of all time.This is the perfect storm of political incorrectness matching the talents of Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott,Cameron Diaz, and The Farrelly Brothers hitting everyone's sweet-spot all at once. Then there's the devices of Jonathan Richman's surreal interjection and the musical soundtrack itself. What a great atmosphere to spring a hilarious story from! Plus, for all the ""take no prisoner's"" satire there's an actual heart too. The movie moves quite well as it paints loser Ted growing up, finding his love, tripping everything up (as expected, yet hilariously not as expected), and never forgetting aboutMary. The journey he takes is absolute gold. So many funny things making repeated viewing not just mandatory, but even better.Now, I think I must admit this kind of comedy isn't so wonderfully entertaining to everyone. In fact, it's kind of a cult group who, many years later, still count this as a comedic watershed moment. But, if you like it in the first 15-minutes then it just gets better and you know who you are. I wish this kind of magic could be more of regular thing. I mean The Farrelly's were really on to something here. I've enjoyed many of their other movies such as Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself, and Irene (this one almost as much). But, as of 2014 the latest version of D&DTo (liked it well enough, not great though) makes it clear there's been a big void in the years since. I'll just watch this again to help fill it in!

It also introduced me to Cameron Diez and managed to have an interesting story thrown in with all that wacky comedy. It definitely made it's mark! This movie had the whole theater in hysterics when I saw it including me. This movie is so very funny. To be honest not every scene is that great, there are a few draggy moments, the movie's not perfect but it's true moments of comedy are just tops and there are a few of the most purely hilarious scenes I've ever seen in a movie contained here. When one goes to a movie expecting just another, mildly funny, comedy and instead gets something like this it's definitely a surprise. I don't think I really know anyone at all who doesn't like this and that is rare. I know some people didn't going by the IMDb reviews and to be sure, there are some pretty obnoxious moments in this movie but by and large I think the moments of pure hysteria are just so funny, they outweigh anything negative about the movie.

58,Movie-ManDan,"Perfect, Just Perfect. I Could Not Contain Myself.",10,4 September 2016,"It has been almost proved that comedies are not as important as serious films. When you look at the greatest films ever made and critics' lists of annual best films, you'll be lucky to find one. When you do look at some of the all-time great comedies, you will find flicks like Some Like It Hot, Duck Soup, and Young Frankenstein. There's Something About Mary is one of those comedies stamped as at the level of the oldies. Some may find it funnier than others, but it is the way everything happens and the way the story unfolds that is just right.Ben Stiller ditches his good looks and starts the movie in a long flashback about when he was a total geek in high school named Ted Strowman who gets a dates to the prom with the most popular and pretty girl in school: Mary. Nobody can deny how beautiful Cameron Diaz looks as Mary. Things take a disastrous turn right away after he gets his sack stuck in his fly. This is perhaps the most memorable scene and the one that rolls out the longest. Mary moves away soon after with Ted blocking the incident out of his mind. Thirteen years later, he randomly starts thinking about her and has a panic attack. That respires his interest in her and his friend (Chris Elliot) recommends Ted hires a private investigator. Ted gets sleazy Pat Healey, played awesomely by Matt Dillon. Matt Dillon is a talented actor who has scored high in both comedies and serious roles. This is his best. Mary now lives in Miami, and after a while of tracking her, Pat also falls in love with her and decides to move down there. When Ted arrives, he learns that he must compete with many men viewing for Mary.The three leads in this are awesome, but it is probably Matt Dillon that was the fan favourite. The supporting cast is just as good, but it is where they fit in and who they are that drive the narrative to perfection. Some guy named ""Woogie"" fell for Mary first, but she had to get a restraining order against him; Ted fell for Mary when she moved to his town in high school; Pat fell for Mary after tailing her, and there's a slew of other memorable characters perfectly placed. Lee Evans plays a crippled man who is perhaps the smartest one in terms of getting guys away from Mary.Each subplot is perfect. Learning the true state of Lee Evans' character was when I couldn't help it and my self-containment was gone. I said to myself with a huge smile: ""Oh my God this is perfect. Totally genius."" Now whenever I watch it, I laugh really hard and it makes me feel so good about myself. That's what's up with Mary, the guys want her because she makes them feel great about themselves. The movie as a whole does that to me. (Well, Mary alone does too.)For a comedy to be truly great, there can't be just fart jokes. There needs to be a serious aspect and actual brains in the way the characters are written and the plot is developed. There's Something About Mary succeeds in that.4/4",There's Something About Mary
59,eric262003,Good Film For Those Who Can Accept That The Film Is Politically Incorrect,9,18 September 2020,"Basking in the glory and showing zero apologies for the raunchy humour, misogynistic characters, and ridiculing situations that shouldn't be ridiculed. If you can accept those flaws, you might enjoy this late 1990's romantic comedy. Sure ""There's Something About Mary"" may not fly to the modern day era where everything is watered down and more sensitive in their presentations. However if you're willing to realize that that it's just a fictional story and that the characters seen are actors and actresses playing off their respected roles and leave it at that, then you might find this film to be both charming and entertaining.Under the direction from The Farrelly Brothers, the film would be something taken from the pages of comical directors like Blake Edwards and John Waters while combining slapstick merging together a romantic comedy narrative to show that not all romantic comedies are sentimental mush. If you can take something generic and have an original spin to it, you can churn thread into gold. ""There's Something About Mary"" is comical gold.Though it supplies a plethora of bathroom jokes, The Farrelly Brothers succeed in getting straight to the bathroom humour by having Ted Stroemann (Ben Stiller) as a young teenager getting his genitals crushed by his pants zipper at Mary Jensen's house while he was taking Mary (Cameron Diaz) to the prom. The gag does ten to extend itself as recue units from all sectors (police, paramedics and firefighters) come and rescue this unlucky fellow and even going far by dropping him while he's being whisked away to the hospital on a gurney. This opening scene alone is the set-piece for the many zany things to come. It may get on your nerves at first, but after seeing it again, it's actually quite funny.Even though many might think that scenes involving the sleazy P.I. Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) can be quite cringe-inducing at first glance. After a second watch, he is really the main reason why this movie is really stands out as Dillion steals every scene he's in. Healy was hired by Ted to track down his lost love who he's still pining over even though it's been 13 years since the disastrous incident in hope to reunite and rekindle their friendship after they lost contact since that horrific accident.Healy, however has other tricks on his mind. He wants Mary to himself. Healy goes incognito as an architect to impress her, but he's being under dark suspicion by a neighbour's dog who he accidently overdoses. The scenes where he revives the dog looks like a scene taken from a cheesy television sitcom. When he takes his act to extremity by electrically charging the canine, the scene was very funny (relax guys and girls, no animals were harmed when this movie was made).Clocking in slightly over the two hour mark, The Farrelly Brothers are not very good when it comes to speeding up on their delivery of jokes. They have the tendency to overdo it with a certain scene and will beat you over the head with it until you are left with no choice but to break down in laughter. Physical comedy is what the Farrelly' s specialize in and it was great that they cast Ben Stiller in the leading role because he's great at physical comedy. Even his altercation with that same pooch is rib tickling funny.Dillon has a tendency to be a bit awkward at times, but in ""There's Something About Mary"", he does an admirable to play off a goofy sneak and his efforts show that he's willing to test waters in every role he tries to perform. Another equally memorable performance comes from Lee Evans who plays another deviant who also wants to win the love of Mary. Diaz, who may be rendered as a mere straight character has enough charm and optimism is able to win anybody's heart. Rounding the supporting cast includes Chris Elliott as Ted's friend and Lin Shaye as Mary's neighbour Magda.Sure this movie may not be on the side to modern era sensitivities by not being politically correct and the raunchy jokes might be a bit of overkill, it's still a great movie if you got two hours to kill. Under all the shock humour featured in ""There's Something About Mary"", it's a film that has heart to it, we want to Ted to rekindle his relationship with Mary and we want Mary to make the right decision of who she wants to date. Though it has its share of flaws, you won't notice it because you'll be laughing until your face turns pink.",There's Something About Mary
60,lewiskendell,A comedy worth watching repeatedly.,8,21 March 2010,"It's the rare comedy that's even funnier the second time you watch it, than it was the first. Something about Mary fits that definition perfectly. It's one of the most memorable Ben Stiller comedies, for a lot of reasons. The story itself isn't something that we haven't seen been before, but it's told exceptionally well and flows quickly from hilarious situation to hilarious situation. Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz have great on-screen chemistry, even though a lot of their time is spent with their equally funny co-stars. And it's nice to be reminded of how gorgeous she was in her younger days.  Be prepared to wince and cover your eyes a few times, because some of the funniest moments in the movie are also the hardest to watch. Overly tanned boobs, painful crotch accidents, and masturbation jokes, are all par for the course.

I don't mind having a good laugh, but at least give me some mature humor and not the farting, vomiting,... kind, because that's just childish. Even though it sometimes seems to go that way (using sperm as hair gel or getting with your penis stuck in your zipper), this movie wasn't too bad after all.Surprisingly enough they added a love story that was quite enjoyable. A man is looking for his dream girl from high school. Even though their first date (the school prom) went terribly wrong and he hasn't heard of her since, he has never forgotten about her. He sends out a private investigator to find her and to find out if she's married or not. The P.I. does his job, but falls in love with her himself... The acting is OK and the story is interesting. Yes, they use many clichés and all the jokes have already been done several times before, but it probably was the right movie at the right moment for me, because in the end I had a good time watching it.

The characters seem just close enough to ""real"" that the audience can sympathize with them.That, and the Farrellys hit on some real painful moments that men at least can sympathize with (the penis in the zipper, the fishhook in the mouth).Other than that, funny, tasteless movie.

64,Sirus_the_Virus,There's something about Mary that you may not know... it's awesome.,10,28 August 2009,"There's something about Mary is the third and best film that The Farrelly Brothers have directed. They did Kingpin and Dumb & Dumber. But There's something about Mary is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. Besdies the Hangover and The Birdcage. I love There's something about Mary because it has a bit of a romantic side. Well, I would never hire Matt Dillon to track down my high school crush for one reason. I don't like Matt Dillon. He's like the villain in every movie. He isn't particularly a villain in this movie, but he's not a good guy. According to Mary"" He's weird, he's got a stupid smile, and he farts a lot too"". I could see Matt Dillon doing a lot of those things. I prefer Ben Stiller as Ted Strobmen. Ted is the main character and throughout the film a lot of bad things happen to him. He gets arrested, beaten by a dog, gets his penis stuck in his zipper, and many other things. There's something about Mary that you may not know... it's awesome. I have seen many great comedies, but There's something about Mary is definitely one of them. The Farrelly Brothers know how to make great comedies, and they really succeed with this movie. There's something about Mary is crude, dirty, and at times gross. Like when Mary gets come in her hair. It's crude, dirty, and at times gross, and I like it.The Plot: A nerd named Ted Strobmen fell in love with a beautiful girl named Mary when he was in high school. His prom night did not go well. Still to this day Ted is in love with Mary and always thinks about her. so his friend Dom convinces him to hire this P.I. named Pat Healy, who tracks her down to Florida and is soon aroused by Mary. So he lies to Ted and moves down to Florida and is now dating her. When Ted finds out, he goes down there and everything goes wrong when he gets down there.",There's Something About Mary
65,Spuzzlightyear,Is she really going out with him?,8,7 April 2006,"Having been a big fan of Ben Stiller, it may surprise you that I only saw 'There's Something About Mary' only today. I don't know what it is, I think it was the Farrelly Brothers, who I'm not a huge fan of, that prevented me from seeing this sooner. I really liked this tale of somewhat-obsessive love. Ben Stiller basically plays the same character he plays in all of his comedies, eg the hyper-neurotic type (one wonders if that's the kind of guy he is in real life) and Cameron Diaz plays Mary, his love-of-his-live-but-only-if-she-knew-it. Diaz's role is not too complicated, the somewhat ditzy-yet-smart blonde that I've seen her do before. The one character that really caught me off guard was Matt Damon playing Healy. Although I think Matt Dillon is a mighty fine actor, I just don't think broad comedy suits him. As for the movie itself, it's goofy fun. Not going to change the world, it's in the ""offensive-but-don't-take-it-seriously"" mold, and quite breezy and easy to sit through. I laughed quite a bit.",There's Something About Mary
66,lambiepie-2,Ya gotta have a sense of humor!,8,22 April 2003,"When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.This is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.What makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don't look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you're going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn't no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that. Plus the Farrley Brothers added in ""some things"" that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you're thinking, ""Better them than me"".....even if it was you!Not for eveyone's taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you've reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things. This is as simple as it gets. Don't put too much into it, it is what it is, and to me, it was really funny! Good Show!",There's Something About Mary
67,Beta_Gallinger,"A second viewing was definitely better for me than the first, but I still don't exactly get its reputation",6,19 July 2011,"This Farrelly brothers comedy was a huge success, and I clearly remember knowing about it and seeing that famous cover image of Cameron Diaz in the role of Mary back in 1998, but I was too young for R-rated movies at the time. I finally saw ""There's Something About Mary"" for the first time early last year, and knowing how popular it was, I had pretty high expectations, but was REALLY let down! I thought it was easily the most overrated comedy I had ever seen, and didn't get why it had gotten so much praise! After that, I had no intention of watching it again. I just wrote a bad review of it and then moved on. However, I recently decided to give it another try, though I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the first time. I think it turned out to be above average for me this time, which was more than I expected.In 1985, Ted is a high school student and has a crush on a popular girl named Mary. He gets a date to go to the prom with her, but unfortunately, after a terrible zipper accident at Mary's house, the date is cut short! Ted has to go to the hospital before he gets to go to the prom with his new girlfriend. Thirteen years later, he hasn't seen Mary since that ambulance took him away, but still can't get her off his mind. He is still in love with her, so he hires a private investigator named Pat Healy to find her and get information about her for him. Pat discovers that Mary is now an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami. She lives with her significantly older roommate, Magda, and a Border Terrier dog named Puffer. It turns out that Ted is in luck, as Mary is still single as well, but Pat finds himself falling in love with her. He lies to Ted about her so he can win her heart without any trouble, and it turns out Ted really shouldn't have hired this guy!Even during my second viewing, I was only finding occasional mildly amusing parts around the beginning. I didn't find Mary's mentally handicapped brother, Warren, being assaulted after being tricked into saying, ""Have you seen my wiener?"" very funny, and still didn't the second time, which was not surprising. I also still just didn't find Warren to be a very funny character. The first BIG laugh I found the second time was Mary's stepfather pulling Ted's leg at the door, and I remember finding that funny the first time as well. It's also funny when Ted is seen urinating through the window, but this leads to the genital/zipper accident, which I found more painful to watch than anything I had ever seen in a comedy before! I'm not sure exactly why, since I had previously seen male genital injuries in comedy, but maybe it's because the one here was longer than any I had seen before, and I found that it got increasingly uncomfortable up to the ""We've got a bleeder"" quote! The second time, I knew it was coming, so it wasn't nearly as bad, but it was still another part I didn't find very funny. After that, I found some good laughs occasionally during my second viewing, but was still finding the film boring for the most part and no more than average, even though I was definitely laughing more than I did the first time. Like the first time, I still thought the sex soliciting scene was pretty lame. Eventually, however, I found that the plot somehow got more entertaining the second time I watched this 1998 romantic comedy. I even found the semen hair gel segment pretty funny, and I don't recall finding it funny at all the first time! After two viewings of this hit romantic comedy from the controversial Farrelly brothers, I still can't say I understand all the high praise, but after seeing it a second time, I can't call it a bad movie anymore, nor can I even call it a mediocre movie, even if I still think it comes close to that. Even though Ted getting his genitals caught in his zipper still didn't amuse me too much the second time, and I still found the close-up of it unsettling (good thing that shot is VERY brief), I don't quite despise that part as much as I used to. It is now another comedy I can refer to as a mixed blessing. Since ""There's Something About Mary"" is from Peter and Bobby Farrelly, you're absolutely right if you assume that it's very raunchy, often juvenile, and irreverent, and as popular as it is, it could easily disgust many viewers. I don't think the movie is NEARLY as funny as maybe most others who have seen it do, but won't just advise everyone to just skip it, either.",There's Something About Mary

There are classic moments in this film such as the Hair gel , the dog fight and the ""We have a bleeder!"" scene that will stand in the memory forever.

I imagine a group of thirteen year old teens watching it would find it hilarious and even crudely educational.To me it was proof of the decadence of contemporary Hollywood and the corroded moral standards of the United States.Sex is a great form of humour. This was not humour but embarrassing vulgarity laced with needless foul language and premised on the validity of lies and deception.I was tempted to turn it off after the first few minutes but forced myself to watch because it is such an excellent example of the moral vacuum that has engulfed the United States.

76,TheNorthernMonkee,mostly humourless comedy with a few highlights,5,17 April 2005,"SPOILERS Like so many comedy brothers, the Farrelly brothers have a record of comedy history. With funny films like ""Shallow Hal"" and ""Me, Myself and Irene"" they've proved themselves year after year. Often though their most famous film is ""There's Something About Mary"". Not particularly funny, but with the occasional moment, this film is over publicised and constantly over-hyped.Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) is a useless school kid with a crush on Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz). After a nightmarish date, things seem lost. Many years later though and with the help of creepy Private Eye Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), Ted is going to once more find her and realise that ultimately 'There's Something About Mary'.Led by a surprisingly strong performance by Cameron Diaz, this film will always be remembered for one or two key scenes. Constantly spoofed, it remains a figure-stone of American comedy. The sad thing however is that in the modern world it just isn't that funny.No film, irrelevant of what it is, should be best remembered for it's end credits. Sadly, with a superb remake of ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"", this film is at it's finest once the story has concluded.This isn't to say that 'There's Something About Mary' doesn't have it's moments. There are signs when it shows potential of hilarity, but it never fully satisfies what it should achieve.All in all, 'There's Something About Mary' is a disappointing film.

78,Atreyu_II,I hate this movie,3,8 February 2008,"Unlike so many people, who claim that this movie is very funny or a great comedy (and so on...), I can't possibly understand all the success around this film. In fact, I practically never laughed when I saw this movie. If I laughed, it was only one or two times with something minor (like a minor comment from some character or something).This movie is just way too overrated. When I saw it, it was for two main reasons: because of Cameron Diaz (I used to like her more back then than nowadays) and also because I thought this would be a clever, worthy and funny comedy.Instead, I had a big shock. This movie is absolutely hideous, full of cheap and ""toilet"" humor and profanity. Besides, its jokes are cruel, dirty, disturbing, shocking and sickening. Its humor is really disgusting, trashy and insulting. I expected at least a reasonable romantic comedy, not a nasty movie.Almost everything about this movie angered me. But some ""jokes"" in particular angered me even more than everything else. These ""jokes"" were the following ones: whenever Mary's retard brother attacks the innocent Ted; Ted's painful and disturbing zipper accident; when Mary's dog attacks Ted on a certain part (needless to say which part); when Ted is taken by the police and those cruel policemen grab on Ted's face and slam it brutally on a table; when Ted leaves at the end heartbroken; the scene with sperm on Mary's hair; and finally, the final scene when an old man shoots a singer.Poor Ted! He only suffers during the whole movie. He's fooled, humiliated, abused, he's the victim!If *this* movie is considered funny, then I'm concerned about what people find funny nowadays. Seriously, a movie like this isn't something I find entertaining, worthy, amusing or funny. This movie left me in very bad mood and, to make things even worst, it is too long considering the garbage it is - almost 2 hours! I was only wishing that it would come to an end. I refuse to ever watch this movie again and that's for sure. For those who never saw this movie, let me give an advice: skip it and try instead an intelligent comedy with really funny humor (not dirty humor) such as ""Liar Liar"", ""Mousehunt"" and ""Johnny English"", for example.",There's Something About Mary

Matt Dillon plays the lying eaves-dropping investigator with all stops out! As a result, it turns out to be one of the best comedies of the year. A couple of scenes are very risque, but manage to keep just within the bounds of censorship.  It's about a love-sick guy who seeks out a girl he knew 13 years before.  She's moved to Florida so he has to engage a private investigator to seek out and stalk her.  It so happens that the stalker falls for Mary, too.  Two of the funniest scenes involve a family dog.  In one scene the dog which has been over-dosed with a soporific drug has to be hurriedly resuscitated (a really farcical scene) and later, poor Ted is savagely attacked by the dog as it goes for his throat and other extremities.  These are only two of the extremely funny situations which keep the laughter bursting forth.

A nicely rounded satire about guys telling all about the girl they love proves that such desiring moments are hilarious in a sophisticated way. If only wishes do exist in becoming true. Cameron Diaz may not be doing so much at first, but there's reason to find her likeable as a young woman who becomes attracted by guys who want to dig her. This has to be the best performance for Diaz so far, yet a no-show at the Oscars. A name to watch for in future Hollywood releases. This is also a truly unique style of modern-day comedy. It's real cool to have the story told through some brief singing numbers, making this much more special. Unintentionally funny bits are sweet and nifty. In a nutshell, it's fun-filled all the way through, but the ""R"" rating is what bothered me the most. You might have heard rumors about Fox putting the movie out on video as a watered down ""PG"" release. That should have been a smart idea, and while the crudeness can be laughable on occasion, it takes some of the advantage away in willing to be a truly heartfelt satire.

86,moviesleuth2,"Gleefully rude, politically incorrect, laugh till it hurts comedy. Any questions?",8,16 January 2010,"This movie is hysterical. That's the bottom line. If you want to laugh, and don't mind severe stomach pain as a result, pop this in the DVD player and enjoy. Admittedly, it's pretty lowbrow, but when so many ""comedies"" fail to generate any more than a few chuckles, it's amazing to see a movie that will actually make you laugh (and laugh hard) all the way through.After their prom night was ended too soon after an unholy disaster, Ted Strohmann (Ben Stiller) and Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) never saw each other again. Now, thirteen years later, Ted is still pining over the woman he loved, and at the advice of a friend, hires a sleazy private investigator to look her up. Once there, he falls for her too. It's a battle of wits, wills, and bodily fluids to determine who gets the girl.Comedy is difficult to pull off. There is so much that has to be perfect to get an honest laugh: timing, reactions, the appropriate build-up, and of course the delivery. The people making this movie certainly have what it takes. This is the best sort of comedy; it's not the lines that provoke laughs (although there are a few good one-liners), it's what happens and how it happens.The talent pool in this movie is terrific. Cameron Diaz is dazzling as the object of every guy's affection. Mary might as well be called Mary Sunshine. She's nice to a fault, and one of those people who can change the tone of a room just by being there. Yet Diaz never lets Mary become two-dimensional. She knows what she wants, but just attracts degenerates, creeps and losers. And it's no feat to understand why every guy would go crazy around her; Diaz is also drop-dead gorgeous.Her co-stars may be losers, but they're funny losers. Ben Stiller is a master of reaction shots, and that serves him well here. Ted is a mixture of guilt and panic, and that sets up some of the film's funniest sequences well. Matt Dillon broke into film playing teenage bad boys, but Dillon proves that he's got considerable comic talent. Lee Evans is pretty funny as Mary's friend who has a secret of his own. W. Earl Brown didn't get any accolades for his spot-on portrayal of Mary's ""retarded"" brother, Warren, but he's outstanding. He's funny without being insulting or a walking plot device. Also of note is Keith David, who is hysterical in the one of the film's beginning scenes.The Farrelly Brothers are known for their low-brow, crude comedy, and that's what they give us here. This is a raunchy, occasionally dark, comedy that appeals to the lowest level of humor. And it works. There are quite a few hysterical sequences, and the inbetween parts develop a cute, if preposterous, romance. It also takes chances (a minstrel duo narrating the story? Who've thought?).

People rarely question this, as it's especially true in movies made by the Farrelly brothers, known for their bad taste in such movies as Dumb and Dumber. If people laugh, they forget that what they're laughing at is offensive. And while there is a little bit of clean humor in There's Something About Mary, it's few and far between as jokes involving at least three bodily functions are shown, mentally retarded people are ridiculed (but not as much as you may think), and fake dogs are injured (but not killed). It's another day in the life of a Farrelly brother.Ted (Ben Stiller), as a somewhat nerdy high schooler in the 80s, is going to the prom with popular girl Mary (Cameron Diaz), but an unfortunate accident has Ted going to the hospital. Thirteen years later, Ted still hasn't gotten over Mary, so he hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out about her. Pat discovers that there's ""something about Mary"" and falls in love with her. Ted now has to go to Florida to stop Pat, but gets into a lot of zany mishaps along the way.Mary works, but in moderation. It seems like the only time it goes for the full comedic effect and works is during the truly inspired scenes. The bathroom scene in the beginning is great-that, and the first ""dog/speed"" scene are the only two that had me cracking up for the whole scene. The rest of the movie had a laugh or two, but not really that much. The ""hair gel"" part seemed to over-the-top to be even remotely believable. There's some good characters, like Magda (Lin Shaye) and Dom (Chris Elliot) that have their moments, but none of them even stand out. Diaz does what she does, playing a level-headed, all-around nice person, and Stiller playing his slightly-nebbish person perfectly, but it's either that or some weird over-the-top guy (like Zoolander or Dodgeball).The romantic parts of the movie worked for what they were meant to do, which was further the humor. I suppose I bought the relationship between Stiller and Diaz, although Dillon's over-the-top character was more realistic in his fascination with Mary. But, since Dillon wasn't in either of the aforementioned scenes, he didn't evoke many laughs. Mary's 2 hour runtime went by pretty quickly, and I suppose when you have a runtime like that, being entertaining is more important than being funny, and that's obviously the case with Mary, although it's not its intention.My rating: 6/10Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language.",There's Something About Mary
89,Peach-2,Funny and tasteless.,8,14 February 1999,"The Farrelley Brothers love tasteless humor, there is no doubt about that. This film is very funny and manages to inject a sweet little romance between Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz. There is some humor at the expense of the mentally challenged that may bother some people, but it is just tasteless humor and I think if you go into this film knowing the same guys brought you Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin, you'll get exactly the movie you expect.

The story is surprisingly both sweet and hilarious at the same time.  The story is absolutely fantastic and incredibly well written, the story flows very smoothly from scene to scene and makes every character important to the overall story.  What makes this such a great story are all the great characters in the film, all played by fantastic actors.  It isn't often that you have a truly great comedy film with such a great cast.The star is obviously Cameron Diaz, playing one of my personal favorite roles to date.  She's such a beautiful actress and such a good actress.  Ben Stiller, what can I say?  Nothing less than a STUD!!!  I absolutely love his character, he plays such a genuinely likable guy.  Ben's little movements and reactions completely make the movie for me.  Lee Evans really shows off his acting talent in this film as well, just amazing, that's all I have to say.  Matt Dillon, Jeffery Tambor, Lin Shaye, Chris Elliot, Keith David and everyone else also play their roles flawlessly.  I also feel that I have to mention W. Earl Brown, who plays the part of ""Warren"".  This guy is a truly fantastic actor!  It's too bad that comedies are exempt from receiving Oscars (well, not always), this guy plays a phenomenal supporting character. There are also some great cameos and minor roles, played by Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, Harland Williams, Sarah Silverman, Richard Jenkins and Brett Favre.Those Farrelly Brothers are nothing less than comedic geniuses!!!  This is just another great comedy to add to their impressive list of comedy films. Keep up the good work guys!The comedy in this film is pretty much what you'd expect from a Farrelly Brothers film, but this one REALLY pushes the envelope.  There is a lot of very ""dirty"" or ""questionable"" humor in this film...but it's just plain hilarious.  I would strongly urge you to see some of their earlier work first, and if you like any of those films, then give this one a shot.  This is most definitely not a comedy for everyone, but I sure found it funny as all hell.I truly hope that you can respect this film for what it is and I hope, even more so, that you laugh just half as much as I did watching this film.

Well it's very famous from Cameron Diaz's hair being put up for being mistaked of gel. This film was so hilarious that I almost fell out of my chair laughing. This one of Farrely's best films. Matt Dillon was so funny in this movie with his teeth and his rude joking kind of comments. He was probably my favorite character in this film and Chris Elliot coming in second as the itching man. Ben Stiller looked so funny in that goofy outfit for the prom and those braces. I heard that he actually looked like that when he was in highschool but was very popular and was a good person.

94,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: a top comedy of all time,7,24 May 2004,"There's something wacky about this film that truly hilarious. Together with ""The Ref"", ""Bowfinger"", and ""My Cousin Vinnie"", this film is perhaps the best comedy of all time. The timing is right on, and there's a real plot. I read the autobiography of Chuck Jones, the creator of Bugs Bunny, who said that for comedy you need the protagonist to be a straight man and the world is wacky around him. Otherwise, if the protagonist is the weirdo, it's farce, and for some reason comedy works and farce doesn't. There's Something About Mary gets that balance right, but the weirdness doesn't consume the film so that the plot no longer matters. We can still identify with the characters. Matt Dillon is especially good.Who should see this film:-- Everyone, and it's safe for kids, tooI'll give There's Something about Mary a near-perfect 9 out of 10.",There's Something About Mary

96,SKG-2,Some belly laughs do not a comedy make,5,15 March 1999,"Maybe as I grow older, I may be less tolerant of really tasteless humor, but I don't think so.  After all, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, which also starred Ben Stiller, also has tasteless humor, but it also had a consistent tone and no gaps of unfunny scenes in it.  There are admittedly some huge laughs here (like everyone else, I laughed at the zipper and hair gel scenes, and the dog humor is as hilariously twisted as anything since Monty Python), but there are also some boring stretches.  Eventually, you get tired of Mary being so naive about everyone's intentions, and how she only seems to attract idiots.  Cameron Diaz is an appealing actress, but she's stuck here with a part that doesn't require much besides being the object of affection. Most of the men don't come off much better; Stiller, who showed range in ZERO EFFECT, goes back to his nerdish character, and he overplays it to the point of being tiresome.  The saving grace here is Matt Dillon, who's quite funny as a sleazy investigator, complete with mustache.  One of the nice things is how he's been able to show a surprising aptitude towards comedy this decade with this, SINGLES, and BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, among others.  For the most part, however, you can give this one a miss.",There's Something About Mary
97,chrisbrown6453,"Yes, there definetly something about her...",7,17 June 2002,"A couple of scenes from There's Something About Mary have already become legend. The scrotum-in-the-zipper scene and, of course, the flying style-gel scene have guaranteed places in the Gross-Me-Out Hall of Fame. The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, have provided us with the funniest mainstream comedy since AUSTIN POWERS. The minds behind the successful Dumb and Dumber and the overlooked Kingpin have concocted an outrageous batch of gags and assembled a game cast to embody them. Ben Stiller is Rhode Island Ted, a nerdy, mouth-full-of-metal highschooler who has a crush on the impossibly tall, blonde and beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). Much to his surprise, she becomes his date to the prom. Well, almost. A nasty close encounter with the aforementioned zipper dashes his hopes of romance on the dance floor. Thirteen years later, Ted, with the braces (and zipper) now removed, is still thinking of Mary. You see, there is definitely something special about Mary. He has her located in Miami by hiring a sleaze ball private investigator (Matt Dillon), and the obsession continues. Stiller is endearing as smitten Ted and Diaz is absolutely charming as Mary. No doubt, there's something about Cameron. You can easily see why she is driving everyone crazy. A terrific supporting cast including Dillon, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot and Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, add laughs. Quite astonishing is Lin Shaye as Mary's ever-present neighbor, Magda, whose bleached-blonde bouffant is way beyond white and whose dangerously tanned skin reminds me of a top-quality Naugahyde sofa. Look for Magda's dog Puffy too. He deserves a doggie Oscar all his own. Love Puffy's stunt double, which looks like an overgrown, stiff-legged Beanie Baby, has seen better days.

99,alicecbr,HIlarious comedy from Dillon and STiller,9,27 October 2006,"I still don't get the thing about Dillon's big teeth. Were they artificial, or was he just poking them out? Whatever, they made him even more dorky than the character he plays in this hilarious, cruel comedy about getting penises stuck in zippers and throwing yippy inbred dogs out windows.Knowing that Matt and Cameron Diaz were significant others during this time made the show even more enjoyable. Obviously, they could both turn off the goony character Matt plays, as the private dick, hired to find the girl that Ben lost many years ago in his own private Hell.This is a great movie for nerdy teen-agers going through the Hell of adolescence and thinking they'll never get the girl or get the guy. In this case, both persevere and become successes in their chosen profession, thereby having the finances to do what ever the script has them doing without the bother of having to show up 8 to 5.The beautiful Florida scenery is also enjoyable, as is the daffy next door neighbor, the owner of said daffy dog. It became a class when it came out, and it's still hilarious. You can't be depressed watching this trip through la-la land. Unless you think that a bunch of cops pouncing on some homsexuals is funny....which obviously the Republicans will get a great laugh out of.

A lot of humour we hadn't seen before (and maybe some we wish we hadn't).""There's Something About Mary"" tells the fictional story of a girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), who becomes an obsession for many guys. The film revolves around Ted (Ben Stiller), who went to school with Mary and as an older man decides to try to track her down. He hires PI Pat Healy (Matt Dillon, in one of his best efforts)to track her down. Healy finds her, but falls for her and consequently makes up a story to try to deter Ted from pursuing her.

101,LivingDog,There's Nothing About Mary,5,19 January 2003,"I found this movie to be incredibly boring. In short it has very few funny moments. Here are the three: the zipper scene, the dog-on-fire scene, and the ""speed for the dog"" scene. However, the ""speed"" scene has a great setup (Evans and Dillon set the dog up to meet Stiller), but in it's punchline it goes flat. Don't see this movie if you want to laugh.There is a scene in Mary's office with Tucker (Lee Evans) on crutches. But I kept feeling that the director was saying: ""look at this, isn't it outrageous?!"" It felt forced. Mary (Diaz) tries to help and there was one more quantifiable laugh. The man (played adeptly by Lee Evans)leaves and outside is a good chuckle, indicating his slapstick skill.This humor is not offensive. It is you who are pseudo-sensitive if you think it is. E.g. the character ""Carla"" in ""Cheers"" was the most insulting image of an Italian-American woman I have ever see. However, she did not represent all Italians, all Italian women, or women in general. She was one character and her antics were about her character. No Italian-Americans were upset about ""Carla"" - we all had a great laugh. In this same sense, the humor about the crutches is not at all about people with handicaps - it is about ""Tucker"" and that's all it is. So get over yourselves, get a life, and learn to ""Eat, drink, and be merry."" (Luke 12:19)Cameron Diaz is a charm to watch, but that's it. I wanted to laugh and all I did was wound up waiting to think of something better to do.Matt Dillon is excellent at being a ""mook."" (I guess that means big dork.)Lee Evans puts in a solid and utterly convincing performance.However, the story is simply not funny and not romantic. I feel nothing between Ted (Stiller) and Mary (Diaz). Towards the end I kept thinking, ""Come on, END!

The ""something"" about Mary must be that; she attracts all those outlaws, who keep competing to see who is the worst idiot she has attracted. Cameron is a young doctor who does nothing related to medicine in the movie. I just did not get what is funny about this movie! Ben Stiller, who is normally a good actor, plays this loser.  In the beginning he wears this horrible wig pretending to be young and is not convincing at all. Since I did not watch Dumb and Dumber I am unable to cross reference. But my recommendation is stay away from this movie. It is awful! There is no script or point to this race of the out-laws that cute young doctor attracts.

106,Pookyiscute,Funnier than hell!,10,28 December 2005,"I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is my favorite Farrley's brother movie, however this is VERY close second. It's funny when I think about the fact that Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller were actually in a romantic comedy together, but the truth is, they were both perfect for the roles that they played. There is something about Cameron, and she was made for this part.After a humiliating and basically unforgettable Prom night, when he was sixteen, Greg (Stiller) never fully recovers from the humiliation he suffered thirteen years earlier. He decides, that even though it's been several years, he'd like to look up the girl he essentially blew all of his chances with, so long ago.He hires a private detective to look into finding her, since Greg lives in Rhode Island, and Mary (Diaz) lives in Miami, FL. After finding her, and following her around, he falls in love with her too, and tells Greg that she is not worth his time and tries to get him to forget about her.Even though, Greg is discouraged he decides to look into finding her anyway. Along the way to Florida, he runs into some trouble with the law (which I won't give away, but the police scene is probably the funniest in the entire movie. For those who have seen the movie, I'm referring to the part with the two officers, who think he's done something other than what he thinks he's being charged for.), ans finally makes it to Florida.While he's there, Pat (Dillan), the P.I., learns of Greg's coming, and the two try to get one another out of Mary's life. With other mishaps, and funny situations that go on in the film, it's one of the most well-written scripts, and funniest films to watch ever.I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy, however there is some pretty graphic dialogue from time to time, so I wouldn't suggest the film to anyone under seventeen. But, it is funny and I've seen it countless times. And now, an excerpt from the film: ""Greg, this wasn't your first time, was it?"" ""No."" ""How many we talking' here?"" ""My whole life? I dunno. Twenty-five, maybe fifty. I dunno, who keeps track? Look I know that this is like the Bible belt down here, but where I'm from this is not that big a deal.""",There's Something About Mary

I finally saw this film when I was 15 when my mum bought the video shortly before Diaz's 30th birthday and I bought the DVD myself a couple of months after.While this film has a lot of funny moments, there are a couple of scenes I didn't like such as the ""frank and beans"" in the zipper scene in the 1985 flashback and another scene that had excessive swearing. I did, however, like the infamous 'hair gel' scene that was parodied in the music video to 'Say You'll Be Mine' video by Steps (one of my favourite pop groups) where Claire Richards was Cameron Diaz/Mary and Lee Latchford Evans was Ben Stiller/Ted. The majority of the flashback was watchable with the exception of the ""frank and beans"" scene I've already mentioned and the scenes involving the mishaps of Puffy the Border terrier being drugged up by Pat were hilarious if sad and hysterical but the first instance of this ended on a cute note when Pat had him ""wrapped up like a baby"" much to Magda's delight. Although Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are the standouts, I also liked the support from Lee Evans as Tucker, Lin Shaye as Magda and W Earl Brown as Mary's brother Warren.Overall this is a funny film that has its fair share of memorable moments, romance and gross-out humour. 8/10.",There's Something About Mary

However, after going to her house and getting his genitals caught in his zip the evening goes from bad to worse with Ted spending the night in hospital and missing the prom.After years of failed relationships Ted reminisces about Mary with his best friend who advises him to seek her out through a private detective friend of his (Played deliciously by Matt Dillon!) who also falls for Mary along with every other man in the film, thus begins this comedy of errors that made both Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz a star and put Matt Dillon back on the map, and also, to some degree, began the rebirth of American comedy.This film has largely been forgotten in moviegoers minds by more recent films such as ""American Pie"" ""40 year old virgin"" and ""Knocked up"", but this is the film that started that flurry in that it shocked people with how far it could go. The sight gags are side-splittingly funny and the physical comedy throughout is hilarious, from Matt Dillon playing ball to the legendary dog fight, it's all good. The script is great and allows all the characters to shine, but as always with films like this it's the chemistry between the leads that's the key and Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz come together with such charm and ease that it carries you along.As with a number of other examples over time,such as ""Rocky"", ""Airplane"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it is clear that the Farrelly brothers had a very clear indication of what they wanted to do with comedy and put a lot of themselves in there and it shows. Their passion for their craft has never been more in evidence.In an age when so many films get to the top of the box office by hype and advertising. It clawed it's way to the top because people saw it and saw it again and the reason they did that is because it is that good.True the crude humour won't be to everyone's taste, but if you've got the stomach for some belly laughs and a small amount of smut, then you can't go far wrong here.Megatron!",There's Something About Mary

This was one of the only movies in which I was in tears because I was laughing so hard.  'Dumb and Dumber' was OK and 'Kingpin' was pretty good, they didn't have much substance to then.  'There's Something About Mary' had heart and gross-out humor making a genius movie.  Most movies depend on one or the other. 
Sure it was about stalkers but poltical correctness is not a good thing, and that is what this movie is against.  I know people who were offended by it big time, but still laughed at it.  I think any movie which gets you to laugh and enjoy yourself is a good movie.  Other movies are just mediocre. 
To those who hate low-brow humor and gross-out gags, why don't you get them? I say you should lighten up and enjoy yourselves.  Let loose.

126,Kakueke,Silly gross-out humor,3,20 September 2001,"While not always averse to crude humor, although I usually would rather see it on a limited scale (Blazing Saddles is an exception), excesses and stupidity mean gross-out humor.  And they also make a movie silly and sophomoric.  And this idiotic movie about sophomoric-type people is not funny most of the time. For the romance, we have Mary (Cameron Diaz, attractive, not beautiful, in my book) pursued by numerous love interests, and finally won over by a loser/schmuck.  And was he ever.  My girlfriend asked me whether women, too, should be entitled to some appealing good looks and other things, you know, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, whoever.  But I guess it was part of the humor, loser humor.  Cameron Diaz in this movie is pretty with a girl-next-door look, but not sexy, like she can appear in photos and other movies.  Her acting job, however, was better than that of any of the main men.  Aside from the dumb scenes, the movie drags at times, particularly at the finish, when I wanted the movie just to get it over with and end, end, end.Why did TV Guide name the gel scene one of the top 50 of all time?  It is one of the (narrower number) most idiotic of all time, and yet it still would have acquitted itself a little better if it were shorter and not pompously drawn out.  But it should be emphasized that almost all the crude scenes lacked the subtlety of When Harry Met Sally and The Truth About Cats and Dogs, and of Mel Brooks, who knows how to make crude humor funny.  And the stuff in There's Something About Mary does not have the humor of slapstick, which I love.  It is, look at me, how idiotically silly, rather than klutzy, I am.  Little intelligence or wit went in.  This movie is vastly overrated, and only for people with bad taste and infantile dispositions.",There's Something About Mary

People lie and say they like it because of its supposed ""shock"" value, but the truth is, gross-out humor is nothing new, and it has been done MUCH better than this (just watch any episode of ""South Park""). The only funny scene is the one in the police station, but by then I was too tired and bored to laugh. A couple other scenes have good comic potential, such as the dog on speed, but they are wasted and fall flat.Even with the horrible script, which has no tangible plot and can't figure out who the main character is and doesn't bother to develop characters at all, it COULD have been funny with the right actors (this is what saved ""Dumb and Dumber""). Unfortunately, everyone here is bland and listless. I guess I'll make an exception for Lee Evans, who really is a talented comedian and does his best with an unfunny character. But Stiller and Dillon don't even seem to be trying that hard. Diaz doesn't even have personality; she's nothing more than a plot device. Except there is no plot. So I don't know what she is. Just a device, I guess.I can't believe I spent money to rent this. Fortunately I also had the good sense to rent ""The Big Lebowski"" along with it, so my evening wasn't completely ruined.

I should have researched about this film more. That's 119 minutes of my life that's gone now. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this. I don't get why it's rated a 7.2, there have been much much better films that were rated much lower.

In this one he's got less of a leading man type role, letting some of the other players (Matt Dillon, Lee Evans) get the odd word in edgeways, which is nice, and also giving Cameron Diaz' Mary a fair bit of screen time. This central group of characters are pitch perfect, from the tight and hilarious script down to every face and gesture they make, and with a clever but not overcomplicated plot and plenty of top-notch gags there's plenty of fun to be had. It's a lot more reliant on wit and plot, and less on puerile toilet humour, than much of the Farrelly's output (and that of their recent successors/acolytes), which makes it a much more rounded and enjoyable comedy.

136,jbartelone,The Something About This Movie? Below Average and Predictable,4,17 January 2008,"I remember when this movie was released that it was considered to be a comedy cult classic. To many it still is. But my observations of the film show that the story lines and character developments leave ""something"" to be desired. The movie traces Ben Stiller's life beginning in high school as he plans to ask the popular girl of his dreams to the prom. Stiller's character is awkward and geeky. While getting ready for the prom, he gets his genitals caught in his zipper, and facing this ultimate embarrassment he is determined to seek her out to make amends for this humiliation.He hires a sleazy private detective to help find Mary. He is madly obsessed with her, as is the detective along with all of their screwball friends. There are varies sophomoric antics and toilet humor jokes that may be funny if you want a typical teen screwball comedy. However, all of the actors are much too old for this sort of mindless drivel. There are a couple of haha jokes but nothing worthwhile or memorable. Why this film is so popular I do not understand. The moronic humor exists for sheer slapstick value. The 5th graders who bully the poor helpless outcast by putting a ""kick me here"" sign on his butt would be the type of people who would give this movie high reviews. That in a nutshell represents the humor of this film.Because of the cruel edge to this film, feelings and relationships never develop. Stiller's relationship with Mary is bad margarine instead of quality butter. The writing is so juvenile and demeaning to relationships that by the end, nobody cares. Substance-wise, there is really ""Nothing About Mary"" to signify this movie as a quality film. Only see it if you like slapstick. Otherwise, ""Mary"" is a film to avoid.",There's Something About Mary
137,brandon_lee420,A great cast!,7,26 April 2010,"Before I had even watched the film, I predicted that it would be one of those sh*tty films, like American Pie, and my prediction blurred my mind and so I never got to watch it.... until now. The idea of Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, and Matt Dillon starring together in a comedy film had to be good, and to make it even better, let the Farrelly Brothers direct it. The two brothers have directed sh*t and crap but it is good to know that that their goal isn't always to direct feces and if you want proof, watch There's Something About Mary. The rest can go in the toilet, with the exception of ""Dumb & Dumber"". I probably wouldn't ever like them as directors no MATTER what they make. Before I go any further let me warn you that this film isn't funny all the way through but it does have some scenes, five or six, that will make you laugh out loud. The story is pretty simple but likable and it has a sense of nostalgia stuck to it. It is about a guy who still thirteen years later is in love with the girl who he WAS supposed to go to the prom with but he never did make it since it was a complete disaster. (Minor Spoiler) Apparently, he had an accident in his girlfriends bathroom that consisted of his balls being stuck in his zipper which was pulled all the way up. The problem could have easily been fixed if the ambulance, fire truck, and EVERYONE hadn't been there to witness the once-in-a-lifetime event(Spoiler End). One of his ""beans"" was shown to the audience and it looked really gross but mostly, PAINFUL. The song ""There's something about Mary"" used in this film is stuck in my head for it's memorable lyrics and the deep voice by the guy who sang it, Jonathan Richman. The beat that goes along with it is catchy and enjoyable. Ben stiller who plays the unlucky Ted has, in this film, comedy written all over him. He plays his role well and the shift from a high school student to a grown up man is really obvious and greatly done. The make up artists have really done a good job of making an ugly Ted into a ""handsome"" one. Matt Dillon is, what I found in this film, very annoying and hateable and that is a good thing. I think that the director wanted him to be exactly that and Matt Dillon has hit that right on the mark but, of course, that doesn't change the way I fell about him in this movie. His character Pat Healy is very sneaky and manipulative but ""weird"" is the word to describe him. (Minor Spoiler) Which sick man will change his ugly teeth to more uglier ones just to impress the girl he wants to be(Spoiler End). Cameron Diaz on the other hand is more about looks than professionalism. I found her character Mary to be very smart, can't say that in real life though, and attractive, and that is why both of them are after her. Pat Healy describes her as: ""Husband... negative. Children and a Labrador... negative. Tight little package... affirmative."" To put it straight I wasn't too happy with Diaz.Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) was last seen hanging out with a bunch of unattractive guys until he met Mary (Cameron Diaz). Their prom night was gone terribly wrong and his disaster resulted him landing in the hospital. Now, he still can't stop thinking about Mary. He hires a private investigator who goes by the name Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to tail Mary and her retarded brother, Warren. As soon as Pat sets his eyes on Mary, he wants her. He lies to Ted about her being fat and stuck in a wheelchair so he can capture her. He uses his gadgets to eavesdrop on Mary to find out her likes and interests but mostly the man of her dreams. Everything is going great until Ted finds out he is being lied to by a friend, Dom (Chris Elliot), who knows more about Mary than he is letting on. The race begins on who will steal Mary's heart.My favorite bits were: the beginning in the bathroom and when Mary uses Ted's gel on hair, but is it actually gel? The worst bit was everything that contained Pat Healy and his annoying personality. The ending is probably one of the silliest endings in a long time. Of course, I won't spoil it for you but the ending nearly ruined the film, nearly..... The film involves homosexuals, psychopaths, balls, a*s, and a whole load of silliness. Be prepared to check your mood as soon as you start watching this. It is highly recommended for comedy fans because it does not disappoint and the plot for this film will keep viewers entertained. If not, forget that you ever read this review. There's something about Mary........ 7.2/10""His friends would say stop whining, they've had enough of that. / His friends would say stop pining, there's other girls to look at. / They've tried to set him up with Tiffany and Indigo, / But there's something about Mary that they don't know. / Mary, there's just something about Mary.""

The fact that so many people found this funny goes to show you how thoughtless and pathetic the general public's taste in comedy really is. Most of the comedy was simply dumb: the fish hook in the face, restarting the dogs heart, ... all thoughtless and stupid.In fact, much of the comedy was so brainless that it sunk to the levels of Australia's Funniest Home Videos (actually, that's not a fair comparison because I've actually got a few genuine laughs from Australia's Funniest Home Videos). Comedy succeeds when it is creative.... and there is nothing particularly creative about a scene where a guy getting his genitals caught in his zipper. The script-writers must have spent days thinking up that one! And on that topic, let me add that the crudeness in this film simply did not work, mostly because it was also uncreative, yet relied upon (by the film-makers) to produce memorable side-splitting scenes. And this film was a spectacular failure in this regard. The jizz hanging off the ear and the genitals in the zipper made it feel as though the film-makers were trying to ""shock"" me into laughing rather than giving me something genuinely funny to laugh at. It didn't work for me. Films like Team America:World Police managed to use crudeness incredibly well because it is original, unexpected, but runs well in the background of an excellent and intelligent satire. It isn't the centerpiece of the film's comedy. However, in There's Something About Mary, I felt that the shocking crudeness took center stage. But since the acting and dialog didn't give me any genuine laughs, what's the difference?There's something about mary is a simply a cheap and worthless attempt hyping a nothing story with profanity and unfunny 'shock-the-audience-into-laughing' scenes.

142,MovieLuvaMatt,A fun movie with some genuinely funny moments,7,18 August 2003,"Though I wouldn't put ""There's Something About Mary"" on the AFI list of best comedies of all time, it does have some genuinely funny moments.  Basically, the film is uneven and dull in spots, but if often works.  And when it delivers, it delivers with a bang.  I still wish I could find the zipper scene as incredibly funny as everyone else, but being a guy the gag is just too painful to be funny.  The gag is directed very well by the Farrellys, with some funny moments where unexpected strangers barge in on Stiller during the unfortunate accident, but the overall scene had me groaning more than laughing.  It's funny how if you showed a guy getting his hand sawed off with a chainsaw, I probably wouldn't cringe, but I cannot watch a guy getting his genitals stuck in his zipper.  So for all you women reading this, yes it's that painful!  However, the hair gel scene is classic.  Ben Stiller is great in the lead, but Matt Dillon made me laugh the most as his sleazy character, and his performance is really underrated.  There's one scene where Mary giggles with her friends after she says, ""I have a vibrator.""  Matt laughs along, sitting one table away.  Then the girls get silent and looks towards Matt, and he goes completely silent.  His reaction during that moment always cracks me up.  And of course, the scenes with the dog are really funny as well.  Cameron Diaz is perfectly cast as the beautiful, yet sweet and friendly, Mary.  Lee Evans as Mary's architect friend also gives an underrated performance.  If you watch the movie, you'll see why.  Chris Elliott is a hit-or-miss comic actor.  I've seen much more obnoxious comics than him, yet his schtick doesn't always pan out.  I certainly could've done without him in this movie, and the joke about the ""love blisters"" was just plain disgusting.  The Farrellys are great at what they do, but comedy's a subjective process and though I may feel they go overboard with certain gags, other people may have different opinions.

At this point the only debate about this movie is where on the all time funny list does it belong. It's easily a top 10 and potentially a top 5. On my list it's a top 5.",There's Something About Mary
148,hhfarm-1,Something really stinks about this movie,1,12 February 2007,"Someone lent this to me and I watched it before I researched it. Big mistake.The Farrellys are the worst of the worst. Their ""comedies"" are dumbed down in the tradition of Blake Edwards, Mel Brooks (but without any of Brooks' redeeming flashes of brilliance) or the Marx Brothers. It's every bit as bad as the 3 Stooges or Jim Carrey. So, yes, if you like that kind of thing you'll love ""....Mary"".Watching this was like watching some old-time comedy that my grandmother cackled through ""Oh, he tripped and his head went into the cow's you-know-what.""; continuity is wasted on an audience as stupid as we are; each small joke is repeated and magnified so many times that even folks not watching the movie will get it; the lines are crass, stupid and ill-timed; the soundtrack miserable; the acting pathetic - which is OK for Diaz and Stiller but Dillon can do much better.The plot is that Stiller's character has a prom date with Diaz's character. He gets his dick caught in his zipper; her parents, some cops, the rescue squad, a neighbor, .... et al see it and laugh. Then we see some close-ups of flesh caught in a zipper, just so we really get it. The Farrellys are the loud jocks who love practical jokes like nudging you at the urinal and telling you that they spit on your sandwich.Years later Stiller hires Dillon's character (a private detective) to find Mary. He does, but then tries to keep her for himself. This is handled with gross and clumsy lines - she's a fat pig on welfare with multiple kids. This could have evolved into a good story but it would be too subtle so they introduce more and more suitors until a small crowd - all professing love - have it out in the dénouement.Diaz is all about her winning smile and great body. Yes, yes, she's a babe. But she has two facial expression (glee & more glee) and really does nothing else. There are many actresses with equivalent looks and talent to match who take difficult roles. Diaz just wanders and giggles her way through.I thought ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"" were abysmal. This was worse.",There's Something About Mary

153,cleary-joshua,I feel no sudden urge now to watch any other Farrelly brothers films...,6,3 July 2013,"I confess that before I watched this, I had not seen any Farrelly brothers films. Not Dumb and Dumber, not Shallow Hal. Nothing. And now that I have witnessed ""There's Something about Mary"", I feel no sudden urge to watch any of their other films. I found it frequently disgusting in its source of humour and a bit too over-the-top. Now, you may accuse me of being a film snob, but I didn't dislike it because I only like black and white or foreign films. I don't. I disliked it because its sense of humour was very different to mine, and I have a very broad sense of humour. This would only be a hilarious movie if you find a continual onslaught of rude and disgusting jokes funny. If, after two whole hours, you still find a perverted man with ever- increasing hives funny, this is definitely the film for you. Unfortunately, I don't.And that's another point. This movie, 119 minutes in length, is far too long for the genre of comedy that it's in. There are only so many gross-out jokes you can make, and after about 90 minutes, it all feels a bit monotonous. So, among all of these negative comments, what saves this film from being completely terrible and unfunny? The answer to that is Ben Stiller. Since this film, he has gone on to star in gems like ""Dodgeball"" and especially ""Meet the Parents"". In ""There's Something about Mary"" we see the foundations to the socially-awkward character which he perfected over the years. He makes a fantastic love-struck teenager, and later on, a great awkward adult. He delivers a lot of his lines in a hilarious way, and he makes most of his scenes completely watchable, unlike many other characters that just make you a bit uncomfortable.There were definitely some jokes that I did like. The entrance of the shrink at the end of the session is really funny, as is the murder of the ever-present guitar player, whose death is very welcome by the end. The overlying sentiment of the film also has some part in its saving, and we do see the true love that exists between Mary and Ted, despite all of the characters around them vying for her love.Overall, it is an unintelligent and often unwatchable farce, but it does have occasional fine moments, which save it from being completely terrible.",There's Something About Mary

157,Tetsel,Geoffrey Rush holds the key...,3,31 May 1999,"After seeing this movie, and wondering for months upon months HOW people thought it was so funny, I finally got the answer. Geoffrey Rush, in the masterpiece Shakespeare In Love, explains that, for the inferior, banal common man, there needs to be ""a bit with a dog"". Aha! I thought to myself. There it is! The bit with the dog was the answer. And then I realized that there was more to it. Much like TV laugh- tracks, this type of movie is a conditioned type of humor. Everyone has seen the same trailers, over and over and over again. So, at the theater, they know when to laugh. There are enough of these conditioned scenes to run the laughter over into the scenes that have not been seen. By the middle of the movie, everyone is laughing. Since most people like to be part of a group, they figure they should be laughing as well. From conditioned trailers to the end, it seems that it is a very funny movie. I realize that this is not a conscious endeavor by the viewers : if it was, it wouldn't work. So if you found it funny, I understand that you will not believe me. But aren't you happy now that you can feel like you're part of this group, this little bit of community fun? I'm sure you do. It's your movie now, so you know whenever you want to laugh, you can rent it and be qued to laugh. Very convenient. Just for my sake : please don't laugh too many more times at the dog.

161,DJ_Shilo,Franks and Beans,10,2 May 2020,"I laughed my head off, and this is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. ""There's Something About Mary"" at its core is an exercise in being politically incorrect and skates a fine line on bad taste but with a direction as opposed to being outrageous for no reason. Cameron Diaz is a peach as the loveable Mary, but it's the rest of the idiots trying to get to her that drive the plot. Okay, all but one idiot. He's just a love-struck dummy.It's about Ted Stroehman (Ben Stiller), who is bedazzled by a loveable girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), in high school. After an unfortunate accident happens and he can't take Mary to the prom, years go by, and he still yearns for her. Wondering if he can reignite the spark they briefly had, he hires a private investigator, Pat Healey (Matt Dillion), to track her down. Ted quickly realizes that everyone who sets their sights on the dazzling Mary falls head over heels for her. With a slew of idiots after her, Ted tries to rekindle his romance with Mary and win her heart.Cameron Diaz lights up the screen in what I believe will be her signature role as she brings the heart and charm to the movie. Mary is a beauty with a sunny smile, and she lights up the dreams of geeky Ted in high school when he rescues her retarded brother, Warren (W. Earl Brown) from being attacked by a jerk off that Ted's idiot friends set up and she asks him to go to the prom. Mary is not the typical blondie dummy who always chooses the jacked-up jock with an arrogant attitude, and that's what makes her smart and loveable. Ted goes to pick her up, and it leads to the film's wildest scene involving a zipper. Aside from a close-up, I won't spoil it, but the scene with have you howling with laughter, and it leads to a funny moment with Warren nicknaming him ""Franks and Beans"" and yelling ""He was masturbating"" to the whole neighbourhood. I couldn't handle myself laughing, and if you don't think funny, this is not the movie for you.Thirteen years go by, and Ted is still in love with Mary, so he hires the biggest sleazeball ever seen, and he is Pat Healey, who has the looks that would make any woman want to run and the smile that says it all. When we first see him in his office, he looks like a weasel with his pants unbuttoned when he goes to stand up from his chair. Pat finds Mary living a peachy life in Miami, and she is still a gorgeous babe who is single, and Pat decides he wants her, so he tells Ted that she is 250 pounds, has four kids and has been shipped to Japan as a mail-order bride. Healey begins eavesdropping on Mary's conversations so he will know to say the right things because he is an idiot otherwise, and this is where most of the movie gets its humour. When Healy meets her a golf range, he pretends to be the man of her dreams until he discovers that another idiot is after Mary posing as an architect that uses crutches.Ted gets wind that Healy set him up, and he wants Mary, so he heads down to Miami to rekindle their romance and push Healey to the side. The only problem is, she doesn't know he hired Healey to spy on her. The comic genius behind the writing is what makes the characters a class act for stupidity, and they are so dumb, but you can't help but laugh at their failed attempts to woo Mary. One screw the other over, and then someone else screws that one over. One of the funnier moments is when Mary ends up getting falsely told that Healey is a murderer by someone, and oh boy, does he ever get his ass kicked for that one. You can't help but laugh at it all. When you see all these characters chasing after Mary and the lengths they go to are unbelievable funny.Ted also has another friend named Dom (Chris Elliott) who gives Ted advice that leads to the film's most comical gag. I won't spoil it, but it involves Mary's hair. Lin Shaye plays Mary's suntanned friend who looks toasted. Into the third act, the film gets by on gags, one involving speed because of two idiots. I wasn't expecting much of an ending, but I was surprised. They attempt a twist with one of the characters, which was also a surprise, and I figured the laughs were done but no. When everyone is in Mary's apartment, and she sees all the dummies that were after her, Pat attempts to woo her with his goofy smile, and she looks at him and says,"" Are you crazy? You're a murderer."" And the look on Matt Dillion's face made me howl when he looks at the character that set him up with ass-kicking intent.After all the comedies that have failed to generate genuine laughs, this movie is a winner with a crazy but sweet ending that will leave you smiling. It's more than just the humour to the film, even if it's about a bunch of morons trying to manipulate a woman they all want, but you can look at these characters and see the stupid but harmless nature of them, and that's what makes them funny and likeable. The film may be a bit crazy, but it has its heart in the right place and is a must-see this summer. This movie is going to be one of my favourite films for many years to come.",There's Something About Mary

168,EThompsonUMD,great screwball romantic comedy,9,4 February 2003,"Not having seen ""There's Something About Mary"" since its theatrical release, I sat down to watch the DVD version fearing that, as often happens in the second viewing of romantic/screwball comedies, it would not be as funny as I remembered and that I would be sadly disappointed. Happily, it was, and I wasn't. Although it lacks the satirical bite and philosophical reach of ""Harold and Maude,"" the cult '70s romantic comedy to which ""There's Something About Mary"" traces its roots and pays repeated homage, this Farrelly brothers effort shares the earlier film's genre-bending spirit, shockingly iconoclastic images, and sharply written dialog - not to mention its sidesplitting hilarity.At least a half dozen scenes in ""There's Something About Mary"" still rank among the funniest I've ever encountered on film and set me off once again into uncontrollable laugh convulsions, even minus the stimulus of a roaring theater audience around me. The list must naturally begin with the prom night ""frank and beans"" in the zipper scene. Even more than the outrageousness of the central physical source of humor, what makes the scene work so spectacularly well is its pacing and the facial reactions of the various characters who enter the bathroom to observe Ted's embarrassed agony. One thing I had forgotten about the scene (or didn't notice the first time around) was how much it owes to the classic Marx Brothers' ""stateroom scene"" in ""A Night at the Opera."" In fact, I was rather surprised while listening to the Farrelly brothers' alternate soundtrack commentary that they did not mention a Marx Brothers influence either specifically on this scene or on their brand of comedy in general.The film's other humorous high-points (if that's the right word), certainly include the three dog sequences (Puffy in a sedative coma/Puffy on speed/Puffy in a body cast), the hitchhiker sequence and its follow-up interrogation at police headquarters, the infamous hair gel scene, and old flame Woogie's sexual assault on Mary's closet. That these are not the sorts of subjects we feel entirely comfortable having jokes based on is precisely what makes them work so well - when they work for us at all that is. Operating on the edges of moral and social taboo the Farrelly brothers deliberately risk offense and invite charges of bad taste. Not surprisingly, therefore, almost everyone will respond to some attempts at humor in ""There's Something About Mary"" with more discomfort than elation. In addition, some comic bits in the film don't work simply because they were ill conceived or poorly acted, the leaden entry and presence of Brett Favre in the film's final scene being one such instance in my view and the whole ""pizza delivery boy"" character being another.For the most part, though, things click together in ""There's Something About Mary"" with a magical charm that few American screwball comedies have ever achieved. Much of the credit for that success must be attributed not only to the clever script but to the wonderful casting/acting of Ben Stiller as the lovable schlemiel Ted Stroehmann, Cameron Diaz as the luminous dream girl Mary, and Matt Dillon as the goofy gumshoe and romantic rival Pat Healy. Chris Elliott as the stressed out fetishist/stalker Woogie and Lin Shave as Mary's Maude-like neighbor Magda also add greatly to the film's comic chemistry - as does the film's musical score, which cleverly uses the Mel Brooks device of giving ""background"" musicians an on screen presence and concludes with a full cast encore lip-syncing to ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" as the end credits roll and outtakes flash by. A unique comic gem.",There's Something About Mary

171,DaRick89,There's Something About Mary and there's also something about this movie that makes me like it more than most other gross-out comedies,8,15 February 2006,"There's Something About Mary is an apt title, for there is something about this movie that is quite endearing, particularly if you are a gross-out fan. Even if you are not a real fan of gross-outs, as is the case with me, you can still enjoy this film. This is because I find it to be funnier and more enjoyable than most other gross-out comedies (and that includes Team America). As a romantic comedy, it is also enjoyable and that is saying something as romantic comedy is, to me, a bastardised version of real comedy, often with a weak romance and diluted laughs. This is certainly not the case here. Having said that, it is not perfect: The Farrelly Brothers use a retard for cheap laughs once too often, which I did not like, the disabled guy wasn't that funny and the plot is a bit clichéd and predictable, but I expected that. The story is about a man named Ted, who we see meet a beautiful girl, Mary, during his teenage years. However, their budding romance falls away when Ted gets his dick caught in his zipper. By the way, this scene is absolutely hilarious and so is the aftermath, after the police officer tells him to 'pull it out'; next minute, he is being carted off in an ambulance, never to see Mary again...or so we think for a minute.Until of course, he finds himself fantasising about Mary years later. He hires a private investigator, Pat Healy, to do some snooping on her. This takes a turn for the worse, as the investigator falls in love with Mary and lies to Ted. Ted finds out about his deceiving ways, thanks to Woogy and goes to see Mary himself.This movie is hilarious at times, funny at others; occasionally, it falls flat. There are too many hilarious and funny scenes to mention here, so I'll mention the best ones: the 'dick zipper' one, the 'fishing line' one and the one where the retard goes psycho and hits Pat Healy in the face. To be impartial, I will say that I have already mentioned some of the imperfect bits above. The acting is quite good too. Ben Stiller does a good job as the nervy, fantasising, sensible Ted, while Matt Dillon is good as the 'sleazy investigator'. Cameron Diaz, in the days when she was still hot, is OK, but not much more than your typical love interest. The rest of the cast is nothing more than OK, including W. Earl Brown, the guy who plays the retard (as anyone could play his role).I'll finish by saying that this is one of the best gross-out/romantic comedies I've ever seen and is definitely worth a Friday night or a DVD rental.

Full of abysmally tacky, low-brow frat boy humour, it's just a baaad joyless stretched out ride, one drawn out yawn trying so very hard to take itself seriously.

The very believable story of your everyday Joe, who is in love with an extraordinary girl. However, he has some stiff competition if he is going to win her heart. A story most can relate with and find some personal truth within. Full of wacky interesting characters and hilarious happenings, I saw this one in the theater three times and laughed myself silly each time I saw it.
Excellent, excellent casting! Matt Dillion, Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller, Keith David, of course the great Chris Elliot, and everyone else are all perfect in their roles. Excellent direction by the Farrelly brothers and perfect comedic timing by the actors brings a great script to life. Truly a comedic gem! FINAL RATING: 9/10. About as funny as movies get. Highly recommended!

181,eternalsea,Average comedy,7,14 April 2006,"Gross out comedy is fast becoming one of Hollywoods biggest industrys. The American Pie films, South Park bigger Longer and Uncut and numerous Adam Sandler movies are among the biggest grossers and in 1998 There's Something about Mary became one of the genres biggest hits. The film opened to generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, as years went by the films popularity grew and since then by many has been regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. I don't share that opinion. The story is simple, a guy gets asked to the prom by a girl(called Mary) he fancys only for a rather unfortunate incident to occur which prevents him from saying goodbye to her as she moves to Miami shortly afterword. Years later and now a man he realises he is still in love with Mary and hires a sleazy private investigator to find her. However he to falls in love with her and soon becomes clear There's Something about Mary..... The film doesn't contain many subtle jokes, but as the genre suggests it shouldn't specilize in them so it would be unfair to complain about that. However the abundance of Toilet humour and sex related jokes does become waring after about an hour and half of the gags fall right on their face, in saying that there are some inspired moments but to few to warrent the praise the film has received. The performances have a certain charm but Stiller and Diaz in the leads aren't really convincing enough, you could argue Dillions Sleazy detective is the only person who raises an above average laugh count but there's no arguing about the fact he carries the movie at times. The film does have entertainment value and some ideas are good, but are rarely carried of to full potential. In the end There may be something special about Mary, but there's nothing special about this movie.",There's Something About Mary
182,jaysilentbob37,One of the funniest movies of the 90's.,7,21 December 2005,"I desperately wish that the Farelly brothers would go back to doing gross-out comedies like they did with Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Me, Myself, and Irene, and this. This is by far the best of all their movies. There are three kinds of comedy. Comedies that make you smile (Sixteen Candles), comedies that make you laugh (Airplane), and comedies that cause you to nearly asphyxiate yourself from laughing so hard. This is one of those rare third category movies. With the friends I watched it with, the laughs sounded like nuclear bombs going off in my room. It's that funny.Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) landed a prom date with the most popular and beautiful girl in school, Mary (Cameron Diaz). Unfortunately, the date wasn't meant to be, for Ted has his manhood damaged right in front of Mary, and ends up in the hospital instead of the prom.Thirteen years later, Ted decides to track Mary down, and have a second chance with his dream girl. He hires sleazy private eye, Pat (Matt Dillon)to find her for him. Pat finds her, and she's grown up beautiful. Pat decides he wants to date her. He stalks her, finds out everything she wants in a man, and poses as just that. Meanwhile, Ted has been led to believe that Mary has become fat white trash in a wheelchair. Pat and Mary start dating.Well, by the end of the movie, every man who is involved in the story has tried to make a move on Mary. We all know how it ends, but it's one funny ride. One thing about this movie that's commendable is how the mentally retarded character is treated. He is treated in a way that isn't rude, or offensive. Mary sticks up for him, and he's really innocent. The funniest gag in the movie involves a NEW brand of HAIR GEL (compliments of Ted, and tested by Mary). I won't tell you what's really being mistaken for hair gel, but when you find out, you'll laugh so hard, you gag. This movie knows what a comedy of this type should be like. Each gag goes somewhere, and is really big. They're usually extended scenes with punchlines. Me, Myself, and Irene goes for the cheapest laughs you can find, but There's Something About Mary takes it's time, carefully planning each gag, in order to make it gut-bustingly hilarious. That's just what this movie is. 10/10.It is rated R for Strong Comic Sexual Content, and Language. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 3/10 Swearing: 9/10 Drugs: 2/10",There's Something About Mary

For instance, when he's being fired from his boss, instead of saying the ""F"" word, he looks at his boss and says, ""Shame on you."" Now that's creatively funny! This film, otherwise, was very fun to watch. Having Brett Favre in the film was a bit much, but it was basically worth a movie-watcher's time. Ben Stiller, as usual, was a hit, but Matt Dillon proves to us once again that he can play any role. Good job, Matt.

It's not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting.  There's a nice love story in here too.

I have never heard an audience have such a reaction to a film.  The movie was so hysterically funny, people were screaming, rolling in their seats, especially for the first 20 mins of the film (which features the infamous ""frank and beans"" shot).  The true test of this film was could it sustain the initial laughs throughout the movie and the answer is a definite yes.

190,the-jerk,They ALL know.,10,9 June 2005,"""There's Something About Mary"" was the movie that broke the Farrelly Brothers, when they went from doing merely stupid gross-out movies (not that there's anything wrong with that) to intelligent, well-written gross-out movies. It was also a huge blockbuster that helped cement the careers of its two leads. It stars Ben Stiller as the everyman who's in love with Cameron Diaz as Mary, the perfect woman.Mary represents that girl that every guy wishes he was with. The title song sung by Jonathan Richman (playing a part that recalls Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole from ""Cat Ballou"") says that ""there's something about Mary that they don't know"", implying that there's something about this girl that one guy sees but nobody else does; of course we realize by the end that that's not true, that EVERYBODY knows, whether they realize what it is about her that they are so in love with or not. Cameron Diaz plays the part perfectly. She's this perfect fox with a great personality and sunny disposition that it's easy to see any guy falling in love with.Ben Stiller is Ted, who had an opportunity to be with Mary in high school, but screwed it up by getting his genitals stuck in his zipper in her bathroom on prom night. It's a mistake that he curses for the rest of his life, so he hires Pat Healy (played to snake-oil perfection by Matt Dillon; he was really at his best here) to go to Florida where she lives and spy on her. But Healy falls in love with her too. We find that this is an endlessly repeating theme; guys just fall in love with Mary. So Healy cons Mary into thinking he's the perfect man, while telling Ted that she's a cow who's not even worth looking up. But there's more competition waiting in the wings, including an old boyfriend named Brett.Matt Dillon is at his best here. Ben Stiller is funny too, showing a real talent playing an average guy who keeps having bad luck dumped on him; it's similar to the type of part he would play later in ""Meet the Parents"". When Ted finds out that Healy was lying, he goes down to Florida to seek out Mary. But on the way he's arrested for soliciting gay sex at a rest stop, and subsequently charged with the murder committed by the hitchhiker he picked up (played by Harland Williams from ""Half-Baked""), who carries the body in a large canvas bag into Ted's car, and has dreams of striking it rich by releasing a video called ""7-Minute Abs"", meant to take business away from the ""8-Minute Abs"" people. Bad break piles on top of bad break, and you can't help but feel sorry for the guy, even as you're laughing at the outlandish and terrible things that are happening to him.This movie is a riot from start to finish. The whole cast is superb, including the smaller supporting roles (including Markie Post and Keith David as Mary's parents, Lin Shaye as Magda (she also played a supremely disgusting woman in ""Kingpin""), Khandi Alexander from ""Newsradio"" and Sarah Silverman from ""Mr. Show"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" as Mary's friends, Chris Elliot as Ted's buddy Dom/Mary's old boyfriend Woogie, Lee Evans as Tucker/Norm, another con artist out to get Mary, and Willie Garson as one of Ted's old high school friends). And the dog is hilarious too; he actually gets two of the most memorable scenes in the movie. In the end, despite all the competition, despite the appearance (orchestrated by Ted himself, because he just wants Mary to be happy) of Brett Favre, and despite the fact that he was basically stalking her, it's Ted who gets Mary. So every man wants the perfect woman, but it's the everyman himself who gets her. It's a great ending to a great movie, almost sappy but funny enough to get away with it, much like the rest of the movie.",There's Something About Mary

Having seen it, though, I have to say that there really is something about ""There's Something About Mary.""  There were a few scenes that I think went a bit too far in the gross-out department (no need, really, for the close-up in the penis-stuck-in-the-zipper scene, or for the fish-hook through the lip; I also thought the masturbation/semen-as-hair-gel thing was superfluous and not all that funny).  However, there was a lot more to this movie than gross-out jokes.  I thought much of the dialogue was actually quite smart, and the wacky humor was deliciously unpredictable -- for instance, the episode where Pat, the sleazy detective played by Matt Dillon, gives Ted (Ben Stiller) the false report on Mary in order to get Ted to lose interest in getting together with her; the hitchhiker with the ""six-minute abs"" pitch; Pat telling Mary he loves ""working with retards""; the cell-phone conversation Pat intends for Mary to overhear.  The scenes with Puffy the dog were hilarious too, and I usually CRINGE at any suggestion of cruelty to animals!  I rather liked the plot twists, especially the one involving Mary's friend Tucker (brilliantly played by the British comedian Lee Evans). And guess what, I thought there was something very sweet about the romance in ""Mary.""  Ben Stiller creates a believable and (despite his many faults) ultimately sympathetic character.  And as Mary, Cameron Diaz projects an irresistible mix of naivete, good-heartedness, and spirit.  So what if it's not very plausible that she would be a successful surgeon?  This is an eccentric comedy, not a serious drama.  (To me, Cameron Diaz as a surgeon is much more plausible than Julia Roberts as a hooker.)

In lesser hands, this material might have become consigned to the bin where all tasteless, stupid and sophomoric films lie; it is tasteless, stupid and sophomoric... and pure genius.When you look at comedy classics like ""Some Like it Hot"" or ""It Happened One Night"", the material is less funny to the modern film-goer, but they remain funny because the interplay between characters and the editing are rock solid.

Most of the scenes are crazy funny. For example, we learn that when Magda's dog meets Mary's date for the first time they know he is a bad guy if the dog reacts negatively to him. So to get the dog in a crazy mood Matt Dillon (Pat Healy) and Lee Evans (Tucker) toss some dog treats laced with speed through the window and Magda and her dog ingest the speed. When Mary brings Ted over to her home for the first time, Magda is vacuuming like crazy and even lifts the couch with one hand. You can here the dog growling from the bathroom.

There first two movies, Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, were among the most sophmoric, tasteless, movies I have ever seen.  There were also two of the funniest.  What made those movies so delightful was the absolute effort that was made to get us to laugh.  As Mel Brooks has said about his movies, they ""rise below vulgarity.""As funny as those two movies are, the Farrelly brothers have clearly stepped it up a notch with this film, which is most likely not the funniest film of all time, but definitely merits consideration.  The film begins in the wonderful state of Rhode Island, and after a very inside joke about ""Borrington,"" shows the first meeting between Ted (Ben Stiller) and Mary (Cameron Diaz).  From the first meeting, that involves Mary's mentally challenged brother, we get the sense that sensitivity isn't a high value in this movie, and that laughter is.Describing the rest of the plot is mostly pointless, although it does contain several delightful twists.  The movie does not rely on its plot, but relies on a combination of high slapstick comedy and the ability to exploit the worst, darkest part of human nature, especially as contrasted to the unbelievably sweet and wholesome Mary.These two elements as well as one incredibly funny misunderstanding (about serial killing of all things), have made this movie a true delight, and a purely fun ride into raunchy fantasy.  Not that you don't need a thick skin to view this film.  It pokes fun at a variety of sources, most disturbingly at people with mental retardation.  However, it is clear the film revels much more in the stupidity of those people who tend to exploit people with mental retardation.The film also contains the wonderful and humorous presence of one of the great rock n' roll musicians of all time, Jonathan Richman, who is all ham in this one.

209,azaro666,A love it or hate it movie........,7,28 January 2000,"Thats the way the world is unfortunately. There are two types of people those who love movies like this beacuse they are very funny and those who don't because they have a manner which means they have to look for problems wherever they look (Read politicians, minority groups). There really is no need to go and see a movie like this if you want to come out and complain. You've seen their previous movies, don't buy a ticket. The deal with the Farrellys is that they understand that if something is funny then it should be laughed at. Someone falls over, laugh. Don't go and help him up. Mary has the ability to make the viewer laugh. More than once and more frequently than not. In my opinion that makes a comedy a good comedy. I truly believe that you stick any old actors into brilliant material and situations as are in mary then you will laugh. That being said though the ensemble really do pull together and play off each other to startling effect and even the Farrelly regulars have some great moments. Lee Evans in particular has broken America and looks to have a bright future ahead of him in film. Stiller is Stellar and Diaz a bombshell once more.

I've seen a lot of BAD comedies; I dare say that a majority of movies that strive for that genre marginally produce laughter from me. There's nothing worse than a contrived comedy scene that fails to make you laugh.But, considering all of this movie's contrived scenes, I can't imagine for a second that anyone would think this comedy to be over the top or gratuitous in any way. The bawdy and prurient scenes certainly push the envelope of what we're used to in any movie, but they're all logical conclusions to the comedy sequences in which they belong. And boy, they made me laugh to the point of embarrassment since I'm so not used to laughing so hard.I also have a problem with the word ""offensive,"" because just about anything put into a context in which it doesn't belong can be deemed ""offensive."" Even a Cross. Or an American flag.Now, I thought Dumb and Dumber was horrible and contrived. Kingpin was great, but was less of a comedy than it was a cult-ish romp of fun.

The story is simple: Ted Stromen (Ben Stiller) is a High School geek who has a crush on the prettiest girl in school Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) although she has a mentally challenged brother named Warren (W Earl Brown) who sometimes gets Ted into some embarrassing situations. Ted decides to ask Mary to the Prom and on Prom night, a disaster happens that keeps Ted and Mary from dancing all through the night. Flash forward 13 years and Ted is a wreck after the date never happened. So Ted hires a sleazy private Dick Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to spy on Mary, to see how she is doing. But, after getting one glimpse of Mary, he lies to Ted and moves to get closer to Mary. This is one of those tasteless comedies that no one would have thought would work but it did and became an instant cult classic and boosted The Farrelley Brothers up to the status as the kings of comedy gross out movies. Some side characters are Tucker (Lee Evans), a friend of Mary's and Dom (Chris Elliot) an ex boyfriend of Mary's.

I mean how can they not? The Farrley Brothers have insulted pretty much everyone in this film, and I knew that this was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. From gender to race, gays to bi's, rich to poor, old to young, handicapped to retarded. No one is spared. No one is safe from being utterly offended. However in despite of the amazingly crude humour against the people of society, ""There's Something About Mary"" is inescapably, and undeniably, an incredibly funny film that can not passed from anyone belonging to any of the listed categories of people.It's a classic in comedy that definitely deserves the reputation of being one of the most outrageous pieces of image moving entertainment ever. While it tells a very obvious story, the hard hitting comedy never fails to amuse audiences. Ted (Ben Stiller) scores a prom date with the most beautiful girl in school, Mary, played by the luscious Cameron Diaz. But due to a painfully unfortunate event and a very public rush to the hospital, the date had to be postponed, after which the lovable Mary moved away, out of Ted's life. Thirteen years later, Ted is still fixed on Mary's memory and hires a private investigator to look her up. But when the sleazy P.I ends up falling in love with Mary also, an endless love fest of pathetic men competing for Mary's heart takes place, and it's not pretty.The plot twists in this movie are just as funny and entertaining as the insulting cultural referencing. However it's not as good as Cameron Diaz's wonderful performance. I've always been a sucker for the adorably humorous and stunningly beautiful Cameron Diaz. I'll admit that the only reason I considered watching this movie in the first place was for her irresistible charm. In fact, I'm pretty sure, that without Ms Diaz to play the role of Mary, this movie wouldn't have even worked. It goes to show you just how dependent this movie really is. You take away Cameron, and you take away the movie.But I'm not going to be one-sighted. There are many more things to be loved in this movie besides Ms Diaz. Like for example the ridiculously funny and disturbing bathroom scene, you know which one I'm talking about, the unfortunate event that took place just before prom night thirteen years ago. While it may have put some people off, that was one of the most painfully hilarious moments in film ever, and that's not just my opinion. I remember reading an article about the top ten bathroom scenes, and as I recall, that was definitely one of the top 3, along side the scene in ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock.""There's Something about Mary"" is not for everyone, which is understandable, but it's also very sad, because this is one of the funniest movies ever made. Too miss it, would be to miss out on one the most enjoyable experiences in comedy film. Cameron Diaz is at her most charming, and the Farrley Brother's are at their most funniest.

This is not nearly as good a film as the critics would have you believe. The styles that make up this film (gross out comedy and romantic fluff) really do not work together. The result is a film that, like some of the characters, is schizophrenic. However, there are many good points to be going on with.In many places the film is very, very, funny. The infamous `trapped in trouser-fly' scene is cleverly put together, and the whole 1985 prologue is extremely well thought-out. Keith David walks away with the acting honours for the whole movie as Mary's black step-father, who also gets the best line: `Don't make me open a can of Whoop-ass now!'. Bad taste proliferates here like fungus in a petri dish. A dog is poisoned, resuscitated with an electric cord, set on fire and fed Speed, there is some terrifying nudity, and the hair-gel sequence has already passed into American movie folklore. Do not watch this film if you are easily offended. The performances are not bad in general, but there is something lacking. Ben Stiller gets surprisingly little to do, and Lee Evans' American accent is very bad for such a talented comedian. On the other hand, Diaz is surprisingly good, making the best of a badly written character.The Farellys seem to think that they can handle the gentler sections, but the opposite is unfortunately the case. They are incapable of the softer scenes between Stiller and Diaz, and constantly inject humour into all the wrong places. On the whole the film is quirky, with popular folk singer Jonathan Richman narrating through song and getting shot at the end. If you don't expect too much from this then you will enjoy yourself, particularly if you see it with friends as I did.

I'm not even opposed to comedy in bad taste -- I thought ""Eating Raul"" was terrific.No, this film just had few redeeming characteristics.All the characters in this film, with the exception of Mary herself, are hateful, deceitful, pathetic monsters.

One is ""the watch-meter"", which is simply this:  how many times did I look at my watch during the movie?  In this case, I lost count.The other is a simple yes or no question:  given the choice between sitting in this theater and watching this movie for two hours, or sitting in this theater and staring at a blank movie screen for two hours, which would I choose?In this case, ""Something About Mary"" won out ... but *just barely*.

Now, when he gets to her house, he gets his, um, member stuck in his zipper (for all you men who see it, you'll wonder how he did it, I know I did), after that, the date is ruined when he gets it out, and is a bleeder, so he needs to go to the hospital, needless to say, the date is over.  Then, 13 years later, he wants to find Mary again, so his friend (Chris Elliot) to hire one of his friends, named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find Mary, he falls for her, tells her she is unattractive, in the hopes that he gives up, but yet, he doesn't. He tracks her down, he falls in love.  And of course, this is a comedy, and a lot of very funny situations.  Although it has some funny situations, there are some long spots where there isn't many laughs, but where the laughs come, they come hard.  Such as the dog on speed.  Now, this is one helluva funny movie, I left with tears in my eyes, don't leave right away, because, during the first half of the credits there is a funny musical number, of sorts.

252,General Comment,"A very funny movie, with a good heart.",10,3 December 1999,"This is one of my favourite films.Although it is primarily a comedy, the story behind the film is actually very sad. It is the tale of a young student, who falls in love with a pretty girl, but who's chance of wooing her is dashed by a cruel (but very funny) prom night disaster.For the next 13 years, he leads a lonely and empty existence, his life (to all intents and purposes) ruined by the tragic loss of his one true love. And then one day, a chance remark by a friend makes him decide to do something about this...What happens next is a study of the demons that haunt those obsessed by something that seems unobtainable, and the pressures that face those who are the objects of such obsession.The film is also very funny. Some of the comic situations are undeniably basic (some would say juvenile), but they are done so well that I found myself howling with laughter, when more usually I would have turned my nose up (usually I'm not overly fond of adolescent humour).The message that I took away from the film was about perspective. As individuals, we can often lose our perspectives, and this can lead to unbearable emotional suffering. But, if you can act with honour and with dignity, you will eventually be rewarded, one way or another.Some people may be offended by this film , and some may not like it.

Before you start wondering if I am the kind of person who only gets laughs out of Woody Allen, let me tell you that I did laugh with, say, Beavis and Butthead Do America, so gross comedy is not a problem with me. The problem isn't the movie's very low-brow, or its highly-touted political incorrectness (which after all is pretty harmless), the problem is the jokes' timing. Even if you hadn't been told the jokes already, you could see them coming from a mile away, and then they are stretched out beyond breaking point.

Maybe it simply is Mary (Cameron Diaz).I liked this movie at some points, but at other points, I didn't. It was inconsistent with its humor. Sometimes it was very clever and sometimes it was downright raunchy. I really didn't see the need for all the f-bombs or the pointless and gross ""zipper"" camera angle. I think the Farrely brothers took a PG-13 movie and made it R.There were strong points to the movie as well. It was well-acted for the most part. Diaz fit into her role well, and made a realistic character out of Mary. Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller were admirable as well, Chris Elliott was a little weak I thought. Then again, he wasn't dealt a good character to work with.The best humor was the ""misunderstanding"" type, more subtle. Like when the stepdad tells Stiller ""She went to the prom 20 minutes ago with her boyfriend Woogie"" or the whole murder interrogation scene. Very funny. But then, the Farrely brothers come back with some of their stupid humor.Overall, I think what this movie needed was a better, more down-to-earth director.

Prigs need not apply and in fact would be WELL advised to stay well clear of it as they are highly likely to be offended. This is evidenced by a large number of 1 star reviews I see here.

What SOB thought it was a good idea to starve this gorgeous girl for this role? Really. Sometimes I just hate Hollywood for what they do to women.

It has all the right ingredients: absolutely hilarious characters, great writing, wonderful performances from all, and an adorable, wacky love story.Ben Stiller is just precious as a former geek still obsessed with his high school dream girl, Mary. He is so cute, clueless, and just irresistible. Cameron Diaz is extremely likeable too as the levelheaded Mary, probably the only sane character in the whole film.  She and Stiller are so cute that even I, despiser of romantic comedies, cried at parts because the story was just so sweet.Besides the two stars, Chris Elliott, Lee Evans, and Matt Dillon are absolutely hilarious as her three stalkers, especially Elliott, and W. Earl Brown is riotous as Mary's brother Warren. The two funniest performances in the film though would have to go to Harland Williams whose five minutes on screen as an insane hitchhiker will leave you in stitches for days, and of course the brilliant dog whose name I can't remember.There are just so many scenes that bring tears of laughter just thinking about them.

Much of ""Something About Mary's"" humor is about ""sticky"" situations, and I mean this literally and figuratively. . . It's crude (what other movie ends with the dialogue, ""I was only bonin' you to get to Mary?""), you bet - but it also has a charming good-naturedness about it that later, more cynical exercises in gross-out comedy (i.e. the ""American Pie"" trilogy) would lack. In fact, remember that guy from high school who was always trying way too hard to be the class clown? ""American Pie,"" and especially its sequels, are like that guy. His freshness wore out quickly, and he eventually became a self-conscious parody of himself. The plot of ""Mary"" essentially revolves around a group of love-hungry boobs who desperately want to hook up with Mary. Stiller was her high-school prom-date; Chris Elliot was her college boyfriend, etc. Each guy tries to sabotage the other guys, and Mary is stuck in the middle of their kooky antics. Simple?

In fact, the only movie I can think of that made me laugh harder was Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which is saying quite a bit considering how many comedies I see).The film is about a rather, to put it bluntly, obsessed guy played by Ben Stiller who thinks about little besides his high school sweetheart (Cameron Diaz) years later. He hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to check up on her. The P.I. falls for her and tries to keep Stiller's character, Ted, from going to see her.A couple of warnings in advance about this film. If you find sexual humor of any sort to be offensive, do not see this movie. Also, don't see it on a full stomach because you might lose your last meal from laughing so hard and because of some of the more gruesome sites (Cameron's neighbor... *shudders*)The only complaint I had with the entire movie was the ending, which seemed a like something of a cop out.

The Farrellys navigate successfully the fine line between being laugh-out-loud funny and just plain gross superbly. They are abetted by a superb cast. Ben Stiller's nebbishy character get's tiresome in a lot of his films but he is somewhat endearing here. Cameron Diaz is effervescent here as the object of everybody's affection. Matt Dillon has never been better as the sleazy private detective(where's he been lately?). This film may have been a case of the Farrellys being too successful because their subsequent efforts have fallen short of the mark(though I'm one of the few champions of ""Me, Myself, and Irene"". It's not as bad as some would say). On a final note if anybody's interested in who the minstrel is who provides running commentary throughout the film his name is Jonathan Richman. Richman and his band the Modern Lovers made a classic self-titled rock album in 1972. Richman was something of an eccentric. After the cult success of their initial album, Richman eschewed rock music and went on to make children's records.

In between the main jokes though, the plot is pretty thin and meaningless.I would however recommend it to most people though as when you do laugh, you laugh hard.

I've only seen one other movie in which I felt similarly moved to just walk out of the theater in silent protest to the terrible moviemaking I was so unfortunate to have witnessed.  Don't believe the slack-jawed uninformed when deciding whether or not to see this film -- avoid it, take a wide berth around it and go see ANYTHING else.Now, the typical response to those of us who found this movie to be incredibly bad in all respects is that we are ""bible thumpers"" or can't respect the anti-political correctness the movie adheres to.  Sure we can. It's just a fascinatingly bad moive. The specific vulgarities were nauseating, yes (the sperm in the hair perhaps being the topper), but the real objection is in that EVERYONE in the entire movie is a complete and utter reprobate,  from Ben Stiller's imbecilic character to Cameron Diaz's sexy but senseless (she's a doctor?  Give me a break) character.  And those were the two most intelligent characters in the entire movie.  The remaining coterie of scumbags aren't worth mentioning.

The more a film acquiesces to bourgeois conventions, good taste and all that junk, the less amusing it is. It was the Farrely brothers flagrant disregard for political correctness that made this the funniest movie of the decade.In other words, what made this film so hilarious to some of us was precisely what made it so odious to others. Imagine how dull the film would have been if the makers had a more refined social conscience: no laughs at the expense of dogs, retards or nice guys. Just ""Friends"" jokes. ""Friends"" is a good example, come to think of it, of the sort of humor that offends no one: it makes you giggle a little, that's all. But for a joke to be rip-roaringly funny, it has to have a target.

330,yashvardhan,Love story with a twist!,10,18 May 2014,"Coming off with hits like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"", audience must have expected funny but juvenile and uncomfortable scenes from Farrelly brothers .But what they did not expect was a mature and sweet love story. Sure this is a romantic movie. But this is not another clichéd love story. No, this is a romantic movie with twist. It contains elements of a black comedy as well as a mindless gross-out teen sex comedy (of which I am a big fan) Though the main plot is not new, how it is executed is. The best part of the movie is its unpredictability. You actually wonder whether the boy will get the girl or not? The movie shocks you not only with its brilliant twists-and-turns but also with its grossness. This movie is quite re-watchable even if it loses shock value after you have seen it many times. Those who are fan of the first three ""American Pie"" movies will quite appreciate its humor. Though the gags may not be as disgusting or sexual like the 1999 American Pie, they are still funny and memorable. Some of them are so funny that your stomach will hurt from laughter even if you know what is going to happen. Even if you don't like its humor, you will still like the movie for its memorable character, brilliant pacing, nice music and believable acting, which is done by everyone in cast.

331,andy-blunt,Better than you remember,8,14 November 2021,"Anyone who has seen a Farrelly brothers movie before will know what to expect here; plenty of trademark lowbrow humour, but blended with enough warmth and heart that they have created a minor 90s classic.That this film is better than expected is due in no small part to the star wattage of Cameron Diaz, who is radiant and dazzling as the free-spirited Mary; casting a spell of longing over ever guy who meets her, and inadvertently turning them into obsessed stalkers.Ben Stiller too is perfectly cast, as a sweet natured admirer who you'll want to win the race for Mary's affections. But the course of true love never did run smooth, and series of bad luck incidents threaten to derail his dreams.Standing in his way are a supporting cast including Mat Dillon, putting in a memorable turn as a douchebag private detective, and Keith David having a lot of fun as Mary's over protective step-father. But although it's great to see Lee Evans being cast in a U. S. movie, his American accent here is perhaps best forgotten.However extra plus points must also be given for the casting of Jonathan Richman as a quirky guitar strumming singer, who appears periodically to give the film exposition. And of course for Puffy the dog, who threatens to steal every scene he is in, as a small yappy mutt, whose bark may, or may not, be worse than his bite.So yes, this is still just essentially a film that promises and delivers it's fair share of crude laughs. (No Mary; that ISN'T hair gel that Ben Stiller is wearing.)But by the time the movie ends, with a crowd-pleasing cast singalong of ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" by The Foundations, you may just find that you feel a little bit happier in your heart than you did a couple of hours earlier.Which is to be saluted.",There's Something About Mary
332,capataz_de_cargadores,3/5 Good. Worth Watching,6,21 December 2004,"USA 1998 Directors: Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly Cast: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, W. Earl BrownIn these awfully politically correct times, its sometimes refreshing to sit through an exercise in bad taste, an area Something About Mary excels in. Fortunately, it is also funny with a sporadic spattering of true 'laugh out loud' moments.The story is all about Ben (Stiller), consumed with regret about the fact that he well and truly messed up his only chance with high school sweetheart Mary (Diaz) during an ill-fated prom night thirteen years earlier, decides to do something about it - locate Mary through the deviously sly private investigator Patt Healy (Dillion). Unfortunately for Ben, Patt has ulterior motives...Ben Stiller is his usual self in a role not too dissimilar from any of his other roles. Cameron Diaz is also good, and creates adequate screen chemistry with her many devotees (!). But ultimately, the 'star' (probably a misnomer) of this film is Matt Dillon, a fact largely due to the script as opposed to the acting performance he gives, which is more than sufficient for a film of this type. To be honest however, we aren't given characters we truly care about, but rather fodder to the endless string of gags, which often works against the film.The laughs come thick and fast, however at times it feels as if the Farrely brothers go somewhat overboard in an attempt to induce fits of laughter with many scenes having a very contrived feel to them. Likely their previous work, the humor is not of the subtle and witty type, and the feather the Farrelly brothers attempt to tickle the audience with is of industrial strength. Though despite the crassness, it is overall quite a sweet film, which will leave most audiences warm and fuzzy as opposed to repelled.After such tripe as Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber, The Farrelly brothers have delivered a comedy not only lewd and vulgar but also funny. This isn't fine art, but it never aspires to be. Worth watching just as long as you aren't expecting anything remotely intellectual.

Then watch this movie... Personally I watched it because I wanted to have some good laughs and I had what I wanted, nut nothing more. I adored the previous Farrelly bros' movie (Dumb & Dumber) where everything was crazy and farcical. The defect of this one is that there are two characters that are too human (played by the divine Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller): so the exhilarating scenes that include Stiller (and where you laugh almost to tears) seem uprooted from the other more serious scenes where the directors have to develop the story, just because they have two human character,too. So the rhythm of the movie seems to limp (just like many characters) and it goes too long, for a movie of this kind. The invention of the two boys that play and sing (like a greek chorus all through the movie) is very good. A few last words about the advertised ""politically uncorrect"" in this movie: I found the scenes including disableds not too disturbing.

The Zipper scene at the beginning set the mood for the rest of the movie.  The hair gel scene is now infamous, and the many dog scenes are very humorous as well.

They are all so desperate it becomes endearing and very amusing. The hair gel scene is also funny in the context of this lovesick man (played by Ben Stiller) trying to make a good impression on Mary. This movie reminds me of the song ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love?""  It's about those fools who wear their hearts on their sleeves in the name of love. All three of these guys will go to any lengths to please the woman of their dreams and that's why I found this movie so humorous. The tone of the movie mocks these love-starved guys while simultaneously persuading the audience to feel sympathy for them. The script's tongue-in-cheek approach to its own characters makes TSOM a winning comedy. I highly recommend it to those who have an affinity for outrageous contemporary comedies about modern relationships.",There's Something About Mary

In my opinion it is sophomoric, juvenile, puerile, obscene and offensive and not at all funny. I watched this film from start to finish and it failed to register on my funny bone enough to make me even smile, let alone laugh. I have no problem with sophomoric, juvenile, puerile, obscene and offensive humour... as long as it actually is humour. Animal House fits all those adjectives, yet it manages to be funny.

There are a couple of dog scenes which will make you giggle and two gross sexual/body part situations which will have you groaning.

Like the classic films of Mel Brooks, this one often aims below the lowest common denominator.

This is a one of a kind romantic comedy that truly stands out. There's no exaggeration or the cast / script writers trying too hard in any of the sequences.

By switching early on who is driving the story (Ben Stiller to Matt Dillon) the audience is confused as to what's going on, then when switching back to Stiller, the 'situations' that Stiller gets in when trying to hook up with Mary (who just seems to be in whatever scene doing whatever actions the script called for, without any semblance of belonging ever) are contrived, juvenile, and insulting to the intelligence.Why anyone beyond the preview audience went to see this movie is beyond me; even ""The Haunted Mansion"" which was criminally un-funny had more laughs than this reject from a garbage disposal.If more viewers would discover the classics of comedy - Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, and other greats, then talentless hacks like the Farelly's would no longer be forcing such tripe on the American public, and truly funny pictures would be shown at theatres.",There's Something About Mary

How sad, this movie is so much more than that...Everybody associates the Farrely brothers with ""Dumb and Dumber"".  This movie is just as good, if not better.

The over-the-top script and no holds barred jokes left me literally rolling out of my seat in the theater - and I wasn't the only one. I have seen several movies that received a standing ovation, as did this one, but this one topped everything else because the trailer I saw of it a few months back received a standing ovation as well - which is something I had never seen before. I'm sure there are people out there who don't appreciate the vulgarity of some of the jokes, but I think they're missing the point.  The whole point of the film is to be a farce, and critics who claim the movie is a farce are actually right.  Too bad they don't understand it though...

Critics will not use phrases like A Witty Satire or A Comic View on Human Nature. But if you want 1.5 hours of fun and humor, and if you can't remember the last time you rolled on the floor inside a cinema, then this is the film for you.The film has a good balance of intelligent humor and Jerry Lewis - Style comedy. The cast is great, and even an actor like Matt Delon, and I use the word actor in a very loose way, manages to give a good performance. Cameron Diaz is great as usual, and Ben Stiller is doing a good job.(If you didn't see the movie yet, please skip to the next paragraph because I'll refer to some scenes now.) When Pat Healy asks Mary for a change because he is stuck with small coins from Nepal, or when he accidently drops some blueprints of a children hospital, you get a wide grin on your face and say Jesus, what a son of a bitch'... And that's a sign of good filmmaking. And when you discover that Tucker is also an imposter, and that the great dialoge they made in the Architecture Exhibition (""Santiago, Chile? Sure, twice last year..."")  was all a fake, you start to appreciate the intelligence of the script.But the real fun is the slapstick part. The dog scenes (""Oh, so you are the little dog making all that noise..."") are sure to make you roll on the floor, unless you went to the cinema wearing a jacket and a tie.In short - a great comedy, and a good return on your ticket money.Uri Rubner, nice27m@hotmail.com",There's Something About Mary

Don't get me wrong, it was a funny movie, but I have to say I walked out of the theater a little disappointed. The reason?  The television commercials for 'Mary' were way too revealing, in other words I had seen almost all of the funny parts on tv before even seeing the film (the zipper, the dog, the hair gel, to name a few).  It was like knowing the outcome of a mystery story before even reading the book. While the ads did get me to spend some bucks to see the film (the ultimate goal of the ads), I sat there thinking ""ok, I've already seen this part, show me something new"".  Unfortunately, there were very few of those ""new"" parts.  Cameron Diaz is definitely the high point of the film.  She is a very good comedic actress.  Of course it doesn't hurt that she is also very beautiful too.  I look for her to really become one of the better actresses around in the coming years.  Matt Dillon was also surprisingly good as a sleazy private eye.  A low point was the totally unfunny Chris Elliot.

Many reviews were promising unending laughs while viewing this film. They were promising a new surprise every few minutes, hilarious and provocating fun from the Farrellys. Everybody was speaking about the cojones-munching dog, the zip scene or a particular kind of gel, and I expected other gags like these to be contained in the film. Unfortunately, all the scenes people were speaking about were all the scenes that were worth seeing... (okay, I'd enjoy a marathon of Bergman movies if they were acted by Cameron Diaz, but it doesn't matter...) After all, the so called ""innovative"" humour of the film, the gags everybody would be indigned to see were not so innovative.

424,lukemoon-90541,A classic that I have found a new appreciation for after many years,7,29 June 2018,"This was a film that I very first see as a teenager around two years after its release when it was first televised....back then I found it 'quite funny and a film that had its own style' though now after watching it the second time around in 2018 I can truly appreciate what a well written and distinct comedy it is and though it fits that 'goofy comedy' genre, there is no film quite like it, it makes me wish the 'Farrelly Brothers' still had the spark to produce good films (especially comparing to 'Stuck On You' and my recent first watch of 'Dumb and Dumber 2' which was underwhelming).
Firstly I'v noticed a few reviews on here with concerns over the film containing 'toilet humour' and 'insensitivity', this indeed is true, there are many moments of both crudeness and narcissism. 
In terms of the crude humour, these are simply light hearted quick laugh scenarios built around a well written comedy that otherwise uses good understanding and comedy around in depth concepts such as 'want', 'loneliness', 'motives', 'greed', 'kindness', 'true love', 'lust' 'social indifference' and the 'relatability between the cultural stereotypes involved despite them being different'. The characters written into the story strongly portray these aspects well and the way the story is structured shows hallmarks of good writing with a story that progresses with the 'game of chess' power struggle between the hapless characters as new info comes to light for them and they take steps to obtain their goal.
In terms of the insensitivity, though the film portrays unsavoury characters that are for example 'misogynistic' or 'insulting of disabled people' , it clearly in no way 'condones or glorifies it', in fact it does quite the opposite, it observes narcissistic attitudes in a comical way using the medium of these desperate characters ultimately coming unstuck; the film also contains strong 'empathic characters' who 'stick up for the little guy' and have more noble motives to their gains of which the film ultimately 'roots for' and centres around, as well as the other plainly 'quirky characters' who are simply 'up against it' and are somewhere in the middle.
As mentioned before, the film very much has its 'own feel and style' which in this new age of mostly 'accepted and often blindly defended uniform mediocrity' when it comes to the feel and style around art, shows a good example of a film to take notes from for a production that shows good individualality, character and distinct feeling to it, which are often traits which make films memorable cult classics such as what this has become.",There's Something About Mary
425,volkanvutich,Mary's Love Story - Every woman is a unique equation,7,5 July 2021,"Every woman is a unique equation and conquering her requires how you solve the equation, not depending on the inferences of others, applying criteria to love is almost completely worthless. If it's said that girls like funny people, then maybe comedians are the standard for all women. If it's said that girls like naughty people, then maybe the hookers, drug addicts, prisoners are the role models of women too.The love of two people is the same, it is a completely different equation, combined in such a way that no two are alike. If everyone has a formula, then why, for thousands of years, we've paired up with someone else who doesn't have a formula at all. Two people with completely different professions can fall in love, two completely different people in terms of childhood, personality, and living environment come together. The fact that a lawyer girl loves you while you are completely illiterate in law, a fashion girl can fall in love with a guy dressed as a beggar. Or you can completely conquer a Biomedical girl while your head barely knows what medicine is.The person we love is a completely separate box, only when we really love can we find the key to open that box.

In the directive approach using Mary as a sex symbol and then splicing her attitude with a female that enjoys the dirtiness of hot wings and good old fashion football Mary is the perfect match for trouble. Being stalked for most her life starting in high school Mary leaves haunting love bug Dom (Woogie) played by Chris Elliot bitten and stricken for his last breathe to see Mary as his own.The movie really brings us closer to thoughts and ideas making the plot and theme really clear to what the main objective is and how the movie plans to display it artistically. Using dramatic impulses in the back of our conscience asking ourselves what is so special about Mary. The director's main focus is on the idea of making us all want to fall in love with Mary. They use the ideas that her character is to perfect for words by making her a guys best friend or girl next door that we all want to meet. The plot from the beginning takes us only a short amount of time to decipher because it is apparent that either Ben Stiller's character is in love with Mary or he is a major dork with hopes far beyond his wildest dreams.I also enjoyed this movie because it involved plenty of action with the some of the best actors in Hollywood. Later during the film Healy played by Matt Dillon makes his debut as a wonderful private eye that can't keep his eyes to himself. Not only does he add to Teds problems trying to hunt down the love of his life, he is the problem in Ted's life. Adding to the plot as the villain unseen Matt Dillon's character prepares us to take a nose dive out of a typical love story in to a beautiful disaster arena of lying and scheming. He is not the trust worthy character he usually plays, nor is Tucker played by Lee Evans, Mary's best crippled friend who apparently builds pizza sky scrapers for a living. In comparison another one of Ben Stiller's movies ""Along came Polly"" symbolizes the same background of ""There's something about Mary"". The theme of finding another loved one in present time and how to make love work when recreating the past. The movie was awesome and the pick for characters could not have been better judged for such an adventurous motion picture.",There's Something About Mary
466,nicholemilani,There is most definitely something about Mary,8,13 March 2010,"There is something about Mary indeed! For a girl to have not one, not two, not even three stalkers, but four people who are so obsessed with her they will do anything to get near her. Although there is always a reason behind why people do things you tend to wonder, how far are they going to go? If you look at Mary (Cameron Diaz) you see all the things a person would dream of. She is beautiful, smart, funny, caring, she's into sports and best of all she is 100% completely single. Now, Ted (Ben Stiller) who was in love with her since high school, realizes thirteen years later that he is still in love with her and needs to find her. He hires the not so great private investigator Healy (Matt Dillon) who, of course, falls in love with the perfect Mary too. But, it doesn't stop there. After delivering a pizza one night to Mary's home, Tucker (Lee Evans), decides to take another approach to get to Mary and that is to pretend he is cripple to win her and her kindness over. It goes on from here with Dom a.k.a. Woogy (Chris Elliot), Mary's psycho ex-boyfriend.This movie has the typical plot, man is in love, man finds girl, man wins girl, and movie is over. And yes, that sounds boring and much similar to every other film, but it's not. In this one, everyone knows who is going to get the girl in the end, but no one cares. It is more about the humorous things that Ben Stiller does, in the beginning for example the 'zipper accident', or what the psychotic things ex-boyfriend Chris Elliot does with Mary's shoes. The list goes on. As far as comedy, if you thought directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly's movie Dumb and Dumber was funny, this movie will have you rolling. The movies stress on the fact that there are several men in love with Mary using motifs. Over and over again you see the hilarious acts of desperate men seeking her undivided attention. I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it a thousand times over and still find it amusing.",There's Something About Mary
467,Wayne-Dorr,"About a guy name Ted who falls in love with Mary and years later tries to find her, to find out he is not the only one that she has pining for her.",9,14 March 2010,"There's Something About Mary Film Review The plot of this movie begins with Ted( Ben Stiller) and Mary (Cameron Diaz) are back in High School in Rhode Island. Ted helps Warren( W. Earl Brown) when a bully tries to beat him up and that causes Mary to invite Ted to the prom and after a unfortunate event he doesn't get to go to the prom. So for the rest of his life he pines over Mary. I think that the movie is a standard Ben Stiller comedy that although funny, does not look any different from other Farlley brother movies. The theme of the movie has been played many times before and reminds me of other movies with the same kind of theme. The movie Just Friends with Ryan Reynolds has the same theme of loving someone in High school and waiting until years later to display your love for them to end up with more suitors to compete with later in life. In Just Friends they showed a real relationship to make it more believable. Personally think that the High School scenes should have showed a montage of Ted and Mary to put a real relationship that would cause him to feel like he had lost his chance with Mary. As you watch the movie you can kind of tell Mary is not the kind of person that would have ignored Ted after the prom incident and leaves you wondering why it takes so long for Ted and Mary to talk. I did like how they tied in Dom ( Chris Elliot ) in as Woogie later in the film.Some parts of the film were too long and unnecessary, one being the opening scene with the guys singing and playing instrument was a part they could take out of the movie. Those two guys were kind of annoying and when they get shot at the end it was kind of a relief. The scene when Ted was preparing for his date was a little too lengthy and could have been shortened with the same outcome.Overall I recommend this movie to friends and family because it is a feel good funny film. I think the film was funny and ends up being one of Ben Stiller's funniest and most memorable movies to date. With a good supporting cast and an excellent storyline. This movie is one that comedy- loving film that would be in my DVD collection if I were to collect DVD's..",There's Something About Mary
468,ramire09,Funny and Entertaining,6,15 March 2010,"There's Something About Mary is a crazy romantic comedy film. It is pretty predictable but it is still fun to watch. The comedy in this film is definitely not your normal comedy. There is a lot of language and sexual innuendo in this film but it isn't really completely inappropriate. Even with all the craziness in this film there is still a nice story that is being told. This film is about being who you are and living with no regrets. The movie starts out with Ted (Ben Stiller) who is kind of a geeky, teenage boy. He likes this girl named Mary (Cameron Diaz) who is a beautiful, popular girl. Ted sticks up for a boy who is being picked on and this boy happens to be Mary's brother. After this the two of them are supposed to go to prom together. When Ted shows up to take Mary to the prom he is using the restroom and has an unfortunate zipper accident which sends him to the hospital. After this Mary and her family move away and Ted does not see her again.The movie then jumps ahead 14 years and Ted is in therapy discussing the issue. He talks about what happened and how he regrets never getting to see Mary again. He then decides to hire Healy (Matt Dillion) to go to Miami which is where Mary is now and ""spy"" on her. Healy does this and realizes that he wants Mary for himself so he reports back to Ted that she is still in Miami and he makes her sound unattractive so that Ted will change his mind about calling her. This works for a while but then Ted realizes what Healy did and he goes down to Miami to talk to Mary. This is not without a little convincing himself though. He is not sure that he is comfortable enough to do this. Eventually he works up enough nerve to go and talk to her. The two of them hit it off and begin dating until Mary finds out, through an anonymous letter, that Ted had sent Healy to spy on her. This is where Ted begins to realize that he needs to just get over himself and tell her how he feels. As he is walking out of her house, after they argue about the situation, he tells her the only reason that he did this was because he needed to find out once and for all what would have happened. After this Mary is forced to make a decision as to who she wants to be with. She can be with Ted or she can be with Healy, who basically stalks her. Obviously she chooses Ted; it would be silly if the movie ended any other way.There is one thing that I think this film does really well. That would be characterization. As I stated earlier this movie is crazy but at the center of it there is a really good story. The characters are really important to that story. I think the producers did a really good job casting the actors that they did. All of the actors portray the characters the way they were meant to be portrayed I think. Overall I feel this movie was good. It is not my kind of movie but I still enjoyed the story and the characters. It is always nice to see a character work through some issues or regrets they may have and be happy in the end.",There's Something About Mary
469,patel40,Unconditional love of Ted to Mary,8,15 March 2010,"There's Something About Mary is directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. The main characters of the film are Cameron Diaz as Mary, Ben Stiller as Ted, Matt Dillon as Healy, Chris Elliott as Dom, Markie Post as Mary's Mom and Keith David as Mary's Dad. There's something about Mary is very pleasant film to watch. This film is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. In this film, Mary is the object of desire for all men because she is very beautiful and charming girl. In other words, any men would love to be with her. This film's story is about a man name Ted Strobmen and a woman name Mary. Ted has been in love with Mary since they were in high school. Ted convened Marry to go to the prom night. He seemed to be very excited about his first date with a beautiful girl, Mary when he went to picked up Mary at her house to go to prom. Unfortunately, a terrible incident took place that changed everything for him. It was very shocking and embarrassing accident. Instead of going to the prom he ended up going in hospital and never saw Mary again since she moved out to Miami, Florida. He truly fell in love with Mary. His friend Dom suggested him to hire a private investigator named Pat Healy. Pat Healy found Mary in Miami, Florida. However, instead of helping Ted, Pat Healy fell in love with her. He lied to Ted about Mary including her physical appearance. This was the moment I personally thought There's something about Mary. Finally, Ted went Miami, Florida and they met each other after 13 years. At the end, good wins over evils as Ted and Mary get back together. I personally like emotional, romantic and comedy movies and this film have really nice themes such as good versus evil, faithfulness versus disloyalty, and a true love. These themes are very similar to the film The Caribbean Pirates: Dead man's chest. These themes are very suitable for both films by supporting the plot and characters. The dialogs were supporting characters' with nice camera techniques in pretty much all scenes. The editor has done excellent job on focusing circumstances and characters. The camera also called attention to emotions in few scenes. A close-up shot was used in zipper scene on actor's embarrassing face. The cinematographer also used camera angles with actors' emotional attitudes at end of the movie.",There's Something About Mary

The jokes r really good, and there are some real classic comedy moments thrown in there to boot. Cameron Diaz is again really good, and Ben Stiller + Mat Dillon are also really good. I would give it a real high mark, definitly one of my favourite comedys, the storyline ain't to bad either!",There's Something About Mary
471,johnkal,one of the worst ever,1,15 August 2005,"What happened here? Multiple friends (many who've been friends for over 30 years) raved and raved about this movie until they convinced me to go see it with them. (The two people I went with were seeing the movie for the fourth or fifth time.) Excruciating. Stultifying. I sat there the entire movie thinking, when do the funny things happen? (Answer: they didn't.) Since seeing the movie, I've come to an interesting observation, and I wonder if anyone else has experienced anything similar. It's clear in my case that all who loved this movie are straight people, and all who hated it/were bored by it are gays. So, someone do a study here -- what is about gay sensibility that can't find humor that is obviously present for straights?",There's Something About Mary
472,antonio_motag,How haven't I heard about this movie?,8,7 August 2013,"To be honest, I always try to avoid movies with Ben Stiller. I can't explain it. Maybe because I really hated a movie with him or something similar.I watched this movie yesterday and it really surprised me.It has the same plot and setting as most of the comedies with him but with great jokes and scenes. Not the usually low comedy you see everyday. Cameron Diaz was also a part of this perfect puzzle. Her beauty and talent keeps fascinating me in a way that rare actors do. Even being predictable, this movie never fails to make you laugh. I have found really difficult to find movies like this. I truly recommend it to anyone. Proof that good movies don't need special effects and violence to be enjoyed.",There's Something About Mary

475,r_tanner,Daft but a good laugh,8,12 February 2016,"Now I was just discussing this film with a work colleague today and we both first thought of the scene with miss Diaz choice of hair gel. Now I found this film hilarious but i know this film won't appeal to everyone, my wife being one( she didn't find it that funny) but she is not a fan of Ben Stiller and I Know he is not everyone's cup of tea. But the story as well as the laughs move along well and is supported by good music and acting. It is well written. The humour is good but will make some of you cringe. Well worth a watch or one of those films you can put on and laugh at again after an interval thumbs up from me. This will be one of the films Cameron Diaz will be most remembered for. I know this style of humour has been repeated in other films but for me this will be thought of as a great comely film.",There's Something About Mary
476,robert-a-stanfield,The Greatest Comedy EVER,10,5 December 2005,My wife and I 'accidentally' saw a sneak preview of this movie at the theater. We went to see something else (I can't even recall what it was now) and it was sold out. They told us they were having a sneak screening of a movie that would be coming out the next week so we thought we'd try it out. I can not even begin to tell you how pleasantly surprised we were! We had never laughed so hard and haven't since at any movie. This is one of those flicks you can watch again and again and again. The only sad part of this movie being so great is that now EVERY SINGLE comedy I see gets compared to 'Theres Something About Mary' - and NONE of them stand up!,There's Something About Mary
