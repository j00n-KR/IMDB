0,TheLittleSongbird,Great soundtrack. The film? Not so much,3,18 July 2016,"In many ways, actually, 'Coyote Ugly' from personal opinion didn't even come close to good.Feel-good films when done right are very entertaining and heart-warming. However 'Coyote Ugly', while with its moments, has too many faults that are at worst ineptly done to succeed as a feel-good film.Starting with 'Coyote Ugly's' good things, the best asset by far is the soundtrack, which is quite brilliant and deserved a far better film. The LeAnn Rimes numbers ""The Right Kind of Wrong"", ""Please Remember"" and ""Can't Fight the Moonlight"" particularly stand out of the songs, as does the classic Elvis Presley standard ""Can't Help Falling in Love"", one of the most beautiful all-time great romantic songs. The score is very nice too.While the acting wasn't great at all, there is one good performance and it is that of John Goodman, who is an entertaining and amiably likable father figure. Some of the camera work is quite smart too.On the other hand, while the music itself is of really high-quality it does feel too constant with little break and like there could have been less, there were definitely scenes that would have benefited much more without it or at least from music with a less intrusive approach. Too many scenes feel like amateurishly edited and lazily choreographed, with a lot of gloss and either being overblown or lacking energy, music videos, which is a huge problem in a film full of them and with a wafer-thin story that feels like an excuse to string these scenes together.Also hugely problematic is how cliché-ridden and stereotypical it is. Not just the story, which has every done to death cliché in the book that everything feels forced and predictable with ridiculous and laughable dramatic elements with little chemistry and no substance or emotional connection whatsoever. We are also talking about the characters in a film loaded with every possible stereotype, another problem being that apart from Cammie and Bill very few of them are likable, with a difficult to relate to protagonist, and some add nothing to the film, Maria Bello's character is particularly useless and only there because the film ""needed"" the obligatory boss stereotype.Goodman aside, the performances are not great, or even good, at all. Adam Garcia is particularly bad, with an acting ability so limited it's almost non-existent and he feels out of place too. He doesn't even work as eye candy that well. Piper Perabo tries hard but too often lacks charisma and doesn't display a wide range of emotions with sudden shifts in character that undermine the character's growth. Everybody else is bland or annoying though Izabella Miko has moments of charm. Dialogue is painfully trite and thin throughout, while the direction lacks panache and flash. The film looks alright, especially in the colours, locations and the camera work, which show a lot of style, but cheapened by too much gloss and amateurish editing.Overall, there is a great soundtrack but 'Coyote Ugly' falls far short. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Coyote Ugly
1,SnoopyStyle,Nice actress in unwatchable movie,5,29 December 2013,"Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is an aspiring songwriter from small town New Jersey. She leaves her pizza joint waitress job, her father, and her best friend to pursue her dreams in NYC. Only the big bad city is getting the best of her. Down to her last few dollars, she tries out for a surprising job at a bar called Coyote Ugly.First, I don't know why she has to move to NYC to pursue her dreams as a songwriter. I would think New Jersey is close enough to get rejected by the music industry, and she could do a week or two. But as a songwriter, why does she have to stay there? I think it would be better if she's an actress.Then the rejections are so silly and ham fisted. It had me rolling my eyes, and hating the first act. By the time she gets to the bar, I couldn't really stand the movie. Maria Bello plays the bar owner. Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks, and Bridget Moynahan play the dancers. Other than watching some hot actresses dancing suggestively, there isn't much in this movie.",Coyote Ugly
2,jboothmillard,Coyote Ugly,4,10 March 2011,"I knew about this film for two reasons, the big actor from The Flintstones being in it, and the successful song, I was certainly interested, from director David McNally (Kangaroo Jack) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air). Basically Violet Sanford (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle's Piper Perabo) is an aspiring teenage songwriter, and she finally gets her dream of going professional going when she leaves home and heads for New York City. She finds herself a place to stay, but her efforts to give her demo tape to a music producer are useless, and then her apartment gets broken into leaving her with nothing. Feeling useless she gets some lunch with what she has left, and by coincidence she overhears some girls who work at a bar as they say goodbye to worker Zoe (Tyra Banks). This leads Violet to the Coyote Ugly bar, run by Lil (Maria Bello), who gives her a chance behind the bar to experience what goes on, and Violet is surprised to see that it is a very raunchy bar, the girls call the shots, they thrust moves on the bar counter, and the attraction of what pulls in the punters. Lil warned her that she may not last long at the bar, but after meeting Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) she learns more of the ways of the city, and gains a bit more confidence to work in the bar, she also auctions him off to get money she needed. But what she really needs is confidence on stage, as her demo tapes aren't gaining the interest, so she needs to sing the songs herself live and maybe get some attention that way, and Kevin tries to help her with her stage fright. One night while working in Coyote Ugly there is an incident that causes a fight, so Violet grabs the microphone and sings along to the song on the jukebox, Blondie's ""One Way or Another"", and that gains the bar some more punters. Violet's toll-booth father Bill (John Goodman) does find out about the bar and doesn't approve seeing what goes on, and there is a point when he has a car accident, but he survives and supports his daughter with any decision she wants to make. After having a disagreement with each other, Kevin returns to give her confidence as well, and she completes a new song ready to present at a live show for newcomer singers, musicians and writers. In the end, Violet initially still has stage fright, but Kevin helps her and she gets through her song gaining high interest, and of course in the end a professional singer, LeAnn Rimes comes to Coyote Ugly to perform her song with her, and a proud Bill gets auctioned. Also starring Izabella Miko as Cammie, Bridget Moynahan as Rachel, Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey as Gloria, Del Pentecost as Lou and Johnny Knoxville as College Guy. Perabo is pretty good in the lead role, Goodman gets his humorous moments, including that scene where he lies about eating a vegetable meal when it is in fact KFC and going ""yum"", the raunchy is obviously very easy to enjoy, the music soundtrack is all good, the story is pretty much a cross between Flashdance and Cocktail, it may be a little predictable, but ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"" by LeAnn Rimes is a fantastic number one hit song, it's not a bad romantic comedy drama at all. Okay!",Coyote Ugly
3,Quinoa1984,A so-so entertaining date movie,5,4 August 2000,"I thought this film wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it isn't something to rush to either.  There are enduring performances by Ppier Perablo and some others, and the story is good, but it is missing something. I think it is called brains.  This film (despite being entertaining) is kinda stupid, so it can appeal to stupid teens.  And it does (not that I am stupid).  But I think that couples will like the sensuous parts and some of the romance.  But that might be it.  Also, you might want to see this movie for Perablo's performance.One more interesting thing (and according to this site) is that Kevin Smith (of Jay and Silent Bob fame) is supposedly a uncredited co-writer on this film, and I actually think he did do a couple of things.  The clues- 1, the character Violet (Perablo) comes from South Amboy, New Jersey (which is where around Smith is from) and 2, the Adam Garcia character's prized possession is a Spiderman comic book (Smith had Stan Lee who created Spiderman in the film Mallrats).  Just a notion, I could be wrong.  But one thing I am sure of is this film is a must see, for girls. B+",Coyote Ugly
4,michaelRokeefe,Belly up to the bar and hang on.,7,10 July 2001,"Violet Sanford(Piper Perabo)wants to avoid a dead end life and decides to leave New Jersey for the big city. In NYC, she is determined to be a hit song writer. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job slinging beer and dancing on the bar with the other ""Coyotes"" at the popular watering hole Coyote Ugly. This is very titilating and an eye full to watch. The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello, who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast: Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Melanie Lynskey, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes, who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes, the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band, Lenny Kravitz, Def Leppard, Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once.",Coyote Ugly
5,sunwarrior13,A Feel Good Dramedy,6,14 September 2014,"Coyote Ugly stars Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia together with Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks and John Goodman.It is romantic dramedy about an aspiring musician from New Jersey who tries her luck in New York becomes a bartender.Violet Sanford dreams of making a name for herself as a singer and songwriter.She move to New York to make a name for herself but she found out that it won't be an easy journey towards it as her music is constantly rejected by music producers.This temporarily led her to becoming a one of the attractive female bartenders at Coyote Ugly that flaunt their skin while dancing and serving drinks to the male customers.She also finds a new boyfriend in Kevin O'Donnell.As the story goes on,we see Violet get into many problems and conflicts with bar owner Lil,Kevin,her father,her fellow barmaids and having stage fright when performing.But in the end,she manages to overcome these obstacles and her dreams ultimately come true.As always,there is nothing refreshing and groundbreaking in it as we have seen the plot elements in it in previous movies.The story was definitely clichéd and predictable as the viewer can see how everything will come out for Violet in the end.The only thing I could say is that it definitely will provide enjoyment to the male viewers especially when the attractive barmaids show parts of their skin while dancing and it also would be a form of a stress reliever for people looking to relax while watching it.Added to that,it can also be form of an escapism as well as feeling good which it does effectively.But viewers looking for an intelligent film should stay away from it for they will feel disappointed.",Coyote Ugly
6,Theo Robertson,Very Shallow,3,20 October 2003,"I don`t want a reputation for writing four word reviews therefore I wasn`t just going to write Weak Shallow chick flick but it`s very difficult to add anything to these four words . As you`d expect from a Bruckheimer production there`s very little substance to the wafer thin story which seems to be a throw back to the days when Jerry made films just to sell a few records , ala FLASHDANCE and TOP GUN . Most the story involves a bunch of teenage bimbos dancing on a bar table which means COYOTE UGLY is hardly compelling , but being a 36 year old male I guess this movie wasn`t marketed for me",Coyote Ugly
7,preppy-3,"Colorful, energetic but sexist and dumb",5,23 July 2001,"Small town Jersey girl (Piper Perabo) goes to NYC to be a songwriter.  While waiting to be discovered she serves drinks (and dances on the bar) of a horrible place called Coyote Ugly.  All the bartenders are beautiful, big-breasted, untalented actresses who show as much clevage as a PG-13 rating will allow.  As for the ""plot"" it's been done HUNDREDS of times before.  Every single situation and line of dialogue is yawningly predictable.  But most of the screen time is devoted to the half-naked bartenders dancing and twitching and (naturally) poring water all over themselves.  It's a PG ""Showgirls""!  I started fast-forwarding through them--there's too many of them and they are dull--although I must admit the women throw their all into it and seem to be enjoying themselves--too bad they didn't realize the movie is objectifying their bodies.  And what the hell is John Goodman doing here?  Was he really that desperate for the money?  There's a few things that save the film from being a total washout.  It is colorful (the bar has tons of little colored lights), the dancing is energetic and Perabo is a good actress and makes for a very liakable heroine.  Also Adam Garcia...he can't act (and what a stupid accent!) but when you look like him, who cares?  He's very handsome and the movie does show him shirtless a few times (definite highlights).  So, there's half-naked woman and a hunky shirtless Garcia.  If either of those sound good, this is your movie.  Otherwise, stay away--FAR away!!!!!",Coyote Ugly
8,Boba_Fett1138,Nicely made but too predictable and sappy.,6,15 February 2006,"This is one of those movie of which you already know how it's going to end. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and it's a quite formulaic one. Still it has been made with lots of talent and profession involved, which definitely helps to makes this movie a pleasantly watchable one.I truly think that director David McNally is a greatly talented one. Problem is, that so far he only has been given awful material to work with (this movie and ""Kangeroo Jack"".). This director certainly deserves better and I hope producer Jerry Bruckheimer also sees this and gives him another chance one day, with a movie with a better script. McNally made this movie with lots of flair and vision and certainly makes the story look more interesting than it really is. Because lets face it, there is very little plot and story present in this movie. At times the movie jumps to one sequence to another without feeling an obvious connection. Horrible editing and continuity at times.It really is the story that prevent this movie from being a great one. It's all very predictable and formulaic and all of the clichéd moments you could expect from a movie with a concept like that, are present. The movie also tries to be too dramatic at times with as a result that it becomes unnecessarily sappy at times. Guess it's more a chick-flick than anything else really.The actors do their best and they did their job well enough, although it is fairly obvious that everyone was cast on their looks and not their acting skills. But I, as a well functioning heterosexual male, am not really complaining about that.The style is certainly good and somewhat uplifts this movie and helps to make it just better than slightly above average. It's worth to watch and enjoyable enough, when you have never else or better to do. But it's far from an excellent movie, obviously.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Coyote Ugly
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just another teen movie,6,18 January 2004,"This is your typical teen movie, with the addition of some hot girls dancing on top of a bar. The premise is not really interesting, and the plot is extremely predictable. The only reason guys would want to see this is because of the girls dancing on the bar, and who can blame us; apart from one or two decent humorous lines, the hot girls are the only thing the movie has going for it. Something I truly loathed was the amount of annoying pop music, that almost kept me from sitting through  it. It isn't exactly as bad as some of the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it's definitely no masterpiece. Most guys will probably watch it just to see the girls dancing, but the good thing is that they can watch it with their girlfriends, since it does feature a lot of girlie stuff. So watch it with your girlfriend, and you'll probably both like some parts of it; it's not as horrible to sit through as the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it does take some effort. On the other hand, pretty much any guy should see this just for watching Tyra Banks pouring water down her chest. 6/10",Coyote Ugly
10,Uriah43,Coyote Average,5,12 September 2019,"This movie begins with a young woman named ""Violet Sanford"" (Piper Perado) having made the decision to quit her job at a local pizzeria and leave her home in New Jersey to try her luck being a songwriter in New York City. Yet even though she has thought about this move for years things don't go nearly as well as she had planned-and then things get much worse. It's at this point that she meets a grill cook by the name of ""Kevin O'Donnell"" (Adam Garcia) who does his best to help her out even though he has few connections in the music industry. Unfortunately, that being the case, she gets tentatively accepted for a job dancing and bartending at a raucous bar known as Coyote Ugly which causes her life to change drastically from then. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an uneven comedy-drama which had both good points and rather weak ones as well. To that extent, both the acting and the comedy were mediocre but the plot was interesting and it kept my attention for the most part so I suppose I shouldn't be too critical about it overall. That being the case, I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Coyote Ugly
11,anaconda-40658,Ugly is Right.,1,19 August 2015,"Coyote Ugly (2000): Dir: David McNally / Cast: Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Tyra Banks: A reworking of the Cocktail formula (as if we need more of that) with a young woman leaving home to pursue a song writing career. After numerous attempts to get her songs heard she accepts a job at a bar baring the title name. The owner explains the rules then she is off tap dancing on bar tops. She eventually meets someone who is interested in helping her get established with song writing but intelligent viewers will realize that it is just an excuse for a dull romance. Dreary setup with predictable circumstances and behavior that is applauded that shouldn't be. David McNally does his best as director but even the locations spark little enthusiasm. Piper Perabo is the one casting that elevates above the low level material. She dreams big and works the bar to get there financially but much of this is predictable. Maria Bello as her boss is a total stereotype. Adam Garcia as her love interest is a useless prop for predictable romantic drivel. John Goodman as her father never rises above the humour level. A pre-talk show Tyra Banks even gets cast in this film. While the film is popular, it doesn't divert the horrible clichés and lazy writing. Any message to be found is lost within a parade of juvenile acts. Fire streams down the bar top to further celebrate the idiocy and ugliness. Score: 1 ½ / 10",Coyote Ugly
12,Wuchakk,"Fun and snappy, but too predictable with little depth",5,18 March 2017,"Released in 2000, ""Coyote Ugly"" is a drama starring Piper Perabo as a singer/composer who leaves her home in nearby New Jersey with her dad (John Goodman) to try her hand at the music business in the big city. For money, she gets a gig at a nightclub hotspot where the female workers dance on top of the bar for entertainment, amongst other things, like dumping ice on customers now and then, spraying others with the soda gun and occasionally pouring liquor on the bar and setting it aflame (Why Sure!). Maria Bello plays the owner of the bar while Adam Garcia plays the girl's potential beau.Perabo plays a thoroughly winsome heroine and the movie's fun with a kinetic soundtrack (with, for example, ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" playing twice). After the first act though the movie never really takes off and the story becomes predictably bland, albeit still entertaining.While the movie wasn't a big hit, it was moderately successful at the box office and has become a semi-iconic film. A mere 2 years after its release I was in Las Vegas and there was an establishment called Coyote Ugly with an alluring woman dancing out front on a raised platform to draw in customers. That was my first exposure to ""Coyote Ugly"" and I asked my brother-in-law about it; to which he informed me it was a movie. One of the problems with the film is that the girl dancing out front of that Vegas nightclub was far more fetching than any of the actresses dancing in the movie. The women simply aren't curvy enough to engender much fascination. Perabo is arguably the best, followed by blond cutie Izabella Miko, but Miko and the rest (e.g. Bridget Moynahan and Melanie Lynskey) seriously looked like they needed to gain about 15 lbs. at least. But, I suppose if you like women with the shape of 12 year-old boys you might appreciate this element more than me.Another problem is the emphasis on the nightclub lifestyle and the soused antics thereof. If bars are your thang then you'll probably favor this movie more than I did. Thankfully, the protagonists eschew the drunkard lifestyle and the movie's to be commended for this (the filmmakers obviously wanted to ""have their cake and eat it too"").But those are minor quibbles. The biggest problem with ""Coyote Ugly,"" beyond the story being predictable, is that there's no meat on the bones, so to speak. Take the subplot with the boyfriend and his big revelation scene; it was underwhelming and weakly executed, to say the least. Moreover, I just saw the movie last night and I can't even remember if the protagonist ""makes it"" in the music business at the end. That's how forgettable the film is.A couple of years after the flick was released my wife asked a 9 year-old girl what her favorite movie was and she enthusiastically said ""Coyote Ugly!"" That tells you something about the film's depth.The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot in South Amboy, New Jersey; Atlantic Beach, Long Island; New York City; and Tower Theatre & Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles.

13,Sylviastel,From a True South Amboy Girl!,7,25 March 2007,"I was born in Amboy, Perth Amboy, right across the river from South Amboy where the girl, Violet Sanford, was supposed to be from. I was there the day that the film came to town to shoot the opening scene. They all ordered pizza from the pizzeria, Delios, right across the street whose owners are truly Sicilian born and bred who have been making pizza since before I was born. I met some of the crew members. The filming only lasted a couple of days but I remember it like yesterday. South Amboy is not so far away from New York City that Violet could have made the trek on her own like the hundreds who do from the South Amboy train station which goes directly to Penn Station. I really became a fan of Piper while watching the film last night on television as well as Maria Bello who plays bar owner, Lil. My family are huge admirers of Melanie Lynskey mostly from her role as Rose on Two and Half Men but she's good here except she plays the accent just a little too thick. Nobody in South Amboy talks like that. You can't help but love John Goodman. Anyway the film's alright with a story of Violet Sanford who wishes to become a songwriter.",Coyote Ugly
14,JamesHitchcock,The Ultimate Product Placement,4,5 July 2014,"""Coyote Ugly"" is a real bar in New York; the name is presumably an ironic allusion to the fact that its female staff are all very attractive. I wonder how many other real bars in America have been able to benefit from the ultimate product placement of having an entire Hollywood movie dedicated to their activities. Violet Sanford is a young woman from South Amboy, New Jersey who moves to New York to follow her dream of becoming a songwriter. The film is clearly based on the dubious theory that songwriters need to live in big cities because no songs worth listening to have ever been written in small towns. (It is also based upon the assumption that ""Violet"" was a plausible Christian name for girls of Piper Perabo's generation. Well, perhaps it was in New Jersey, but in the seventies the only Violets in Britain were those queuing up for their old age pension). Violet quickly discovers that, in the songwriting trade, success does not always come quickly and realises that she will need another source of income to tide her over until her genius is recognised by the music industry. She therefore gets a job at the Coyote Ugly Saloon.""Coyote Ugly"" reminded me of a slightly later film, ""Burlesque"". In that film Christina Aguilera also plays a rather naive young girl who leaves her small-town home to settle in the big city and who ends up working in a rather risqué establishment. Lil, the bar owner, also bears certain similarities to the character played by Cher in ""Burlesque"". The main difference is that the Coyote Ugly Saloon is not actually a strip club; taking their clothes off is not something the Coyote Girls are expected to do. If, however, they are not strippers, neither are they barmaids as that term is more generally understood. They are encouraged to flirt with male customers, to dance on the bar, to take part in wet T-shirt contests and to behave in a generally raunchy way. The film charts Violet's rise to fame not only as a bartender but also as a singer-songwriter, and there is a subplot chronicling her romance with a handsome young Australian named Kevin. Actually, ""handsome"" seems an inadequate adjective to describe Adam Garcia. He achieves the rare feat for a Hollywood leading man of being even prettier than his leading lady. The film-makers seem to have had the cynical idea of making a romantic comedy (normally regarded as a genre which appeals more to women than to men) which would be equally popular with both sexes. Garcia would provide eye-candy for the ladies, while for the men there would be the sight of various sexy girls parading their charms in tight- fitting T-shirts and jeans. Among Violet's co-workers is the gorgeous supermodel Tyra Banks, at this period trying to carve out a cinema career for herself. (Tyra's bid for screen stardom did not prove a great success, but at least she was no worse than some of her fellow supers, such as Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson, who also tried their hand at acting around the same time). Good looks, whether of the masculine or feminine variety, are not always enough to ensure the success of a film, but ""Coyote Ugly"" did relatively well at the box-office. The critics, however, were less impressed, and I must say that my sympathies are with them. The plot is weak and clichéd, and the acting is undistinguished. Both Perabo and Garcia are forgettable; about the only one of the cast to make anything of an impression is John Goodman as Violet's father Bill, like most Goodman characters an amiable slob. Even the sight of Tyra Banks in a T-shirt cannot make ""Coyote Ugly"" anything more than a below-average rom-com. 4/10",Coyote Ugly
15,StevePulaski,"When you don't know what to say, display for TnA, I guess",5,28 June 2011,"The most clever scene in Coyote Ugly is when Maria Bello explains why the bar is named what it is. She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.It was much to my surprise that Kevin Smith actually did a rewrite of the film's script at one point. I would imagine if Smith's version was made into the final film that it would be less about the girl's bodies and more about their problems. Instead of so many overhead shots of women dancing on one another, soaked in water, comparing wet t-shirts, I'm sure there would've been more sincere dialog between Violet and her friends. Maybe we would've gotten to know them better. It's all one big ""maybe."" The film centers around Violet (Perabo), an aspiring songwriter trying to make it in the complicated and relentless world of music. She tries to get her demo tape heard, but is always met with reps that blow her off. Violet leaves home and goes to New York to try her look, but realizing she needs to make end's meet, she goes to work at a bar called ""Coyote Ugly"" where she will entertain customers by seductively dancing on the bar countertop while pouring drinks and showering her and her fellow employees with water. That's the extent of it.In the meantime, Violet dates a shady guy who she had mistaken for a record exec (Garcia). Let me ask Violet, do you think it's a good idea to date a guy who just tried to pass himself off as a guy who could get you a record deal and doesn't discuss any of his past? Does he seem like the dream guy mothers would want their daughters to date, and could have a good ol' day out with the father? I neglected to mention that the club is run by Lil (Bello). Lil, full name Liliana Lovell, actually runs the real-life Coyote Ugly in New York. Maria Bello was excellent in The Cooler, and does more sure-fire work in this picture. She is still as hilarious as ever, and plays a very strict, yet laidback bartender.Coyote Ugly, even in possession of a decent storyline, is ruined by its own immaturity. There are too many overhead shots of women on the bar countertop that go nowhere and aren't arousing or entertaining at all. I appreciate John Goodman's role as Violet's protective and caring dad, but the scenes with him are far to spread out and far too short to fully enjoy. I imagine if Kevin Smith was responsible for writing the entire screenplay maybe the movie would've been more about the daddy/daughter relationship rather than the women.The story isn't gripping, but it works for a while. Until the bar comes into play. Then it's down to twelve year olds controlling the camera. Piper Perabo is gorgeous, and is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood today in terms of looks and acting skills. She still hasn't had that ""breakout"" role that has taken her career to new heights. Surprisingly, as juvenile as this picture can be, this really didn't jump-start any future projects for her. Nor anyone else in this film.Starring: Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, and John Goodman. Directed by: David McNally.",Coyote Ugly
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,Predictable but always a fun time!,6,1 May 2007,"I honestly have wanted to see Coyote Ugly for a while and I finally thought of it when I was renting some movies, so I just watched it on Friday night and while I could predict every second of this movie, I have to admit, it's still a fun movie that I think anyone could get a little kick out of. It's a cool teen movie with fun music, hot actors, and one of those ""tubular Dawson's Creek"" stories. But I thought it had it's moments that made it an enjoyable movie, especially the girls dancing, they provided some fun entertainment. It had a couple laughs here and there, but it was more of a drama type of teen movie.Violet is a young song writer who has big dreams of going to New York and getting her songs published and sung. But of course, she goes with very big disappointments ahead of her. She gets tricked into giving her tape to a guy, with a pretty corny accent by the way, Kevin, and he is fascinated with her. But she's making no money and goes to a sexy bar where girls dance and tease guys while they bar tend, but her dignity has been stripped away while making tons of money, and her career takes the back seat, oh, will she realize the error of her ways and follow her heart back to Kevin? I guess you will just have to see.The acting is pretty corny and so is the story, but it's all good, for a teen movie, it's a fun one that I think people need to give a better chance too. It has sexy actors and is everything any teen drama fan would like! Lol, well, all I can say is just to sit back and enjoy, don't be too judgmental, this was a cool movie and had it's entertaining moments, as silly as it was, I'm sure you'll like this movie if you let go of all you know that is movie knowledge and might just find yourself dancing along to Coyote Ugly.6/10",Coyote Ugly

18,DKosty123,Good Idea Hollywoodized,2,11 August 2008,"This film is based upon a true story based upon a bar in NYC. Too bad they had to Hollywoodize the main character. It comes off in total more like a female version of the male bar movie Cocktail. The main female lead character role seems like she was based upon a real person, but then her phobia seems to be manipulated in order to pull in the viewer. This manipulation insults the viewer and treads too far from the main story.The main story here should be the bar. There are times when the bar almost takes over. If it had, instead of having a contrived story based upon truth, the story would have rang more true and been a much better film. It could have been closer to televisions CHEERS where ultimately, the bar always was the focus.The things to watch for are the women who are good looking, and a solid workman like performance from John Goodman. There is half a chick flick here as young chicks might enjoy this though older woman sleep through it. The music is good including the talented LeeAnn Rhymes. This helps it avoid being awful, but there is no real classic material in this one.",Coyote Ugly

She meets Kevin ( aussie Adam Garcia.) and gets a job working in a crazy, popular bar. Now her dreams of singing are getting put on the back burner. She seems to put her own roadblocks up, since she says she's too scared to sing in front of an audience. But she performs in front of the crowd at the bar every single day! Her dad is John Goodman.

20,atlasmb,Entertaining Film of a Young Woman Following Her Dream,6,3 July 2014,"For me, ""Coyote Ugly"" is worth watching because of Piper Perabo (who plays Violet). I am a fan, having seen most of her films and every episode of ""Covert Affairs"". She's the spunky girl who follows her dreams. The story is reminiscent of ""Flashdance"". Violet is a small town girl who wants to become a songwriter and/or singer, but suffers from stage fright.In order to survive in New York City, she takes a bartending job at Coyote Ugly--a rowdy, high-energy joint where the girls are expected to dance provocatively on the bar, sell as many drinks as possible, and appear available--where she discovers her inner chutzpah.The soundtrack is immensely popular and the music helps drive the action. Violet's singing is dubbed by LeAnn Rimes, who makes an appearance on screen. The film has a competent cast including John Goodman, Maria Bello, and others who are fun to spot.Don't think too much while watching this film. Just relax and enjoy the music, the energy, and the formulaic story of a young woman learning to make it on her own.The name (of the bar) Coyote Ugly is a monument to the concept of getting mindlessly drunk.",Coyote Ugly
21,leplatypus,Not ugly and definitively not a bar movie as well (DVD),7,29 May 2011,"The cover with all the girls having fun in a bar isn't accurate because the bar intrigue and the friends are really a subplot. The story focuses really of the life of Violet and as a ""dreams come true"" movie, this one is really superior to ""Honey"". The reason is that even as a newcomer, Piper Parabo is definitely a better actress than Jessica Alba! She is really moving with her feelings and i like the way she manages her relationship with her father and her boyfriend. The final moments are maybe a bit rushed but i have enjoyed the journey. And what about the coyotes then? Well, they are in the back: the dance and drinks aren't so many and it's a good thing because getting drunk in a bar while peeping girls isn't my habit. Now i understand why it's a Disney production because it focuses on dreams and not booze and if the girls get loose, there is nothing scandalous.",Coyote Ugly
22,damianphelps,I Did Enjoy it...however,6,23 January 2021,"This movie is as formulaic as baby formula....very predictable which to me is a sign of lazy writing, producing and directing.Its also a 15 year old boys wet dream!Where the movie works is generally a good soundtrack and any scene that has John Goodman in it.Where it fails is any time they focus on her song writing.Released in 2000 the film drips 90's clichés.Still overall the movie has enough highpoints (and John Goodman) to be entertaining and earn itself a little more than a pass mark.",Coyote Ugly
23,Anonymous_Maxine,"Unfortunately, the Internet Movie Database only allows 1,000 words, which is not nearly enough to sufficiently communicate how horrible this movie is.",2,8 September 2000,"The drawback of watching the huge amount of movies that I watch is that you find yourself watching the same previews over and over again. I saw the preview for Coyote Ugly so many times that I was sick and tired of the movie before it was even released. I was unable to decipher any kind of plot from the preview, and the reason is simple. If the producers had allowed the preview to reveal the extensively recycled and re-done and re-made and used up plot, no one would have bothered to watch the movie. From a business point of view, that's very understandable, and I respect the decision not to reveal how shallow this movie is too early on. However, after seeing the entire film, I have realized that Coyote Ugly is packed full of every cliche ever created by every unoriginal and boring film ever made in cinematic history.(spoilers) Young kid decides to leave home to pursue wild dreams in the big city. Encounters difficulties, gets robbed, decides to go home, father encourages her to keep trying, success is inevitably and laughably attained. I accurately predicted at least 80% of everything that happened in this film. Did anyone not know that there would be a robbery at her new apartment in New York? Was anyone surprised that she would have some sort of superficial problem getting her music heard? Is it that hard to predict she would succeed at the end? Okay, I'll admit that if she failed, the movie probably would never have been made (what a relief that would have been). You can't put a Fight Club ending or an Arlington Road ending on a movie like this. But look at the way the entire movie panned out. Violet was completely isolated from reality during the entire film. Think about the logic here. Violet goes to New York to become a star, but obviously has trouble getting a record executive to listen to her music. She goes home one day to find her apartment robbed. This is the pathetic attempt to make it seem like the real world, but even if it did do that, this is where it stopped. For the rest of the film, everything worked out perfectly. The first guy she meets becomes her wonderful new boyfriend. The first group of girls she overhears in a diner are talking about the lucrative jobs they have, and how one is leaving and there will soon be a difficult effort to replace her. This very same bar happens to be the hottest bar in town, and when Violet inquires about the opening, she is hired within minutes. You gotta be kidding me.Besides all that, everything that happened in the plot is just recycled garbage that has been seen dozens of times before. Violet finds a cute new boyfriend. They get in the usual fight somewhere in the middle of the film, and when she tries to call thinking she wants to apologize or something, she hangs up a split second before he grabs up his receiver, anxiously saying ""Hello? Hello?"" to the usual dialtone. She goes to his house to make things right, and just as she shows up, he's got some girl walking into his apartment (THAT was the most predictable element of all). But wait! He's not sleeping with her, he's showing her the apartment to see if she might want to move in! He's a sweetheart after all! How about Violet's job? Obviously some problem has to come up (the suddenly lonely parent, as always, winding up in the hospital), and she has to get fired at least once. When she does, she decides to get a job at a quiet little restaurant (which, for some reason, doesn't seem to have electricity), but eventually goes back to her old job. The bar scenes were both laughable and ridiculously exaggerated. No bar in the world looks like that, and even if one did, there would not be scantily clad female bartenders dancing on the bar every few minutes, and even if there were, there would be about 50 bouncers, not just one. You would think a policy or two would change when the airheaded blonde Cammie was pulled into the crowd and fondled by a bunch of drunks. I guess nothing came of that because she didn't seem upset about it at all. Every bar scene in this film was the result not of skillful filmmaking, but of audience manipulation.What a pathetic waste of time. Everything in this movie has been done before, and it has never been done worse than it was done here. Even though New York City is portrayed terribly, at least they thought to throw in an acute bit of stage fright for Violet so she would have a problem that coincides slightly with reality, even though this was also ridiculously unoriginal (ever see Runaway Bride? EXACTLY the same thing). Coyote Ugly is an awful movie. It follows a formula that is more easily decipherable than the script, and it is the kind of film that will probably be hugely entertaining to you if you have never seen a movie. If you don't like being jerked around at the movie theater, avoid this garbage.",Coyote Ugly
24,robert-temple-1,The Adventures of Piper Perabo in Manhattan,8,27 April 2013,"I decided to watch this film because I admire the work of the young actress Piper Perabo, who has been so brilliant and charming as the lead character in the ongoing series COVERT AFFAIRS. The reason why she is called 'Piper' is not because she is a tropical bird who makes strange sounds in the jungle, but because she was named after the fifties movie actress Piper Laurie, remember her? But the reason why she looks so unusual is that she is half Norwegian and half Portuguese, a mixture so rare that we have never seen one before and may never see one again. She attended high school in Toms River, New Jersey, one of the small New Jersey towns I have actually been to long ago, strange that. (How many people have been to Toms River? If you have six fingers on one hand that's too many.) I first encountered her on screen in SLAP HER SHE'S FRENCH (2002, see my review), in which she and the whole film were equally hilarious. She was also in the wonderfully funny BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA (2008, see my review). So I thought I would jump from chihuahuas to coyotes and see what that was all about. Well, what a shock. All those girls dancing on the top of a bar in a Manhattan bar called Coyote Ugly, the girls themselves being called 'coyotes'! I got a DVD of what is called the extended cut, whatever was extended. This is in some ways what is called a chick flic, but not really. Perabo plays a good little girl from the tiny South Amboy, New Jersey (is that an in joke of some kind?), who gets the nickname 'Jersey'. She loves her dad who is a widower, excellently played by John Goodman, who has just the right sentimental sad sack tone for the part. Perfect casting there. She falls for the quirky Australian actor Adam Garcia, who has just the right amount of whimsy and works at a grill, so that is the love story part of it. She moves into the most terrible filthy and collapsing apartment in China Town, but seems to love it. But it's the bar that makes your jaw drop far below floor level. The girls cavort on the bar from where they throw buckets of water and buckets of ice cubes all over the patrons, and the patrons just love it. Everybody drinks bottles of whiskey and it gets poured all over the counter and the people too. Perabo wants to be a song-writer, like her deceased mother, but is too shy to sing her own songs in public. She takes a job as a coyote to pay the rent. The girls are all dressed in as little as possible and, as the woman owner puts it, 'must give the impression of being available while not really being available'. Perabo slowly warms up to this, which is not exactly her thing. There are numerous ups and downs, not to mention sideways wriggles, and Perabo is forced to sing to the patrons of the bar to stop a violent fight, which means she has sung in public for the first time by accident. Eventually after endless rebuffs she gets someone to listen to one of her own songs. There is a lot of very good satire of the music business in the film. Perabo's father comes to the bar unexpectedly one night and is shocked, and this makes for problems, as he says he never thought he could be ashamed of her but he is. She gets fired but then gets rehired. She realizes she is not a natural coyote. The pure unrestrained anarchy of the bar is really something to see and behold, though pardon me if I don't go searching for such a place, for as much as I can cope with anarchy, I really don't want to be soaked with buckets of water all evening and forced to drink that much whiskey. I'll give it a miss. Nor do I necessarily think girls should be demeaning themselves by wriggling on bar tops. It goes against my male feminist principles. But still! It's a movie! And there she is, Piper Perabo with her girlish smile, surviving it all somehow, for after all she has a big future ahead of her as the world's cutest super-spy in COVERT AFFAIRS (to be reviewed).",Coyote Ugly

The scenery was nice, though. Piper Perabo, who I had never heard of, has beauty and charm, and I am sure she will turn up again. John Goodman NEVER mails it in, no matter how insipid his role or the film, and he was up to his usual form here. I thought the strongest performance was by Maria Bello, and I was far more impressed by her here than in her stint on ""E.R."", the only other place I had seen her. The plot was predictable and formulaic. The bar was kind of interesting. Why would all those people flock to that sort of place, instead of just going to a strip club?

If you have never seen another movie, all this might seem new to you.  If you've seen any of the ones I mentioned, or have lived on this planet for longer than five months, you can see it all coming a mile away. 
The plot (you should excuse the expression) is paper thin, the acting is amateurish for a high school play and the biggest complaint of all is its not bad enough to be good..its just bad enough to be bad. 
I DID enjoy seeing Melanie Lynskey, who was so memorable in 'Heavenly Creatures' and she did a passable New Jersey accent.  I guess you have to pay bills, but I hope she gets better opportunities in better movies before she is stuck in the second female lead forever.  I enjoyed Perabo much more in 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' but part of that could be because she is not carrying the whole movie with that one.  She does not have the screen presence necessary for you to even consider the possibility that you are seeing a future star.  She might be a legit actress someday, but you can't tell from anything seen here.  She is not helped by a dreadful script, though.",Coyote Ugly

Why is this happening? What kind of moron would use such a contorted device to advance a story? Unfortunately, Coyote Ugly doesn't not want to be a descent music movie, it wants to be Showgirls; a bad decision. I'll give points to the choreographer for staging a bar dancing style that doesn't rely so much on nudity to sell (unlike Showgirls), however that fact that the movie spends more time on such sequences than it does on anything else, results in Coyote Ugly being pretty Indescent. On the other hand, Coyote Ugly, is a much nicer film than Showgirls. There are fewer A**holes in the cast of characters, and far more laughs (although some may be unintentional)None of this however changes the fact that the storyline is tripe. Of course the intended audience won't care, but even if one treats the film as pure eye candy, its effectiveness doesn't go beyond moderate.

It is certainly watchable and not near as bad as some would make it out to be. I'ts even fun in some areas.What is lacking however is any originality. It is completely generic. Cookie cutter is a great word. I had a problem with that aspect of it, that and the complete lack of believability in anything about it.Violet (I'm sorry, beautiful name but this girl did not look like a ""violet""-Cindy, Stacy maybe but not Violet) is determined to become a song writer and moves to the big bad apple to do just that. Yet from the opening scene(WARNING-SPOILERS THROUT REST OF POST) we know exactly where this movie is going, the predictable formulated movie problems that will get in her way, the movie characters that will appear and how it will all end.This movie reminded me of two others-flashdance meets cocktail-Yet even though I don't think either of those movies was particularly great they had something that I can't put my finger on that was lacking in Ugly.The strengths of the movie was in the quirky cast and the actual bar scenes-this is a perfect movie to watch when you don't want to concentrate to hard because you don't have to with this. Yet although this movie was better then it was reported to be, it was also light years away from being anywhere near as good as it could have been. There was a lack of buildup toward things-characters simply appear, things happen that are so unrealistic they border on ridiculous-take away the racy dancing on bars and a few other things and this could have been a 1 hour after school special on going for your dreams etc etc-not that all after school specials are bad but there is this unreal quality to the movie-and a rush at the end to make it feel good that reminded me of a high school version of cocktail(a better movie in my opinion). A good example is the whole painfully dull ordeal of Violet getting to the club in time to sing her song and become a star(which you know through all the u turns, screaming and general hysteria is gonna happen anyway).Still, the movie wasn't all bad-good looking characters,fun dancing and singing, a few great one liners-all combined to make Coyote a pleasant movie view if not outstanding. 6 out of 10 is my vote.",Coyote Ugly

Decisions of who to cast and how much skin to show are now determined to the millimetre, it seems, by simple, cold algorithms.  There's no spontaneity whatever.  I'm aware how silly I sound in saying this, but if you must watch ""Coyote Ugly"", don't do so for the chicks - watch it for the story.  It's another slickly produced, enjoyably formulaic tale from the Bruckheimer factory, and since the selling point is this time ersatz sexiness rather than ersatz violence, it's a good deal less offensive than most.

40,jhclues,So Much More Than Expected,7,16 September 2000,"A talented young woman from New Jersey, filled with hope and desire, moves to New York to chase her dreams of becoming a songwriter in `Coyote Ugly,' directed by David McNally and starring Piper Perabo.  Against the wishes of her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to show business discovers:  It's tough out there.  Soon, in order to pay the rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her `audition (work one night)' to see if she can handle their kind of action.  It's a tough gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if she's to succeed.  And that is really what this movie is all about:  Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all through. 	Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh, somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character makes it easy to connect with her right away.  She becomes someone you care about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately.  There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as an actress.  John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter at heart. His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional bond between them and the audience.  It's something with which many will be able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the film. 	One of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the movie itself, but from the `promotion' of the movie; in this case the theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what `Coyote Ugly' really is. Certainly the `coyotes' and the bar are a significant part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by the preview.  It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a profane word, and no sex or nudity in it.  It is an upbeat, entertaining film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one would expect simply from seeing the trailer. The excellent supporting cast includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a cameo as herself).  Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will gain the audience it deserves.  Reminiscent of `Flashdance,' there is a universal theme here of having a dream and going for it.  In the final analysis, `Coyote Ugly' is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's ever had or pursued a dream.  Do yourself a favor, put any preconceived notions aside and check this one out; I think you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 7/10.",Coyote Ugly

On the level of pure, mindless entertainment they usually work; they certainly make him and his team buckets of money. In ""Coyote Ugly"" Jerry takes his style and applies it to the romance genre. It doesn't work.Yes, the production values are super slick, and the story, although unoriginal, holds promise. To digress, Violet (Piper Parabo), pizza joint songbird from New Jersey, pulls up stakes and heads for Manhattan to hit the big time. To pay her bills while launching her music career, she bartends at Coyote Ugly, a bar where the female bartenders dance, prance, and sing (all very suggestively) for a raucous male clientele. It's all very predictable from the stage fright, the romantic misunderstandings, the trouble at the barwill her career get launched, love find its way, the bar remain open? Need you ask?   Since we've plowed this ground many times before it's the 'getting there' that should provide the entertainment. But thanks to an incredibly bad script, getting there is an unintended laugher. At this level the film works, but if you want to take it seriously, I'm sorry, it fails.",Coyote Ugly
42,TOMASBBloodhound,More watchable than it probably deserves to be.,6,8 June 2008,"The director listed for this movie is someone named David McNally. Who? The writing credits are given to Gina Wenkos. Who? Actually Kevin Smith apparently did some work on the script, I hear. Anyway, there is only one name that matters in these credits. Jerry Bruckheimer. Of all the slick, commercial, featherweight productions this man has made, this one might be the most slick. And that's saying something. Coyote Ugly almost makes Days of Thunder look like Shawshank Redemption.That said, the movie is often rather entertaining. Much of the credit would seem to go to Piper Perabo who plays the main character. Her name is Violet, and she's just moved to New York to pursue a song writing career, but it seems like the big city will swallow her up before she ever gets her chance. She ends up taking a job at the bar of record, and the rest of the film details the ups and downs of her time there. It must be noted that Piper Perabo is not only beautiful, but quite charming and likable. As someone watching the movie, you really hope she succeeds. A bad casting choice here could have really given us a turkey of a film. The rest of the cast is spunky, and generally talented. Maria Bello shines as Lil, the owner of the bar. She is actually based on Lil Lovell who was the founder of the franchise. Adam Garcia shows some promise as the male lead, but its a thankless role. John Goodman adds some laughs and acting gravitas as Violet's dad. Tom Brady's baby momma Bridget Moynahan is there as a bitchy bartender. A chunky LeAnn Rimes plays herself in an ending scene. She also provides the vocals whenever Piper is singing. Tyra Banks isn't in it as much as you'd hope.There is not a shred of credibility in any situation we the audience are presented with. For example, the Coyote Ugly bar is about the rowdiest bar east of the Double Duece in Jasper, MO. Yet, there is only ONE bouncer who sits by the door and mostly just reads. Fights in this bar can be broken up simply by throwing a bucket of ice down on the crazy patrons. Violet lives in Chinatown, yet there are never any Asian people around. Kevin seems to be broke and has to do all kinds of odd jobs around town, yet he drives a huge gas-guzzling old car when public transportation would be the likely choice for such a person. Or how about the scene where Violet has just humiliated herself and is hiding out in the bathroom. Another bartender gal informs her that there is a guy at the bar asking about her. ""Asking for me?"", Violet asks, completely stunned. Because obviously nobody in a bar full of drunk men would ever ask around about a hot new employee. Sure. But this film takes place in a magical dimension known as Bruckheimer Land, where the improbable is not just possible. It is demanded. You know, here's a big question..... since this film was such a hit, why was there never a sequel? Since 85% of all films released from Hollywood now are either a remake, sequel, or based on a comic book, why was no sequel for Coyote Ugly ever made. Heck, this summer we're getting sequels for Hell Boy, and the Hulk. Those weren't even hits!!! 6 of 10 stars for Coyote Ugly.The Hound.",Coyote Ugly
43,stamper,Good film and great fun,8,14 April 2001,"First of all I must say that I was pretty disappointed in the cover of this film, which had me believing that Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) was the hottest of the five, while in the film she was the ugliest Coyote. The rest all more or less made an impression similar to the one on the box. But on to the film itself. I liked it and I liked it a lot. You can call me a romantic ba***rd but still I liked it. Almost everything about it. Ok I admit this is a film with not much depth or twists but it is really great fun from the moment 'Jersey' (Piper Perabo) leaves her house to the predictable ending. The best scenes in my opinion the ones in which we see 'Jersey' singing her own songs (damn she, or better LeAnn Rimes, can sing) and it makes me wonder why the Can't fight the Moonlight became the single for this movie.
Moving on, there is everything you could possibly want in this movie, hot chicks, dancing, romance, fights, comedy and last but certainly not least a good deal of great music. All the actors and actresses are good, but I especially liked seeing John Goodman again in a good part. Highly recommended because highly enjoyable. Plus it just might change your perspective on life.

47,Atreyu_II,Not more than just a movie for teens,7,28 April 2008,"Considering that ""Coyote Ugly"" is a teen-movie, it isn't even bad. In fact, it is quite better than most of those nasty teen-movies (such as the ""American Pie"" movies, ""There's Something About Mary"", ""Cross Roads"", etc...), but nothing extraordinary. Nevertheless, it is still entertaining enough and has its fun, as well as its moments.The best things about this movie are the good pop soundtrack and the beautiful Piper Perabo as a very seductive girl. The plot is predictable but okay. The dialogs/lines are okay. The romantic atmosphere combined with humor is good in my personal opinion. There is some language in this movie, but fortunately it has no disgusting dialogs or profanity. There is also some drama, without being very intense, however.Piper Perabo portrays Violet Sanford, a very sexy and sensual character, but also a very friendly and lovable character. Adam Garcia portrays Kevin O'Donnell, a likable, funny and cool dude.While not necessarily a great movie, ""Coyote Ugly"" is however underrated. It deserves a little higher rating than this, if you ask me.For teenagers, it's very easy to enjoy this movie. As for adults, I won't say they will dislike, but most of them will certainly not be as pleased with it as teens.",Coyote Ugly

Perhaps the problem is a sensible script is reduced to a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The name alone is synonymous with everything wrong with modern cinema: movies that sell sex rather than show it, movies that at best can only parody actual human life, movies that seem manufactured rather than made...it sucks. Maybe for you this is a great movie and you had fun seeing it, that makes you lucky in my book, but me, I had the misfortune to see this movie, not a high point in my day, in fact I watch it now and again just to try to take back from this crap movie whatever it took from me the first time I saw it.

The movie follows all the necessary steps (work sucks at first, meets boyfriend, work's getting better, boyfriend is great, breakdown at work, break-up with boyfriend, thinking about returning, chat with dad that she has to stay to make it, finally makes up with boyfriend and makes it in music industry). Now, we've all seen it before (showgirls comes to mind), but it's carried out really good in this movie.

52,bopdog,"Familiar story still has great energy, and works for me!!!",8,5 August 2000,"Not bad, not bad. I read reviews that criticized the cliche-ness of this movie, and I can see their point. At times the plot made the characters a little bit annoying. But hey-- story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal ""truths,"" or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.This movie is interesting-- it is engaging, and even touching at times. I DID care about the characters throughout the story. I wanted to see how things would work out for them, and I wanted them to win. Sure, the plot is kind of predictable-- but the energy kept the theme in the forefront, and I AM interested in the theme presented here-- love, taking risks, courage, and all of that. The women actors were wonderful-- hot, sure, but also outrageous in an innocent kind of way. I had the sense that none of the characters in the movie, even the raunchy extras in the bar scenes, was belittled. I suspected the writers, director, cast, etc., had a basic affection for their subjects and topic.The dancing was great-- I noted ""dancing doubles"" in the credits for all of the girls-- and the bar tricks and stunts were fun. I enjoyed pretending that those stunts were even possible, and that they wouldn't have killed 7 people the first night they were tried in a real bar in real life. I gave this one an ""8"" out of 10. Go see it-- you'll like it!",Coyote Ugly
53,FlickJunkie-2,Insubstantial but highly entertaining,7,22 February 2001,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is ""Flashdance"" lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous `Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 7/10.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  He knows how to push our buttons.",Coyote Ugly

He and Piper had such an amazing chemistry on the film, it was great. Melanie Lynskey puts in a small but cute performance as Violets best friend, Gloria and John Goodman is great as Violets dad, William. Maria Bello (Lil.) makes a really cool boss and is obviously the one who hires Violet to work at Coyote Ugly and Izabella Miko, (Cammie.) Bridget Moynahan, (Rachel .) and Del Pentecost (Lou.) make really good co-workers to the bar. With a small performance from Tyra Banks as Zoe. The music in the film is brilliant and it was really cool to see LeAnn Rimes in the film singing the theme tune to Coyote Ugly-'Can't fight the moonlight.' The soundtrack to movie is brilliant too and includes four LeAnn Rimes' songs. Among many other great tunes. Coyote Ugly is a great film. It's one for the guys and girls.

56,oOoBarracuda,Coyote Ugly,1,24 March 2017,"David McNally directed the sexually charged Coyote Ugly at the turn of the millennium. His film starred Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia in the familiar tale of a girl leaving her small town to try to make it in the big city. If you're thinking ""I've seen this storyline before, do I need to see Coyote Ugly"" the answer is no. The film is just as boring and formulaic as it seems despite girls dancing on top of bars while pouring pitchers of water on themselves--I suddenly realize why the film grossed so much. Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is tired of waiting tables at a diner in her small town in New Jersey and only writing her music part-time. She is ready to make the leap to nearby New York and begin the pursuit of her songwriting endeavors full-time. After finishing her last shift at the diner and getting a wonderful send off from her friends, Violet goes home to pack the car for the move. Her father, Bill (John Goodman) is reluctant to let his only daughter loose in The Big Apple, and it's clear that she has taken a parental role over her father since her mother's death years prior. He eventually is as supportive as he can be with her departure. After arriving at the run-down apartment which is all she can afford, Violet's best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) hides money in Violet's freezer that she is reluctant to take. After several disappointments in trying to get the mixtapes of her songs to studios and agents, Violet finds herself disappointed and rejected. When she returns home to find her apartment ransacked and her belongings stolen Violet cries and questions whether or not she should return home. While out for a slice of pie to drown her sorrows, Violet overhears a conversation between several girls waving money around at a nearby table. Violet gathers that they are ""coyotes"" working at a nearby bar. Following the bread crumbs she has sniffed out, Violet seeks the bar out looking for a quick way to make a lot of money. Violet is initially stunned to find out that the bar she has happened upon is a city hotspot in which the girls comprise a team of sexy women who entice patrons to pay for the show they put on. The rest of the girls can sniff out Violet's small-town upbringing, but what they can't sniff out is the passion for her dreams that will push her to do whatever it takes to succeed. Oh, of course, there is a love interest that initially looks like it's not going to work out.Of course, she's from a small town and wants to move to a big city, of course, she's the parental figure in her single parent home, of course, her apartment gets broken into, of course she loses everything she's saved for months, of course her friend from back home left money in the freezer, of course she overheard that there would be a position open at the bar, of course she was too shy to dance on top of a bar, of course she had outdated technology making it near impossible to adequately get her art distributed, of course, she had a love interest that she was reluctant towards, of course, she had stage fright--except when she was with the coyotes, and of course she eventually made it. I'm not kidding when I say this is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen in my life. It's also aged horribly and was difficult to watch, as most films that prominently feature technology, clothes, and music. Throughout the entire film, when I'm supposed to be buying into how hard this beautiful white woman's life is, I kept asking myself, ""how hard can your life really be, you have perfect hair--if all else fails, shampoo commercials. A film as predictable and lazy as this just has nowhere to land with me, and few redeeming qualities about it, with the exception of John Goodman, he's always good--certainly the bright spot of this pile of garbage.",Coyote Ugly
57,statuskuo,20 Years Later Revisiting This,6,16 April 2020,"After 20 years, I'd have to say...it doesn't hold up that well. BUT, that's not to say, it brings a tug of nostalgia for that era of Jerry Bruckheimer slick music video retreads of ""Flashdance""
A lot of it is due to Diane Warren's corny soundtrack music. And those of us who were in college by now, have a slight shiver when we hear her anthems. Which nearly toppled another Jerry Bruckheimer gem ""Con Air"" with ""How Do I Live Without You"" Oof.The present day woman would consider that dis-empowering to be so attached to a man (or perhaps this could be used towards other women). Speaking of which, the topic at hand is ""Coyote Ugly."" Presumably, an article led to this story (written by Gina Wendkos). I recall a friend had moved to New York City and discovered a bar called Hogs and Heifers, which shared very similar rambunctious behavior (nailing bras to the wall). And dancing on bars and so forth. In Jerry Bruckheimer world...it's PG-13. So none of the topless stuff is displayed (unless you get the unrated DVD/Blu-Ray which shows Piper Perabo's funbags).Though this movie is about making it in the big city, it is somewhat laughable at the truncated timeline. Within a few weeks Violet Sanford (Perabo) becomes the hottest songwriter in the country with a number 1 hit that is sung by Leanne Rhimes. And though these girls are suppose to be world and tough, the painfully model casting of...Tyra Banks, Bridget Moynahan, Izabella Miko and Maria Bello set this in a truly fantastical mystical world I'd reserve for...um...say Hollywood. If that was the intention than kudos to director David McNally. To me, it seems less genuine. Jennifer Beals would seem like a dog up agains these girls.
Any way, great to see John Goodman pop up as Violet's New Jersey dad (though still seems like he can't shake that Dan Conner-ness) and Bud Cort's very small cameo.
Clearly this movie was made to rake in the jiggle factor. So, cheers to them for recognizing what it exists for. Also special note to cinematographer Amir Mokri. Great lighting. I feel this may get a re-release in the future. That will stand up well.",Coyote Ugly

And I must admit, my buddies and I were part of the huge public that figured this is going to be a great T & A movie.  Well, we were right; however David McNally went and snuck in a great, yes great, story. At first it may sound like just another small town girl moves to big town in hopes of making it big.  And you're right, but this isn't just that, it's laced full of great acting by Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, and the great John Goodman. Violet Sanford (Perabo) wants to be a song writer and saves all her money, from working at the local pizza place, to move to New York City.  Naturally her dad, William Sanford (Goodman), doesn't want her to go.  She inevitably moves out, and into a run down apartment in ""The City."" There she encounters every problem imaginable trying to get her songs heard by music execs.  She meets Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who at first lies to her and says that he can get her tape heard, but finally gets found out. Instead of getting hurt, Violet begins to fall in love with Kevin. When all desperation is coming to an end, Violet meets a manager of a bar, Lil (Bello), and ""auditions"" to work for her in the bar.  As the preview shows, this is not your regular corner bar.  Violet, now ""Jersey"", has a horrible first night, but sticks with it, and by the movies end, is the best one at the bar. The movie does have a few sappy scenes, and I actually did get a little choked up at one particular scene with Violet, and her dad, but all in all this is a ""feel good"" movie. That's not to say that there is nothing wrong with the movie though.  I think, being a mere 91 minutes long, that it is a bit short, and probably could have gone into Violet's childhood a little.  And I didn't feel anything for the love interest in Violet's life.  I didn't care for the choice of Adam Garcia for this role. This movie definitely has a great deal of T & A, a wet T-shirt scene come to mind, but it's much more then that.  Please trust me when I say that this is a MUST SEE movie.",Coyote Ugly
62,bat-5,It's Flashdance meets Cocktail,5,20 August 2000,"Seems Jerry Bruckheimer is running out of ideas these days.  He's now recycling material from nearly twenty years ago.  With Coyote Ugly, we have the story of a young New Jersey girl moving from NJ to the big bad city of Manhattan.  There, she learns that life in the city is tough and the only way to write music is up on the top of your roof.  Violet, played by Piper Perabo, does have some moments where she has some true defining moments as a character, but those are few and far between.  She finds the titular bar and promptly begins work there with the other barmaids.  They jump, they dance, the light the place on fire all to the tune of heavy pounding rock music.  The one bright spot about this movie is John Goodman.  As Violet's father, he brings some humor and life into an otherwise dull story that has all the plot twists of an unwound pretzel.  And as for Tyra Banks, I don't know why she was cast.  Her character vanishes before the first act is even over.  Lets just hope Bruckheimer doesn't mix any other films together.",Coyote Ugly

The women are sexy and sexual but empowered. The dancing scenes are more about the group interaction and the scene of the scantily clad guy dancing on the bar top is in the context of him being auctioned off.It is through this environment where sexy women are in control of their sexuality that Violet become empowered and gets the chance to follow her dreams.Over all this is a fun movie though a little contrite.

69,Shiva-11,It wasn't as bad as I thought (of course it may just be the hormones talking),6,4 August 2000,"Coyote Ugly: Coyote Ugly: Rather than follow the classic script - marry your high school sweetheart, settle down in a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 kids and a dog named spot, Violet sets off  (against her father's wishes)  for New York to fulfill her dreams as a songwriter.  Our heroine soon discovers that life in the big city isn't easy, and getting noticed in the music business is even worse.  In order to make ends meet she gets a job as a bartender at a local bar. Let the games begin.I've always found it interesting that women (at least the ones I know) will go to a movie, no matter how bad it looks, as long as their favorite star (Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, etc) is in it.  I can't stand the thought of an actor I enjoy being in a lousy movie, and tend to avoid them like the plague.   But all that came to a crashing halt when I saw the trailer for ""Coyote Ugly"" - I didn't think ""Hey, this is the movie based on the GQ article"" or ""This looks like an interesting story"".  The only thought that came to mind was ""Wow!""  So much for my credibilityProducer Jerry Bruckheimer, known for such testosterone laden dramas as ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock"",  has dropped the guns and explosions in favor of bars and bombshells (the non-exploding kind) in this homage to ""Flashdance"". The first half-hour of the movie is like a trip to a strip bar with several notable exceptions: the girls look better, they keep their clothes (what little they happen to be wearing) on, they can actually dance, the crowd is mixed and everyone is having a great time.  Furthermore, you don't have to worry about a cover charge, choking on smoke, or paying $6 for a watered down beer.  Unfortunately, they choose to spoil the fun with a ""plot""- it seems that our little Violet has performance anxiety and gets involved with a cute do-gooder boytoy.  Will she triumph over her fears, become a success, and marry her Prince Charming?  Honest, it's not predictable (note: heavy sarcasm alert!). They should have spent more time in the bar and less time in reflection.  Story aside, there actually are some good performances.The casting call for the part of Violet involved hundreds of girls and I can say without fear of reprisal or recrimination that they found exactly what they were looking for in Piper Perabo - she is cute, dynamic and possessed of a wide-eyed innocence that is genuine.   Not only does she have to look adorable, but she had to take piano, guitar, and singing and dancing lessons for the role (doing quite well at each I might add).  It was also a pleasure to see Maria Bello once a again - she was the no-nonsense-tough-as-nails doctor on ER who quit to pursue other interests and whom I feared would join David Caruso at the ""Home for Abandoned Actors"".   If your script calls for a ""Gutsy Broad"" she's your woman.  The one piece of casting that sticks out worse than sunflower in a field of tulips is Tyra Banks - her character retires from the bar to go to law school.  Please, the only way I'm going to buy that one is if I've had one too many drinks beforehand - I would try to diminish her successes in any way, she is a beautiful, successful, vibrant woman, but by her own admission, if you're looking for brains from her, you had best look elsewhere. In summary, if you are searching for a tightly written cohesive plot, beautiful cinematography, suspense, or deep characters, this is not the movie for you.  If however you want to watch the beautiful people have some fun and don't feel like thinking for awhile, this may make for an entertaining matinee.",Coyote Ugly
70,Brogan,Babe-O-Rama.,5,11 August 2000,"COYOTE UGLY is a nice romantic/drama/comedy that is uplifting and delightful.  It brings hope that no matter where you come from in the U.S. you can always make it in the big bad city. Except that I've already seen almost every John Cusack and John Hughes film, so it becomes routine and cliche.  If you haven't seen those films, which chances are you have, since they are in color, then COYOTE UGLY is nothing new. Every movie were a girl from a small town goes to a big city, either New York City or Los Angeles.  This time it's New York, but the main star, Violet (Piper Perabo) wants to become a songwriter, but she needs to pay for rent and other necessities (my guess is make-up).  So she goes from recording studio to studio dropping off her tapes for recording agents can listen to, but then that crummy copyright law gets in the way, damn lawyers. So what is Violet to do but to work in a evening hot spot bar called Coyote Ugly.  The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello) a energetic boss/bartender who is concerned about making money and not breaking the law.  There are other bartender's as well, Cammie (Izabella Miko) a sweet and kind bartender who usually melts men's hearts with her dancing.  Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) a tough as nails woman who releases her agression on the male customers.  And Zoe (Tyra Banks) a bartender who's on her way out to go to law school.  And what the women do at the bar is like a mixture of SHOWGIRLS and COCKTAIL.  They dance very erotic while pouring drinks, (hey, why can't every city have a bar like these?)  And the girls bring in lots of money nightly, mega bucks amount. While Violet is learning the ropes at the bar, and saving her money, she builds up a romance with a man who has multiple jobs, Kevin (Adam Garcia). And Violet communicates with her worried some father (John Goodman) who takes money at a toll booth. One thing that ran through my mind with COYOTE UGLY is that it is the most erotic and sexiest pronography where everyone keeps thier clothes on. The way these women dance, it comes close to a strip club dance than anything else.  The other thing that ran through my mind is the plot.  I kept guessing on what was going to happen, and I was right.  It's a romantic routine film, girl meets boy, they fall in love, they fight, they make-up, etc. What did I like about this movie?  Well, first there are the women, they are attractive and very beautiful.  Also each girl has a flame of talent that is begging to get out, however director David McNally sticks with the routine and shows too little of the girls at the bar and more with just Violet trying to succeed.  Then there's the two charming men, Adam Garcia and John Goodman.  Garcia is enjoyable as the romantic male, he is funny and charming at times, but he's also hammy and cheesy. And speaking of food, John Goodman is also funny as the father of Violet who refuses to diet and to watch over his little girl. But it's that darn bloody script that ruins everything.  It's a script that could be shown in a screenwriting class, in fact I think they have shown it in my class.  The typical rags from riches story, just with five women shaking their stuff while serving alcohol, man's two favorite things. When I talked to producer Jerry Bruckheimer last March about COYOTE UGLY, he told me that, ""there are going to be A LOT of hot looking women in it.""  And guess what?  HE'S RIGHT!!  There are a lot of hot looking women in this film, sadly they have nowhere to go.  This is similar to Bruckheimer's last drama, FLASHDANCE.  I think Bruckheimer should stick with action films, he's much better with those. *** (out of five)",Coyote Ugly
71,tex-42,"Mindless, but pleasing film",9,11 August 2000,"In the proud tradition of such movies as Flashdance, here comes Coyote Ugly, based on a real bar in New York City.  Our young heroine has just moved to NYC to pursue her dream of being a songwriter.  However, her stage fright proves to be a barrier to her career so she finds herself having to take a job at a bar where all the bartenders are beautiful women who do exotic dancers and other things to please the customers.  Of course she meets the man of her dreams and eventually gains self confidence.  The only small thing wrong is the previews make it seem that Tyra Banks has a much larger role than the 8 or 9 minutes she is actually on screen.  Very light movie, but ultimately pleasing fluff made so by the charm of its stars.  Fun for a night out.",Coyote Ugly

Country girl goes to big city with dreams, gets robbed, finds job, **Spoiler**, makes it.  So why would anybody go see this.  Because of great marketing!!  This has the best, most deceptive marketing strategy ever.  Why?  It got guys into the theater, didn't it?The bar scenes were cool, and they are the only good thing about the movie. I wanted to know how many people in the audience actually cared about the plot.  The bar scenes were limited, and the plot was overdone.  I didn't care about Violet's problems.  I wanted to see more T&A.  But, emotions overruled, and so we got stuck with a lame movie that tests the fast-forward button.  We just want to see stories around the bar.  A story centering around the bar owner, by way of Violet would have been better, in my opinion.  So, because of the plot getting in the way of my entertainment.6/10",Coyote Ugly
73,ninjaalexs,"The Goodman, the mediocre and Coyote Ugly",5,17 February 2020,"I had free cinema tickets in the year 2000 and my choices were this or Disney's Dinosaur. It was a daytime screening and I couldn't make a later screening with more choice and the tickets were expiring that week. Dinosaur was the choice; a mediocre film following Disney's pantheon of midas touched 90s films. Why is this relevant? It was better than Coyote Ugly.Coyote Ugly isn't bad per se, just a bit meh. The film is a fairly generic story about a small town girl who moves to the big city to become a songwriter and ends up working in a rowdy bar, maybe not unlike Hooters. Inbetween she meets a hunky Australian love interest. It's sort of a comedy-cum-Romance-cum-music film-cum-bar room drama. I'm all for hybrid films, but this film doesn't do any one thing particularly well apart from the music (the songs are good). Piper Perabo is unfortunately obviously lip synching and it just feels like a thinly veiled promotional video for then largely unknown LeAnn Rimes.The romantic plot is just too predictable and a bit tacked on. The bar scenes are good and capture some of the excitement. Unfortunately, it isn't as groundbreaking or thrilling as say corny Tom Cruise vehicle Cocktail.The best thing in the film is John Goodman. His charisma and natural humour is always fun to watch and of course playing a Dad character is a natural fit as he's been doing it to perfection for years.So all in all: good photography, good music, John Goodman being his usual charming self, boring plot and it never really escapes from feeling like an extended music video.",Coyote Ugly

Well, it isn't, but not totally avoidable, actually Coyote Ugly is quite enjoyable and entertaining: gorgeous women, sensually dancing, boys flirting, music, drama, comedy... it's like a funfair  pretty much of everything. By the way: take a close look, at the end, at the clumsy handsome girl behind the bar (the one that takes the place of Jersey).

77,JohnnyPHreak,Wet and Wild,6,19 August 2000,"Super producer Jerry Bruckheimer adds fuel and fire to an overdone love story. Girl (Piper Perabo) leaves small town and bitter single parent (John Goodman) to make it big in the city. She gets turned down one after another by everyone and moves into a run down apartment. She then gets robbed but finds a great job where she can makes some cash. She meets a boy (Adam Garcia) and has a fight with her parent. The parent gets injured, she has a fight with her boyfriend and loses her job. Then everything somehow comes together in the end. What Bruckheimer does to this story is turned the level of energy up quite a few notches. He adds in gorgeous women (Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Melanie Lynskey,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks)for some seriously good eye candy, loud thunderous music, Bruckheimer colors, camera shots and flair and a wild bar named Coyote Ugly. This is one love story other than Chasing Amy that guys can enjoy. The eye candy is popin all over and the music makes for big time fun. This is a summer popcorn flick. It just replaces the explosions and FX with beautiful women going buck wild on top of a bar. This is a good date film but if you're a guy make sure you keep your hormones in check or you could be leaving alone.

Girl meets some tough-talking friends and does some ethically questionable things in pursuit of her dreams. Girl meets perfect guy who sweeps her off her feet and believes in her. Girl makes all her dreams come true.If you've heard it all before, you're not alone. ""Coyote Ugly"" breaks no new ground, takes no risks, and doesn't even have any decent acting to redeem the movie. It's almost painful to watch Piper Perabo trying to decide whether her character is tough-and-sexy or sweet-and-innocent. She gets neither quite right, and in truth should've just gone for ""porn star"" because that's how she comes across.The script is laughably awful, containing lines that surely made movie audiences across the nation groan aloud and roll their eyes. The plot - such as it is - is utterly unrealistic and offers us nothing in the way of insight, profound thinking, or even lighthearted laughs. Some men (mostly teenaged boys) may like this because it features good-looking women dancing on a bar... but even those scenes are fairly tame compared to most of what you'd find in your average PG-rated flick these days. The movie sets back the cause of empowerment of women by at least five decades. Oh, and the soundtrack blows. In fact, there are almost no redeeming qualities here whatsoever.So why the three stars? I'll give one star alone to Maria Bello for her performance as the bar owner who turns out to have a heart under her tough-as-nails exterior. And I'll give another star to the dance sequences, which, while tame, were at least fun and mildly energetic. The final one is for John Goodman, who has one of his worst roles here, but is a cut above anything else in this mess.Two hours of my life I wish I could have back.",Coyote Ugly

I thought it was the best bar-flick since ""Cocktail"". If you haven't seen ""Cocktail"", it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender, and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly, you have Violet (Piper Perabo) who comes to NYC to become a singer/songwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos, so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called, ""Coyote Ugly"". The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello), Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade, and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singer/songwriter or not, because that would wreck the movie, but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally, I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10, because it has an amazing story, memorable characters and a lot of great lines, but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song, ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"".

The story lacks interest. The emotions and acting seems fake.  You don't really end up caring about any of the characters and the music really isn't that great either.  This is more or less a made-for television movie that really can't justify paying money to see or rent.  In fact if I was watching it on television I probably would have just changed the channel.  MTV has more pretty faces, better music, better dancing as wall as many other channels.  Stay at home and watch TV rather than waste your time and money on this dud.

Even if this was the worst movie of all time it would still be a hit with the guys. If you're a girl you'll love the girls too. Maybe not for their looks but because they show us what it's like for a woman to be in control and in charge. They'll also like violet's journey to become a song writer and make it in the world. Now i'm 15 yrs old and i went to see tihs with some friends from the ages of 15-18. we fall somewhere in between. our favorite parts were the ladies dancing on the bar tables and pouring water on their beautiful bodies. but i also like movies with some hint of a plot and i think this movie's plot was pretty good.The story focusses of Violet Sanford who leaves New jersey and goes to New York City to be a song writer. Now Violet has stage fright and in new york you can't just hand over your demo tape to just anybody you have to present your songs in one way or another and for her that means going to open mic nights and performing them herself. She's too afraid to do that so in the mean time she needs to make some extra money. This is where coyote ugly comes in. This is a bar where sexy ladies entertain their guest by dancing on bar tables, feeling on each other, and showing off their beautiful bodies. the ladies are all beautiful and very strong characters. Girls with attitudes. at first for Violet this is just a job but pretty soon she realizes that Coyote Ugly is the place where she'll break out her shell.The acting is pretty good for this kind of film. The standout is Piper Perabo who is on her way to being a great actress. she has a mixture of charm, sexiness, innocence, and talent. Maria Bello is good as Lil, the boss who runs the bar, she's very demanding in the role and she makes you believe that this bar is her life. Izabella Miko and Bridget Manyahan are also good as the sexiest coyote's in my opinion. Tyra Banks who is only in the movie for about 10 minutes is good as the energeti zoe. she's in the films most memorable scenes.All these critics and people the say this movie is bad or the worst movie of all time need to chill out. movies don't need to have oscar winning plots. they just to need to entertain and this one most definitely entertains.",Coyote Ugly

It's actually a quite decent and enjoyable film, although of course it's not a masterpiece. The story is quite conventional and simplistic and that's might the reason that this film didn't reached so many people. Some of the gags are funny, but at times they also feels constrained. Piper Perabo is stunningly beautiful and delivers a okay enough act. It's a shame she didn't got a bigger breakthrough in Hollywood. Though, she doesn't have enough chemistry with Adam Garcia on screen and the lines between them which the screenwriters came up with are awful. Adam himself doesn't show a big range in his act in this film. John Goodman does a decent enough act as Violet's father, although this is of course not his greatest part. The other girl actors (Tyra Banks, Maria Bello) delivers okay act, without leaving so much impression.The target audience for this film are youths/people in the twenties/older teenagers and ""Coyote Ugly"" have all the ingredients to satisfy them, both males and females. Why does it then fall on the category ""bad""? It's not the best movie in this category, but, like I said before, it's decent entertainment.

USA, 2000, Directed by David McNally starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, John Goodman.  I went to see this movie without my wife.  She decided from watching the trailers and see the ads that it was some dumb T&A drunk guy bar movie.  I mean that sounded OK to me; but I was really surprised.  `Coyote Ugly' is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.  `Coyote Ugly' is the best romantic comedy that I've seen since `Notting Hill.' Violet Sanford (Perabo) is a young woman from small town New Jersey and she's moving to the Big Apple to seek fame and fortune as a song writer.  Her dad (Goodman) and her friends don't want her to leave.  Her best friend reminds her that they have never carried through on any of their dreams (preserving their virginity, going to college, going to beauty school) so why does she want to pursue her dream of being a famous songwriter?  But Violet is off to the city, where she naïvely goes from one agency to the other trying to sell her songs.  Needing to earn money she ends up working at `Coyote Ugly' serving drinks and dancing on the bar.  All the familiar plot points of a romantic comedy follow and you just know everything is going to end up happily ever after.  And it does.  But there are a number of things that make `Coyote Ugly' a good movie.  The acting is good.  John Goodman is especially good as Violet's father.  All the girls at the bar are good.  Garcia is good as the boyfriend and love interest. Another thing I liked about the story is the persistence of the main character.  When life was getting her down, she'd have a good cry and go back out and kick some butt.  She stuck to her dream and worked hard to achieve it.  In the end she has friends, family, the promise of a carrier, and a boyfriend.

A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.Anyway, it wasn't an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well.",Coyote Ugly

98,Serva,God Awful Mess,2,17 January 2002,"I consider myself a feminist, and I suppose that is why much in this movie really just doesn't cut it with me at all. Of course in this drivel we are given the portrayal of feminism and females in general that people seem to think is good nowadays. Real women dance in bars and exposes as much bare skin as possible and splash water over themselves, and at the same time they talk about this independence complete BS. At one point of the movie we are told why the bar is named Coyote Ugly - entrance ""funny"" joke that isn't a fraction cliche by now - ""because X was taken"". Whee. Actually contrary to most people I guess, I didn't find one of the female cast attractive. You know this thing food. They should try it. They all just look anorectic to me. Which leads to another problem, the total absence of acting in this movie. Nobody can act, especially not John Goodman, it's as if he tried to act really bad but making it turn out even worse in the process. This film, aimed at teen girls primarily, also sends out many messages that are very unhealthy in my humble opinion. Alcohol is nothing bad, ""looking good"" is another word for being an anorectic and yes of course you will become an actor or a singer or whatever if only you work hard enough. I gave it a 2 out of 10, but honestly I can't remember why I didn't give it 1, I guess I must've slipped.",Coyote Ugly

Girl realises dreams are not being realised, girl gets ticked off with boy, boy gets the flick, both are miserable.  While girl is miserable she does something to realise dream. Dream is realised, credits roll.  End of movie.There is no serious thought needed to see this film.

102,Bondo20,Heartwarming story overcomes sappy bits.,8,21 July 2001,"Based on the true story about the crazy female run bar in New York City, Coyote Ugly becomes surprisingly believable despite the usual Hollywood bits.  The story follows Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) as she moves from small town New Jersey to the city to become a songwriter.  Through her misfortunes she meets boyfriend Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) and the Coyotes and learns from each of them to overcome the stage fright that threatens to ruin her dreams.Many moments are sappy or overly dramatic but the majority is enthralling as all the characters are solidly built.  The girls all have their own character but aren't so strictly chained to it that they become merely symbols instead of people.  While the females may be on the screen the most, the two supporting males Kevin and William Sanford (John Goodman) provide the most heartwarming scenes.  Goodman's performance provides subtle humor while his character struggles through the conflict of his daughter leaving and his desire to see her succeed.  For an actor who has put in so many great performances, this one still manages to be one of his best.Coyote Ugly offers something enjoyable to everyone.  Guys obviously will enjoy the attractive girls and the provocative dancing while girls can enjoy the strong female characters, each of which won't take crap from any of the men that surround them.  Parents can enjoy the side story of the conflict between Violet and her father.  Another feature to enjoy is the fabulous music with four songs performed by LeAnn Rimes with some smaller groups as well.Coyote Ugly crosses the unusual boundary of being both an exciting, fast-paced movie that gets the adrenaline flowing and a sensitive story with strong characters and brilliant acting to get the mind working.  The result is a thoroughly rewarding movie experience.",Coyote Ugly

104,sean_36,great entertainment,7,10 December 2001,"Personally, I loved this movie!  It was funny, entertaining, uplifting and had a great soundtrack.  However others I talked to didn't think it was nearly as great, and maybe it's no great masterpiece but it is a really fun film.  The story revolves around Violent Stanford (perfectly played by newcomer Piper Perabo), a small town girl who moves to New York to be a songwriter, but finds out its not as easy as it sounds.  In New York, Violet gets a job at Coyote Ugly, a wild bar where the women dance around in skin tight clothes and pour water on them selves.  As dirty as that sounds its actually not.  There is no nudity and the dancing isn't that sexual, something that probably disappointed all the drooling men who went to see it in the theatres expecting another Showgirls.  In fact the advertising for this film is quite misleading, there are only 4 main scenes that take place in the bar, the rest of the film focuses on Violet's struggling career, her romance with a dish washing Australian, and her father's disapproval with her job.Coyote Ugly was produced by that maker of masterpieces, Jerry Bruckheimer, and has drawn many comparisons to his 80's hit Flashdance.  If you ask me though, this one is much better.  The direction is slick, the stars are hot and the story is entertaining.  See it.",Coyote Ugly

106,doodah367,"Good idea, badly pulled off",6,28 October 2001,"After seeing the trailer and reading a little about the film, I liked the premise of Coyote Ugly a lot - small town girl goes to work at some kind of hardcore bar.  However, writer Gina Wendkos has simply delivered a sappy love story, with a slightly darker edge, characterised by the Coyote Ugly bar, and probably the influence of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, better known for his work on action films such as Con Air and Enemy Of The State.Now, this would have been my misunderstanding and me simply going to see the wrong movie if it were a good love story.  However, the characters are hideously one dimensional (i.e. the audience knows nothing about the other two barmaids, Cammie and Rachel, both of whom seem to have leading roles, apart from their bar personalities).  Even the protagonist's main development, the overcoming of her stage fright, doesn't really make any sense and seems to be a rushed conclusion rather than a gradual development.However, after criticising it, Coyote Ugly is moderately entertaining.  The bar scenes in particular, not just because of the acres of female flesh on display, but also because of the excitement of these scenes and the whole concept of the bar itself.  With this in mind, the scenes shot in the actual bar are the best of the whole film, coming off like a music video.  This does work against the film in the conclusion however, with the last 5-10 minutes seeming to be more of a promo for the film's music single rather than actually concluding the film satisfactorily.Make no mistake about it, Coyote Ugly is entertaining, and even exciting in parts, but it's really just a cardboard story filled with one dimensional stock characters.  6/10",Coyote Ugly
107,jennifer-99,Shhhhh....don't tell anyone....,6,28 January 2001,"I actually liked this movie.  Not because it had a believable plot, rich characters, witty dialogue or standout performances.  It didn't. But what this movie did have was energy, a catchy soundtrack and a large dose of fun. From the trailers, the movie didn't appear to have a plot.  I was surprised to find that it did, albeit a very weak one.  Had this plot been handled by a more experienced screenwriter or a producer other than Bruckheimer, this movie may have been better received by the movie going population and may have elevated itself above the ""Pathetically Cheesy"" category. 
Taking all this into consideration, the movie is still an enjoyable watch....one of those ""Bad but Fun"" movies.  The catchy soundtrack, rowdy dance scenes and the adorable performance of Adam Garcia (Mr. O'Donnell...comic book collector extraordinaire) are what saved this movie for me.  As a kid, I enjoyed the likes of Flashdance, Dirty Dancing and Footloose....all dance movies with great music to keep your feet tapping and will leave you singing the tunes for days afterward.

The cries for mercy in the barroom scene reminded me of the Odessa Steps sequence in Potemkin,especially as the innocent man was catapulted into the jukebox glass, thus symbolizing for all cinematic history the tides and fluxes of human history upon which we all ride helplessly, like that bull in Gilley's from another film, which cast all aside in its merciless sweep?

112,jacob-l-williams,Almost good... but in ultimately ugly.,7,30 June 2010,"Coyote Ugly is a film that I have to admit I was looking forward to watching, I'm not normally a fan of rom-coms, but this film had been described to me as a raunchy teen drama so I thought it was worth a watch. However imagine my disappointment when I realised it was basically just a boy meet girl film all over again only with a bar where girls dance and sing.After 15 minutes I was bored and ready to turn it off when there came a scene that made me stick around to watch the rest, the scene is when Violet is having breakfast and the other ""coyotes"" walk in. The scene isn't a fantastic one but it was enough to keep me watching and I have to admit I enjoyed the film for a small time in the middle. It was thrilling to watch the girls dance of the bar and the way in which customers where served and pelted with water if they ordered it, it was just a shame to see it ruined so soon and revert back to the badly written rom-com it had begun.The last ten minutes are in all honesty probably the worst last ten minutes of a film I have seen in a long time, honestly beginning with the toll booths stupid light flashing, the ridiculous u-turn the turning off the power; then Le-Ann Rhymes appearing and everyone being happy it was stupid and to end the film with the biggest cliché of all other than a freeze frame... a slow motion kiss, was ridiculous and took away all the enjoyment I had from the mid-section of the film.This film is not raunchy and it is not a teen drama, my friend has lied to me and I cannot help feeling that nearly two hours of my life has been completely wasted and wish I had turned it off after the appalling start.5/10",Coyote Ugly

It makes a valiant effort at being about something and the characters are engaging and enthusiastically portrayed, but ultimately there is too much focus on bouncing breasts and bared midsections.One thing I will definitely give credit for, though...it would have been VERY easy to fill the movie with gratuitous nudity and, as near as I recall, there isn't any at all.  I think it's admirable that the filmmakers resisted the urge to go for the cheap thrills and let the film degenerate into ""Porkys 7"" or ""Showgirls"".

Young girls who don't know any better won't pay any attention to any negative publicity this bile gets, they'll just watch it, vainly hoping that if they look reasonably pretty, and open their legs to opportunity, their life will be a breeze too.

I think she was expecting more of a Thelma and Louise meets cocktail type film with strong female roles running a bar and not taking crap from anyone. Yeah, they all danced around in skimpy outfits to 20 year old music, but there are sexy and strong willed people in the world. What bothered me about the movie is that it was a long disjointed collection of cliches that we've seen before and done better. Girl goes to New York to be a songwriter (in case you saw the preview rather than hearing about it from friends this is actually what the movie is about). Guess what, no one will buy her songs. Big surprise there. No one will even be nice to her! What a shock! She lives in what looks like the projects, has no job, has a stock dead mother family past. I keep thinking I've given too much away, but this is all the first five minutes of the film. Nothing else develops other than the generic boyfriend with a stock sitcom relationship. Oh yeah, the bar? It could be left out. It has nothing to do with the plot. She doesn't even grow as a person there. All those tough, take no prisoners women who work there? Wimps! They couldn't get together and make one stable person. And they are messed up in a seven dwarfs kind of a way. Oh let's see there's Slutty, and Bitchy, and Bossy. Each one is screwed up in her own endearing way. There is no explanation of why they are like this, and their tag name is the end all and be all of their personality. The characters all march through the plot like dutiful actors hitting the mark because that's where the director told them to go. No matter that it's out of character (Oh but they have none), or that it contradicts what they said 5 minutes ago. The lead character is from 20 miles South in New Jersey. She acts like she's from Nebraska or Iowa or something. Big doe eyed sucker from some farm, or fall out shelter. Doesn't the local library have internet access? There really is no excuse for being that naive in life.Now there were things I did like. The house she moves from looks like a working man's house in New Jersey.

133,Joey_Mac,Actually Has Plot!!!,10,25 June 2001,"I couldn't have been more pleased with ""Coyote Ugly"".  Being a huge New York fan, I loved the setting and atmosphere of the film.  Piper Perabo was excellent as Violet and has a very promising film career, and Adam Garcia who play Kevin O'Donnel is my new fave actor.  The songs, performed by LeAnn Rimes and written by Diane Warren could not have been any better (especially ""But I Do Love You"").  The trailers (although they are what made me want to see this film!!!) mislead you greatly, and I think that's why critics panned this film.  The advertising leads you to belive there's no plot further than a bunch of scantily clad chicks shaking it on a bar, but the movie has heart and substance and is very positive in inspiring people to follow their dreams.  I recommend this film to almost all tastes!!! 9/10.",Coyote Ugly
134,Cyber Cat,The Coolest! Something for everyone!,10,29 August 2000,"What a great movie!Where do I begin raving about it? Well, for one, it's way cool. The bar scenes just put a smile on my face, no less! Flipping bottles, spraying the costumers with beer, dumping ice(!) on out-of-line drunks... It just makes you want to be there and do that, and the hell with computer-science!Secondly, it's touching and romantic without being mushy or sickening. A beautiful love story, a simple love story. It's not one of those that-could-never-happen-in-real-life kind of stories. It's one of those that-could-happen-to-me kind of stories. Plus, he's cute and romantic, and has a beautiful Australian accent. What more could you ask for?It is also an inspiring story of success, and overcoming your fears.To sum it all up, it's a cool movie (did I mention this already?), with beautiful songs (I actually got goose bumps when Violet sang the last song, and that only happens when I hear a song I *really* like), a beautiful story, and some funny spots here and there to top the cool whipped cream with a comical cherry.Bottom line: I gave it 10/10, and I wasn't being generous.

However, I must say that Coyote Ugly was the most fun movie I had seen in a long time!  The bar scenes were the best, and I actually found myself waiting for the next one.  I was practically dancing in my seat, the music chosen for this movie was amazing. And it's obvious that not only men went to this club either. The story of Violet is sweet, and ""Mr. O'Donnell"" is a hottie.  John Goodman was great as the dad, and being a Maria Bello fan already, I loved her performance as Lil.

I watched it when I was 11, and I couldn't resist on its magic. My sister owned the OST, and there were many times per month I used to listen to it. Anyway, I think that the whole story of a girl coming to the big city, full of dreams and no money and finally makes it, is totally motivating. I suppose many guys will think I'm stupid loving a chick-flick, but keep in mind that it's also about a bar full of bartenders singing, dancing and... showing what they've got!!! But, it was also a great film. I've watched it more than 15 times ( I stopped counting four years ago), and I gather it's gonna be the movie I'll be watching in future...

Some people will probably disagree with me but this is not a film about nudity or something like that, it is a film about following your dreams, about leaving home searching for something real.

Her behind the scenes interviews, shows she is a hard worker and will do what it takes to get the job done. I also enjoyed the performance of Bridget Moynahan, her acting and timing as Rachel, worked very well with Piper Perabo, when she started at working at the bar, replacing Zoe. Veteran John Goodman plays a perfect single father, trying to care and do the right thing for his daughter and in the end helps her make the right decision. The story was easy to follow and the director made it feel real. The addition of Lyann Rymes singing at the end was a great ending.

This film has the writing quality of SHOWGIRLS and the originality of a Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoon.I don't blame the actors (they are all attractive and don't overact).  I blame the writers and the director.  When ""Jersey"" finally kisses her love interest, he says ""Have a nice day.""  Then he apologizes for not having anything else to say.  I laughed out loud, and wondered if that line was ad-libbed.If you want to know what this movie is like -- think of every movie cliche you've ever seen cramped into a plotline taken from that terrible J Love Hewitt TV show that failed last Fall.There was one other thing about the movie -- the music.

148,Avg. Joe,"It ain't ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but I still like it.",9,26 June 2002,"When Jerry Bruckheimer committed to produce ""Coyote Ugly,"" I don't think he was intending to remake ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Gone With the Wind,"" widely regarded at two of the greatest movies of all time.  And while I don't think ""Coyote Ugly"" is one of even the fifty greatest movies of all time, I did like it for what it was; a cute little movie that can lift your spirits when you're down.Violet Sanford, played by the heartbreakingly sexy Piper Perabo, decides to pick up and leave her smalltown New Jersey existence - much to the chagrin of her toll-booth operator father, played by John Goodman in a show-stealing performance - for the Big Apple for a shot at success in the music business. Once there, she finds out there's a lot more to it than simply having great songs. One night, she happens upon one ""Mr."" O'Donnell (or Kevin, played by Adam Garcia) and gives him her demo tape thinking he's in the biz. When it turns out that he's nothing more than a guy who works odd jobs, she gets disgusted when he won't leave her alone (she's so cute when she say ""So, I'm going to say 'good night...'"").After more meetings, a rather embarrassing, um, performance at an open-mike night (which we get to see her legendary stage fright) and being robbed, she happens upon three women, one of them who is saying goodbye to the other two, at an all-night eatery. ""Are they hookers?"" she asks excitedly. ""No,"" says the dive owner as he hands her a matchbox with the name of a bar, the infamous ""Coyote Ugly;"" ""They're coyotes!"" She then decides to ""audition"" for the empty slot.Somehow, over time, she impresses the hard-as-nails owner Lil, played with /chutzpah/ by Maria Bello, formerly of ""ER,"" with her way with rowdy New Yorkers ready to get into a fight over a girl, her ability to raise $250 in two minutes by auctioning off an intimate night with Kevin as a means of payback and saving her fellow waitresses from impending trouble by singing along to ""One Way or Another"" by Blondie on the jukebox. 
And while she falls in love with Kevin (who helps her get over her stage fright), she disappoints her father when he finds out that she's working at what he must believe is a strip bar, having seen his buddies at work putting her picture up in their toll-booth windows. I think that the screenplay could be written a little better (Gina Wendkos does a better job with ""The Princess Diaries"" in my opinion). But the directing here is adequate; and I feel that, all things considered, the movie is well-acted; Melanie Lynskey was cute as Violet's long-time, always loyal friend. It's quite interesting to see Bridget Moynihan and Tyra Banks, two models, cast in the movie, Moynihan as the sexy ""New York b****"" and Tyra Banks as the sexy law student (who I would have liked to have seen more of). I feel that both of them held their own. And Izabella Miko was hot as Cammie, ""The Russian Tease!"" I love the use of music throughout the film, including Violet's songs, which were actually written by Diane Warren, as well as the music played at the bar. Being of the male persuasion, I can't help but love the dance numbers with the Coyotes - love those outfits especially (even if it's really stunt dancers). And I can tolerate the sappy love story. Overall, this is a fun movie for anybody who needs to be cheered up (and who /doesn't/ these days!?).9 out of 10.",Coyote Ugly
149,Bernie-58,"Great Music, Great Storyline, Great movie",9,14 September 2000,"The plot: This movie, starring beautiful, naive Piper Perabo as struggling songwriter in NYC, is a wonderful insight into the music and entertainment industry in NYC. Violet has always dreamt about making it in New York. Finally she kisses her rural North Amboy, NJ (and her dad, John Goodman) goodbye and leaves to find fame and fortune as a songwriter in New York. The usual cliches follow: unanswered demo tapes, the burglary in her flat, the daily struggle for survival. Things turn better when she is tried as a new Coyote: a barmaid in the underground bar Coyote Ugly (because ""Cheers has already been taken""). First she is everything a young girl from the countryside is supposed to be: naive, clumsy, bashful - a contrast to the in-your-face attitude of the other barmaids. After a long and weary fight behind, in front of and on the bar, she is accepted as a Coyote, even putting her boyfriend and some open mic night chances aside. This phase of giving up her dreams for the easy money is really saddening. Finally her dad, boyfriend and girlfriend intervene  out of different reasons and get her on her first open mic night, where she is once again confronted with her stagefright, but is overcoming it (for sure we need a happy ending here).The conclusion: an open-hearted, sometimes amusing, sometimes melancholic display of a young woman, her dreams and fears. Peppered by some hot bar scenes (well there has to be something for the guys) and some real hot music (can't wait to lay hands on the soundtrack) this is a wonderful movie. (Don't ask me whether LeAnn Rimes is doing a cameo for the former or latter reason).

Most of the action takes place in a bar that is wild and weird and lots of fun. There is also danger as the gurls get into tricky situations with all sorts of characters, some of them shady. This movie is pure entertainment and made me want to be a bartender, or at least get into a hot relationship with a female bartender that's for sure.

159,Dicekid,Something for guys to look at... but nothing more,2,9 September 2000,"Babelicious dancing girls and wicked cocktails aside, this is perfectly harmless fun that manages to subtly entertain while looking deceptively stylish. ""Flashdance"" it's not, though it tries its damnest to copy Adrian Lyne's signature flamboyant style. The story is way too familiar - small town girl goes to the big, dirty city to sell her soul, I mean songs.In the case of Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), one too many rejections land her way in over her head in a gofor-broke party bar with the unlikely moniker of Coyote Ugly. Big bucks to be had, but you've got to earn them the hard way. Tossing bottles of Jack with the finesse of a swaggering Tom Cruise (remember ""Cocktail""?), brazenly shakin' your groove thing (that pesky ""Flashdance"" again), and maybe even belting out a song or two (""Little Voice"" anyone?). Violet, affectionately renamed Jersey, catches on to the after-hours ropes, but doesn't let go of her dream. Oh, you've heard this one before?Not a whit of imagination, but every predictable moment is drenched with an emotion closely resembling heart. Violet tackles the bright lights of the big city and the love of her man (hunky Adam Garcia) with let's-put-on-a-show gusto that's endearing in its struggle to seem genuine. With her big-hearted Dad (John Goodman) to show her the way, there is no mountain high enough to keep Violet from making her show-biz fantasies come true.I poke fun, but the truth is the package works like a big old fun house mirror. Images are not always what they seem. Coyote Ugly is one bog party, where zany girls light the bar on fire (literally) and burn the floor with some frisky moves. When the action is elsewhere in the sprawling jungle of New York City, it looks gritty in an artsy, artificially lit way. The plot twists and turns can be seen coming from a mile off, but much is forgiven when the costumes are tantalizing and the dreams burns bright. Excellent psychological approach...Perabo, the month's ""It"" girl, works her story with effort. Her chemistry with just about everybody - from the bitchy bar dancers to her best buddy from home - is vintage good girl clicks with the universe. Bar dances are a disappointing, quick-cutting mishmash of leather-clad thighs, kick-butt boots and bare midriffs. Relentless strings of pop tunes wear thin early on.

While the trailer does the movie some justice, the plot was actually good even though it started to get a little predictable at the end.I did not expect a whole bunch of girls dancing on the bar for two hours, but that wouldn't have been bad.  I had a feeling that it was going to be a girl that was trying to make it in the big city, and it was.  Though, I was impressed at the way Violet/Josie (Piper Perabo) started to get the hang of the big city as the movie went on.  She started to lose that cute country girl look and took on an edge that seemed appropriate for her character.As for the other girls, even though their parts were small, they played them well.  'Lil (Maria Bello) was very tough as nails, but not as much as Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), who played the violent loner coyote.  Cammie (Izabella Miko) and Zoe (Tyra Banks) had minor roles.Overall, I would say that the movie was very well done with an excellent plot, good dancing and ""party tricks"", i.e. spitting fire and such.

A movie for those of us out of high school, but not quite to retirement.",7,10 August 2000,"If you're looking for a movie that has a complex plot that makes you think about the wonders of life and what you're doing in it then look elsewhere. If you're looking to watch a movie that will have you smiling the whole time and leave you feeling `frisky' then you've found the right spot. 
It seems these days that Hollywood has mostly forgotten us 20 somethings as they push out films that are either `Teen Flicks' or epic stories that appeal to those who have mostly forgotten the bar scene.  This movie, however, brings back some fun for those of us who know what it's like to search for that perfect bar while still trying to find our futures amid our `normal' lives.  I truly didn't expect this movie to actually be that good when I went out to see it, but was thrilled to find myself wrong.  They keep the story light and easy to follow which allows you to just sit there and enjoy the party.  Throw in some beautiful people and a soundtrack that defines our `generation' and you get a movie that you just may need to see again.",Coyote Ugly
164,pjmoore810,Pleasantly surprised,7,11 February 2001,"The previews for this movie didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I remember thinking that this might be an ok movie to see, but I didn't put very high on my list of movies to see.  Even after a co-worker said that he and his wife had gone to one of the first screenings in our area  and both had really enjoyed it, I didn't make any special effort to see it in the theater.  But last night at Blockbuster, I said ""What the heck..."" 
In the end, I was mildly surprised, and enjoyed the movie.  There isn't anything special about the plot...girl moves to big city to pursue her dreams, reality sets in, girl meets boy, girl falls in love, girl faces some adversity, girl overcomes adversity and things start to fall into place. Yet, the plot works well for this movie.  I found myself being drawn into the story.  The casting was well done, I felt all the actors did a  good job of filling their parts.  The cinematography was visually stimulating without being over the top or relying on any nudity...yes there is a fair amount of skin flashed but not enough to push the rating over PG-13.  Add to all this a well rounded soundtrack, and you get a movie that is fun and energetic.All in all, I enjoyed this movie.  I may even watch it again before it is due.",Coyote Ugly

If you can mostly ignore how irritating Violet is then the film is pretty fun. Violet is shallow, dumb, naive and generally gives women a bad name. She treats the one person in NYC who gives a damn about her like he's some annoying school boy. She's arrogant and judgemental with zero street smarts and seems to lack any sense of self-preservation.
The other characters are entertaining, clever and add lots of laughs so watch it for them and just roll your eyes at Violet's irritating performance.",Coyote Ugly

All it makes me wonder is, what do those women get paid to degrade themselves?   I guess everyone has a limit to their morality.You want Jerry Bruckheimer?

I went in with low expectations because of the reviews I had read in the past.  I was surprised to see that it kept my attention throughout and had a few interesting side stories to keep the main plot fresh (girl moves to big city).Many parts you knew were coming, the break-in to her apartment, her thinking of moving home, her getting fired and given a second chance, etc.  What saves this film are the bar scenes that the trailers have killed for the past 2 months.  You can't get enough of them and everyone knows there should have been more.  I've heard stories that the real ""Coyote Ugly"" in NYC is close to being as wild as the joint in the movie which makes me want to visit it sometime. :)  The biggest disappointment was the fact that Tyra Banks had basically NO part in the movie.  A quick 5 minute cameo in the beginning and that was it.  It's like Carmen Electra in the beginning of ""Scary Movie.""  You want more but it's never there :)If you're still planning on seeing this movie go into knowing that you have seen this plot before and know that there won't be nearly enough bar scenes. Try to focus on the relationship with the main character's father and the movie seems much more interesting.Piper Parabo really grew on me.  She's very sweet and innocent but her acting has some minor flaws which need to be worked out.  Great date movie, the women will like it as well as the men. Remember.....open minded!",Coyote Ugly

Ok, there are two or three pretty girls, but it's still an awful movie.  This is the archetype of ""the loser who becomes a hero"".  The songs composed by the main character are below average, corporative, love songs anybody can write, and the story, awww! Puh-lease!  Can't we get at least two minutes of originality?",Coyote Ugly

Can't remember much but wondered where health and safety was when the girls were dancing on the bar when it was on fire.  Watched it again sober and was it painful.  Usual story of small town girl trying to make it big in big city with the usual ambitions, the usual love interests, usual cliches etc.  You get the idea, in other words, the usual nothing new in it and it ends with that 'you go girl' attitude.  Can't have done John Goodman's career any good.  Unless your a die hard Britney Spears fan, you really need to get drunk and stoned and mushroomed to watch this movie.",Coyote Ugly

Piper Perabo couldn't act her way out of a paper bag with a road map ... her biggest feat in this film is trying to see how doe-eyed she can look, or how long she can bite her lower lip and appear naive. Her ""performace"" was excruciating to watch, and how anyone is able to stomach it is beyond me. Thanks to this crappy movie, Coyote Ugly has been thrust into main stream marketing, and has lines out the door of drunk tourists paying 15 dollars for crappy watered down drinks. No plot, poor acting, and trailer trash values ... I give this movie an F!!",Coyote Ugly
178,gypsy14,Dreams in the Big City,8,5 July 2001,"When I saw adds for this movie I thought it was going to be like a border line porn flick but then a friend of mine rented it and he said I would really like and to watch it.  So after some debate I did.  He was so right! This was a fantastic film.Violet Sanford is a small town New Jersey girl who moves to New York City to pursue her dream of being a song writer.  When she gets there she finds out it's not as easy as it seems.  After approaching all the music studios with her tape she finds that no one will even listen.  She goes to this club and meet Kevin this cook that she thinks is a big music director.  She gives him her tape and learns, after he's already got her tape he's not who she thinks he is.  She's completely upset and then comes home to find that her shabby apartment has been broken into and the money her friend gave her is gone. She goes to a diner almost broke and very depressed and that's where she sees them--The Coyotes.  The guy behind the counter tell her where they work and she goes there and gets hired.  At first she has trouble keeping the job because she's very shy. She almost got fired 2 times then she goes back to get the tape from Kevin and he asks to see her again.  He wants to know where she works and all she will tell him is that she's a coyote.  Well he finds her and with his help and their blossoming love for each other she finds her way. It an amazing film with wonderful party and dance sequences as well as a good love story.  It's a story of finding yourself and finding success in the big city.  It's also got that element of love that I so love to watch. It's a great movie, definitely worth the time.",Coyote Ugly

Mistake. I could not stab myself hard enough to remove the permanent pain this movie has caused me. Some shy small town girl moves to New York City and decides for some reason to join Coyote Ugly, a bar. But uh oh! Girls dance on the bar and pour drinks listening ""You're Unbelievable"". How intimidating! Eventually though, she sheds her dignity and decides to mix drinks and light the bar on fire like the best of us. Not even the semi-attractive cast could make this film with plot holes and terrible acting and dialouge more than very very rarely entertaining, if at all. I enjoy the occasional chick flick, but this was just too unbearable.",Coyote Ugly

I thought it could be good, so I bought the DVD and watched it.The protagonist, Violet Sanford, is a struggling songwriter who decides that a small town like South Anboy is nowhere to be successful. So she moves to the Big Apple. There, after trying in vain to be signed to a label, she auditions at a seedy bar in the city.As a male viewer, I was surprised to be interested in this so-called 'chick flick' which also delved into the relationship between Violet and Kevin O'Donnell, a worker at a nearby area.Overall, while it isn't Oscar material, it's entertaining and far from deserving a Razzie.The film has a killer soundtrack, too. From Charlie Daniels to Lenny Kravitz, it kept me entertained.Seven. If you're not a fan of films like this, don't see it. Simple as that.",Coyote Ugly

The basic plot-line is a girl goes to New York hoping to become a song-writer, and finds out that it is much more difficult than she thought.  She ends up getting a job at Coyote Ugly, a very crazy bar where the girls spray water on customers and dance on the bar.  It has the romantic story to it as well.  I thought it was a very good movie.  It could have been very predictable, but it wasn't.  It was very well acted, and I just fell in love with a lot of the characters.

183,rustind-2,I have nothing good to say.,1,8 August 2000,"This movie was, in a word crap.  I am kind of depressed to know that I live in a world where millions of dollars are used to make movies like this and Kazam.  Can't Hollywood think of a better way to spend money?  Like, I don't know, burn it?Anyway, pretty much every aspect of this film was poorly executed.  The plot was less believable than Weekend at Bernie's II.  The editing was confusing at best and the acting...well, John Goodman was as usual, a solid performance, but aside from him it was a slew of WB rejects(mind you this is the network that allowed the Wayans brothers their own show.)  Well...I take that back, there was one other glimmer of light in the otherwise foul smelling mire of Coyote Ugly...TYRA BANKS!  Just kidding She made me yearn for the master thespians of Cleopatra 2525.Being the sad fanboy that I am I was reading an interview with the stars(I really don't think that word is appropriate, a much better term would be ""people who the camera was on the most"") they went on and on about how this movie was a celebration of womens sexuality and their newfound freedom to be whatever they(all women) want to be.  Well I guess that makes sense, after leaving the theater I realized that most women in this sexually and culturally open minded world, do in fact have the right to work in any Hooters restaurant they want.  Seriously though, Maybe I'm just hyper sensitive but the movie seemed slightly demeaning to women.  I found it in the same vein as Pretty Woman; using your body to make money will make all your dreams come true.  What a great message for a PG-13 movie.Well, in a nutshell, this movie really sucked on every level.  It is a sad reflection on the intelligence of the American consumer(as I glance across the room at my ticket stub).",Coyote Ugly
184,Tarna85,coyote ugly........,2,23 November 2006,"Coyote ugly tells the story we've all seen a million times, yet i think a plot like girl-next-door moves to big bad city could still work if the script could be spiced up a bit.A good actor can do wonders with a bad script (if the director lets them) and a great script AND great direction can bring out an outstanding performance but in this film Piper whatever her last name is couldn't even do that and after wondering why, i came to the conclusion that she just simply can't act and her 'performance' is what let the film down.I couldn't emote with her cause her acting had no depth. In the scenes where i was suppose to feel sorry for her, i didn't. She doesn't have any screen presence, and she reacted to lines BEFORE the other had said it. I can't believe out of all the takes they did that these takes were the best.Adam Garcia had not done much screen acting at the time but his performance was okay.....he didn't need to characterize at all so all he had to do was stand there and say the lines and hoped it sound convincing. I was entertained by his little jiggy on the bar for about half a second but the film could have done well without it.The bar scenes were just stupid, i didn't enjoy them and from where i come from you don't have to be wild and crazy to get up on a bar and shake your ass. There was nothing seedy or shocking about it in fact i was worried about the patrons safety when they started spraying water everywhere and going by piper's reaction to people dancing on a bar, obviously she had never been out of the house and to a party.....This film will only be enjoyed by teenies.

187,hatebreed,I think it is a good story,10,21 March 2004,"I saw the movie and I think it is a very good story. Forget a litle bit about the image. It tells a story of a girl chasing her dreams, despite her stage fear she as to win and she finally beats the stage fear. For me, thats what this movie is about, a small town young girl who leaves her home place, to pursue her dreams, who finds herself in a distant, diferent, and wild place (New York City), and despite all that she makes her dreams come true. Its a good lesson. The script was cool, well written, the feelings of the characters are involving, and whith great deph. It is not only a movie where good girls shake themselves in a bar, as some people think, it is much more than that. The best actor was certainly Jonh Goodman, as Violet's father. Piper Perabo's performance, has Violet Sanford was well made, she was able to give that inocent/country girl style. The older coyote Lil(Maria Belo)has a leader and boss, but with origins a litle similar to Violet, was a well atchieved performance. One of the highlights of the movie, is Leann Rimes song ""Can't figth the moonligth"", one of the best songs I have hever heard. In fact it is one of my favorites.",Coyote Ugly
188,SmoothCriminal8291958,"Without substance, but highly entertaining.",7,24 March 2007,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema. He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer. He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance. In that regard, 'Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch. The story is ""Flashdance"" lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous 'Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in. Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered. When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below. Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director. Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes. This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find. She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role. Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius). Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career. Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest. His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial. John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film. It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1. The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great film-making, but it is great entertainment. It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch. I rated it a 7/10. Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film. He knows how to push our buttons.",Coyote Ugly

190,kurdt,great fairy tail,10,4 August 2000,"This movie succeeds as a female fantasy and a male fantasy. Innocent, naive female becomes street smart and learns to celebrate her sexuality--- as a reward she finds true love and a stable income....badass....As a male fantasy, this is a thinly veiled exploitation about a strip joint....And it ""titillates"" without even showing any skin...What this film lacks in intelligence it makes up for with energy and humour.  John Goodman is consistently funny, and Piper Perabu is unbelievably appealing, even though she obviously has very little experience.  If the bar actually existed I would definitely be a regular.By the way, if you're looking for deep truth and meaning, don't look here.  The film is pure fun, pure fantasy, and pure hormones.  But there is a message behind all the funk--- be unafraid.  Be very unafraid...... Guys, this is a good date movie.

Those were base purely on flash and sex appeal, but I personally don't even really like Ms. Piper Perabo's face (or acting for that matter). The whole stage fright thing got really old.  Besides, they never conveyed that she had worked hard enough to even deserve this success.  They already expected us to start bawling just three minutes in when Violet parts with her friend outside the apartment.  I guess her authentic Jersey accent is supposed sway us.  But I don't even know where to start on that tollbooth u-turn scene... As for everything but the silly bar gimmick: canned and cookie cutter. They must be using some kind of Madlib-like movie templates when they come up with this stuff.  (Witty pun:___Frozen_Assets___)  I'll save my worst rating for something truly horrible.

193,DoubleUK,Flashdance revisited,7,5 August 2000,"I managed to see this movie on it's first day of screening in New York, just before I went back to Europe.'Coyote Ugly' is a nice romantic comedy, perfectly fit for the generation who didn't grow up with 'Flashdance', Saturday Night Fever etc.Piper Perado plays the young aspiring song-writer who wants to get a major record-deal, write songs and then safely watch others perform her music. But then there's this little snag, called reality. Although the story is not very surprising it is solid and consistent told. We understand why she ends up on the bar dancing (no spoiler here). And at the same time we understand why her father is disappointed. A fine part played by John Goodman. At times their relationship reminded me of the one Madonna and Danny Aiello had in the 'Father Don't Preach' music-video. Father reluctantly sees his daughter grow up. And she only wants him to be proud of her.After I saw the trailer on television I immediately went to the REAL Coyote Ugly Saloon on 1st Avenue on which this film was based (unless there's another one, of course). The real bar is not nearly as flashy as it's celluloid counterpart. But they DO hose down annoying customers with beer and there IS dancing on the bar. However by the female customers, rather than the waitresses. But they do get fresh with you if you happen to order something they don't serve. (anything besides beer and Jack Daniels) And they do drink shots with the costumers. Funny detail is that in the movie is explained why they don't get drunk.I know, I know, we already have Flashdance. (Also from Bruckheimer) but I don't mind if this type of story is being updated now and then, right? Although the soundtrack could sound a bit more contemporary.",Coyote Ugly

I have seen MI2, The Perfect Storm, Chicken Run, What Lies Beneath, etc... and none of them left me feeling as satisfied as Coyote Ugly.  I have not seen Gladiator yet so I will not comment on it, but the majority of the summer movies I've seen this year made me wish I had stayed home.  Yet Coyote Ugly had it all. A beautiful cast (both male and female), a story line you actually believe could happen, and a great soundtrack.  The audience laughed, cried, and for the first time this year the audience cheered at the end.  This is not Shakespeare by any means and it is not Showgirls either (sorry guys).

Only unfortunate thing is that she didn't sing in the movie.  Jerry Bruckheimer thought that her voice ""was too low"".  But what the hell?  Didn't effect the movie at all because, you really believed it was her singing.  I couldn't tell.  Anyway, she was perfect for this role, gracing it with the sincerity and innocence it needed, to become believable as the small-town girl, trying to make it in the big city as a song writer.  Definitely expect great performances from her in the future.Maria Bello was great and believable in her ""strong-woman"" role as the owner of the Coyote Ugly bar.  Andy Garcia also surprised me, with a decent performance as Violet Sanford's love interest in the film.  John Goodman stood out with a surprisingly decent comedic role as Violet's overweight father.  And as for Tyra Banks ... well, she was OK, i guess.  Didn't mind her that much, although the only reason she's in this movie is for a little star power to grace the movie posters and trailers.All in all, the movie was decent.  For me, the highlights were Piper Perabo ""singing"" and her scenes with Andy Garcia.",Coyote Ugly
200,novusopiateseclorum-1,Stop me if you've heard this one...,1,9 May 2007,"a small town girl moves to the big city with big dreams, only to get a reality check, fall for a mysterious guy and experience some light drama, only to prevail in the end.heard this one before? it would surprise me if you haven't.aspiring filmmakers, screenplay writers, moviegoers, really anyone that has even seen a movie; coyote ugly is an exercise in exactly what to avoid in doing a movie. terrible acting, terrible writing, annoying characters, predictable plots, and sex appeal to make it sell. almost every aspect of this movie was stereotypical, pedestrian, and underdeveloped. it all follows a very neat and tired formula, that you can see where the movie will end ten minutes in. most of the time, i find the pleasure in films in not knowing the ending, but in coyote ugly, you can see it from a mile away, and don't want to sit through an hour and a half of fluff to get there.in what might be the most overworked Hollywood formula, here we have a small town girl with big dreams who moves to the big city to become a songwriter. but, as expected, the city is not as glamorous and welcoming as it might be, and she ends up working in a bar, where scantily clad women dance on tables and serve drinks to unruly men. she meets one, a sensitive mysterious one, who has a mysterous past and a mysterious demeanor and is just a mystery wrapped in an enigma in a box of puzzles that she falls for. she then gets terrible stagefright playing some three chord bubblegum pop song that sounds just like every other mass produced bubblegum pop song and runs offstage, only to confront this fear later.this formula has been done a million times, and million times better. the dialogue is fake, bored and uninspired, only going through the motions to move the plot along. the acting is horrendous, the actors are so bad and just feel like cardboard cutouts, there is very little acting involved. all of their relationships are underdeveloped, and the lack of good acting negates any possibility of feeling attachment to the characters. my personal favorite downer of the film is the huge talent that the main character believes she possesses in her musical career, after playing three chords and singing something that sounds like it was written by Hillary duff. how is the audience supposed to feel a connection and an empathy for her musical ambitions when she clearly has no talent? in conclusion, this is a movie you've already seen far too many times. this is a terrible film that fails on literally every level. almost every scene, every piece of drama, and every piece of dialogue falls flat with a resounding thud just minutes into the scene. predictable, recycled garbage, in one of the most irritating films ever conceived.",Coyote Ugly
201,AderK,Better buy a magazine,5,20 October 2002,"I watched this movie with a female and male friend. Both were very excited, one because of the girls and one because of Adam Garcia. I watched this movie mainly in expectation of some good music video style dancing scenes and pretty girls. Well, one can't deny that they look good, but they don't blow you off the couch. I was mainly disappointed by the bring use of light and camera. I think most of the scenes could have been great ones, but they stuck into a switch from camera A to camera B and flash a little bit of light. I didn't have the feeling of being in a big party, but in a dirty, loud bar.The girls were so obviously superficial, I can't believe anyone older than sixteen finds those women attractive.About the plot: There is none and the bit of plot that can be found is so predictable, you don't even need to watch until the end.
The most disappointing fact is this happy end and the fulfilling of the `American Dream' that makes everybody happy ad everybody smiles and says: America, Land of freedom were all you're dreams come true. I realized just later that there is a quite big amount of American flags which is quite annoying, since this film isn't a patriotic one in the first place.
If you want to see nice girls dancing, watch some R'NB Music clips or buy a magazine. But don't watch this film. It is not worth it.",Coyote Ugly

Plus there is the one scene where a guy dances on the bar, and does a little strip tease.  The movie was funny as hell to.

Ok, it was made last year, but I have been able to avoid it until today, when we didn't find anything interesting in the shelves.The script is ludicrous, it's so bloody obvious what's going to happen and let's not get into the dialogue.. It's got tonnes of small flaws that bothers me, for instance the microphones is way to far from her mouth to get the words in.. The cast is not even actors, just pretty girls.. The only actor in this movie is John Goodman, that doesn't do a great part like he does when the Coen brothers direct him, but still keeps his honor.The music is awful, this chart-music shite. OK, I can see why my friend in my old school loves this movie, it's kinda told in a woman's view, not that I'm saying it's something wrong with THAT, but it's just so bloody bad.

It's a story of leaving home, making it on your own in the ""big city"", life and love, hopes and dreams.  I know that sounds corny, but it's true.

From what the previews showed, I was expecting a bunch of girls in tight snake skin pants prancing around on top of a bar with liquor being poured all over them while guys in the bar (and in the audience) oggled. Well, I was completely wrong!  The movie actually turned out to have a story...even if it was sometimes cheesy and predictable.  The plot is about a young girl who aspires to become a song writer but has a terrible case of stage fright.  She eventually seeks out a job and joins a group of girls working at a bar in NYC called Coyote Ugly.  Although the story line is rather predictable and even though I wouldn't call the movie oscar worthy (god forbid), it was nevertheless very entertaining and a good choice for a Friday night out with friends.",Coyote Ugly

We've seen movie like this - the concept although.However, the fact that music plays a great part in it, makes it really fun to watch. The soundtrack is partly re-used, partly new, and that makes it for the spectator a great experience.Some people would say it's kind of a sexistic movie, but I wouldn't think so. The women - although they are dancing on a bar - are presented as real human beings with real emotions!When you are searching for a movie without much of a story, which makes it lightly digestible, and make you smile, Coyote Ugly is for you!",Coyote Ugly

Rather, there were strength and courage in the Coyotes' endeavours in a rough and tumble world.  They were just doing a job like any of us and were they good at it.  Above all, I came out of the theatre feeling a sense of empowerment as this was a movie all about realising and celebrating feminism in all its curves and beauty.",Coyote Ugly

213,whaq,"Bad acting, weak plot - Superfluous",3,29 November 2000,"***SPOILER*** Do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway)If you are wondering whether to see ""Coyote Ugly"" or not: don't! It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical ""Chick-Feel-Good-Flick"", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the ""tragic"" accident of the father, the ""difficulties"" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of ""Jersey's"" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and quite funny thing) about ""Coyote Ugly"" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" and now this... what happened to great movies like ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air""? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.If you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see ""Charlie's Angels"" (it's much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).",Coyote Ugly

It fell in line with many ads, TV shows, and films that portray women as sex objects under the explanation that it is showing independent, empowered women. As far as the filmmaking, the dialogue was even worse than The Perfect Storm, which I thought was the worst I'd ever heard. The scene where she shows her boyfriend how it feels to be nervous singing by stripping was truly in horrible taste for a movie that junior high girls are going to be viewing. I really dont know who they were targeting. It was too tame for horny teenage guys and too provocative for young girls who might not mind the awful story telling.",Coyote Ugly

Tyra Banks was great even though I was waiting to see her more on the picture, Maria Bello great performance, and Piper Perabo should be taking more into account in Hollywood because she showed she also is a great actress, and the music, well what can I say this was really the chick flick of 2000 so congratulations!!!!!

Well, it is not worth writing more than a few brief comments so as to dissuade others from watching this dreck.  Based upon a true story?  Who knows...who cares!  The ""story"" is BAD and is not worthy of a movie treatment.The lead, Piper Perabo, looks like a cheap imitation of another actress, Sarah Jessica Parker,  neither of whom possess much talent.  When Piper adds to the mix her character's whining, sad-ass life story, it is comes across as an annoying Kristy McNichol imitation...remember how hard that brooding delivery was to take in the TV show ""Family?""...well, multiply that by about 10, and you end up with ""Jersey,"" a character every viewer wants to instantly hate.This movie is like the female version of ""Cocktail,"" minus the talent and budget.  I truly am surprised that nobody tried to shoot ""Jersey"" when she was playing her ""music"" on the roof.  Only her next-door neighbor had it right, by smashing and banging on the adjoining wall to her rat's nest of a hovel (a.k.a. apartment) the very instant she began playing her horrid version of what was supposed to pass for ""music.""  Clearly, there must have been neighboring penthouse units nearby, and unfortunately there was no Vietnam Vet sniper living in one of them to pick her off when she was on the roof.  I guarantee he would have done anything to get her to stop playing.

""Coyote Ugly"" is much too lengthy to discuss such a basic premise: girl moves to big city to fulfill her dreams and encounters interesting experiences along the way.  Mediocre, teenybop and emotionless performance by lead Piper Perabo, who happens to be in almost every scene. Plus a dumbed-down script that will make you scratch your head and go ""Whaaa?"" while you feel that you're being dragged on by a hole-filled story.I haven't been to Coyote Ugly, so I couldn't say if the movie is a close depiction of what really goes on in a Coyote Ugly bar. In any case, if you like to see women gyrating on bar ledges and people being doused with ice cubes, then this movie is for you.

225,MJDrew97,"Coyote Ugly- ""I'd be shocked if you last another night!""",8,12 April 2014,"A lot of the movies I write reviews for are branded 'amazingly bad' nearly every single time and more often than never, I'm left sitting there going, 'did you even watch the damn movie?' Because sometimes, that's how I feel. Sure, I'm all open for people to share their opinions but there's just some out there that make me want to tap them to a chair and play the movie over and over again.Anyway, that's exactly how I feel with this movie. I've read reviews where they judge even the music they use during the film, which is ridiculous - the music choices in Coyote Ugly just help make it.This is a story about Violet Sanford; an aspiring musician who moves to the big apple in hope of getting a record deal. So, that doesn't happen as easily as Violet had hoped and in order to gain some easy money, she becomes a bartender. Oh! But, not just ANY bartender - A Coyote. Sounds fun, doesn't it? They dance on the bar and guys buy them drinks (which they subsequently hardly ever drink). There is a lot of reason behind the making of this film. I mean, for one, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer film; Mr Big himself. So, just because the movie isn't something along the lines of CSI: Miami, doesn't mean it's not worth the watch. It's funny, it has romance, drunk hot guys... drunk hot girls! C'mon, you have to hand it to them - the whole cast made the film good, great even.Personally, I love this movie, I would've given this a 10/10 BUT I had to take into consideration what other people thought. I mean, whether you watch the Director's Cut or the cinema version, it's still worth the watch. Don't take any one review for granted, watch it for yourself. Solicit Opinions. It's totally worth it.

It's best moments are when it's both. It shows a more human side to the girls at the bar, and adds more depth to Perabo's character.No, this movie isn't for someone looking for an Oscar winner. It isn't. Some of the acting (read Tyra Banks) is weak. Some of the story is too good to be true. You may not like what it has to say about men...or women for that matter.

Oh, by the way, I said produced didn't I, but I forgot to mention the masters name...Producer extraordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer adds yet another great movie to his resume (including Armageddon, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, American Gigolo, and Top Gun among many others).  Bruckheimer also maintains his reputation for producing movies that first and foremost deal with entertaining his audience...such as Coyote Ugly.  This movie offers something for everyone, whether it be attractive women controlling men completely, a great sound track, an aussie hunk, a decent love story, comic relief, a great new talent in Piper Perabo, or the time tested lovable antics of John Goodman... Coyote Ugly delivers.  What the critics seemed to have forgotten the occasional attraction we simple moviegoers have to a movie that is just fun to watch.  When it comes down to it, that is all Coyote Ugly really is, a fun movie that provides a solid two hours of entertainment for an audience weary of pumped up thrillers and human dramas that leave you in a far worse mood that if you had never even heard of the movie.

To be honest - I didn't. First of all most of the plot is not that realistic (are they sure there are filthy bars like the one in the movie with girls like Tyra Banks in them?). Nevertheless my basic problem with this movie is that our hero (yes - she might be talented and some of her songs sound good in the beginning) needs almost the whole one and a half hours to fight the fear of getting on stage. Finally she makes it BUT it is her last time on stage - because she prefers to be a song writer. OK... Whatever... Then what the heck is this movie all about? If you don't want to be a star just forget about it? I don't know.

238,lorovi,i always thought my town was dull,6,6 August 2000,"okay, the critics said this movie was horrible.  maybe it wasn't the most original plot ever.  maybe if the bartenders were 200 pound 50 year olds it wouldn't have been as appealing.  but, they weren't, and so it was.  this movie was fast paced, hilarious, and very fun.  i would definitely see it again.",Coyote Ugly
239,acapela322,Great Date movie or for people who like happy love stories,10,12 August 2000,"Ok I have been waiting for months for this movie to come out and yes i will admit the only reason i wanted to see it was because there was many hot women in this movie.... at first.Then I read the reviews and saw it it got 1 and a half stars in my local newspaper and I was kinda of thrown off by it but because i had read a plot summary i decided to give a shot. Lemme tell you I am so happy I saw this movie. Not only are the women in this movie trey hot but it is an emotional movie as well. Of course those harsh critics who went for a complex plot and in depth character development and guys who went to see it just for the chicks are going to say it sucked because they didn't go to see the movie to be entertained they went for T&A (which because its pg-13 i knew wasn't gonna happen). Well not only did this movie please me it almost made me teary eyed (and i do not cry at movies at Titanic I didn't even come close I laughed at my friend who did). And because Pierabo is so sweet and innocent-looking she sold me. So in my final analysis if your looking for a date movie this is it, and if you want to go to the movies to critique it because you knew you were going to hate it anyway then don't. If you liked High Fidelity or Keeping the Faith, you will be pleased.P.S. To all you Coyote Ugly haters, you probably thought Battlefield Earth was a classic or perhaps Sphere",Coyote Ugly

This movie did not meet my low expectations.  It was nothing like ""Flashdance"" or a female-""Cocktail.""  The dancing was minimal and the close-up shots of boots on a bar is hardly dancing.  New-comer Piper will get better roles but she should continue taking those acting lessons.  Adam Garcia showed the most potential to breakout.  Maybe it's just me but did anybody else think he looked like a blend of Dylan McDermott & Ralph Macchio?  The movie was derivative and cliche.  The soundtrack was the only good part.

Funny, sexy, intelligent, full of hope and optimism.I fully agree with somebody calling it the 'Flashdance' of 2000. But I really tought it was much better. Ok so it's not 'Rainman', so what! Enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a great time. I give it a 10! I'll probably buy it and make a 'Coyote Ugly' party. Tequila from everybody it's on me!I don't recommend a sequel. No Way!

From the looks of it, it was a bunch of underdressed bimbos dancing on a bar. Such a guy movie... but, looks can be deceiving. The movie had a lot of substance with ""follow your dreams"" part of it. Throw in some fun girl-powered bar dancing (even if they happen to have a mile of flat belly and a set of D cups)and a gorgeous Aussie man, you've got yourself a rockin' flick.

It was a toss-up between this and ""What Lies Beneath"", but the final choice came from my mates who said that ""What lies.."" would be a film where some old farts try to act young - which is quite justified for Harrison, but Michelle?? Nah. Anyway, maybe I expect to much from films nowadays - they seem to be thinking up new adorable ideas which are both romantic, funny and interesting, so I thought this was going to thrill me with some more crazy innovative stuff. But, I'm afraid not. They seem to have cut this down to a sequence of little ""nice"" moments which don't fit together very well, so the result hardly involves at all.  The script wasn't funny (apart from the occasional quip by John Goodman), and the ideas upon which the film were based were silly and not-very-clever-at-all. A nice idea, done many times, but still nice - but it was rubbish (couldn't think of any clever adjectives there).

She plays a fantastic role, which is supported by other actresses such as Maria Bello, Izabello Miko, Melanie Lynskey. I felt that Tyra Banks didn't participate in the film for long enough! so no mention for good acting for her !On the whole, a romantic story set around Violet (Piper Perabo) who has her heart set on becoming a song writer, so she moves to New York where she encounters Mr O Donell (adam garcia), but she lacks the courage to perform thus leading her to Coyote Ugly (a bar). The film generally gets better as you watch more of it and by the end you have to be singing one of the several songs in it like 'Can't Fight the moonlight' - just excellent!
I certainly recommend you watch this, and would guarantee anybody even vaguely interested in films would enjoy this one.",Coyote Ugly

Myself personally i have wanted to be a dancer for 14 years and this movie helped me to believe it could happen! They had killer dance music, great moves, and an awesome wardrobe. I think they chose the perfect actors and actresses for every character perfectly. The movie also shows you what the real world is like (well, except we can't all get lucky and walk into a club and find a completee hottie, who also happens to be a nice guy).

Beyond the hotties there actually is a story line. A bit weak and definitely overused but still, a story line. I guess like every other guy I would love to have a beautiful sexy women dance and strut around for me as she ""serves"" me. What amazed me is how much effort goes into being a successful bartender. Beyond the dancing there is more preparation in their success that is planned out, way ahead of time. It was considerably easier for the writers and directors in that this is an based on an actual successful bar ran by women. Go ahead and watch it and enjoy yourself.",Coyote Ugly

I have a condition where once i start a movie i watch it start to finish.  Anyhow, this movie staggered my imagination, even after so many months i can't think of it without cringing. I had never before, and never since been in physical pain from a movie. And in all honesty i was in actual pain watching this.

269,Judge-Penitant,"Reactionary, poorly made, hypocritical and in some places very strange",1,9 August 2009,"I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke I watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.For starters I'd like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more the whores. Are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? This is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of cash. A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.The manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. Any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.And finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend.

272,bethaneybailey,A perfect mix of sexuality and romance.,8,4 June 2005,"Coyote Ugly was the first movie to make me declare my devotion to a single movie as my ""favorite."" Having only been ten years old when I saw it and immediately liked it, I'm assuming most pre-teens nowadays will enjoy it. In fact, I will venture to say that it appeals to all types of people, as it is not your typical ""chick flick"", but it is certainly not a movie solely for men who see the cover and immediately pick it up, wanting to see chicks dressed in skimpy outfits and dancing on a bar.The film's stars are displayed in the film at their absolute best in both acting and appearance. Piper Perabo kick-started her movie career with her leading role, later being cast in the family favorite, Cheaper by the Dozen. Adam Garcia was at his very cutest in this film. A couple of years after the film was released, he appeared in Riding in Cars with Boys, playing a forgettable role for anyone not a die-hard fan of his acting. In this film, however, he and his charming Australian accent shine undeniably as the boy-toy of Piper Perabo's character. This film also launched the costars into stardom, and even the actual bar Coyote Ugly, which is located about an hour away from my hometown.As the old saying goes, you should never judge a book by its cover. This film may appear to be targeting a predominantly male audience, but it is also a brilliant blend of coming-of-age wisdom, family crisis, and romantic drama. It presents all aspects of Jersey girl Violet Sanford's life and journey to stardom with smart humor and inopportune situations. Featuring a few timeless songs on its intelligently varied soundtrack, it creates a vibe with absolutely nothing to criticize.This being one of my favorite movies of all time and featuring my favorite song of all time, I am quite convinced that this movie was created flawlessly and would appeal to all audiences, but I tend to be very opinionated. However, if you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your friends OR your spouse on any given weekend, I would highly recommend giving Coyote Ugly a try. Recognizing some of your favorite actors of the present will undoubtedly be only half the fun.",Coyote Ugly

Nothing but girls talking and dealing with emotions (all with their clothes on) and the girl next door gets her chance to make it big as a singer.

275,alympiaedwards,"Classic movie ""Coyote Ugly""",9,2 May 2014,"Coyote Ugly, released in the year 2000 is still to this day a favoured film. It's a 12 rated romantic comedy/drama based on the existing Coyote Ugly Saloon, which stands in New York just as this film is set in. The running time is 100 minutes. It's directed by David McNally, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman, written by Gina Wendkos and stars Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks and John Goodman.New Jersey girl Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) leaves her hometown, her father Bill (John Goodman), and best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) to live up to her ambition of becoming a songwriter in New York City. Whilst everything was going wrong, Violet results in visiting an all-night diner and notices three girls, Cammie (Izabella Miko), Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), and Zoe (Tyra Banks), flaunting the hundreds of dollars in tips they earned. She then finds out that they work at a trendy bar named Coyote Ugly. She decides to find the bar and convince the bar owner Lil (Maria Bello) to give her a shot at it. Whilst in the process of trying to please Lil, Violet ends up getting cosy with Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia). Kevin commits himself to helping Violet overcome her stage fright so that she can sell her music.She then feels that she can proceed to pursue her dream, and performs at an open mic night at the Bowery Ballroom with the Coyotes, her father, her best friend, and Kevin all there for moral support. The performance goes exceptionally well and she finally lands a deal with a record label.I believe that this film can be loved by millions of people, and that it will never get old.

A movie for teenage girls (and guys who come to perve on the gorgeous Piper Perabo).Violet, a shy singer from New Jersey moves to New York to become a songwriter. Along the way, she pulls a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly where she learns to make drinks, as well as singing and dancing suggestively for the male clientèle. Whilst it is very predictable, with the romance, curing of stage fright and eventual triumph at open-mike night, Coyote Ugly manages to insert a bit more humour and heart than average. Maria Bello as Lil, owner of Coyote Ugly does an excellent job (I loved her explanation of what Coyote Ugly means) whilst Violet is less insipid than most heroines. I'm a fan of LeAnne Rimes, so the inclusion of her songs works great, although I would have liked for the dubbing job they did on Perabo to not be so obvious. Adam Garcia (as Kevin) was bland and boring, and even the 'tragic past' they gave him failed to warm me up to him at all, but it could have been worse.Better than I expected, but not great.",Coyote Ugly

I'm not one to watch something over and over again, so that definitely says something.",Coyote Ugly
