0,MartinHafer,"just okay,....",4,1 July 2006,"Despite the recent tragic early death of Christopher Reeve, I cannot give this film a high score just to be kind to his memory. This film is the sort of over-hyped and overbudgeted mindless film that I usually avoid. While the film is not terrible, it also isn't terribly memorable--having pretty poor acting throughout and being aimed at a young or perhaps stupid audience. I really wish the producers and writers had tried harder to make the film interesting or meaningful instead of spending all the budget on a overblown cameo by Brando as well as an over-the-top publicity campaign. In the end, the film is sort of like eating an entire meal of nothing but egg whites. It fills you eventually but isn't very satisfying.",Superman
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the all time great super-hero movies,10,1 June 2010,"Superman may be corny and cheesy to some people, but for those who grew up with it it is as original and as exciting as it was 30+ years ago. The spectacle of the film is terrific, the cinematography is wonderful and the special effects are dazzling. In terms of effective scenes, the scenes with Clark and Lois are cute and don't take up too much of the film or harm it in any way, while the confrontation between him and Lex Luthor is suitably bright and breezy and the opening is wonderfully elegiac. The score's main theme is iconic and just superb, John Williams has done some wonderful scores before, this score is no exception. The direction is innovative and the script is sophisticated enough. I also much enjoyed the acting. Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast as Clark/Superman while Gene Hackman is superb as the calculating yet comic Lex Luthor. Overall, just terrific fun! 10/10 Bethany Cox",Superman
2,bkoganbing,It's a bird.........It's a plane.,7,21 April 2016,"I've long had a theory that science fiction films and films about superheroes started in the 70s post Watergate. Reality was something to painful to deal with so we made our films with make believe heroes. Whether it was Luke Skywalker newly created or Superman dusted off from the past watching these people do their thing was better than reality any day of the week.After 20 years when Superman went off the small screen, he returned with one whopping budget for special effects that won an Oscar for same. It also had an A list cast and like Lawrence Of Arabia introduced a new face for the lead. Sad in real life the talented Christopher Reeve proved to be all too frail a human, still he fills out the cape and tights. Margot Kidder is the intrepid girl reporter Lois Lane, Jackie Cooper as Perry White still does not like to be called chief, and Marc McClure is the wide eyed Jimmy Olsen. All the folks that on television Superman had to save on a regular basis.Next to those Oscar winning Special Effects the best part of this film was Gene Hackman as master criminal Lex Luthor. With his two retainers Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine as Otis and Ms. Tessmacher I don't think Gene Hackman ever had as good a time in a role in his career. His scenes are mostly with Beatty and Perrine and they seemed to get into the tongue and cheek spirit.As for Reeve he successfully wire walked the task of appealing both as a real hero and a Dudley DooRight. He succeeds on both levels, not an easy thing to do for an actor.After almost 40 years Superman the movie holds up well. The seeds for Superman II were planted here with the introduction of a few characters who would figure prominently in the sequel. It appeals to those of us who like our superheroes both real and with a bit of humor.",Superman
3,Leofwine_draca,Dated in the worst way,4,13 March 2012,"As a kid, I never saw any of the SUPERMAN films. It took me until now, at the age of 29, to finally catch the first in the series when it was shown on television. This may be the reason why I don't hold any affection for the movie whatsoever, and actually consider it to be a very poor film, one that's far too reliant on now-dated special effects for impact and to pad out what is a very thin storyline. Released a year after STAR WARS, this helped to usher in a new era of effects-heavy Hollywood blockbusters, so we also have that to hold against it.If I had to sum up this film in one word, it would definitely be ""cheesy"". The whole film has a dated '70s feel to it, especially in the outer space scenes involving Marlon Brando as an alien and the planet he inhabits. I've enjoyed my fair share of cheese - take a look at any of the Italian STAR WARS rip-offs, which I found hilarious - so this stuff wasn't too bad. Neither was the next section, as we witness Clark Kent's powers on Earth. Once the story shifts to adulthood, it falls apart.The story is dull and boring and the villains senseless. How they coerced Gene Hackman into making this film I'll never know - and as for the embarrassing Ned Beatty, this has to be the nadir of his career. Reeve's decision to play Clark Kent as a bumbling character based on Cary Grant is one that fits with the film's infantile tone, and the many special effects sequences of Superman flying and performing superhuman feats are spoiled by shoddy effects work. The climax is forgettable and the romance with Margot Kidder nauseating. So no, I can't say I'm a fan of this much-loved production.",Superman
4,SnoopyStyle,From one comes many,8,28 March 2014,"This is the granddaddy of all modern superhero movies. It is the first big screen big budget superhero project that had big success and big critical praise. It was a big risk that paid off big time.The first 20 minutes takes place in Krypton. Everything with Zod is probably better left to the second movie. Marlon Brando is a bit of a stunt casting. If not for him, it would make a lot more sense to trim most of that section and leave almost all of it to flashbacks.The next 20 minutes takes place in Smallville. While I liked the story, it's somewhat disconnected from the rest of the movie. Jeff East isn't that compelling as young Clark Kent. The material deserves better, and would make a great prequel.Christopher Reeve deserves all the praises he received for playing the duo role. It would be very easy to ridicule his disguise, but Reeve played the roles very well. They are distinctly two different characters. It also helped that Margot Kidder did such a great job reacting to the duo characters so differently.I am sure many modern audiences have problems with the effects or the pacing. This is a 70s movie after all. Most movies of that era have a different sensibility. The flight with Lois Lane could be taken as cheesy romanticism. It's an attempt to find where this new genre fits. Even if it's not my taste, it's a necessary experiment. For its time, this was a big home run and sets the stage for all those who come after.",Superman
5,Hitchcoc,It's So Exciting...And I Loved the Beginning,9,20 December 2016,"This is, for me, the best of all the Superman films. It takes into account the mythos of the most famous superhero ever. The beginning is so incredible. I already knew the story (by the way, I'm not a fan boy, just encountered it along the way). I think that the Superman oeuvre is the best plotted out of all these heroes' stories. We get to see the struggles of the father, Jor-el, dealing with the short-sightedness of the civic leaders. We get set up for a future with the three malcontents who are out there somewhere. We get the storied life of Clark Kent/Superman as a kid and the struggles he faced. We get an explanation for the Fortress of Solitude. And finally, there is an introduction to Lex Luther, the mastermind, who will make Superman's life a continuous battle. Clark has left home and seems to have some real insights. He is prepared. Now the story and future stories will move along. Oh, we will miss the kind and accomplished Christopher Reeve for this and other roles.",Superman
6,Horst_In_Translation,"Probably not a super movie, but a good one",6,1 November 2017,"""Superman"" is an American/British/Swiss live action movie from 1978, so this one has its 40th anniversary next year. It was the film that turned the comic book character into a full feature superhero to be reckoned with. Sure there were a lot of other inclusions of him in film and television before that, but none of them were really as impactful as Adam West's Batman series for example. The most known were probably still the old cartoons from the days of WWII. Anyway, if you take a look at the people who made this, you will find many big names. The writing team is packed with Oscar winners and nominees that were in charge of several films that are considered classics today and this is also true for director Richard Donner, even if he was never nominated for an Oscar. He is still alive today by the way, in his late 80s. And the cast list is just as spectacular. Brando and Hackman in the same film, add to that Stamp, a personal favorite of mine and Oscar nominees Cooper, Howard, Perrine in supporting roles plus the likes of Maria Schell etc. This project was really destined to turn into something big. And it sort of did.I think it was a good watch. Even at over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it basically never drags, which is quite an achievement. Sure there are moments that you will maybe not like as much as others, but they were gone quickly and it is all subjective obviously. The long runtime is also justified by the story. There really is a lot in here: Jor-El, the childhood, the reckoning of his powers, becoming Superman, leading a normal life at the same time, meeting Lex and keeping catastrophe from happening. At under 2 hours, it could certainly have felt rushed, so it's all good. I am not sure if I am entirely sold on the ill-fated Chris Reeve playing the title character. It's not that he is bad or anything, but let's decide after film 2 perhaps if I think he is right for the part. The best thing about the film were maybe the first 25 minutes as Brando really shines there and I find it shocking that he received zero awards recognition for his turn here, if even the female assistant to the bad guy got some. Speaking about the bad guy, Gene Hackman is a brilliant actor, but honestly he wasn't working too well here for me I must say. Maybe they gave him the wig, so he wouldn't feel like another Blofeld or so as he sure had an aura of Bond villain to him. Just like the girls, especially Perrine's character, felt a bit like Bond girls and as I am a huge Bond fan, maybe that helped the film with me in particular.Still it is okay overall: If you like superhero films, then you can check this one out and like it too. The Oscar nominations it got are okay. By the way, it lost two of those to Best Picture winner ""The Deer Hunter"". So yeah, I liked the beginning the most, but the fact that the film would have worked without it too, shows that everything afterward isn't too bad either. Audiences apparently thought the same and Reeve reprised his role several times in some sequels that were after the first sequel not well-received anymore. But the pathos of Superman is shown by this still being the defining role of his career. And of course, in the wave of recent superhero films, the character is more than present in today's cinematic landscape. Back to this one here: I am not too enthusiastic about it to be honest, but it was a decent introduction to the character and universe and as I have always been bigger on Batman and Spider-Man, my judgment is a bit biased here. ""Superman"" gets a thumbs-up from me. Go check it out.",Superman
7,classicsoncall,"""That'll be the day when a guy could fly.""",8,29 June 2012,"Everyone has their own personal Golden Age roughly corresponding to when they were about eight to twelve years old. For me, that would have been during the late Fifties/early Sixties. I was watching the 'Adventures of Superman' in re-runs during that time, along with my other two boyhood heroes, Tarzan and The Lone Ranger. The TV shows of that era are almost hopelessly hokey by today's story telling and production standards, but as a kid, what do you know? So I recall it was with some degree of anticipation that I awaited the first big screen incarnation of Superman as an adult, and although there were minor inconsistencies with the Superman canon that I picked up on while viewing the film, overall I thought the picture did justice to the iconic super hero. Probably the main thing that bothered me was seeing that big old 'S' on Marlon Brando's chest during the early scenes on the planet Krypton. There really was no justification for that and the picture didn't try to offer any, but it managed to distract me big time whenever Brando was on screen.What the film does real well is interject a kind of whimsy to the idea of a super hero, the kind of character we all envision ourselves to be when left to daydreaming about having super strength or the ability to fly. I know I donned a bath towel around my neck more than once in my youth, realizing full well that I was no match for the law of gravity. Funny how you remember things like that when revisiting old friends like Superman, Batman and Green Lantern; those would have been my favorites from back in the day.Watching the movie today gave me a different kind of perspective that comes from reviewing films on this forum. For example, there's a scene in a train station where one of the destinations called out happens to be Poughkeepsie. Since Gene Hackman appears in the story as Superman's arch-foe Lex Luthor, I had to wonder if that was a subtle tribute to 1971's ""The French Connection"", in which Hackman's character, a New York City cop, asks a street thug if he ever picked his toes in Poughkeepsie. Then of course there's that quick glimpse of New York's Twin Towers (at 1:36:48) of the World Trade Center serving as a stark reminder of the horror visited upon America on 9/11.I guess by today's standards, the special effects of this movie aren't that big a deal, but they're impressive enough in their own way. I particularly liked the way the opening scene established The Phantom Zone as an eternal prison for inhumane criminals, and the formation of the Fortress of Solitude in almost direct contrast to the destruction of Krypton. It was cool to see those elements from the comic books brought to life along with the reversal of time concept I recall from some story I read as a kid. However the best takeaway one can get from the film if you're an old time fan like myself is the way Christopher Reeve's Superman responds to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane when she asks him for the first time 'Who are you""? His answer - ""A friend"". That's exactly what I thought.",Superman
8,gavin6942,Super! (To Say the Least),7,27 February 2006,"Of all the Superman movies ever made and all the movies that ever will be made, this is probably going to be known as the best film about the hero ever. From the beginning to the end, no part of the Superman mythos is left uncovered. The destruction of Krypton, the Fortress of Solitude, Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Jor-El, Pa Kent's death. There's really not much more they could have packed into 2 and a half hours.Directed by Richard Donner (""The Goonies"") and starring Chris Reeves (not really known for anything else), and written by none other than Mario Puzo. Already you know you're in for some excitement. Then you add Marlon Brando and the guy from The Limey as General Zod (who I look forward to seeing in future Superman movies). I should admit at this point I'm unclear why they paid Brano the insane amount of money they did for his role in this film. It could have been played by anyone -- even Brian Dennehy.Jimmy Olsen comes off as being an even bigger loser than in the comics, which saddens me. Margot Kidder is an average Lois Lane, but it really makes me wonder why they chose an actress who is not attractive, can't sing and put her in some of the most hideous outfits ever worn by leading lady. Further, why can't Lois Lane spell anything correctly? She's been a budding journalist since she was 12, basic words like ""massacre"" shouldn't make her uncomfortable.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor gets the finest woman in the film. Luthor, by the way, played by Gene Hackman. Hackman does this perfectly - the mad genius, the eccentricity. Perfection. What I love about this movie is how they kept the plot and characters fun and light-hearted, yet at the same time they didn't turn it into a campy, kitschy lovefest like the old Batman film and show. Could this be Hackman's finest role? Oh, I think it might.If Suoerman fights for ""truth, justice and the American Way"", what happens when these things contradict each other? The ending, which I won't reveal here, has some serious problems. I enjoyed it, but it really makes you -- forces you -- to suspend your belief in reality and give Superman basically unlimited powers. But, you know, it's a comic. Highly recommended for good, clean family fun and something extra for the kids or the child at heart.",Superman
9,lee_eisenberg,"And then, Christopher Reeve became even more of a superhero in real life.",10,9 March 2006,"Obviously, everyone knows Superman, so I'll talk about a few aspects. It was sort of a shock to everyone when Christopher Reeve got paralyzed, seeing as to how we associated him with the man of steel. But his tireless crusade for people with spinal cord injuries showed him to be a sort of superhero in his own right.As Superman's father Jor-El, Marlon Brando seems subdued, but still shows why he was one of the greatest actors of all time (as it was, he and Reeve died within four months of each other). As villain Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman makes a really interesting character: vile, but kinda cool, he's the bad guy who we all want to be deep down. Margot Kidder also has a great role as the title character's self-standing hubby Lois Lane, and Ned Beatty is really funny as Luthor's goofy sidekick Otis. Also starring is Marc McClure as Jimmy Olson.I remember a ""Saturday Night Live"" episode where they imagine what would have happened had Superman been raised in Germany: they conclude that the man of steel - played by Dan Aykroyd in that skit - would have joined the Nazis and been called Ubermann. As it was, Friedrich Nietzsche theorized an ""Ubermensch"".All in all, ""Superman"" is an inimitable superhero flick. I agree with a previous reviewer that ""Batman"" and ""Spiderman"" owe a lot to this movie. Truly great.",Superman
10,jboothmillard,Superman,9,21 September 2005,"Based on the famous DC Comics series, possibly the world's best known superhero, the Man of Steel, gets the live action film treatment with the fantastic fantasy adventure, from director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapons 1-4, The Omen). The film begins far away in the galaxy on the planet Krypton, where alien scientist Jor-El (Marlon Brando) is unable to convince people the planet will destroy itself, so before it is, he and his wife send their baby son Kal-El to planet Earth, taking about three/fours he gains powers under Earth's yellow sun, until finally crash landing. Raised by the Kents, young Clark (Jeff East) learns of his abilities, and after the death of his adoptive father, he decides to leave home to find his real routes in the North Pole, where remains of his world are located. Now all grown up, Clark Kent (introducing BAFTA winning Christopher Reeve) is living in Metropolis working as a journalist for the Daily Planet newspaper, where he also meets reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). When the opportunity comes, Clark dons his blue suit and red cape with the ""S"" symbol on the chest to fly and save the day, and after an interview and flying love scene with Lois, he is named Superman, saving the day numerous times with his super powers. Criminal Lex Luthor (BAFTA nominated Gene Hackman) is convinced he can defeat Superman, when he discovers his weakness for Kryptonite, and with this in mind, he plans to sabotage two nuclear missiles and create an earthquake to wipe out the California coastline. He does stop a large flood, but was too late to save Lois trapped in a car, so he angrily speeds around the world, to change the events of history, stop the disaster and save Lois, and after, take the wig-wearing Luthor to prison. Reeve in his first film role is superb, Hackman makes a great villain, Brando in his few minutes adds some good seriousness. The special effects for the powers of Superman, his world and the situations for him to save people from are fantastic, this was the first film to successfully make a man fly, just a fantastic comic book adaptation. It won the Oscar Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Superman was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 51 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",Superman
11,ccthemovieman-1,Superman Takes Off On The Big Screen,9,10 January 2006,"It's interesting that another re-make is coming out this year. Man, time flies because I vividly remember when this movie came out and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.It's still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as ""Lex Luthor"") and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular ""Man Of Steel"" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this, too.Personally, I didn't care for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with her character. However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence (it's now on DVD, by the way, and worth a purchase), it was just too weird hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!Anyway, this is simply great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.",Superman
12,rmax304823,Cartoon Extravaganza.,6,15 January 2011,"With their planet about to be destroyed, Superman's parents send him to Earth in a spiky space ship that looks like something found on the shore of Mono Lake. The parents are played by Marlon Brando and Susannah York, but their screen time is brief, as is that of a number of other name players -- Trevor Howard and the rest.The Man of Steel is only a Toddler of Steel when he happens to land in Smallville, USA, to be raised by Ma and Pa Kent on a farm. When he's a grown man he travels to Metropolis and assumes the guise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet (Reeve). But I don't have to go through all this, do I? Just a few observations will do. One is that Smallville is presented as if it were the ideal place for a growing boy. Huck Finn should have had it so good. It's a pretty place on rolling flatlands with grain waving in the summer breeze. But we don't really get to see Smallville, and when Pa Kent drops dead of a heart attack, there are only two others in attendance at the funeral, and they stay at a distance and don't speak to Ma and Clark. There is no Smallville. It consists only of the Kents' farm. Maybe it's appropriate. It's an abstraction, an ideal type, and real people and authentic buildings would spoil the concept.Metropolis is a dream world too. The first thing that happens after Clark is hired is that when he and Lois Lane (Kidder)leave the newspaper building they're held up by a street rat. The street rat is a middle-aged, white male in neatly pressed trousers, checkered sports jacket, and turtleneck or something. The busy Daily Planet flourishes and it occurred to me, watching this, that both Reeve and Kidder were headed towards tragedy in the not-too-distant future and that newspapers were on their way out as well.I also found myself wondering if things would have been different if the Toddler of Steel, instead of being set down on the high prairie, had landed on a roof top near, say, 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. Would he have been secretly adopted and grown up to know evil in the same way? Would he still have been able to spell words like ""massacre""? Would he have come on to Lois Lane with some smooth talk like, ""You be da bomb, you Fox""? Or how about if he'd have landed in a neatly kept back yard in Coney Island or Rye Beach and grown up under a Jewish mother? Would his character still have been so thumotic? Suppose he'd landed on the stoop of an ill-tempered Irish cop or on the Corleone estate on Long Island? You see the endless possibilities? What an experiment it might have been in the nature vs. nurture argument. Instead we have Christopher Reeve, nice guy, flyweight actor, being bopped on the head with a crowbar, then turning to the quivering guy who wielded it, and having to say lines like, ""Bad vibrations?"" Wisecracks worthy of Bugs Bunny.At that, the writers have insinuated some edgy lines that will get past the kids the story is aimed at. When Lois Lane first meets the uniformed Superman for an interview, she looks him up and down and asks breathlessly, ""How big are you? Er, how tall are you?"" Well, there's only so much you can do with a super character lifted from 50-year-old comic books because, after all, they live in a simplified world, purged of ambiguity. The villains will be cheerfully evil, like Lex Luthor, not tortured by guilt like Raskolnikov. Nothing wrong with that. What puzzles me is the multiplicity of cartoon super heroes that have been hitting the screen ever since then. Mostly, they've gotten dumber and dumber. But where's the weight on the other end of the see-saw? Hollywood seems to be turning out all this sweet junk food regardless of its effect on our aesthetic health.",Superman
13,BA_Harrison,"It's super, man.",9,25 November 2012,"If director Zack Snyder's last few films are anything to go by, his forthcoming Superman movie Man of Steel will be an overworked, over-stylised cinematic turd. Rather than waste your time and money on watching that, why not treat yourself to a viewing of Superman The Movie; it's near comic-book perfection—an exciting, humorous, spectacular and romantic blockbuster with a superb cast and top-notch production values that, unlike many a modern super-hero movie, doesn't take itself too seriously.The only thing that really lets the film down a touch is the confusing time-bending finalé which presents all sorts of paradox issues if thought about for longer than a nanosecond. Best not to waste any time dwelling on that and simply enjoy the film for its wonderful performances (will anybody ever play Supes better than Christopher Reeve? I doubt it), impressive special effects (for the day, at least), memorable score, and—for me at least—the ability to still make the top of the head tingle with excitement after 34 years as Kent pulls open his shirt to reveal his Superman logo for the first time.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Superman
14,moonspinner55,"Tongue-in-cheek adventures, appealing to the kid in all of us...",7,22 March 2008,"The '70s Superman, featuring the impeccably well-cast Christopher Reeve in the cape and tights, is full of rousing, heroic adventures. An unknown at the time, Reeve's embodiment of the DC Comics superhero is so ideal, it's easy to overlook the film's flaws, including an elephantine third act which is unsatisfying. Spared as an infant from the horrors of his dying planet, Krypton, and raised by a childless farm couple on Earth, Superman as teenager Clark Kent eventually makes his exodus to Metropolis and goes to work at the Daily Planet alongside wily girl reporter Lois Lane. The movie's elongated prologue (with Marlon Brando as Superman's father, Jor-El) is somewhat obscure; the three convicts on trial at the beginning would return for ""Superman II"" in 1980, but no one knew that at the time. Margot Kidder makes a wonderful Lois, while the villains of the piece (Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty as his cohorts) are a charmingly ruthless trio--however, by the time they put their world-domination scheme into motion, the picture begins to feel top-heavy. John Williams' score, with its faint overlay of his ""Star Wars"" theme, is designed to bowl us over (I found it exhausting), while the finale is so inflated with hectic effects and ideas, it nearly renders the end results callow. Three Oscar nominations and the winner of the Special Achievement Award for visual effects. Five BAFTA nominations with one win: for Reeve as Most Promising Newcomer. *** from ****",Superman

There is so much to like about this film it boggles the mind. First off, Marlon Brando playing Jor-el in the way only Brando could. Second, you got Gene Hackman as one of the major bad-asses of comic-book adaptations. Even parents (who might be reluctant to watch anything with their kids) will want to take a look-see at Brando, Hackman, and Christopher Reeve as the man of steel which many baby boomers remember to be their child hood hero. In fact, there are many who do consider this the best super-hero film ever made. Its way up there for me, as it is a well done, with some great action and good actors. A+",Superman

18,hitchcockthelegend,Man of Steel - Film Full of Love,9,15 July 2008,"The planet Krypton is doomed, all life there is soon to be over. Jor-El, knowing that the planet Earth has the same atmosphere, rockets his baby son there post haste. On Earth, the infant grows up to find that he has super human powers that must be hidden from the ordinary Earthlings, he hides away as mild mannered reporter Clark Kent and transforms into Superman whenever evil and wrong doing needs taking care of.I would think most people have either seen Superman:The Movie, or at the least heard everything about it. It's one of those films that sticks out in cinema history as a defining point, and some like me would say a high point as well. I recently revisited the film for the first time in about 5 years and had such a wonderful time with it, the moment John Williams exhilarating score kicks in a get goosebumps and start to believe a man can really can fly.The expectation level on release of the film in 1978 was enormous, one can not understate the hugely iconic love that the DC Comic character of Superman had. A worldwide search for the right actor to don the red and blue cape was underway, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal, Nick Nolte and Charles Bronson were all at times linked with the hot role, whilst James Caan and Robert Redford are confirmed to have passed after being offered the job. All of those great names now seem remarkably stupid choices, and that is purely down to the man that did take on the gargantuan role that was bursting at the seams with expectation. That Superman:The Movie worked (and still does with each passing decade) is down to the wonderful efforts of Christopher Reeve.Reeve positively nailed both sides of the character, making it his own, he is all muscles and square jaw in the cape and then showing wonderful comic ability as the bumblingly frustrating Clark Kent. Sure the supporting cast all contribute grandly, but Reeve carries the picture and lifts it to triumphant heights. Gene Hackman has the time of his life camping it up as super villain Lex Luthor, Ned Beatty & Valerie Perrine flesh out Luthor's cohorts with comedy and sexiness respectively, whilst Margot Kidder is a pure joy as core character of the piece, Lois Lane. Asked to play a love interest but a fiercely strong woman at the same time, Kidder breezes through it and radiates a beauty that couples nicely with Reeve's broadness. Marlon Brando was paid $4 Million for what is little more than a prologue walk on part, but the big name he brought to the party ensured the paying customer went through the doors in droves, but on leaving the cinema it was Reeve's name that most were talking about.Full of outlandish sequences and cheeky comic book ideals, Superman is lasting the test of time as an endearing classic of the genre, it may have been surpassed by quite a few of the more modern exploits by Spiders and Bats, but it was once the Daddy of them all. From x-ray eyes to catching bullets, to pushing nuclear missiles into space and wooing Lois in the sky, Superman:The Movie is a special treat, and oh how I love you so. 9/10Christopher Reeve RIP.",Superman
19,preppy-3,Pretty good,7,8 May 2000,"One of the better comic book movies. The story is vague (something about Lex Luthor causing California to sink into the ocean), but the movie holds your interest. The acting is mostly good--Reeve is perfect as Superman, Margot Kidder is OK as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman is fun as Luthor, but Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty are just annoying. The script is a problem--some times it's funny, other times it's horrible. It was also obviously written ""down"" for the kids in the audience. Also there are lapses in logic and the special effects are pretty laughable. Still, I was never bored and the acting by Reeve and the music score by John Williams carry you through the bad sections. Worth watching--perfect for the entire family. Try to see it letter-boxed though--it doesn't work on full-screen TV.",Superman

21,zardoz-13,Superman On the Silver Screen!!!,8,20 March 2014,"I can think of more good things than bad things to say about Richard Donner's ""Superman: The Movie."" Of course, it's a fun film and Christopher Reeve will always be the standard that cinematic Men of Steel will be measured by. He looks powerful and radiant in his costume. He makes an iconic Superman. Further, Reeve balances out his Superman with Clark Kent and does a good job of differentiating these two individuals. He behaves like a square head when he plays Kent, while he is firm, confident, and naturally in control as Superman. He isn't overbearing, but he has a businesslike attitude. He manages to be both personable. Donner and ""Godfather"" novelist Mario Puzo have crafted the ultimate origins movie. Essentially, ""Superman"" is the grandfather of all costume-clad superhero sagas on the silver screen. Remember, Kirk Alyn had cleaved the airwaves as the serial Superman in the late 1940s and early 1950s, while George Reeves, no relation to Christopher, forged his image of Superman into the hearts and minds of television audiences for the better part of the 1950s. Reeve's Superman constituted the first to appear in a colorful costume. Everybody else had been confined to black and white. Donner and Puzo make the Krypton prologue look visually intriguing and on a far grander scale than either the serials or television series could. However, nothing has changed in substance other than the three Kyptonians that Jor-El sentences to prison sentences before running himself aground the disbelief of his peers when he informs them about Krypton's doomed future. The starship that Jor-El sends his infant son into Earth looks like a gigantic Christmas ornament of crystals. Crystals play an important part in this adventure. We follow Superman as an infant found by Martha and Jonathan Kent, who grows up into teenagers and then leaves the farm on foot to walk to his Fortress of Solitude in the north's frigid regions. Later, he winds up in New York City as a reporter for The Daily Planet where Managing Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper) with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and photographer Jimmy Olsen. Eventually, Superman runs afoul of evil Lex Luthor who obtains a specimen of Kryptonite from Africa. Lex wants to blast the California coast at the San Andreas Fault so it will vanish in the ocean and he will be the owner of the new coast that he can sell for a fortune. First, Lex and his cohorts must reprogram the rockets. Second, they need to take out Superman. Lex sets out hero up so that he opens the crate containing the kryptonite and suffers horribly.Altogether, ""Superman"" definitely rates as an above-average movie with a memorable performance from Christopher Reeve. The film looks massive and Gene Hackman makes a great villain.",Superman
22,Boba_Fett1138,Deserves the classic status.,9,20 March 2004,"""Superman"" already is a classic superhero movie that was ahead of its time and set the standards for many more other superhero movies later to come.From the very first minute you know this movie will be spectacular. The fantastic opening titles (also mainly thanks to John Williams music) really wakes you up and gets to you every time, in a way it already lets you know that this movie is going to be special and spectacular.The movie has a high pace even though it has a lot of story telling for a superhero movie. It takes its time to tell the main characters background and how he grew up, only later it starts to focus on the superhero element of the movie. But due to its good pace you wont start to lose interested for a moment.The movie has lots of different elements. The first part of the movie is drama, the second comedy, almost slapstick like and the third action. All this elements flow really well in to each other thanks to the good directing and story telling but also to the cinematography, editing and music. Everything works perfect in the movie especially the comical elements. It give the movie an high fun level and makes it easy to watch.The cast is very good. Everyone is casted very well, especially Christopher Reeve is believable as Clark Kent as well as Superman and Gene Hackman plays an highly enjoyable and fun villain.The special effects are good and even now days in the time of computer effects they look acceptable. ""Superman"" really was a movie that made the world believe a man could fly.It's too bad that the second halve of the movie is not as good as the first with a lacking final but it doesn't really ruin the movie in any way. The movie stays fun and enjoyable to watch right till the end.A fun and spectacular movie with great characters that shall entertain many people for years to come.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Superman
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A good start,7,9 August 2006,"I've never cared much for Superman. He gets all the attention, while (in my opinion underrated) heroes like Spiderman are widely ignored. He's just too strong. Superstrength, invulnerability... and there's only one thing that can hurt him at all, and it's not even of this world. The main reason I watched this was to get the background that I presumably need to fully understand and appreciate Superman Returns... the latest directorial effort by Bryan Singer in the field of superheroes. From a man who's brought us two of the best comic book films of all time and recent years, who names something his dream-project... it's no choice at all. I acquired all four Superman films, and intend to watch the next three after Returns. The first thing that struck me with this was the marvelous production values, and the visually stunning production design. The plot is quite good and well told. The pacing seemed a tad off to me... somehow, the time spent on various situations and subplots just didn't seem to fit. Maybe I'm too used to newer films. The acting was mostly good. Reeves fills the boots well. The humor(though some of it is very funny, such as Lois Lane's slip of the tongue during the interview with the title character) is silly, much of the time... personally, I didn't like that. The bad guys, with the exception of Luthor(and even he, in some areas... come on, guys... wigs? Though, admittedly, the final reveal was pretty cool) are just too daft. I realize that Americans don't want anyone to view villains as anything but criminals, evil people, but give them just a little character. Give Superman a worthy opponent. That's what makes a hero... overcoming adversity and impossible odds for the good of mankind. The whole fish-out-of-water thing they did with Clark and his colorful and caped alter-ego was perhaps a tad overdone. The effects, I must say, are good, if dated. They did a good job of making us believe that a man can fly. And I must say, the film is definitely a comic book movie... the characterizations, locations and situations are clear indications of that. All in all, a fine introduction to the character, and the references and in-jokes are kind of cute, but I didn't find it out-of-this-world amazing. And can someone explain to me why Lex's assistant must show cleavage in just about every shot she's in? Talk about gratuitous. I recommend this to fans of the character and/or superhero movies in general. 7/10",Superman

Look, up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's the greatest comic book adaptation to date about the classic superhero from Krypton, The Man of Steel AKA Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent (Reeve in his iconic breakthrough performance) who fights for Truth, Justice and the American Way while wooing scatterbrain fellow journalist Lois Lane (plucky Kidder) and battling evil mastermind criminal foe Lex Luthor (Hackman having the most fun on screen in his varied career). Directed with smart, shrewd craftsmanship by veteran helmsman Richard Donner and arguably the most rousing film score by genius composer John Williams, the film never fails to amaze me in its dazzling display of special effects and visual gee-whiz-idness (the latter won a Special Achievement Oscar while the former received a nod too). My favorite scenes: befuddled Kent looking for a phone booth to make his first on screen change into Supe and his subsequent derring do rescue of Lane from a plunging helicopter over Metropolis' bustling streets; and his heart- wrenching scream when he realizes he couldn't save her in another  prompting him to fly around the Earth so fast to change its orbit to go back in time to do just that!

25,neil-476,30 years on,9,1 November 2009,"With the benfit of 30 years' hindsight - and Brian Singer's revisitation to the source - it become clearer than ever what makes this film such a success.It's not Chris Reeve - well, not entirely. After all Reeve was in Superman IV which was, frankly, kryptonite-flavoured poo (incidentally, there is no question that Reeve will always be the definitive screen Superman: not only did he look perfect, he nailed both Superman's moral centre of doing the right thing come what may, as well as Clark Kent's faux naivete).It's not the effects. These have all been done much better since although, for the most part, they were quite well done at the time (the mattes and back projection were a bit ropey, and some of the colour balancing was off).I think we have to be fair and say that it's the script. It's not perfect, but it has a solid story, sufficient set pieces to keep the fanboy happy, and a truth to it which plays fair with the characters.And it's also the synthesis of all the elements involved, which come together and produce something which is greater than the sum of its parts.",Superman
26,evanston_dad,The Man of Steel Is Also a Dork,7,19 October 2007,"Some mighty big names lined up to be in this still-most-famous screen version of the comic book series, but a relatively unknown actress, Margot Kidder, manages to steal the show out from everyone in her performance as the spunky Lois Lane, and it's her that I remember most now.Richard Donner's direction is as square and dorky as Christopher Reeves, who plays the man of steel and looks like a plastic action figure of himself. Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty yuck it up as Lex Luthor and his right-hand man; Valerie Perrine, an Oscar-nominated actress for God's sake, lends nothing really more than her boobs to the picture as Luthor's girlfriend.The movie climaxes with a spectacular earthquake that decimates Southern California and offered what were for the time some pretty dazzling special effects.In this age of dark, angst-ridden superhero flicks, ""Superman's"" cheezy aw-shucksness is rather refreshing. It's much more ""Fantastic Four"" than it is Tim Burton's ""Batman."" Grade: B+",Superman
27,Uriah43,Not without Its Flaws but Still Entertaining Enough,6,14 August 2016,"I personally have mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand I thought Christopher Reeve played a very good ""Superman"". No question about that. I also thought both Gene Hackman (as ""Lex Luthor"") and Margot Kidder (""Lois Lane"") performed quite decently as well. Likewise, the presence of Valerie Perrine (""Eve Teschmacher"") certainly didn't hurt either. On the flip side, however, I thought the inclusion of the comedic role performed by Ned Beatty (as ""Otis"") was especially bad and really cheapened the overall effect. Additionally, I didn't particularly care for the poetry recited by Lois Lane during her flight with Superman either. Rather nauseating actually. But aside from all that, the film had decent special effects and essentially covered all of the essential history--so I suppose it deserves some credit for that. In short, although this movie had certain flaws and definitely didn't fulfill its potential, it still managed to be fairly entertaining all things considered. That being said, I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Superman

Planet Krypton is about to self destruct and baby Superman is transported to earth. Marlon Brando is cast as his father and he transcends all of his power, strength and knowledge into his son. His alter ego is Clark Kent employed at the Daily Planet where he meets reporter Lois Lane. Truly spellbinding and never sidelined by the visually creative process. Director Richard Donner creates a film that asks all the right questions. This is an interesting choice for a director whose previous credit was The Omen. Christopher Reeves plays Superman with great appeal and charm but not without vulnerability. Margot Kidder shines as Lane who spends a weightless evening with the man of steel before the electrifying climax. Gene Hackman plays the evil Lex Luthor who plans to destroy the entire West Coast and knows Superman's one weakness. Ned Beatty plays Luthor's ever loyal henchman.

Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and Jackie Cooper as Daily Planet editor Perry White round out the good cast.Only drawback is that Luthor's plan is just a bit goofy, and the use of time-reversal at the end silly, but otherwise, this film soars because of the late Mr. Reeve.",Superman
30,Aaron1375,A super long film which would be fine except for the content that fills it,6,25 June 2013,"Christopher Reeve played Superman first in a big screen adaptation with a big budget. Therefore, people say he is the best...then when he had his accident and died he became forever locked as Superman to some people. I feel bad for how his life ended, but the man was not a very good actor and if not for makeup, hair dye and a banana in his pants would not of looked the part either. He had his moments where he was good, when he was directed by the very capable, but overrated Donner. Then he was a bit lost when playing Superman in part three, and absolutely dreadful when playing him in IV, yet since he was first and he died tragically he seems to get a free pass. He was an okay actor when directed properly, okay at best. Name another film of his that did anything and you will have trouble recalling one. So we have a new film that finally casts someone that has no resemblance and we have people that want to live in the past and continue to say this 1978 bore festival was a superior film as they seem to forget comic books were written for children so a child should not have to squirm through a movie waiting for Superman and then have to witness Superman's longest sequence on the film being him flying Louis through the sky in a scene that is so uncomfortable and awkward it made me want to exit the room as a child. Looking back on it now, it was not even romantic thanks to Margot Kidder's horrid voice...smoke much Mrs. Kidder? The story spends way to much time focusing on Clark's beginnings without really going anywhere or establishing anything. It takes forever to get to Metropolis and nothing is really built in the time it takes to get there. So we witness all this Smallville stuff and it lasts forever and quite frankly they have to squeeze in Lex Luthor and his beginnings as Superman into a smaller window and it just seems rushed. Louis is introduced and is the most obnoxious woman ever, not to mention she is not attractive, and we are to believe he instantly falls in love with her? Lex Luthor barely has any screen time doing anything dastardly other than killing a cop before coming up with a ridiculous scheme that is brought to an end in even more ridiculous fashion. There are moments, I enjoyed some of the movie as a kid, and I enjoy some of the movie now...overall though it felt way to bloated.Donner wanted to do something grand, but in the end he did not tell the story of Superman in an entertaining enough fashion. As an example, who among us wants to watch the credits at the end of a film? Not many of us, these days they sometimes put extra scenes in a film just to get us watch an annoying amount of names from the stars to the guys who provided their forks at the buffet table. Well here we have to watch a credit sequence at the beginning! Yes, we are subjected to one of the longest pre-movie credit sequences ever. Sure it's rousing at first, but keeps going and going. Let's look at another film from this era, a little film called Star Wars...the music booms across the theater, Star Wars shoots on the screen, a brief scroll comes up telling us the situation, and then we are thrust into the action! Meanwhile, we are still learning who is the writer of Superman. The film just takes to long to get going, then we get to Metropolis and everything seems rushed! However, it was still a well done movie, just a film that seemed to take forever in parts...at the time though this was pretty much the only comic book film of the day and there is a reason nothing made since has been like this, despite people who still proclaim it a great Superman film, it really was not a good comic book film.The casting for this film was not very well done either. They put big stars in small roles and absolute nobody's in the main ones. Louis was not pretty, Reeves made Superman seem like a pansy, Gene Hackman I am guessing refused to shave his head and Marlon Brando did quite good actually. It is a film that has its moments much like the 2006 version, but it has a lot of dead time. People say this is a time for character development, but considering all the dead time they still were not able to really explain why the heck Supes fell for the most obnoxious reporter at the planet, Luthor does not get enough screen time to adequately do his thing and Zod comes off as a one note villain in this and the next film. The next movie though would be a bit better and have more to it...still though neither film is all that super. I saw both as a child as they were released back in the day, I am afraid a lot of the people dismissing the new film in favor of this are the type who also proclaim their music better than their kid's. I fall into this category too, and I may have here, but as I stated...I was never a super fan of the Reeves Superman films.",Superman
31,Wuchakk,"""Miss Teschmacher!""",9,12 March 2014,"I didn't catch ""Superman"" (1978) until over 25 years after its release. It's a great superhero flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated, like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable), the movie definitely stands the test of time despite being shot in 1977.""Superman"" may be a comic-booky superhero flick, but it's also a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema. The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip ""Superman"" just because you assume it's some mere superhero flick. No, it's more, much more. The screenplay seems to have been written with little concern of cost so many are the great F/X sequences.Speaking of Brando, you can't beat the cast, starting with newbie Christopher Reeve knocking it out of the ballpark in the starring role.I'd like to point something out that is hardly ever mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is jaw-droppingly voluptuous!

It's when we get to Metropolis that this movie really comes alive; the sense of humor, the chemistries between Reeve and Kidder, Beatty and Hackman. Not to mention the thrill of seeing Superman first save the day.And on the matter of Christopher Reeve, he is absolutely what makes this all work. He didn't have the star power of Brando or Hackman, but he did the grunt work of lifting the character off of the page and onto the screen. The dignity he brought really made this character real.

34,ShadeGrenade,The Man With The Krypton Factor!,10,28 May 2008,"No sooner had the world recovered from 'Star Wars' mania in 1977 than 'Superman' mania was upon us. But whereas George Lucas' homage to 'Flash Gordon' came out of nowhere to become the top-grossing film of all time ( until E.T. came along ), with The Man Of Steel the publicity bandwagon started rolling a long time before the film received its premiere.I remember telling my friends all about it, based on snippets I had read in newspapers and magazines such as 'Starburst'. Most scoffed. 'Superman' was considered baby stuff, fodder for poorly animated Saturday morning shows.The idea to do the film came from Pierre Spengler, who suggested the D.C. comics character to producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind as a follow-up to their hit 'Three Musketeers' movies. You have to remember that this was the pre-C.G.I. era, hence a project like 'Superman' was always going to be something of a risk. It would only take one person to laugh at the sight of a flying man in blue and red for the whole world to join in.But who to play the lead? Big-name stars such as James Caan and Robert Redford were ( wisely ) ruled out. Rather like Sean Connery and 'James Bond', the producers cast an unknown actor - the late Christopher Reeve - as 'Superman'. Reeve was no muscle man, but could act. A body building course was all that was required to turn him into the perfect hero.A major casting coup was the signing of Marlon Brando as 'Jor-El', Superman's father. With him aboard, it was relatively easy for the Salkinds to secure other stars such as Gene Hackman, Susannah York, Glenn Ford, Ned Beatty, Trevor Howard, and others.The film opened at the end of 1978. Unlike 'Star Wars', I did not have to wait six months for it to turn up at my local theatre, finding myself in the unique position of seeing a major blockbuster before Barry Norman had a chance to review it for the B.B.C.It opens with a shot of the very first 'Superman' comic. A tiny hand opens the cover, and we hear a boy's voice reading the first page. Suddenly, it all comes wonderfully to life. John Williams' marvellous theme explodes onto the soundtrack as the titles hurtle towards the audience like comets.On the ice planet Krypton, three villains ( Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran ) are on trial for attempting to overthrow the ruling elite. Sentenced to exile in The Phantom Zone, we see them spinning off into space, their screams echoing as they get further away. As it turned out, they have had a lucky escape as Krypton is about to blow up anyway. Jor-El and his wife Lara place their only son, Kal-El, aboard a space-ship that resembles a large thistle and send it to Earth. Then up goes the planet. Stanley Kubrick could not have bettered these scenes.The ship lands in Smallville, America in the year 1938. Jonathan and Martha Kent, a childless couple, find the baby Kal-El and decide to raise him as their own.Years later, Clark Kent ( as Kal-El is now known ) arrives in Metropolis to take up a post as reporter on The Daily Planet.I will leave the synopsis at this point but its worth pointing out that although 'Superman' does not show up properly for about the first forty or so minutes the film has been so good it has not been a major problem. Reeve is terrific both as 'Superman' and his clumsy alter-ego 'Clark', as is Margot Kidder as fellow reporter 'Lois Lane'. Hackman's 'Lex Luthor', however, is a bit of a problem. He's very amusing but I found him a little too reminiscent of the campy villains from the old 'Batman' television show. Valerie Perrine made quite an impact on me at the time as his sexy mistress 'Eve'.Luthor has come up with a mad scheme to destroy California by detonating nuclear missiles along the San Andreas fault in order to make the worthless desert he has purchased valuable. The action is, as you would expect, spectacular, particularly the earthquake sequence. But its Reeve and Kidder who make the film work. The 'can you read my mind' scene would have been nauseating without these two. This was Richard Donner's first film since 'The Omen' and with it, he delivered another super-smash hit ( many liked it better than 'Star Wars' ), paving the way for three sequels, a spin-off ( 'Supergirl' ), and most recently 'Superman Returns', which, in my view, was a disappointment.Until 'Spider-Man' in 2002, this was the best superhero movie of them all.",Superman
35,JamesHitchcock,A Too-Perfect Hero,6,16 March 2004,"The original `Superman' comic-book first appeared during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This film came out during the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, economically depressed late 1970s. It seems that whenever Americans are going through a difficult period they need patriotic reassurance that truth and justice really are synonymous with the American Way, even among the inhabitants of a planet on the opposite side of the galaxy.The hero of the film is Kal-El, a native of the planet Krypton, who is only a baby when his world is destroyed. Kal-El's father, however, has designed a special spacecraft which enables his young son to escape to Earth. There he is found by an elderly, childless couple living on a farm in the American Mid-West, and is raised as their adopted son with the name Clark Kent. As an adult, Clark moves to the city of Metropolis where he becomes a journalist. He is, however, aware from a message sent by his father through time of his alien origins and of the fact that he has superhuman powers.
Unless you count the feeble Adam West `Batman' from the sixties, `Superman' was the first of the modern big-budget superhero blockbusters. One of the attractions of this type of film (or, for that matter, of magical fantasy films) is that they serve as a metaphor for the human condition. The superhero may have superhuman powers, but, like ordinary mortals, he is a moral being with a knowledge of good and evil and with the duty to choose between them. (Despite his name, Superman is not a Nietzschean `superman', beyond good and evil). Kal-El, following the lessons learnt from his father, determines to use his powers only for good, and has two identities- Superman, the crusader for truth and justice, and Clark Kent, the ordinary man.The plot, which revolves around a villain planning to destroy California as part of a get-rich-quick property speculation is a fairly silly one, but superhero movies are not the place to go if you are looking for plausibility or social realism. I did, however, think that the plot suffered from one major flaw. Superman seems almost too perfect, with virtually no weaknesses, either moral or physical. In most films which feature heroes with extraordinary powers, there is a limit to those powers, whether they derive from superhuman strength or from magical abilities. The `Harry Potter' films are a good example. In J K Rowling's world, magic operates by strict rules, which can only be mastered by long study. Harry, the teenage schoolboy wizard, has only a limited understanding of those rules, and cannot therefore simply use his powers to do as he pleases, especially as he is faced with enemies who are more powerful than he is. Harry can only defeat them by using his courage and resourcefulness, and the sense of tension in those films arises from the fact that, until the very end, we cannot be sure whether good or evil will prevail. Similarly, the heroes in the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy frequently have to confront enemies who seem stronger than they are; Gandalf may be a wizard, but this does not necessarily mean that he is more powerful than Saruman or Sauron.Superman, by contrast, is a hero whose powers are almost limitless and who is all but invulnerable. The scene where he is able to turn back time by reversing the rotation of the earth is perhaps the worst example of this. Quite apart from the fact that this is implausible beyond even the normal conventions of the superhero genre, it implies that there is nothing that he cannot do, that he is a god rather than a mortal with extraordinary powers. Such a being is so obviously bound to triumph in the end that we never experience any anxiety on his behalf. His sensitivity to `kryptonite' is an obvious plot device to try and overcome this flaw by giving him one single weakness, but even this does not give rise to any great excitement. The result is that the film generates less tension than it might otherwise have done; a less powerful Superman with more limited abilities could have made for a tenser, more exciting film.Christopher Reeve nevertheless makes an attractive hero, gentlemanly, diffident and modest despite his amazing powers. There are some other good contributions, such as Marlon Brando's cameo as Superman's father. As always, Gene Hackman makes a splendid villain as Superman's enemy Lex Luthor, throwing himself into the role with gusto. Despite the progress that has been made in the last quarter of a century, the special effects do not look too obviously dated- you can still believe that a man can fly. Although this film is not really a classic, it still can make for entertaining family viewing.I am pleased to see that I was not the only person who wondered why the Statue of Liberty had moved from New York to the fictional Metropolis.

36,StevePulaski,The abominable classic,8,13 June 2013,"Richard Donner's Superman is the closest thing I've seen to a big-budget, superhero art film in terms of aesthetics and storytelling (we're speaking of a stereotypical art film, of course). There is a big emphasis on scenery and location, long-stretches of the film are void of dialog, and several scenes are left to the audience to decide how to feel, rather than giving them a perfunctory emotion to explore. Now if there's anything I want to see it's a superhero film shot for less than $500,000 to open the next Sundance or South by Southwest Film Festival.But I digress. With the enormous commonality of superhero films in present-day 2013, no doubt has Donner's original classic been left in the dust. It's so easy and justifiable to view it as a corny piece of cinema, but one must respect its roots and its participation in the foundation of an incredible genre. There's something I never thought I'd call that particular body of cinema. And in its own right, Superman is an incredible movie. There's something sincere about being able to call a film made up almost entirely of effects ""incredible."" We begin by seeing Superman's biological father Jor-El on Krypton, a dying planet that is bound for uncertain turmoil. Desperate and worried about his infant son's potential being unfit for the planet, he sends him down to Earth in a pod that crash lands in an open field. The baby is discovered by an older couple that raise him under the name ""Clark Kent."" Clark would be a normal tyke if he wasn't so damn powerful, with his speed and super-strength.He grows up into an all American boy, drop-dead attractive and sophisticated, and works for the Daily Planet, a successful newspaper in the big city. He meets and grows fond of journalist Lois Lane, and tries to protect her in the face of crime and danger and Lex Luthor. Luthor is trying to destroy a large part of the west coast to greatly inflate the value of the desert real estate his company owns. Kent, who evolves into Superman, must become bold, brave, and smart enough to stop him in time.The special effects here are enthralling. The large-scale approach the film uses, even when the film isn't looking for a riveting spectacle sequence, is pleasant and rewarding in terms of payoff. Early on, the film relies heavily on scenes of the countryside, showing Clark Kent's adolescent roots. Shots capturing the indescribable, rural beauty of American farmland are terrifically and memorably captured.When the film ventures into the big-budget, groundbreaker it was meant to be from the get-go, it remains enticing for the most part. Occasionally, the film gets to be a bit slow and sometimes feels like it is trying to drag out its material to opus length (IE: the opening sequence on Krypton could've been cut in half). The film, also, has trouble trying to find a consistent tone, often running amok in the possibilities and situations it could throw its protagonist into. It's nice to see variety, but the cohesion isn't as strong as the content would suggest.Furthermore, it wasn't until the end of the film did I realize that the film robs Superman of a strong identity. This could very well be one of the perks of the neo-superhero genre. The character of Clark Kent is pretty empty and unremarkable when not in his shiny suit, and there is almost no emotional depth to him whatsoever.The film features a laundry-list of solid performances, most notably, Christopher Reeve's as a strong, rock-solid protagonist. Reeve pulls off Superman's charm with the intelligence and design his character needs to thrive and function. Supporting performances by Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane are enjoyable, and Marlon Brando's brief stint as Superman's biological father is utilized efficiently.Fortunately, the film zips along with zealous energy and its action sequences are favorable and generate priceless excitement. If anything, it takes even the most modern viewer back to the time when motion pictures seemed more wholesome and primitive. The time when everything had a discernible cheeriness and not all content had to be dark, heavy, and subversive to the point of alienation. Superman is enjoyable when seen through that and various other perspectives, and if you approach with the mind of whimsy and joyfulness, then there's almost no excuse why you shouldn't enjoy it.Starring: Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando. Directed by: Richard Donner.",Superman

But this was so original for it's time and the effects were astonishing! While it is very corny and goes over the top with the cliché hero/villain relationship, Superman is just a fun little movie to watch. Despite that I'm still digging Batman even more, but Superman is cool to watch too. :D I had heard that there was a new Superman movie coming out and I had not seen the original Superman movie in a while, so I figured I should re watch before seeing the new one. Comic book nerds, I know they'll love this movie! :D No offense to those who are! Remember, you'll be the rich one's in the future!

38,blanbrn,Not the best comic book adaptation film still one of endurance and enjoyable stamina!,7,29 September 2016,"Wasn't the biggest ""Superman"" fan around still the 1978 classic is worth a watch it's a film that kind of started a springboard for the hero genre on the big screen and for it's day and time of 1978 highly entertained with special effects and big screen graphics on the screen. The story is pretty simple it involves the Krypton council with a look into the creation of the one and only ""Superman"" himself as Jor-El putting his son on earth for a special purpose with special powers which involves helping people and flying and stopping trains, planes, and cars, faster than a speeding bullet! All of this while facing the doom and gloom from villain Lex Luthor and on the side a sweet and nice subplot exist in the form of a romance with reporter Lois Lane. And the acting and performances are from an all pro cast which includes the now late greats in Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve, and good supporting turns from Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and Ned Beatty so fly high with this film it's one you can visit again and it's entertainment endurance and stamina holds up for viewing pleasure.",Superman

40,DKosty123,Richard Donners Superman,7,15 February 2007,"This is an amazing film. This is a expensive film, with a loaded cast. While critics were complaining about how much Brando was paid for this role they didn't realize Donner was actually shooting scenes of Brando for 2 movies. Then, even though 80 % of the second movie was shot, Donner was fired & Richard Lester hired to redo Superman 2.Because of Donner being fired, this complete film has brilliance, but is an UN-even gem. The humor in this is very well done, & the acting is great by every standard. Christopher Reeve became the man of steel here & did it well. Margot Kidder finally achieved stardom as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is brilliant & over the top as Lex Luther. The trouble is you must have patience to wade through it as the early sequences drag a lot making this a long film. While there is plenty of good stuff, the youngest viewers get little out of the long sequences on Krypton. This is Donner's work at it's most subtle.It is also the reason he got fired, as even though this film is very good, Richard Lester was brought into the second film because he would shorten sequences Donner liked to make long. Because the second one was nearly complete, Lester did not hurt the second film with his work. Lesters problems show up in Superman 3 when he makes that film into a quagmire whose only redeeming quality is Richard Pryor.This one, has so much good in it, that even little cameos like the one by Larry Hagman get lost in the shuffle but are gems for history. As for the ending, well turning back time was the only way to go. It is too bad time has robbed us of Reeve much too soon & much to harsh a way.Truth, Justice, & the American Way are treated well in this film. The humor & acting are superb.159",Superman
41,lasttimeisaw,Dated but pure popcorn,7,27 June 2016,"The silver-screen debut of Man-of-Steel, from its flashy opening credits and title cards, under John Williams' déjà-vu anthem, Richard Donner's SUPERMAN is blatantly striving to model itself on the triumph of STAR WARS (1977), one year earlier. Bombarding with some serious name-dropping (8 Oscar winners or nominees, including, the ludicrously first-billed Brando, second-billed Hackman, Beatty, Cooper, Howard, Perrine, Stamp and York, sorry, Glenn Ford and Maria Schell, you are not in that rarefied elite, any modern blockbuster can muster such a thespian-struck roster?), where the two true (although green as grass) leads Reeve and Kiddler are unassumingly sandwiched amongst, it does serves as a pick-me-up for a doe-eyed first-time viewer.It is unavoidable to feel the spectacles outdated and less spectacular, since the state-of-the-art special effects of its time have inevitably and unchangeably aged with the ongoing progress in the technology field, the matte shots and miniature models look incredulously primitive to the eyes accustomed to the digital VFX, but, on a plus side, it acts as a telling remainder of how far the advancement has evolved in less than four decades. The helicopter accident is still damn good by today's standard, the same cannot be said to the barren Krypton setting and its fluorescence- heavy aesthetics, no way this species is far more superior than earthlings, not with that thinly-built prologue.The late Christopher Reeve, exudes an affable down-to-earthness, wonderfully embodies the dual personalities of Clark Kent and Superman, not an easy task to fool everyone considering his towering stature, which completely outstrips his successors. Kidder's Lois Lane, is a daredevil herself, and not a priggish dame either, ""can you see the colour of my underwear?"", that's a borderline risqué line cannot pass today's PG rating criterion. An offbeat scene where Miss Teschmacher (Perrine), pecks a little kiss on Superman before saving him from Kryptonite, seems so impromptu, but rightfully shows that a woman can have some initiative too, especially the object is Superman, in both cases, all contend that woman doesn't have to be straight-jacketed in the innocent damsel-in-distress slot or the sexed-up bimbo sidekick niche, which is very surprising to see in the first instalment of a franchise, which is notorious for being patronising to its female characters, what would go wrong from then?The rest supporting roles are uniformly monotonous in its cartoon-ish characterisation, which is understandable, Hackman and Beatty make a golden duo nevertheless. What really comes as a shock is the setting-back-time stunt, is that rather too far-fetched even in Superman's capacity? Or, why this very useful manoeuvre hasn't been deployed in the revamped DC universe yet? That will allow the justice side as many opportunities as possible if they fail to restore the peace in the eleventh hour, Superman can always turn back time a little bit in a cinch, maybe that is something the upcoming Justice League movies can tap into.",Superman

44,OllieSuave-007,Christopher Reeve IS Superman!,8,21 February 2014,"Several actors have graced the big screen playing the red-caped superhero, but it is Christopher Reeve who symbolizes the superhero in his iconic portrayal. On the planet Krypton, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sends his son, Superman, to Earthwhere he leads a normal human life as newspaper reporter named Clark Kent. But, he soon discovers his superpowers and flies around in his iconic underpants and tights, saving the day and attempting to save the world from the evil Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).For a movie made in 1978, the special effects were sophisticated and fun to watch. The character development was great and the chemistry between Clark Kent and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) were terrific (although Kidder was a little corny at times).Though a very long movie at over two hours, this film grabs your attention from start to finish, filled with intense drama and action (making you want to root for Superman), with humor (especially funny one-liners) and sci-fi fun mixed in, providing us with a very entertainingly balanced movie.Grade B+",Superman
45,thesar-2,"That's Clark, nice.",10,9 July 2009,"""You will believe a man can fly."" No truer words (original tagline) were revealed in the best comic book/superhero adventure of all time. I'd like to add, ""You will believe there is an honest man still alive."" One of my all time favorite films, and a perfect family adventure (no nudity, language, sex, very mild violence – or its off screen, great message, uplifting, mirrors Biblical references, the obvious Christ-like ""Only son sent to Earth to save humankind."") What a masterpiece of cinema. The performances by ALL actors were excellent, and the late Christopher Reeve was the iconic Superman. He was very toned down, certainly not a Schwarzenegger-type. And he didn't need to be; we still believed he was the strongest man in the universe. Hackman was excellent and obviously having fun. I have loved many scores, a great majority by the master John Williams, but 'Superman' has to be one of the best. For forty years (now it's been over seventy) there's been little to say about the music in relation to Superman. Williams brings the character alive with the iconic, fantastic score that is still recognized today. Above the excellent performances, humorous dialogue and great theme music, is the message. Here we have a lone survivor of the doomed planet Krypton (ironically, 31 years later, the argument on Krypton mirrors today's debate on Global Warming, and shows we haven't really evolved too far) who has all the power in the world and chooses to not only do good, but lead by example. Superman has always been my favorite character of all time, and this movie clearly shows why. The character of Superman has always uplifted me, and here's the proof. Reeve makes you believe a man can not only fly, but can soar with spirit.",Superman
46,Robert_duder,A brilliant Epic for the generations!!,9,29 September 2005,"This is it ladies and gents...my 200th review. I thought long and hard about what I would dedicate my 200th review to...would it be something new and flashy, a movie that I knew was a knockout, something more personal to me?? One of my faves perhaps?? I finally decided on this film. Since I was a little boy I have loved Superman. Even now many years later I am still fascinated by the character, I mean he has withstood 6 decades of changes and world upheaval and still one of the best selling heroes of our time. Without further ado let's talk about Richard Donner's big screen epic Superman: The Movie. Thanks for reading my reviews!! Superman: The Movie MUST be judged not by today's standards but by the standards set for films of the late seventies/early eighties. That's not to say that it doesn't stand up for itself even almost 3 decades later but it's true brilliance may be lost if you don't remember when and where it was made. Brilliant Director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon series, The Goonies, and stocks of brilliant TV series) I think really knows what the audience wants out of characters. I'm sure he tread on thin ice when it came to bringing the infamous Man of Steel to the big screen having only comics and TV and radio before him to base it on. Donner took everything Superman stood for, truth, justice, American Way, fighting evil, his estrangement from his home planet, his love for Lois Lane and put it all into this film.Nothing is left out of Superman, we have the origins including an in depth look into Krypton (which at the time would have been a first.) We see Kal-El's parents and their conflicts, we are given a small introduction to Clark Kent's youth and his coming of age and then everything else we know and love about the Superman legend. Everything from ""The Phantom Zone"" to Lois and Clark falling in love. I always thought the casting for Superman was it's one downfall but after watching the film again I really see that it wasn't such an error in judgment.The late and incredible Christopher Reeve truly was built for Superman. He embodied the character and created two completely different people to the point where you believed a pair of glasses and a different part in the hair was the perfect alter ego. His Clark Kent was goofy but pure and honest but completely different from the strength and character of Superman. His Superman was tall, larger than life, strong, honest, too good to be true. He was perfect and he looked both parts perfectly too and he will forever be known....in my books...as The Superman of film. Margot Kidder pretty much had Lois Lane nailed. I always thought she was a little old for the role and wasn't sure she looked the part but the personality was perfect, strong, forceful, pig headed, leap before you look kinda gal. And the chemistry with Reeve's Superman was very good. They established a fast but very bonding romance between the two characters. The supporting cast was also well done...Jackie Cooper was great as Perry White, Marc McClure was perfectly cast as the young, naive Jimmy Olsen, and Marlon Brando was an awesome screen presence for Jor-El and considering the billing he got for his brief role it's good that he had that pull. Gene Hackman is a brilliant actor, I've loved him in many roles...he was not right for Lex Luthor or perhaps even his character wasn't written right. Although diabolical and evil it was done in a comedic way right down to the doofus sidekick which was more cartoonish than it was big budget film. You just didn't truly feel the tension and arch rivalry between Reeve and Hackman's characters. The only other beef I can find with Superman is the overlooking of some key elements of reality. Yes I know Superman must leave reality at the door and that's easy to do with such a brilliant beautifully done Epic but the whole concept of Superman reversing time by making the earth spin backwards, or turning into Superman and having his ""human"" clothes literally vanish into thin air...these are things that the writers should have looked more closely into. But I think they focused so much of their time on making sure other elements were in place that they let these things slide and that's okay but it's such a minor thing but still with such perfection in other areas they stand out.Special effects like this had never been seen before and they are still stunning. Watching Superman fly and the explosions and earthquake and his miracle powers are just wonderful and will forever be in the mind of movie goers. This is such a brilliant film and put a stamp on the genre of superheroes that every other film will try to live up to. For the record I am thrilled and excited about the upcoming Bryan Singer Superman film, I think he will take everything that was great about this original and utilize it to continue on the epic. Bravo to him!! Superman: The Movie also had and still has one of the most haunting, beautiful and stunning scores ever created. The music became his anthem no matter where Superman is. This is one of the best films ever, and will always be a classic especially to me!! 9/10",Superman
47,g-bodyl,A Beginning for Superheroes!,9,11 January 2011,"This Superman movie began the entrance of superhero movies in Hollywood.

It had this epic feel that was helped by John William's amazing score.This is about the beginning of Superman/Clark Kent and his mission to make Earth a better place. Of course, Lex Luthor had something else in mind.The acting is very good. In 1978, Christopher Reeve was virtually unknown but he is perfect. The rest of the cast is legendary like Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper, Ned Beatty, etc.The special effects are great even by today standards.

48,ericstevenson,Of course it holds up,10,4 February 2017,"Nowadays we live in a golden age of superhero movies to the point where we forget the original ones in the genre that were considered the best ever. I truly believe that this was the first truly great superhero movie and most people agree with me. This is easily the best Superman movie I've ever seen and it's something that can never be topped. It's as perfect a film you could ask for the man of steel. Even the first minute is wonderful. We get the film being set up like a theater with a screen surrounded by curtains. To be truly authentic, it actually shows the original Superman comic that started it all. Then it extends to the whole screen to truly begin the film.The atmosphere is probably what makes this film so great. I am just amazed at how bright everything looks. It's just so clear. One of the first scenes in the movie is showing General Zod and his followers being banished from Krypton. It does a great job of setting up the sequel even though it has nothing to do with the rest of the film. The effects in this movie are top notch. The planet exploding with all those rocks is what really makes the opening scenes. We get to see Superman grow up. The amount of time they show him doing this is perfect. We don't see him in costume until 47 minutes into the movie, but the film's so long that's not a big complaint at all.The pacing in this film is some of the best I've ever seen. Lex Luthor is set up wonderfully. It's just great to watch him figure out Superman's weakness. It might be far-fetched, but he's a genius so I could forgive it. I guess radioactive pieces of your home planet would hurt you. We get so much of the Superman mythos set up. We learn about how he can't see through lead and simply wants to fight for truth, justice, and the American way. There's a great joke Lois Lane then makes saying he'd be against every elected official. Insert Donald Trump joke here. It's a movie that redefined superheroes and I am in debt for it paving the way for future films. It also helps that Christopher Reeve is so amazingly likable as Superman. He comes off as so real in this movie and I can easily say he's the best Superman I've ever seen in any version. Even the ending credits are great! They show the names and just jump off the screen with these cool effects and do it for the entire ending sequence. It's such a wonderful film to look at. It's great to be gradually introduced to all these classic characters this way. I simply can't imagine any Superman movie being better. ****",Superman

51,CuriosityKilledShawn,Miles better than the 2006 disaster!,7,15 March 2007,"I had only ever seen the TV version of the original Superman movie until I bought the HD-DVD. So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the 'full' movie until now. And I have to admit, it's far, far superior to Bryan Singer's self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns.It actually takes quite a while to get going, but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that? Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated, clumsy, meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody, including secret love Lois Lane, falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination (the modern term for World Domination). But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography, the music, the editing, the pacing. I won't call the SFX fake, since it doesn't ever take you out of the film, so I'll just call them 'quaint'. For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation.Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle, such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don't you think? It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years, will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule, I think not.",Superman
52,callanvass,The man from Krypton,9,13 December 2013,"I watched Superman Returns the other day, and was extremely deflated, because it was such a boring epic. I admit to not being the biggest Superman fan, but I remember enjoying this movie very much, years ago. After the dull experience I had with Superman Returns, I was really hoping this movie would wash the bad taste out of my mouth from Superman Returns. I can honestly say it did just that. With how unbearably heavy handed Superman Returns was, it was refreshing to find out that this movie has a sense of humor, along with some laughs. It doesn't take itself that seriously, despite some poignant moments. I really loved the epic opening to Superman. As much as I hate Marlon Brando, I couldn't help but admire the spectacle. Even for 1978, it still holds up to this very day. It doesn't have a dated feel, and it remains as fresh as it was when it was first released. The first 60 minutes or so has some terrific build-up on Clark's upbringing (Nicely done by Jeff East) It has some terrific action scenes, such as the Grand Canyon scene, or the helicopter rescue sequence. This is heavy on story, but it doesn't skimp out on the action. It knows how to perfectly balance the two to make a great epic. Christopher Reeves is excellent as Superman. He has Clark's nerdy demeanor down pat, while having his confidence as Superman. He embodies what Superman is all about. It was a great casting decision. Margot Kidder is effective as Lois Lane. She's lots of fun in the role, and I loved her sassy portrayal. Gene Hackman is solid as Lex Luthor. His hammy performance was fun to watch. I hate Marlon Brando, but he does deserve credit for the Jor-El role. What I don't like is how he vetoed other people, such as Sylvester Stallone & others, just because he had casting rights. Ned Beaty is good as Hackman's accomplice. Jackie Cooper is great as Perry. Stamp (General Zod) & others do fine. Overall, this is a terrifically fun experience. It has a great storyline, solid action, and non stop fun. I highly recommend it. I just hope Man of Steel is as good. I'll check out the sequels to this movie at some point9/10",Superman

The first real superhero movie and the foundation of the genre that has enormous expansion these days. But even after a great number of superhero movies that followed and huge technology advancement, in my opinion, this movie still has no match.

Beatty and Perrine are also quite amusing as Luthor's bumbling and curvaceous assistants, respectively. The rousing score by John Williams really adds to the sense of excitement. The last part of the film becomes a bit too silly but in general this is quite entertaining as it does not take itself too seriously while avoiding becoming campy.",Superman

Everyone knows the story, but here is my usual plot in a paragraph.Plot In A Paragraph: An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where he grows up to become his adoptive home's greatest superhero.All of the cast do a great job Gene Hackman plays Lex Luthor brilliantly, Margot Kidder is spot on as Lois Lane (though she is not my favourite incarnation of Lane. That would be Teri Hatcher in TV's ""Lois & Clark"")and Marlon Brando gives one of his best performances, but this movie is all about Christopher Reeve in the dual role of Clark Kent and Superman. He is perfect, and nobody has been able to hold a candle to him since. Ned Beatty, Valerie Perrine (who I had a massive crush on as a kid) Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure and Jeff East all offer solid support whilst Glen Ford and Terrance Stamp do well in their small roles too.The story is fantastic, it is beautifully filmed and the special effects still hold up today. All of this and I haven't even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams that become so well associated with the character.Brilliantly directed by Richard Donner, I love everything about this movie 10/10",Superman

"" Big Time Treatment of SUPERMAN Tale Took Man of Steel & All Comic Book Super Heroes From Matinée To The Highest Level of the Motion Picture",10,22 June 2007,"When this Super Saga hit the Theatres in 1978, it could only be described as ""a Dream Come True!"" This surely must sound trite, but what else could be said? This picture starts off fast and never slows down. There is an opening sequence wherein a young boy reads from a from a mock up of a copy of a fictitious copy of ""Action Comics"" which provides a proper preamble to the presentation of the then 40 year old comics feature. The scene is in Living Black & White. While you never really get a good look at this little kid, it is obvious that he's wearing the sort of striped Tee shirt and jeans. As he lays, sprawled out on his living room in front of the radio, we hear words something like:""In the 1930's a Great Depression had the World in a terrible ..here was the great newspaper,The Daily Planet.....then came a Great Champion of the People.......!""(you know, something like that! The still non-colored screen (sort of a sepia tone)in a non wide screen format, irises in on the roof of The Daily Planet, as it would look in a Comic Strip illustration of that 1938 period. Suddenly, image on screen widens, film goes to full color, a Modern Looking ""Planet Sign/Logo. Now, up tempo of Orchestra and about 20 minutes of credits! The producers spared no expense. The Special Effects are dazzling and may well be the best on screen up to that time. And please remember, this was long before so much of this 'computer generated' images.The Effects alone would never carry any film. That is there must always be a story to tell. And even though this Origin of Superman tale has been told many times, the Director and Company kept it lively, interesting and even believable.(Honestly, they did!) The Supercast was well used from beginning to end. We are overwhelmed by the scenes of Marlon Brando as Jor-el, Superman's Father and top Scientist of Krypton, doing his best Perry Mason on a Court trying a Trio of Kryptonian Traitors. (Wait a minute there! Mr. Jor-el was Prosecuting, not Defending. I guess he was doing Hamilton Berger!)The trial over, the subject turns to Mr. J's theory of an impending explosion of Krypton. Council disagrees. Jor-el and Lara (Mrs.J.) send their baby son, Kal-el off to Earth in model space craft, lots of Space Travel stuff and then...................Well,you know!* Christopher Reeve did a virtuoso performance in his interpretation of both Superman and Clark Kent. Rather than wearing any type of phony muscle padding, Mr. Reeve chose to Pump the Iron along with a High Calorie/High Protein Diet. Under the tutelage of former British Power Lifting Champion (called 'Strength Lifts' in Britain), David Prowse.** Chris built himself into a real Herculean, Superman-type of physical specimen.And in no small way is the success of the film the same without the fine John Williams Score. From beginning to end our sense of hearing is treated to a veritable symphonic composition that belongs in the same league as work by some guys named Bach, Beethoven, Lizst, Shubert, etc.(You get the picture.) Remember the tag line that was used in advertising SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE? It was: ""You'll believe a man can fly!"" Hell, we already knew that! * The Production did a fine job with these Council and Trial scenes and the Convicted Traitors eventual banishment to the Phantom Zone. Not only that, but they also set up the premise of the story a $equal or $equal$!! ** David Prowse, 6'7"", 270 lbs. of finely trained Muscle.

59,zkonedog,I'll Always Believe A Man Can Fly After Watching This Movie,10,12 March 2017,"In today's Hollywood, superhero movies are serious business. Not only do they dominate the box office year-in and year-out, but their themes are usually dark, gritty, or very much based in reality. This film takes a different approach. Though it probably could come off as dated viewed from today's lens, it simply comes from a different era where superheroes were a bit more fun, light-hearted, or comic book-esque. That being said, this 1978 is still my (if not THE) definitive portrayal of the Man of Steel thus far in cinema.For a very basic overview, this film can be broken down into three distinct acts:Act One focuses on Superman's doomed home planet of Krypton. Scientist Jor-El (Marlon Brando) can't convince the Kryptonian council that the planet is doomed, so he sends his only son (Kal-El) to Earth in order to perpetuate their heritage. The interesting visuals and cinematography of these scenes are some of the best the film has to offer.Act Two features a young Clark Kent (Jeff East) as he lands on Earth, is raised by Jonathan (Glenn Ford) and Martha Kent (Phyllis Thaxter), experiments with his super abilities, and ultimately learns of his Kryptonian heritage via a trip to the Arctic.The Third Act introduces the blue-and-red suited & caped hero we all know and love, as well as his alter-ego of mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) . Key themes here include Superman becoming the hero of Metropolis, his burgeoning love for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and the battle to stop the latest diabolical scheme of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).What's amazing about this film is that those first two acts are actually even more enjoyable than the third! In this specific movie, the Superman mythology works just a tad bit better than even the action/adventure beats, which is quite a feat. I also always enjoy the comedic touches throughout the film. Though admirable, the ""Boy-Scout"" aspect of Superman is cloying, so the injection of small humorous moments is a welcome respite. For example, the over-the-top Daily Planet editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and Lex's comically inept henchman Otis (Ned Beatty) provide a perfect counterpunch to the more serious themes.Of course, a lion's share of the credit for this film's success has to go to Christopher Reeve. While I could argue the merits of different Batman actors for days, Reeve is still my definitive Superman. Not only does he portray the square-jawed defender of ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way"" admirably, but his bumbling Clark Kent is also a sight to behold. Truly one of the greatest acting performances ever put to celluloid.Going all the way back to my youngest days, there may not be another movie I've seen more times than ""Superman"". It captivated me as a child, and still does as an adult (albeit in completely different ways). I recommend this exciting, intriguing, inspiring movie to anyone--young or old. As the tagline says, you will indeed ""truly believe a man can fly"" upon its completion.",Superman
60,poe426,Still stinks...,1,25 March 2009,"I fell for the hype. ""You will believe that a man can fly."" Boy, did I want to see this one. Superman has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. He's always there; maybe not up front where he used to be when I was a kid, but he's there, nonetheless. It's hard to express the kind of love one feels for a character one has grown up with. Even now, after all these years, the eyes well up and the heart breaks at the memory of a lonely childhood spent living vicariously through comic books. This guy was there (and there FOR me, when no one else was) for so long... I finally stopped buying comic books when they went from a reasonable 12 cents to a whopping 15 cents. (Oh, I'd bought the occasional Gold Key or Dell comic at the higher rate, but they were few and far between: DC and Marvel had been my mainstays.) By the time SUPERMAN-THE MOVIE came along, my tastes ran more to sports like boxing and ""real books"" (books that had no illustrations other than on the covers) and women.But just seeing that familiar blue and red costume again was all it took: I made up my mind to see this movie. Something vital had been rekindled in me. My heart soared as it hadn't in a very, very long time. (Maybe not in a ""reason-to-live"" kind of way, but certainly in a ""I-can't-wait-to-see-you-again, Old Friend"" kind of way.) This one meant that much to me at the time.Then I saw it.Seeing SUPERMAN-THE MOVIE reminded me of the day I was propositioned by my very first girlfriend (she'd literally become a hooker in the few years since I'd known her, and didn't even recognize me). It's amazing how many people there are out there who'd willingly sell their soul if only there were a buyer.",Superman
61,johnnyboyz,"In essence, one of the better films of its ilk that I've seen and a throughly effective romp on several fronts.",7,15 June 2013,"Here's a novelty: a big budgeted, English language superhero film which is actually pretty damn good; a film that knows how to have fun - a film that knows how to depict people and their actions, rather than just depict action and have the people sort of fill into the frame. At its core is an interesting hero; a strong villain, a good love interest and some imagery that is genuinely powerful. To an extent, it is a love story but it is its strange concoction of romance; screwball comedy and horror that makes the film so appealing. We've seen films many times before with plots at the centre of them revolving around evil people attempting to destroy the world (or at least part of it)– when we see it here, we don't mind it so much out of how well the film nails all of the other stuff. Take a scene much later on when the villain outlines his plan to our hero, a scene which is cruelly undercut with the villain's hapless sidekick attempting to muscle in by staking his own claim on things. Angry at his minion's grab for glory, he berates him, and continues his threats. Such a sequence, while featuring in a film buried deep within a canon of American cinema from an era when treating terrorism as one big joke was the norm, encapsulates perfectly the deftness of director Richard Donner's ability to hop between genres and codes and yet still maintain an eye on the prize.We begin as if the whole thing was one large soap opera set on another planet entirely, furthermore located within another solar system and playing out to an entirely different set of social dynamics. A being known as Jor-El (Brando) is busy addressing matters in relation to the punishment of three of his own species whose ideas of inter-planetary mutiny are scorned upon. Once that has been dealt with, we learn that this planet, named Krypton, is millions of years ahead of Earth in its spiritual and technological development in spite of the fact its general inflection reminds us of ancient Greece. Perhaps that is the point. Despite these advancements in years, the people thereon are unable to tell the difference between a ""routine orbital shift"" and their own planet's destruction. When the planet does destroy itself, it kills all who inhabit it but for Jor-El's son Kal-El - someone who is ejected from the planet and crash lands on that of Earth in the 1950's. He grows up to become the titular Superman under the homo-sapien guise of Clark Kent, played by Christopher Reeve.But Donner is still far from playing his hand. Before an adult Clark ends up as a newshound in the fictitious metropolis of. Metropolis, there are some amusing sequences set in an additionally fictional locale named Smallville, a small rural town set in an unspecified state, although most likely shot in New Mexico. It is during this stretch that Clark grows up with his adopted parents; shrugs off bullies; feels aggrieved that he doesn't get a girlfriend and hides his extraordinary powers made possible through Earth's gravitational sciences in comparison to his home planet's. These segments might very well have inspired a film all on their own: the ultimate concept piece of a superhero from beyond the stars stuck with an (un)enviable ability to boot a football the length of a the pitch lest he join he football team when he isn't out-running an express train lest he partake in high school track and field. Years later, in 2008, director Peter Berg produced ""Hancock"" whereby the central idea read something along the lines that a human-like creature with Superman-esque powers was stuck on planet Earth but kept falling afoul of everyone out of his mismanagement of them.It is Metropolis wherein things take shape in this young man's life, someone who infiltrates a newspaper Bureau as a typist whose off screen speed and ability to do such a thing impresses an editor. Reporter Lois Lane (Kidder) adopts the role of the love interest, somebody besotted by Superman when he saves her life but oblivious to Clark Kent's actual attraction to her. These scenes carry such weight in dynamism that it's difficult not to enjoy them, with the idea that Clark is trapped in Earthly conditions alien to him combining with the fact the film is essentially the tale of a farmhand coming-good in the big city with an unrequited love to boot. It makes for wonderful viewing and there is a real flair and energy behind these scenes that is never sugary nor overdone.Gene Hackman's villain, Lex Luthor, is one of the slimier 'event movie' villains; not someone especially brash and quite obviously insane, but someone whose introduction is both at once funny and sadistic and whose on screen presence merely carries on from there. While in no way a physical match for Superman, the fascination lies with observing a twisted, criminally opportunistic Earth brain going up against extra-terrestrial brawn. It isn't good enough to have these two people merely meet up and slug it out: it would be a no-contest. They must, therefore, speak and match one another verbally – something which requires skill in the writing and patience in the viewer. This is a really romping, cracking adventure depicting people meeting; bonding; clashing and ultimately dealing with one another, a film that allows the bad guys to occasionally win; the superhero to appear vulnerable and is assertive enough to take its time (through its runtime) in dealing with characters regardless of what its audience's attention span may be. If there were more films of this nature that were of this nature, the multiplex would be a nicer place to frequent.",Superman
62,filipemanuelneto,"A cinema relic that, despite being relevant, has aged badly, is very dated and has many script problems and excessive length.",5,31 October 2021,"This was one of the great precursors of modern superhero movies, full of effects and CGI. However, what we have here is obviously much more primitive and simpler. The film takes one of the most classic cartoon characters - Superman - and brings us a very canonical view of his origins and path, from the destruction of his home planet and arrival on Earth to his consecration as a world hero. Today, however, it is a somewhat forgotten film, that has aged badly: it continues to have admirers, to be loved by those who saw it in youth, but it has natural difficulties to conquer new audiences.The script takes the official story of the hero and seems to me quite faithful to that narrative, but it can't go any further and gives us an artificial, forced and clichéd story, in which even the villain is such a caricatured figure that we can't see him as a threat. Despite this, and its excessive length when we think about the story told, the film turns out to be a good piece of entertainment, and even those who do not like it are unanimous in giving it a place in the list of relevant films in our collective memory and in pop culture.One of the essential pieces for the success of the film is the excellent performance of Christopher Reeve, an actor who was immortalized thanks to this hero, in the several films in which he played the part. He's not a flawless actor, but I'd say a lot of the trouble comes from the material he's been receiving and the way Richard Donner conceived the film in general, trying to lighten it up, like a histrionic and very presumptuous adventure comedy. Margot Kidder also did a satisfying job. Less lucky, Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando are fortunate to have made other films that are much better, and where we can see them in all their talent: Hackman persistently overacts and Brando has almost no screen time.On a technical level, the film justifies its large budget with elaborate and very flashy visual and special effects, but which for us appear as authentic museum relics, with a strong cheesy tone, totally unbelievable. Cinematography, absolutely without any contrast, looks hazy. The settings range from the most conventional to the height of hospital futurism, so white and gleaming that they look like ultramodern clinics. The editing is relatively good, but like I said, the movie drags a lot and doesn't justify its length. The best, really, is the soundtrack, where it pontificates an extraordinary theme that was composed by the ""master"" John Williams. A Superman movie without this theme song, to me, is inconceivable.",Superman
63,leplatypus,Super  Eros (DVD),10,9 March 2007,"I first saw this original Superman as a child (maybe on a ""Betamax"" rented tape !).As the other positive movies of my childhood time (ex: ""Rocky"" (reviewed in IMDb), ""Star wars original trilogy"") & the negative ones as well (see the list in ""Society"" (reviewed in IMDb), ), ""Superman"" was an influential brick in my path to maturity and its effects are still felt long after the film ending ! First, with a good character so much bigger than life, as a kid, it was like a lighthouse in the baddest tempest and a real confidence builder.Second, as told in the (super) DVD bonuses, Superman is an American icon, and accordingly, in spite of being French, this movie offered me more appeal for America. It embodies some American values: fight for justice; social values coming from family, University; job as a interest; the nec-plus-ultra technology.Superman offers it all from ""flashy"" Krypton to ""Norman Rockwell"" Smallville to Metropolis, helped in that way, with the sublime music of John Williams & an extraordinary talented cast: Who could be a better spiritual father than the ""Godfather"", the missing Marlon Brando ? What about the down-to-earth pragmatic (and also missing) Glenn Ford, Margot Kidder (see the DVD bonuses for her other competitors), and last but not least, Christopher Reeves: Unforgettable! It is a good choice than his heir in ""Superman Returns"" (reviewed in IMDb),looks like his twin! Considering this role to his fate, I think I said my best when I watched ""Rear Window"" (reviewed in IMDb.And, now twenty years later, its values are not exhausted and this revelation explains my strange title: it comes from a crucial dialog between Brando & Reeves in the fortress of solitude that shouldn't have been cut: Jor-El explains the 2 reasons why Clark should have a secret identity: 1/ To not be on super-help duty 24 hours a day 2/ To protect the ones he cares The question of director Harold Ramis (""Why, with all the threats in the world, Superman is always depicted saving the world in Metropolis & flirting with Lois Lane ?""), that I recalled in the remake of 2006, has finally an answer: * Superman is REAL human: as everyone, his biggest achievement in life would be LOVE * So, if he has been sent to save the world (a bit religious), he is also dedicated to find his soulmate, and when he meets Lois Lane, he knows Destiny is knocking at his door. In addition, this relationship is funny, because Lois is more attracted by Superman than Clark in spite of being the same person! It's a proof of masterpiece to propose enjoyment for each age of life ! So, if the new generation has ""Superman Returns"" for reference, I wish it help them as much as mine BUT also that they will look after this 1978 version as well !!!!!!",Superman
64,digitalbeachbum,Not bad for a movie from the 70s,5,29 July 2021,"This movie is not state of art, but the script and the direction are good. There are plenty of errors, but I believe that the movie is a classic Superman.",Superman
65,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A clear precursor to the modern-day superhero film, and a classic in its own right",8,14 November 2017,"In more ways than we probably know, the 1978 film adaptation of ""Superman"" set the stage for the modern-day superhero movie, even though the comic book film boom was decades away. Nearly 40 years later now, Richard Donner's film boasts a unique combination of qualities: it has a classic if somewhat campy feel, iconic imagery and music and – compared to today – a refreshingly character-focused approach.The first 30 minutes are still among the superhero genre's best. One of John Williams' best musical themes and an innovative title sequence evoke the excitement of ""Star Wars"" (released a year earlier) and the production design of the Krypton scenes are not only unforgettable, they set the tone for ""Superman"" adaptations going forward. With Marlon Brando at the center, the film begins with an incredible amount of gravitas, a cue to audiences at the time that this was a comic book film to be taken more seriously than the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" television programs of the '50s and '60s.Then, if ""Superman"" has nothing else going for it, it has Christopher Reeve. He's not some incredible actor, but if you close your eyes and picture Superman in the flesh, you probably think of Reeve. Presence is everything in his performance, and the way he controls it, fluctuating between dweeby Clark Kent and the swoon- inducing Superman, is what earns him all his charm. It's this perfect casting of stature with Reeve that has made casting this character so difficult and prone to intense scrutiny ever since. Opposite him is Margot Kidder, fumbling her words marvelously as Superman's presence as intrepid reporter Lois Lane. She's a damsel in distress here, but a post-Women's Liberation version in a way; she's got attitude and drive, even if she spends a lot of screen time screaming for her life or gawking at Superman. The interview scene and night flight is cheesy, but name the last superhero film that devoted a sequence of that length to its love story. There aren't many. These films demand action today, not magic carpet rides. Much of that scene hinges on the flight special effects, however, so it feels a bit dated and boring, but their time together proves critical to the film's emotional payoff.Loopholes and too much required suspension of disbelief are the only major negatives of ""Superman."" Even the silliness of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor and his dim-witted cronies Otis (Ned Beatty) and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) luxuriating in Luthor's subterranean mansion has a certain delightful whimsy about it, even if it feels reminiscent of the villainous plots of a '60s cartoon. How Luthor obtains all the critical information he needs about Superman without leaving his house is disappointing to be sure, but it gets a free pass for 1978, especially because it's clear that Luthor and Co. are intended to be comic relief. Lastly, Donner truly makes ""Superman"" a cinematic experience. Although it takes trying to put yourself in the shoes of someone seeing this in 1978 to truly appreciate it, it's clear the production spared no expense to make the film feel novel. Next to ""Star Wars,"" it's likely the decade's finest visual achievement. Donner understood this and devotes extra time to the majesty and adventure of the whole experience, lingering a little longer here and there to make the movie feel larger than life. All of this is of course accentuated if not dependent upon the terrific score.As the best film adaptations of anything do, ""Superman"" gave so much back to the character and informed how it would be adapted in the future – even in the comics. The ways it innovated and set the tone for comic book movies are apparent, as are the ways it also mimicked the past. Whether it feels dated or like an absolute classic, it did set in motion so much of what came after for costumed heroes on the big screen.~Steven CThanks for reading!

For millions upon millions of fans, there simply IS no Superman, other than Christopher Reeve. He is the epitome of this modern day hero. In the shadow of the genuine tragedy which has befallen Mr. Reeve, the entire world grieved for his loss, and even today, we applaud his accomplishments. In the wake of the upcoming new remake of this movie, I am simply stunned at the news of this project. While a bit dated, this movie was not poorly done, as to deserve a remake. Move ON to Superman 5, for in the continuation of this series and ONLY in its continuation, will the majority of fans accept another actor wearing those tights!Yes, I am irate about this, and rightfully so.This movie is an icon for truth, justice and, although Superman belongs to the world, he also stands for the American way of life. What about it, exactly, needs to be retold? Why waste the time and resources remaking a lovable classic, when they should be working on a continuation of the line?This movie was the very best attempt, and the most successful, in capturing the spirit of the comic book character. And while some may not care about the comic book character, this movie is BASED on the comic book character, so to not care if it was like the original work, is like not caring that Adam Sandler is cast as the lead in ""The Godfather."" The direction was wonderful, the filmography was insightful, the dialog was campy, entertaining and witty (as it was meant to be), and the portrayals were dead on for the comic book characters. The scenery and sets were professional, innovative, and added greatly to the enjoyment of this production. The very IDEA of a remake is downright offensive and a slap in the face to the true-to-life hero who made this original. I am offended. Do they think by remaking this original, that they can start a whole new line? I say, ""H3LL NO!"" At least, they will not get a dime of MY money for a ticket purchase, DVD rental, or pay per view fee. Not one dime. While I would be all for a continuation of this series, I am steadfastly against the remaking of it. They will not remake 2, 3, or 4, either. They will pretend as though they were never made. While in the case of 4, that would be a good thing, as I like to pretend they never made that one, as well, how do you just forget about an entire run of successful, universally loved movies?

70,hellraiser7,Soaring Hero,10,27 August 2018,"Superman is one of my favorite fictional protagonists as well as favorite superheroes of all time. Other than his powers to me what really appealed to me was in his unbreakable humanity which I feel surpasses his superpowers but is also why his legend has continued to soar throughout the years.Believe it or not my first exposure to Superman really wasn't this film but it was actually the Ruby Spears cartoon from the 80's (which is an under the radar gem) which I saw when I was about 8. I really liked what I saw I never seen a superhero quite like him, except He-Man but that's a different story. That cartoon soon lead me to the live action film which at the time blew my mind, I loved that film and I love it now, it literally was believe or not again the first live action comic book film I've ever seen.Everything about this film feels big which made it all the more special, it was beloved by fans and non-fans of the comics. Even he teaser and trailer for this film are enjoyable, seeing these audiences back then must've been blown away as fans and non-fans of the comics weren't expecting it. The music is just fantastic from one of my favorite composers John Williams, that theme (along with these opening credits) one of my favorite themes of all time it just says Superman, there were some others over he years but this one is still the best in my book.This was also one of the longest comic book films for its time though now that running time is a little more common place now. It's goes at a good steady pace which works to the films benefit as it wants to give us time to know who Superman is and the world he inherits, and you have to understand also not everyone has read the Superman comics so seeing how things came to be for the character really helps in getting depth.Christopher Reeve one of my favorite actors is just fantastic as Superman/Clark Kent he is the character much as Karl Urban is Judge Dredd or Peter Weller is Robocop; you just can't see or want to see anyone else play that role. Sure, there have been many others after Christopher Reeve but he is still the best Superman in my book. I really love how he plays it as he is able to separate his actually identity to his costume; in this film Superman is his real identity and Clark Kent (at least the one from the Daily Planet) is the real costume. Chris's performance is great you really kind of buy that he's totally two different people all together, his Clark Kent persona from the planet is sort of insecure, cumbersome, nice but kind of on the uncool side. It makes sense he's put up this act because no one would suspect anyone of this persona of being a superhero, but I also feel there is some truth to this, according to psychology everyone of us when we go to work or anyplace outside we tend to put on a mask to blend in to our social structure and hide our real persona because we don't want to reveal or open up to anyone unless ready or gain a certain amount of trust. And it's great as he plays Superman, whom is heroic in every sense. He's got lots of sharp charisma, so he's got plenty of good and memorable lines. But what I love about him is just the strong humanity he welds inside. Yes, he's an alien from a different planet and he has power where he can just about do anything, but he's exercises a continuous know that he shouldn't misuse his powers that if he does there are dire consequences, as an old saying goes ""just because you can do a thing, doesn't always mean you should."" But most of all remembers how human he is, as he's lived among them most to all his life he also has the same feelings and his wants and needs. There is one quote from his that is my favorite that stuck with me ""All those things I can do, all those powers and I couldn't even save him."" I know that's pretty sad, but I felt that really summed up the core of what ever hero and superhero truly is human, that there really are limitations in heroism that we can only do the very best we can to save whoever we can. This also help in emphasizing with him, as there is truth to him how deep within us where capable of greatness or having it inside ourselves to do what is right no matter the odds but most importantly how there is a wonder person inside us.Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is solid despite the fact she a little low on my list of favorite live action Lois Lane's. Her character like the character is an aggressive go getter that has big ambitions of being a great reporter. Though that go getter attitude is also sort of her Achilles heel as she lands in a lot of really sticky situations, though you could also say it could be luck in disguise as it a way of always meeting Superman. And the chemistry between both of them is pretty good, really bought there was attraction going on.Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor whom is one of my favorite fictional antagonists, this is one of my favorite roles from the actor, like in the comic he's a villain you love to hate, despite how really bad he is you still at the same time have fun with the guy. Personally, I mainly like the latter version of Lex Luthor whom is a villain more in a grey area. This version is more the golden age version as he's just the plain evil supervillain archetype whom is comical but menacing at the same time. Lex here is a sociopath that will do anything to make his grand dark ambitions reality, human lives to him are just obstacles that need to be eliminated or necessary sacrifices, you could see he lives by the dictum, ""you want to make an omelet, you've got to crack some eggs."" But in a twisted perverse sense. He's also a egocentric, he's like a real diva that wants his name everywhere like in one scene where he is showing off his grand plan to Superman it's the same with almost every villain in a James Bond film, sort of their way of flaunting their ego toward them but at the same time their way of challenging the protagonist by presenting them with a challenge they can't possibly beat.But one thing I really like about him is how smart he is, much as Professor Morarity is in Sherlock Homes as he uses his sharp wits as his weapon against Superman. Really like the verbal interplay between both Superman and him is was sort of like a chess match, it's suspenseful because we unfortunately know Lex already has the winning move and we're hoping Superman can uncover it in time. Of course, this character just has some of the best and memorable lines like the one from the library scene and the other when he has Superman cornered ""when it came time to cash in your chips, this diseased maniac became your banker."" That quote just oozes with menace and rings true because for where there are heroes and superheroes there will always be villains and supervillains waiting.The action is pretty solid, it's not exactly wall to wall action as most of it consists mainly rescue missions and emergency work. But I personally didn't mind, it's also something I don't see much in the comics anymore which is kind of strange considering their heroes and superheroes. Personally, I find it's kind of a nice break from the constantly typical pounding the baddies which is frequent in just about every comic. But most importantly we saw Superman at work using his superpowers which are awesome the effects on them are top notch, almost as if he could exist in reality. There are a lot of crowd pleasing moments in the action from seeing him rescue Lois Lane for the first time and catch that Helicopter, I remember my mom who saw it in the theater said that the audience cheered during that scene, and it's understandable why I love moments like that in a theater those don't happen much. Or even that nuclear missile chase which I always found really cool, I remember being on the edge of my seat think, ""C'mon Superman, get there.""Well, I've said enough for anyone that is a rookie starting out this film is a good place to start with the series. Or an experienced comic book reader or movie watcher this is a vintage classic worth flying toward.This film like the man of steel himself soar high in legend and into our hearts.Rating: 4 stars",Superman
71,jadavix,Still one of the best,7,24 March 2019,"The Superman movies were favourites of my childhood, but I don't remember them as well as many others. I was never that into superheroes.Therefore I came to ""Superman"" with some reluctance, which turned out to be unnecessary. ""Superman"" still stands up as a pretty fantastic movie, and could probably still be used as a template for the modern superhero movie... not that I've really seen any of those.It's got decent characters, a decent story, and the effects are still impressive enough. What really sets it apart, though, is the actual chemistry between Reeve and Kidder, and the wit in the screenplay.",Superman
72,freemantle_uk,The first true Superhero film,7,26 August 2011,"Back in 1978 Superman became the first superhero film and made with the intent of treating it's source material seriously. It was a big special effects movie that was made at the time of the rise of blockbusters like Jaws and Star Wars and still has fans today. But does it stand the test of time.On the planet of Krypton the ruling council ignores their leading scientist Jor-El's (Marlon Brando) warnings that their planet is about to face destroy and threaten him with exile to the Phantom Zone, a fate worst then death, if he tries to leave the planet. Given no option and seeing that his planet is about to be destroyed he put his only son Kal-El in a space ship and send him to Earth with all the knowledge Krypton has. On Earth Kal-El crash lands in Smallville and is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) as their son, Clark. Years later Clark (Christopher Reeve) becomes a reporter for a major newspaper, the Daily Planet and the North Pole his he created his Fortress of Solitude where he learns about his planet and its history. He becomes Superman, having abilities no one else Earth has and soon starts a relationship with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). But villain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) plans to commit the crime of the century and willing to kill Superman to do it.Before Superman all superhero programs and film serials were either seen as children programmes, like the George Reeves Adventures of Superman or the camp Adam West Batman. Even as comics were getting darker and more serious comic books were still seen as children's entertainment. This Superman project had a lot of potential, being one of the best known superhero and it had a long production. A number of directors were attached, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. Guy Hamilton of Bond fame, director Goldfinger, was set to director but had to leave because he could not live in England for more then a month because he was tax cheat. Richard Donner stepped in, having only made The Omen and a few TV Movies. Donner's directing is mixed, he is able to come up with some grand visions for Krypton and a dark sombre tone when Jor-El sends his son off as the planet is being destroyed. The action sequences are strong and the special effects were the best available at the time, though the flying effect does look a bit ropey by modern standard. But I do like the physicality of using models and more does need to be used for modern blockbusters. There are also tender moments between Superman and Lois Lane, the flying send being the most famous and Donner did do well for the most part for having to fit in a lot of the Superman story in one film, his origins from his childhood to his early days as Superman and mixing the tone and action sequences.For me however I do not have the nostalgia for Superman that some people have, growing up with this series. They see it a proper serious superhero film, but I find there are still problems. There is a lack of a good antagonist: you can not really respect Lex Luther as the main villain of this film. He sometimes has a dark edge, killing a police officer like a Bond villain but for the most part Luthor and his henchpeople are just played for laughs taking away an threat they main hold and some of the leaps of logic is extraordinary, particularly how they figure out Superman's weakness is Kryptonite. Luthor has an extraordinarily dumb play and its only in Superman Returns when Luthor is actually a sinister and creditable villain. I think Donner was so focused on showing Superman's origins he didn't have time to develop a good villain. There are also so really cheesy and silly moments like when Lois and Clark at robbed and Clark's exaggerated geeky traits. There is also no set scene of time, with a lot of the characters looking like they were from the 50s. We can also not over look the ending, how the hell is spinning around the world and making it rotate backwards able to make time go backwards? There are a lot of problems with it and it causes a lot of plot holes, including Superman could have gotten both nukes within seconds. It is the type of ending which pretty much say the previous event didn't matter because we reset time.We know that there was a long casting process to find someone who could play Clark Kent and Superman, from James Caan, to Christopher Walken, to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Reeve was an unknown stage actor but he really was Superman, who was torn between Jol-El who was his mentor and his desire to protect Earth because of the ideals he was raised on. This Superman is a little more arrogant but that is because he is still young and starting out as a hero. But of course he is still a good man. Reeve had excellent chemistry with Kidder, both as Clark and Superman and she is strong in role as a smart journalist on the up. My view on Hackman is that his role was ruined by the comedy but at least there was so banner with Valerie Perrine. There is no denying Brando was a great Jol-El, giving his character a calm grandness and he played his role deadly seriously.Plus Superman has one of John Williams' best scores, a really powerful rousing bit music.Overall Superman is a fun film but what lets it down are some cheesy/silly moments, a bit too much comedy and a lack of a treating antagonist. It is not the classic some people think it is but it is a worthy film. A 7.5/10 would be a fair IMDb score.",Superman
73,strong-122-478885,Fighting For Truth (?) Justice (?) & The American Way (!?) Ha!,4,4 June 2014,"With this Superman picture now being close to 40 years old, I honestly did try to lean on its irksome shortcomings gently and, with that, be more tolerant about cutting it some slack.But, you know what? Far too often, this disappointing superhero movie fell way too short of my expectations. So, by rights, I think that it deserves nothing more than just a 4-star rating. And, I really believe that I'm being quite generous here by giving it this ranking.What bugged me the most about Superman (besides the badly-dated visual effects, the terribly-staged violence, and Marlon Brando's laughable white wig) was this whole hypocritically idiotic business concerning Jor-El's warning to his son, forbidding him to alter history during his stay on Earth.'Cause once Superman arrived in Metropolis, the way it looked to me was that altering history was all that he seemed to be doing, to one degree or another. And I'm not just talking about this film's final climax involving Lex Luthor, the XK-101 missiles and Lois Lane's death.I mean, even during the helicopter crisis on top of the Daily Planet Building (when Superman rescued Lois Lane) - That was altering history! 'Cause without our hero's heroic intervention, Lane would've definitely fallen to her death at this early stage in the story.And, speaking about this film's final climax - No one can ever convince me that Superman's miraculous reversal of this planet's rotation was all that was necessary to turn back time. No way, Jose.Doesn't anyone realize (with the Earth spinning at 1000+ mph) what sort of catastrophic damage would result from this reversal of rotation? And how this would affect the entire planet, including all of its inhabitants? (Even if it were for a mere 5-minute duration) And, then, on top of that - The immense jolt to this planet in order to get it back to rotating in its regular direction? And, then, expecting everything to immediately be running smoothly again, as if nothing out of the ordinary had ever happened? Nope, This utter nonsense was just too much for this viewer to accept. I couldn't let this stupidity go as if it were totally acceptable.And, besides all of that, I'd sure like to have it explained to me, in a sensible way, what the latter part of this saying means - ""His fight for truth, justice, and the American way."" Like, what the heck is ""the American way"", anyways? I sure as hell don't know.But, for some reason, Superman (a visitor from an alien world) certainly seemed to be 100% convinced of what ""the American way"" was even though it was never defined. And, he believed in this ambiguity so much that he blindly fought for it with all of his might.Anyways - I think that this film was, at best, only mediocre entertainment. I'd say that at least a good half-hour could've easily been edited from its rambling and over-indulgent story and, I'm sure, in the long run, it would've been of a great benefit to us all.",Superman
74,dee.reid,"""Super"" is a way that will never be matched",10,8 April 2005,"This is my 301st review on IMDb, so I'm going to make this short, simple, and super:""You'll believe a man can fly!"" - the tagline for ""Superman""He stood for ""truth, justice, and the American way."" Ahh, to just think that this is the movie that started it all, ladies and gentlemen. Carefully adapted from the popular DC Comics character created by Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, Richard Donner's 1978 epic has stood the test of time to become the supreme superhero film. Alongside Tim Burton (""Batman"") and Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man""), Donner earned his place in cinematic history by becoming the first director to make a perfect superhero film. Superman is the most recognizable comic book superhero in history, and when Clark Kent (the late, great Christopher Reeve) rips open his shirt to reveal that symbolic ""S"" an hour and 11 minutes into the film, you know that it's one of the greatest cinematic moments. This epic defined the superhero film, and in the 27 years since its release, every subsequent comic book superhero movie is forever indebted to ""Superman."" The plot (and what a plot) runs complete throughout its epic 154 minutes and believe me, there's not a single wasted moment in the film's entire running length. Of course, Clark Kent is sent from his dying home world of Krypton by his father Jor-El (the late Marlon Brando), grows up and works at the Daily Planet, falls in love with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and must foil the diabolical plans of Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Put simply, there will never be another movie like ""Superman,"" and who can forget those *cosmic* credits, the aforementioned ""S"" scene, the Superman and Lois date over New York City and later above the clouds, and that one, definitive climax when Superman lets out a painful cry that reveals that one glint of humanity that he's earned from his time on earth. Reeve will forever be linked to the role that really made people believe he was a super man, even when he wasn't wearing the blues, reds, and yellows, and was instead confined to the prison that's called a wheelchair. But we know that he's up there, flying high with the Almighty and proving to us all that he is who we believed he was. The recent news that Bryan Singer (""X-Men"") is directing a new Superman is not exactly getting me giddy, considering the low standards of today's film-making and the onslaught of CGI effects that dominate many Hollywood action movies these days. I love ""Superman"" and even today, I'm still touched by its magic, and deeply saddened by the real-life tragedies that have followed it.A perfect, ""super"" 10/10.",Superman
75,Coxer99,Superman,9,30 May 1999,"Lavish and elaborate production of the durable comic book hero that is great fun from start to finish.

76,drqshadow-reviews,"Predecessor to Today's Superhero Pics, it's Naive But Respectable",7,10 July 2012,"It occurred to me while watching the opening credits that, at the time this first hit theaters, Action Comics #1 was forty years old. Today, that landmark is right around the corner for this film, and that led me to wonder if it had as much to do with shaping my generation's snapshot of the Man of Steel as the original issues did my grandparents'. The world has changed in a lot of ways since the late seventies, particularly in its fashion sense - many civilians' getups are just as outlandish as Superman's - but despite his squeaky clean image and dated morals, there's still something familiar and relevant about this rendition of the big blue boy scout. He's naive to a fault, but there's no questioning his motivations and it's still refreshing to see a nice guy who doesn't finish last. Christopher Reeve is responsible for the majority of what works, and he buys into the role so completely that it's no surprise he'd be associated with the character for the rest of his life. Gene Hackman is disappointing in his first turn as Lex Luthor, but the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on and the script is impressive given its age. Although the much-maligned ending sequence is a total disaster, the rest of the story does a very good job of balancing a mature, serious tone with the lighter dalliances into fantasy that go hand-in-hand with the character.",Superman
77,alindsay-al,the first comic book film and it is good,7,15 September 2014,"This film was a big risk as it was the very first comic book film and I do believe that the film was good. This film sees the planet krypton destroyed but before scientist jor el sends his son kal el to earth to keep his race alive. Once found and raised he goes by the name Clark Kent before becoming superman and attempting to stop the evil genius lex luthor. Now Christopher Reeves was perfect for superman I thought he did a wonderful job as supes it is just a shame now we know what would happen to him and I just cherish the perfect superman that he was. The supporting cast was alright I liked Lois lane I thought she was a good foil for superman and I thought even though he was underutilized lex luthor was a good villain for the film and once again a good foil. The rest though either weren't in the film enough or they were comedy characters that didn't really work in my opinion. The story is also okay, I recently watched man of steel and there are a lot of similarities obviously with this film and i just feel like that film did it slightly better. This film just seemed to rush some certain aspects of the story and as mentioned before I don't believe they went into enough detail between the relationship of lex and superman. But this is a good origin story for superman and this story does the character justice when just dealing with him. The script is very good and the chemistry between the characters was really good making the dialogue a huge plus. Obviously this film is like 35 years old so the style while impressive for the time isn't the best but that is obviously out of the films control. Overall this is a solid film with a lot of good things about it.",Superman
78,MaxBorg89,I still believe a man can fly...,10,20 July 2006,"Superman is arguably the most famous superhero of all time, so it was only fair to ask for a decent cinematic treatment. Richard Donner's Superman, released in 1978, still stands out as one of the best superhero opuses brought to the screen: it captures the hero's essence and makes us believe in him and cheer for him throughout the whole film.After the awesome opening credits, we're shown the dying planet Krypton. In order to make sure that fascinating society won't be lost forever, renowned scientist Jor-El (Marlon Brando, who makes an impeccable use of his limited screen time) sends a small space vessel to Earth. That vessel contains his only son, Kal-El, whose amazing abilities, which derive from the sun, will hopefully contribute to making our planet a better place to live on.We're briefly shown the boy's teenage years, until his ""father"" 's death makes him realize it's time to move on. Hence his decision to move to Metropolis, where he leads a double life: officially he's Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve), a journalist working for the Daily Planet, but whenever someone's in danger, he becomes Superman, an invincible being whose mission (as he's been told by a holographic image of Jor-El) is to fight injustice and corruption. These negative aspects of human behavior are perfectly embodied by crazy millionaire Lex Luthor (a powerhouse turn from Gene Hackman), who, as he says himself, only draws pleasure from evil deeds, such as causing the death of innocent people.If this film had only been about another struggle between a hero and his nemesis, it wouldn't have been a bit as successful as it was, and still is. Instead, the director succeeds in making the audience understand that, despite his powers, Superman can be damaged through the people he loves. He's human and alien at the same time, and therein lies his charm, effortlessly brought to life by Reeve. Hackman, on the other hand, plays Luthor a little differently from what we've seen in the comics: he's a funny man, but in a twisted way. Like Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first Batman movie, you'll laugh at the power-lusting freak when he argues with his employees, only to be appalled by his nastiness once he reveals his plans.26 years on, Donner's Superman hasn't aged at all. Some people may complain about small details (Luthor's wig, the slightly unrealistic ending), but in the end, this remains the film that started the wave of good, sometimes excellent, comic-book-based flicks. Alongside its sequel, it's also the finest Superman adaptation yet (also counting the TV shows).",Superman

Full of nostalgia, charming banter between Clark & Lois as well Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman in colorful roles. It was neat to see a smattering of fun scenes with Superman using his powers as a kid and as Superman, saving people with 70's effects. However, I did not see Lex Luthor as a very dangerous foe. Additionally, Superman did seem to foolishly fall into his trap as well as not being clever enough to escape from the 'loose- fitting' Kryptonite chain Luthor draped around him.

80,smatysia,Hasn't aged all that well,6,23 July 2013,"Well, I have re-watched this film, which I saw in a theater when it came out. It hasn't aged all that well. First of all, it started the extremely unfortunate trend of making big-budget movies from comic books. Not all have been bad, but most are awful. I really used to like special effects done the hard way. One of the things you would discuss later, or try to find out was ""how did they do that?"" Now, of course, with CGI, they can do anything. But even though I liked how that used to work, it now makes the effects in this movie seem cheesy. Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman weren't bad, nor were Ned Beatty, Glenn Ford, Jackie Cooper, or Valerie Perrine. Marlon Brando sort of mailed it in. And I completely missed Larry Hagman and Susannah York. Margot Kidder was at her most gorgeous here. Some people have mentioned plot holes, but come on, it's from a comic book. If you haven't already suspended disbelief, then you are watching the wrong movie.",Superman
81,snoozejonc,It's like three movies in one,9,4 October 2020,"A baby from the planet Crypton is sent to live on Earth.This movie has several distinct stories within an overarching narrative. Each one features the title character at a different stage of his life and has its own visual style. Superman is portrayed as a Christ-like figure throughout and many scenes contain subtext on this theme.The opening sequence is as strong as any great sci-fi movie with Crypton brought memorably to life and featuring a famous cameo from the great Marlon Brando as Superman's natural father. Brando's godlike presence helps to convince you that the son he sends to Earth is going to be someone quite special.Superman has another Hollywood legend in Glen Ford as his adopted father. Ford was equally as naturalistic an actor as Brando but he brings a more human (no pun intended) and slightly lower-key presence to the second stage of Superman's life. This part of the movie contains some of the best cinematography with its rural landscapes. One image of a train running along a track above a cornfield is one of many beautiful sequences.Both parts of the movie mentioned above serve the origin purpose of the character and finish quite emotionally. After about an hour I found myself ready for a change of pace and tone, which is exactly what we get as we meet a fully grown Superman and his alter ego Clark Kent in the big city of Metropolis.What follows is almost like a different movie. It is funny, action packed and contains superb performances from Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder who have excellent chemistry. Reeve is so perfect for the roles of Superman/Clark that one of the reasons later incarnations of the character never worked for me was that he could never be replaced. He looks like the comic book drawing of the character and effortlessly switches between the two versions of the man. Kidder is not your typical leading lady with her husky, smokers voice and ultra confident personality but is the perfect foil for Reeve in Kent mode.Gene Hackman steals the show whenever he appears on screen making homicidal, megalomaniac Lex Luthor not only funny but feel like a credible antagonist to a virtually indestructible superhero. Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine provide solid support as his criminal sidekicks.All of the above performances and the casting decisions made are a massive part of what makes the film last so well and compete in today's market where superhero movies reign supreme.The special effects were epic in their day but are slightly dated now. Particularly the flying scenes and some shots where scale models can be easily spotted. However some hold up as well as any, such as the Crypton visuals and the helicopter sequence.The great John Williams wrote another fabulous score and in particular Superman's main theme is an unforgettable piece of music. My four year old daughter heard it once and was humming the tune for days.I can only imagine what a breath of fresh air Superman must have been on its release. The seventies was a renaissance decade for American cinema but a lot of it came with too much depressing realism. Superman did not showcase quite the same standard of spectacle as Star Wars, but it was far less centred around violence and with it Richard Donner kicked off the superhero genre.",Superman
82,juneebuggy,For me there will only ever be one Superman and its Christopher Reeve.,9,14 February 2020,"One of, my favourite childhood movies, I really enjoyed seeing it again so many years later, mostly it filled me with a feeling of nostalgia but its still a great movie and stands up well today.One of the original superhero origin movies following Kal-El just before the destruction of the planet Krypton, as his father (Marlon Brando) sends him on a spaceship for earth. Clark Kent is raised by a nice farmer family, gets Glenn Ford as an adoptive dad and then movies to New York where he faces down Gene Hackman as Lex Luther and continually rescues Louis Lane.Exciting action sequences, the special effects are good ... its 1978, Christopher Reeve is so good looking, of course seeing him makes me sad now. Margot Kidder as Lois lane is also great, that scene/date where he first takes her flying is fantastic, accompanied by the music of John Williams which is still stuck in my head.Of course parts of it are cheezy now too, the opening credits swooshing by, the young girl getting slapped by her mother after Superman rescues her cat and her Mum tells her to stop lying, wow that wouldn't happen now.Just a classic though, and for me there will only ever be one Superman and its Christopher Reeve.",Superman
83,gcd70,The Original Superhero,8,1 March 2010,"The original superhero came to the screen for the first time some twenty years ago. I saw it back as a wide-eyed eight year old, and it really dazzled me. Two decades have since gone by, and I still love it.It must be said that ""Superman"" was probably the first of what have since been many action heroes that have come to the movies. Richard Donner's film is the original though, and the best. Donner directs the film (from stellar scripters Mario Puzo, Robert Benton, Leslie and David Newman) with the fixation and fascination of a child, always intent on having fun. If you're a big kid at heart, his infectious approach will rub off on you for sure.The special effects crews had some real fun, and they received a special Academy Award for their efforts. Art Director John Barry and cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth also have a ball, though editor Stuart Baird could be accused of allowing ""Superman"" to over-run at 143 minutes (especially for the young-uns). John Williams' inspiring, instantly recognisable score is still his best ever! This is open to debate if you prefer another of his compositions.Finally, the cast seem to enjoy themselves just as much as the audience will (isn't that always the way in a Richard Donner film). Christopher Reeve is Superman. An ideal choice for the role, he is probably even more synonymous with the part than George Reeves ever was. Margot Kidder has made Lois Lane all her own as well, giving the single reporter a really punchy style. At his very best is Gene Hackman as the diseased maniac Lex Luthor. In one of his most enjoyable roles, he plays at scene chewing like it was a game, gobbling one after another. Tops in support are Ned Beatty as the bumbling Otis, Valerie Perrine as the lovely Miss Testmacher, Jackie Cooper as tough Daily Planet editor Mr. White, Marlon Brando as Superman's real father Jor-el, Glenn Ford as his adoptive earthly father, and Marc McClure as fresh photographer Jimmy Olsen. Also stars Terence Stamp.I only wish I could see this film at the cinema again. If nothing else, it contains the single most uplifting, hero-cheering, jump onto your feet and scream 'hurrah' scenes ever filmed.Sunday, August 30, 1998 - T.V.This is adventure done as it should be. All credit to the imagination and vision of writer Mario Puzo, screenwriters David and Leslie Newman, Puzo and Robert Benton, and big director Richard Donner. Even with the long filmography Richard Donner now has behind him, I still feel this is one of his best.Technical team have put on a fine show, and of course this is easily John Williams finest score. His main theme is the stuff of legendary heroes.Then there's the cast. Say ""Superman"", and most baby-boomers recall images of George Reeves in all his black and white splendour. Their children, however, instantly think of the now tragically paralyzed Christopher Reeve; being part of that generation, there was no other man of steel for me! Margot Kidder, Ned Beatty, the marvellous, villainous Gene Hackman and all of the support cast do great.In short, the kids will love it, and so will you.Sunday, November 28, 1999 - Video",Superman

In the city of Metropolis, he uncovers a deadly plot by arch-villain Lex Luthor to destroy California with a nuclear missile. Can he save the day ?I reckon this adaptation of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic DC Comics adventure serial is probably the best comic-book movie ever made. More than any other I think it embraces and captures the spirit of adventure, fantasy, romance and heroic nobility that made the comics of the thirties and forties so imaginative and enjoyable. This is partly because it's a first-rate yarn (by Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather), but mostly because it's exceptionally well-made and beautifully acted by a rich and varied ensemble cast. In particular, it's the quality of the performances that make it ring true, and whilst the plot may be fantastic, the relationships are grounded in truth and poignantly played. Reeve is simply perfect in his greatest role - he has the physique to play Superman but also the chemistry to portray Clark as a completely separate character, and he explores his darker side (grief, impotence, uncertainty) without ever detracting from his altruistic heroism. The sequence where Kidder interviews him in her penthouse apartment and then they glide above Metropolis is a sublime mixture of a frisson-filled adult courtship and a child's fantasy of flight. Contrasting with this is Hackman's fabulously hilarious turn as the incomparably egomaniacal Luthor, ably supported by the wonderful Perrine as the gorgeously pulchritudinous Miss Teschmacher and Beatty as the lovably oafish Otis. This trio of comedy villains are simply irresistible - my favourite moment is when Perrine complains to Lex that her mother lives in the town one of the stolen missiles is headed towards, and he simply glances at his watch and shakes his head. Equally memorable are East (who is dubbed by Reeve), Ford and Thaxter in the Smallville sequences (""Son, you are here for a reason.""), and Brando is iconic as Superman's father, Jor-El, although his performance has always been overshadowed by his four-million-dollar fee (a record at the time) for what is essentially a short supporting role. The film also has a fantastic operatic score by John Williams, with an irresistible pounding heroic theme, terrific special effects which accommodate an amazingly imaginative story (in one scene Superman flies under the Earth's crust, and in another he flies so fast around the planet he spins its orbit into reverse), great editing and an undiluted sense of the epic, in everything from the opening credits spinning through space, to the amazing ice-bound Fortress Of Solitude, to Luthor's secret lair under the Metropolis subway system, to an amazing earthquake sequence that will probably never be bettered. All of this is captured in unforgettable images by director of photography Geoffrey Unsworth (who died not long after production and to whom the film is dedicated). His camera-work here is the piece-de-resistance of a remarkable career and the sweep of the imagery is breathtaking - the crane shot in the cornfields over Clark and Ma Kent is I think one of the most beautiful and emotive shots ever done, and the entire film is dripping in the very best visual storytelling. Donner coordinates all these wonderful elements into a magnificent adventure movie, full of warmth, humour, imagination and excitement. Shot at Pinewood, with location photography in Alberta, New Mexico, Grand Central Station and the Hoover Dam. It's hard to watch Superman without contrasting Reeve as the invincible Man of Steel with the tragic accident which left him paraplegic and led to his premature death, and to feel the ironic injustice of fate. But what he and others created with this film is one of cinema's greatest gifts, a heroic icon to be treasured, loved and aspired to, and to enjoy whenever we wish. He lives on through his creation. An astounding film. 8/10",Superman
85,rbverhoef,Entertaining nonsense,8,21 March 2003,"This is a very entertaining film. You will know how it is going to end but that doesn't matter. The thing with this kind of superhero movies is just to present the action sequences as spectacular as possible and in Superman they succeed. Of course everything is a little dated, but the visuals are still pretty good.If you don't mind some silly things (such as you can expect in this kind of movies) and like a nice superhero story, very funny characters, a lovely love interest, a great hero, a greater father of the hero and an even greater villain of the hero 'Superman' will definitely be something for you.",Superman
86,valleyjohn,The most iconic Superhero film ever made ?,9,14 May 2021,"What can you say about Superman that hasn't already been said before . Arguably the most iconic Superhero movie ever made ( not necessary the best ) and the best choice of leading actor in any such film of its kind .This was one of the first films I ever saw on VHS ( I don't remember seeing it in the theatre ) . I was about twelve at the time and as soon as I heard that iconic music from John Williams , I was hooked .Having watched it again as a 52 year old i realise it's not the greatest film . It has its faults ( no pun intended) and it does look dated but it still gives me that buzz.Christopher Reeve was absolutely perfect for the role and I believe there never has or never will be anyone better for the job . Christopher Reeve IS Superman.It's such a terrible shame what happened to him .What I didn't realise first time round was that Superman is just an appetiser for what is the main course and that's Superman 2 .This is just an introduction.The first people we see are General Zod , Ursa and Non and only for a few seconds . They are the baddies in the next film .We get hints of a romance between Superman and Lois and Lex Luther is just getting started .I still find it amazing that they paid Marlon Brando four million Dollars for his twelve minutes of screen time and he's not exactly putting everything into his performance either , and his lack of effort was obvious to see in many of his later films .I've given this 4.5 stars . If it wasn't for the John Williams Score it might just a 3.5 or a 4 but it holds a place in my heart , despite it's problems , so it deserves that mark .",Superman

And was adopted after crashing to earth literally, by a childless couple named the Kents. Who he took his adopted name from.As he struggles as a teenager and adult. Acting like a meek guy but really not who he really is.

Clark must unveil himself as the one true hero, aka Superman to save earth and all of humanity.Really a great way to start off Superman.

89,triple8,best superhero movie ever made.,10,24 April 2004,"How does one tire of superman? Saw it when I was a child and it may have been the first movie I ever truly loved. Superman, to me as a child was IT. This beautiful movie struck me so hard I watched it over and over again.....I surely hope they don't remake this, WHO is superman if not Christopher Reeve? This may sound nuts to some, but I think this should be in the IMDb top 250. There isn't one boring moment in this movie and the older one grows the more timeless this movie stays. Everything was done so well, I couldn't get it out of my head as a child. Superman and it's incredibly beautiful haunting music may have made me a movie lover.I have yet to see a major motion picture ""superhero"" movie that comes close to this. The sequel wasn't BAD though honestly not touching the first one but anything after that-STAY AWAY! Superman three was a nightmare pure and simple, they should have left it as 1 and 2.If it WERE remade today I can't think of anyone who could fill Reeve's shoes.

90,Spleen,"Promises the world, delivers a little",7,24 August 1999,"All epics cover a lot of ground, but this is ridiculous.  It's more like an epic in reverse.  We begin with the longest opening title sequence I have ever seen, with a magical overture by John Williams promising us the greatest show on Earth; the actual story begins with matters of cosmic importance on the planet Krypton; we end up with an all-in-a-day's-work act of superhero derring-do on Earth.  We pass over other terrain on the way, such as the coming-of-age-in-the-middle-of-nowhere bit.  It's all very well: but we should have encountered it on the way up, so to speak; not on the way down.Part of the problem is that Superman isn't epic material.  He's a nice fellow, the epitome of superhero innocence and all that, but he's not someone about whom one can successfully tell the Story of His Life.  And there are some grave things wrong with this particular story.  One of them is Lois Lane, played as an unattractive, whiny neurotic by Margot Kidder. It's completely mystifying what Superman sees in her.  The obvious explanation is that she's the first woman he's laid eyes on, but that can't be right: we know he meets other women in the coming-of-age bit; and moreover he later gets the chance to change his mind and plump for Valerie Perrine instead.  I know which way I'd go on that one.The villains have the usual clunky lines to deliver.  (""Why is the number 27 something of that kind] so significant for both of us?  It's my shoe size, and your IQ.""  Honestly - it's as if he's quoting from the Puffin Book of Put-Downs.)  Their plot is just another villainous plot and the pretence that it has something to do with Superman's search for his identity is a vain one.  Also, at the end ...OK, I won't give it away, even though it's not a secret particularly worth keeping.  Let's just say that the movie cheats.  With one bound, Superman is free.  He's already in danger of becoming a deus ex machina, with all his powers; but to give him ANOTHER power at the very end, a power which would allow him to extricate himself without cost from ANY difficulty ... surely they could have done better than this.The story never quite comes to life; nor does it quite focus itself. These are serious problems, and I don't wish to understate them.  On the other hand, it's fun the first time round, it has a great score (which is often VERY important in fantasy), and it's always been my contention that sincerity makes up for a good deal.  Not really a good film, but worth watching all the same.",Superman
91,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The original best,10,4 April 2014,"Before 1978, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman had been put on the screen in the past. With multiple actors donning the suit of ""truth, justice and the American way"", it was hard for fans to really pick their favorite actor who portrayed the Kryptonian. But when this movie came out, there was no decision that had to be made. Richard Donner's Superman (1978) is THE superman. Viewers who are closed-minded and don't like watching older films must try to make an attempt to see this. It does not have the crisp well-blended look like most of our films today but for what it had, it was astounding. It's not just the look either; everything else included as well.The story follows the original that we all know and love. With Krypton on the rise of destruction, Jor-El sends his baby son Kal-El to Earth where he can start a new, and be the hope and inspiration for all humans. Upon arriving to Earth, Kal is adopted by farmers Pa & Ma Kent and renamed him Clark Kent. As he grew up, Clark journeys to discover his heritage and answers to his questions. He then moves to Metropolis where he secretly puts on his suit and cape whenever help is needed. But it's not at this point where things become amazing; everything described that leads up to this point is just as great.The writers behind the screenplay took extreme care with the how the viewer sees the growing process of Clark. Seeing Clark and his world change along with his loving stepparents are by far the strongest of character development scenes in the film. There are moments of pain and frustration and there are also moments of joy and power. The emotions are equally balanced throughout the film. With that, the positive tone of the film feels bright and optimistic. This mixes well with our main protagonist because Superman (Christopher Reeve) is an optimistic person. He is a symbol of hope.The other characters in the film are just as likable. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane portrays her role accurately with a mind only a reporter could truly understand. Although his scenes are limited, Glenn Ford as Pa Kent provides significant depth to Clark Kent and his morals. Even as a villain, Gene Hackman as the notorious Lex Luthor provides a comical performance that viewers should enjoy. Speaking of which, comedy is another aspect this movie got right. The comedic elements do not push for camp. The funny moments feel natural as if anyone would react in the same manner. Nor does any of the funny scenes involve dark humor, the jokes are more innocent than they are intentional.The other things that'll stand out are the effects, which co-exist with the action, music and cinematography. For 1978, the mix of green screen and practical effects look great. This helps make the action scenes look very professional (including props to editor Stuart Baird). One thing that stands out about the action is that it relies more on the brain, of how to take care of certain situations instead of having an all out brawl or frequent explosions. In fact, there's really only one true explosion in this film and that's all it needed. With the action comes one of John Williams' best known scores. It is by far still, the best of all Superman scores. The main theme is there, along with a love theme that may create goosebumps for some. Lastly, the most visually beautiful aspect of the film is the cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth. He captured so many shots that'll take viewers' breaths away. See it for everything.Christopher Reeve is the original Superman. There is no argument. The music, action and characters would be nothing without the pristine writing and optimistic tone.",Superman
92,pc95,Original Blockbuster Superhero Movie Alive in Grand Fashion,7,21 March 2009,"Superman, made in 1978, really defined the big budget Superhero movie. With distinctive characters, great set pieces, expansive scope, and one of the finest scores/music in cinema history, it can rightfully claim itself as originating or at least redefining the genre. At over 140 min the movie isn't perfect and a little bloated in places, but nonetheless it's middle 3rd easily makes up for any short-comings. In particular the Helicopter rescue scene still is as captivating as it is entertaining to watch today. Made 30 years earlier, without digital computers, Superman even now is a pleasure and spectacle to watch and listen to. Both Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeves are impeccably cast - particularly Reeves who is equally bumbling as Kent as he is majestic as Superman. Supporting cast members including Hackman, Brando, and Glenn Ford significantly add to the depth and likability of the film. Main weakness in the movie is it's last quarter and somewhat anti-climactic ending, but despite this, Superman stands tall lead by some of the finest music/score ever written by John Williams.",Superman

But more about them in Superman II.Christopher Reeve turned in a note perfect performance here, helping bring Superman to life, and also created one of the most iconic hero characters ever in film, despite the fact he doesn't even appear on-screen until nearly an hour into the film.Gene Hackman is a good zany villain, but he just doesn't seem particularly intimidating.

The only other weak point is the dated flying effects, although the remainder of the special effects and model work still hold up well.",Superman
94,philip_vanderveken,I'm glad that I finally saw it with my own eyes,6,15 July 2005,"""Superman"" is one of those movies that is called a classic by many, but that isn't loved by everybody. I guess it is most of the time the American audience who will enjoy this movie. They grew up with comic book super heroes, while we Europeans don't have such a tradition. We are used to an entirely different kind of comic books, with a completely different style of drawing and story. Most of them aren't even intended for adults, but for children. Still, a super hero like Superman is known all over the world and that's why movies based on the Superman comics, may draw a larger crowd.When the scientist Jor-El isn't able to convince the ruling council of Krypton that their world will soon be destroyed, and when he is even considered as a traitor, he decides to take some drastic measures to preserve the Kryptonian race. He will send his infant son Kal-El to Earth, where he will have to grow up as a normal child, but with super powers which he has to hide from the ordinary mortals around him. Once he is fully grown up, he starts his 'normal' working career as a newspaper reporter, but also starts saving the world from all evil and brings people safety, truth and justice where-ever he is needed. But then he meets an opponent who is a lot tougher than all those other human bad guys. The evil Lex Luthor plans to take over the world and Superman is the only one who can stop him...Normally, I'm not into Sci-Fi and movies based on comic books, but because this movie got four stars out of five (a rating that you'll almost never see) from a reporter that normally doesn't like this kind of movies, I decided that for once it was time to set aside my bad feelings. And that wasn't exactly a good idea. Hoping for an excellent movie, I was quite disappointed by the naivety of the story and the many clichés. Of course I knew that Superman would save the world from destruction, but that Lex Luthor had to be such a typical, almost James Bond-like bad guy, really didn't do this movie any good in my opinion.Still, not everything about this movie was bad. If you consider the year in which this movie was made, than the special effects are absolutely stunning. By today's standards they wouldn't stand the first screen tests, but we should never forget that this is a movie from 1978, a year in which computers still were a rare item, let alone that they knew how to make excellent graphics with them. What I also liked, was the first part of the movie. Krypton still looked futuristic enough to keep me watching with wide opened eyes and that's not obvious for a movie of this age. The acting in this movie is also OK, Christopher Reeve will always be the one and only Superman and Margot Kidder was a nice Lois Lane. And even though I didn't like Gene Hackman's character, I must say that he probably did the best that could be done with his role as Lex Luthor.In the end this is a movie that belongs in the same category as Star Wars and James Bond. There are many people who like those classic movies, but I'm not one of them. I prefer other, more believable and down-to-earth characters and stories. That's also the reason why I give this movie a 6/10. It has some good things to offer, but it just isn't to my taste. On the other hand I must also say that I'm glad that I finally saw it with my own eyes.",Superman
95,brando647,A Superhero Legend Brought to Life,8,4 February 2013,"Somehow I've gotten almost 30 years without having ever seen one of the original Superman movies. I'd seen bits and pieces of the first movie back when I was a kid/teenager but I was bored with the little bit I'd watched. I remember coming in at some point during the Smallville portion of the film, getting bored, and wandering off to find something more engaging. Due to my one and only poor encounter with the movie, it wouldn't be until many years later when my film tastes have changed and I had a new appreciation for decent movies and I'd realize, whoops, I've never seen SUPERMAN. So I've remedied that and my initial impression hadn't changed much at first, but I gave it another shot and I found that my appreciation for it grew a little more with subsequent viewings. I see now why the original SUPERMAN is a classic and there is a lot to love despite its many flaws. SUPERMAN is an origin tale, introducing the Man of Steel, the Last Son of Krypton to movie-going audiences. We see Jor-El's futile efforts to save their planet and his final effort to save his son, sending him off into space to live a new life on the planet Earth. The child is discovered by the Kents, who adopt the child as their own and raise him in the town of Smallville, USA. As he approaches adulthood, his human father dies and young Clark Kent realizes that the time has come to move on. He travels north to the Arctic, learns of his origins, and then moves to Metropolis where he makes a life as a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet and eventually embraces his new role as Superman. You know, the usual Superman stuff.I've seen both major versions of the movie, both the theatrical and Richard Donner director's cut, and I prefer the Donner cut that was released in 2001. SUPERMAN is a long movie, and the director's cut is even longer but I think the additional material adds a nice extra bit to the movie. Despite its intimidating running time, the movie never really feels overdone. It's slow to get moving, no doubt about that. The Krypton sequences drag a bit, and the Smallville portion is deliberately paced but it all works. SUPERMAN is an original story that's done incredibly well. It takes its time but the result is a movie where you're incredibly comfortable with the characters by the time the action kicks into gear and it's a little easier to suspend your disbelief for some of the more ""out there"" elements that come with a story about an alien being who acts as humanity's savior in a pair of tights. I was surprised at how well the special effects in the movie worked, as someone viewing them with a contemporary mindset. Some of the flying effects are a little weak and I almost laughed at the scene with young Clark outrunning a train. It wouldn't have been so hokey if you could tell he was suspended from wireshis feet were nowhere near the ground. Still, the rest of the effects are surprisingly good for late '70s.My only issues were the story issues and the fact that Superman seems to have any power that's convenient to the plot. Aside from the drama that arises from a last minute escape, why would Jor-El wait until the literal last minute to launch his son to Earth? And, for a massively advanced civilization, how could the people of Krypton not accept that their planet was about to explode? You'd think they see that coming, with or without Jor-El (a much respected member of their government) pushing them to action. How does Lex Luthor know that kryptonite is lethal to Superman? I am willing to accept that he might have deduced that that kryptonite fragments were on Earth and where they might be, but how could he magically know what effect they'd have on Superman? How exactly does Superman magically transform into his costume? I was under the impression that he wore it under his clothes but SUPERMAN shows him dissolving mid-flight out of his Clark Kent persona. And what government would run a test launch with not just one but two nuclear warheads? Whatever, whatever. This isn't the movie to nitpick the little details. It's a fantasy and it embraces it, regardless of whether some of the elements make sense or not.The cast is every bit as great as I've heard. Christopher Reeve really is a perfect fit for the dual role of Clark Kent/Superman. He goes from a klutzy lovable loser to iconic hero effortlessly, and Margot Kidder is a great fit as his love interest Lois Lane. She's got an unconventional beauty to her and a feisty personality. And there's Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Hackman is so awesome as Luthor, I was more interested in anything he was doing in the movie than the hero. I wasn't keen on his stooges, Otis and Ms. Teschmacher, at first because I thought the comedy brought the movie down but I got used to them and now I love their chemistry with Luthor's egotism. I did think Marlon Brando was a little awkward as Jor- El. He infuses each line with his presence and weight but it doesn't sound all that natural coming from him.Minor complaints aside, SUPERMAN was a better film than I'd given it credit for in the past. Reeve embodies one of the most legendary superheroes in an epic fantasy movie that brought an icon to life.",Superman

100,sme_no_densetsu,Among the best superhero films though the effects show their age,7,7 September 2008,"Richard Donner's 1978 interpretation of ""Superman"" is lauded as one of the finest films based upon a comic book superhero. Christopher Reeve stars as the 'Man of Steel' who, as an infant, is sent to earth by his father in order to escape the imminent peril of his homeworld. From his adoptive home Superman eventually grows into his destiny as a champion of justice and must match wits with self-proclaimed criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).One of the reasons why this film is better than the usual superhero fare is the acting. Brando may have been in it solely for the money but he didn't just phone in his performance by any means. Gene Hackman, the other major star at the time, gives a fine performance that hits the perfect tone for the character; equal parts vanity, insanity & camp, without overdoing either. Christopher Reeve is excellent in the challenging dual role of Clark Kent/Superman. As Kent you believe him as a meek, awkward reporter and as Superman you (as the tagline says) 'believe a man can fly'. The other performances are solid as well, particularly Margot Kidder's charming turn as Superman's love interest Lois Lane.The script is good but every once in a while it descends into cornball territory. For the most part, though, the story has a successful balance of seriousness and lightheartedness. Also, it should be obvious that the more fantastic elements of the story will require considerable suspension of disbelief.Donner's direction is well done and treats the story and characters with a dignity that elevates them above the level of camp. The film's special effects were ambitious but today look unconvincing in a number of scenes. For me, this is the main detraction from the film since the believability of the visual effects is central to the story. On the other hand, one of the major benefits to the film is the score by John Williams, which is among his most memorable in a career that has spawned several immortal movie themes.All in all, this film is worth watching for fans of a wide variety of genres; science fiction, fantasy, adventure, action, etc... This is one of those films that literally has something for everyone. However, you're going to have to accept the fact that the Academy Award-winning special effects of thirty years ago can't hold a candle to today's best efforts.",Superman
101,dunmore_ego,"One Part Steel, Two Parts Cheese.",7,11 July 2006,"This movie did for Superman what *King of Kings* did for Jesus - burned an iconic image of a fictional god into the world consciousness.And the Word was made Flesh. And the Flesh was Christopher Reeve. So unknown at the time of his casting that he might as well have been from Krypton, Reeve became the Face of Superman for the fortuitous fact that *Superman* was arguably the world's first ""serious"" superhero movie.Read ""serious"" as ""money,"" with a cast that corroborates this: Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Glenn Ford, Jackie Cooper, Ned Beatty, Susannah York; with a script initially penned by Mario Puzo, and Omen-hot director, Richard Donner, this movie began a trend which continues to this day  A-Listers unashamedly appearing in what would have been beneath the likes of the Gregory Pecks or the John Waynes in their heyday. And through its success, *Superman* was single-handedly responsible for turning superhero movies into the economic cog they are today.Leaving no stone of the mythos unturned, the movie follows Superman from his origins on his home world of Krypton (sent to Earth by father Jor-El before the planet exploded), to his teenage years in Smallville, to his first days in Metropolis and his flirtations with reporter, Lois Lane.Look up ""trailer trash"" in the dictionary, there's a picture of Margot Kidder. Bringing a much-needed harlotry to what had become a prissy figure, throaty Kidder does Lois Lane like two beers and cab fare will make her anyone's for the night. Superman didn't have to fly her around Metropolis to cultivate her pink panties; he had her at ""Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel."" When it's good, *Superman* is super. When it's bad, it is cheesier than a German cheese festival.The Daily Planet scenes ""pop"" with snappy dialog and cheeky nods to the legend; whilst Brando waxes solemn as a heart attack, Hackman waxes about as solemn as Groucho Marx; somehow melding his *Superman Theme* with every motif that had come before, John Williams forges a soundtrack of steel that will survive through generations; and without the bad boy of CGI, Donner and his visual effects mavens make us believe a man can fly On the other hand, there's Lois Lane's mile-high poetry-slamming; Superman's boy scout dialog; Brando fancily pronouncing ""Krypton"" like it would kill him to make an ""o"" sound; and those anachronistic tights and cape  with external underpants - which we still take seriously enough for this movie to gross 300 million dollars.Chris Reeve was no Olivier, but The Man of Wood epithets aimed at him were not entirely fair, as audiences mistook the simplistic character he plays with his acting ability. As with any protagonist so pure, Superman became the least interesting persona on screen. It was enough that Reeve, at 6'4"" with baby-blues and pecs like banquet trays, embody the physical icon; no one cared for developing Kal-El's notions of ""truth"" and ""justice"" beyond the boy-adventure tousles Superman involved himself in.In the movies at least, Superman never tackles corruption higher than street level. Yet when his adopted father (Glenn Ford) tells him that he is ""here for a reason  and it's not to score touchdowns,"" we've got to assume that with such unfathomable powers, that reason should be more compelling than just hindering the lowest rung of the crime ladder, whose crimes are merely manifestations of an infinitely larger social disorder.Saving lives is another conundrum that Superman tackles unthinkingly: rescuing Lois from falling to her death is commendable, but while he rescues Fluffy the cat, one thousand kids drop dead in Africa for want of a river being diverted to feed their crops.When Siegel and Shuster unleashed their tale of a being sent to Earth from the heavens who takes the sins of the world on his shoulders, it is doubtful they intentionally forged so many parallels between Superman and Christ. But over the decades, as Superman's chest got bigger and his panties got smaller, innumerable writers, editors, cartoonists and film-makers added elements from humanity's vast pool of mythology, with *Superman* finally sealing the similarities between the Son of Krypton and the Son of God.Clark Kent is raised by a single, surrogate mother; his father is spiritual (Jor-El, who omnisciently speaks from beyond the grave through Kryptonian crystals); the three stages of Superman's life mirror Christ's  birth, teen angst, and thirty-something; Superman's full-fledged, formidable powers suffice for the miracles of Jesus, and like Jesus, Superman brings a message of peace - which may seem ironic coming from someone omnipotent who can kill you quicker than thought. (Even if Jesus cannot kill you personally, rest assured, one of his obsessive followers will.) That is the great paradox of ""respect""  we are more apt to take advice on pacifism from someone who has the power to kill us if we don't.Like Jesus, Superman is far advanced in knowledge and power; like Jesus, he won't shut up about his home in the sky; and like Jesus, his girlfriend is a whore.""Now wouldn't that beat all get-out?""(Read this unabridged review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Superman.html)",Superman
102,KUAlum26,Maybe you won't believe man can FLY from this but...,8,23 May 2006,"...this is still one exhilarating ride. From the opening credit sequence to the blistering ending,this big screen adaptation of the classic comic book and t.v. series is quite a rush,particularly to fans of the MAn of Steel.Just like the up-coming Superman Returns,the Producers--a father/son duo named Salkyn--and director Richard Donner chose a virtual unknown,handsome twenty-something actor Christopher Reve,whose previous credits were mostly stage related,to inhabit the cape and tights. His ability to alternate between nice-but-bumbling cub reporter,fresh from Kansas Clark Kent and the hero from Krypton is JUST good enough to work through the film. The acting power in this films(as is much often the case in ""Hero"" movies)is from the rest of the cast: well-received,girl-next-door actress MArgot Kidder is slotted in as a sometimes abrasive and pushy,but still very vulnerable Lois Lane,one time child actor turned veteran character player Jackie Cooper is editor Perry White,Marlon Brando is a well-compensated Jar-El and Academy award winning everyman actor Gene HAckman(in probably the best performance of the film MHO)is supervillan Lex Luthor. Throw in reliable supporting actor Ned Beatty as the dim assistant Otis and sexy vixen Valerie Perrine as Lex's apparent paramour,mix in plenty of bright colors and nifty(for 1978)special effects and graphics,and you have a film that is generally pleasing if perhaps over-the-top and even a bit cloying at times. 1981's Superman II would probably be a better expansion on this story,but this film is still a very strong and lasting image of comic book film-making.",Superman
103,Maciste_Brother,Episodic script and bad ending almost ruin SUPERMAN (spoilers),6,3 March 2004,"I won't go over the merits of the music, acting, special effects, etc, of SUPERMAN. They're generally good for a special effects film made in 1978 (even if it feels dated today). The feel of the movie is epic and majestic, thanks mainly to the cinematography and the rousing score by John Williams. What's really poor in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE is the episodic script. 3/4s into the film, and we're still being introduced to new characters and situations, with no story in sight. Puzo (and other writers) should have written a better, tighter script with a focus on a main story. In SUPERMAN, the film goes like this: we see Krypton. Then Krypton explodes. We're then introduced to the Kents. Then dad dies. Young Clark goes to the north pole and becomes superman. We're then introduced to the Daily Planet, and Lois Lane, Perry White, Jimmy Olsen. Then that's it for the newspaper world. We're introduced to Superman as someone who captures crooks, saves airplanes and helicopters and a cat from a tree. The super-heroic stuff is quickly left aside because we're heading into romantic comedy, with Lois interviewing Superman. She even sings about him in her head (?!?!) as they fly together in the sky. Then the romance bit takes a back seat to yet another element, as we are introduced to Lex and company. Then we're introduced to the scene of Larry Hagman and the missiles, etc. The film goes on and on like this. It's very episodic. It's tries to cover a lot in so little time that we never get a whole aspect about anything. Just snippets of Clark as a young man. Clark as a goofy newspaper reporter. Superman catching villains, etc.When the movie finally focuses on a story, it's lame: Lex Luthor wants to sink California. In SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, Lex's character is reduced to that of a demented real estate agent with two really goofy sidekicks. And when the earthquake hits California, which results in the death of Lois Lane, Superman turns back time by flying super fast around the earth. Okay. Sure.I know that the whole ""spinning the earth"" bit is mainly an extent of the fantasy aspect of Superman's world taking hold of the story but the ending just doesn't work. Not just because of the ""spinning the earth"" idea but because the producers had to kill off an important character in the first film. Why did Donner, Puzo and company have to kill Lois Lane for Superman to prove his love for her? It's a really lame conclusion. The focus of the story should have been more about Superman, and Supes leaving his mark as a champion of justice by overcoming a super villain than anything else, certainly in a first movie. The ending in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE would have been good in a second or third movie but her death was just too much for us to absorb in the first one.",Superman

105,TheUnknown837-1,"Even though ""Superman"" is loaded with special effects, it is the cast who emerges triumphant!",7,23 September 2012,"On the surface, Richard Donner's ""Superman"" would seem to have two ambitions: one, finally bring the long-cherished comic book character to life upon the silver screen and secondly, accomplish little more than being a technically lofty, tongue-in-cheek blend between spectacle and comedy. And while it does accomplish both of these goals quite well, at heart, the movie is more of a screwball love triangle. In the center, there's Lois Lane: the feisty, go-getter reporter who spells 'rapist' with two Ps. On opposite sides of her are the titular character—a flying hero from the long-deceased planet Krypton—and her skittish coworker Clark Kent. The only catch is that the latter is merely the alter-ego of the former, who deftly plays both parts back-to-back around her, and the criminals of Metropolis.This love story is certainly the most interesting element in ""Superman."" So interesting that I wish the lengthy climax of the picture—which involves nuclear weapons, an earthquake, a dam collapsing, and the most bizarre form of time travel that I've seen—had been trimmed to allow a little more room for it. As either Superman or Clark Kent, the late Christopher Reeve is immediately affable: handsome, well-fit, and full of uncanny energy. He's oddly enough most impressive as Clark Kent. The reason, I think, is that many actors can play a tough-as-nails deadpan hero personae. Yes, Mr. Reeve plays its well here, but it's not exactly a new role. As Clark Kent, he hits every nail on the head, coming across as likably pathetic and clumsy without succumbing into pretentious play-acting. Margot Kidder—sexy and seldom with a changing expression—is right for the role of Lois Lane. Whenever these two are on screen, the picture comes alive, and the screenplay gives them just the right banter to develop and interesting chemistry. So it's no surprise that the best part of the picture is when the two characters take an evening flight over the clouds.As for the rest of the movie, it's delightfully entertaining. The screenplay has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that only occasionally overplays its hand: Superman has a few too many comments as he saves somebody. Such as: when he saves a reporter from a collapsing dam, he mutters some snappy comment that not only seems pointless but is hardly audible over the roars of the newly born waterfalls. Where the humor comes into great play—and what I really enjoyed next to the love story—were the villains. There are three of them. The leader is Lex Luthor, brilliantly acted by Gene Hackman. There's also Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty as his somewhat clumsy subordinates. And although these three conjure up a plan that threatens half of California, they are essentially just a bunch of numbskulls who can hardly get through a scene without Mr. Hackman deriding one of them. Mr. Beatty in particular. A scene where they discuss their plans to get Superman out of the picture based on what they read in the newspaper is a real gem!As a technical achievement, ""Superman"" runs hot and cold. When it's in outer space (showing us another planet, exploding stars, and waves of dust reminiscent of the Star Gate sequence from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") it's brilliant. Even though the opening titles, with each credit being born out of zapping bolts of blue light, run for a long time, it's hardly a bother since graphically they're so dazzling. When it's on earth, however, there are some weaknesses. The methods by which Christopher Reeve simulates flying (many of which are done without processed shots) are stunning: smooth, graceful, and seamless. However, the processed shots are not as impressive, as the backgrounds become noticeably darker and grainier. There are also a couple of sped-up shots, most of them when Superman changes disguises, that have an unfinished feeling to them.John Williams' music is, as we would expect, ear-warming and memorable. The other person I do want to give special mention to is Richard Donner, the director, for treating this material with a certain style—like an epic. Most superhero pictures are shot like a comic strip, which each shot in close-up and bounding between characters. Here, Mr. Donner gives every scene a complimentary extreme wide-angle, showing us sweeping landscapes, wide angles of cities, and Lex Luthor's luxurious underground chamber. Even dramatic scenes are shot from a distance: a bold move at any point in cinema history. Sometimes he does lose his head, using a few too many dissolves between shots when they are not necessary, but for the most part, his approach is appreciatively adventurous.At two and a half hours, ""Superman"" maintains a gleeful pleasantness. It is never boring, except in its needlessly expanded version, which adds too much padding and wears out even some of the original cut's good stuff. But it really is a testament to how important actors and actresses can be to a film. After all, even though ""Superman"" is loaded with special effects—some of which, again, are dazzling—it's the cast who triumphs. Mr. Reeve, Miss Kidder, Mr. Hackman, Mr. Beatty, Miss Perrine, Jackie Cooper, Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford (what an inspired choice putting this underrated actor known for more plausible tales in a superhero movie!) and the others are so insistently good that they make ""Superman"" the innocent, easygoing 151 minutes that it is.",Superman
106,brchthethird,"A landmark moment for comic book movies -- thrilling, but dated in some respects",7,26 May 2015,"I'll be perfectly honest here: Superman isn't one of my favorite superheroes. I wouldn't even put him in my top five (maybe even top ten). For one, I didn't really grow up with him. I'm also more drawn to damaged characters, and Superman's ""boy scout"" nature just doesn't connect with me in the same way as someone like, say, Batman. The first Superman movie I saw was SUPERMAN RETURNS, way back in 2007, and it was decent enough. I was also able to see MAN OF STEEL in theaters, and while that one hewed closer to the tone I like in a comic book movie, the non-stop barrage of action in the final act was almost too much. Now that I've seen the film that started it all, I can see why people might prefer this incarnation over what's come since. He's an uncomplicated hero in a world filled with moral complexity. I liked SUPERMAN for what it was and what it meant for all that was to follow, but I still feel like some elements date it considerably.Since the film has been out for almost 40 years, a plot synopsis is probably unnecessary, but I'll do one anyway. It starts on Krypton when Kal-El's parents (Marlon Brando as Jor-El) send him to Earth in order to survive Krypton's impending destruction. When he lands, Jonathan (Glenn Ford) and Martha Kent find him and raise him as their own. He eventually finds out who he is and where he came from and then it moves to the present day where he lives as ""mild-mannered reporter"" Clark Kent and works at Metropolis' big newspaper, The Daily Planet. Being that it is a comic book movie, it has a big bad villain who, in this case, is Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) and Superman (Christopher Reeve) has to foil his nefarious plan.I'll start with what I liked. All the performances were really good, even though the way some of the characters were written didn't quite sit right with me. Christopher Reeve, even though he doesn't show up until almost an hour in, perfectly embodies both halves of Clark Kent/Superman's identity and he had this boyish charm that I'm sure women strongly responded to when they first saw the film. Marlon Brando, even in his limited screen time, did a good job. Gene Hackman did a fine job as Lex Luthor, although at times he came off as a stereotypical mad villain with harebrained schemes. There were, however, a few moments where he came off as very intimidating and evil, but not in a cartoonish way. I also thought Margot Kidder did good work as Lois Lane, although I still don't get how she can't tell that Clark Kent and Superman are the same person. In general, her character was well-written, although maybe not as a strong a female character as modern audiences are used to. Beyond the performances, I thought the special effects were done, if a little dated. The flying sequences are probably some of the weaker ones, but there were some amazing sets and practical effects especially in the opening sequence on Krypton. However, far and away my favorite aspect of the whole film was John Williams' score. Say what you will about the cheesy writing and hackneyed attempts at comedy, but I got chills every time I heard the main theme. I also really liked the love theme ""Can You Read My Mind."" John Williams is a master composer, and this is for sure one of his best scores (although I did hear a bit of Star Wars in there).As far as what I thought didn't work, the overall tone of the film was a little bit too ""comic book-y"" at times. In particular, Lex Luthor and his two dimwitted associates came off as overly silly. Luthor himself was broadly written as an obviously evil villain who often refers to himself in such terms, and it made me laugh but not in a good way. In general, the comedic tone wasn't something I particularly cared for anyway. At times I wondered if I was watching a screwball comedy with pratfalls and bad puns. There were also a significant portion of the special effects, particularly composite shots of flying which pale in comparison to what can be accomplished nowadays. Endearing maybe, but not very believable. The sequence where Superman takes Lois flying is a perfect example of this. At one point all she's holding onto is his hand, and it was fairly clear that both of them were held up on harnesses, which took me out of the experience a bit. There's also the issue of the climactic earthquake where Superman dives into the Earth to fix the San Andreas fault line which looked pretty cheesy and fake. Finally, and this is a pretty big spoiler, the part where he flies around the Earth in order to reverse time and bring Lois Lane back to life was just bad. Silliest and stupidest part of the whole movie.Overall, though, I do respect the film for what it accomplished at the time, and opening the door for future comic book adaptations to get big-budget treatments. As far as I'm aware, this is one of the most faithful representations of a comic book character to date. It succeeds on the level of blockbuster filmmaking, as well as being a suitably entertaining film otherwise. Richard Donner would of course go on to better things (in my opinion), but he showed a lot of talent here. I would also be remiss by forgetting to mention the amazing cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth. There was some legitimately amazing camera-work and beautiful visuals. Those things combined with the good performances and enthralling score by John Williams are what make this such a watchable film. There are a number of things which I don't think hold up, but every comic book fan worth his salt should see this if they haven't already.",Superman
107,emasterslake,Pretty good to watch even if you're not a Superman fan.,7,22 June 2006,"I didn't see this movie before because I wasn't a huge SuperMan fan. But a teacher told me that this was a must see movie.I just knew it it was big when it came out in 1978 and Christopher Reeve being disabled.So it took me awhile to see it because A. I didn't want to buy it B. They didn't have it in stock at the local rental store. & C. I had to download it legally and then deleted when I was done.And it was pretty good. I already knew the story about Superman from seeing other versions of Superman. A survivor of the planet Kreptun which blew up. He was sent to earth to live among the human beings. He's kinda like the Moses/Hercules of Sci-Fi. Was found and lived with his foster parents as ""Clark Kent"". Wasn't aware of his destiny till he was a teen and had a vision of his father telling him that he has extraordinary powers greater than any being on earth.So he went as his identity and alias name ""Clark Kent"" the ""Daily Planet"" writer while his other alias is Superman the man of tomorrow. The man of tomorrow, man of steel, a hero everyone can rely on. Things were great as Superman.Till one day a villain named Lex Luthor is plotting to reprogram nuke missiles and used them to make the ""San Andraus Fault"" destroy the state of California.And only SuperMan can stop Luthor from achieving his goal.This movie isn't too bad.

108,mentalcritic,Underrated,10,21 September 2005,"I grew up in the era of the Commodore 64, so it should not surprise too many people that the 1978 adaptation of Superman was among the first films I ever saw. To put it honestly, I never cared much for Superman for the most part. The reasons why were elegantly summarised by Jerry Seinfeld in one routine. You see, Batman was basically just a millionaire who developed a bit of a fixation on the lack of justice in his world, and turned his resources to do something about it. Heroes like the X-Men were just regular people with a difference from others that they neither asked for or express a lot of fondness of. Superman, by comparison, seemed arrogant and riddled with Deus Ex Machina. So why is it that I am here to tell you how underrated the 1978 film adaptation of the comic book is? Put simply, Richard Donner's film and the Warner Brothers comic book are two very different things. While the changes from page to film are very subtle compared to the recent X-Men adaptations, both share the common virtue that one need never have read one of the comics for it to work.At least three different cuts of Superman exist. I know I have seen the 1980 video cut and the 2000 director's cut. The director's cut gives us the best version of the story. As I understand it, previous cuts ended simply with Superman raising Lois Lane's car out of the ditch and saving her. Not so in the director's cut. The director's cut has Lois dying and Superman, in a fit of anger, breaking his father's commandment by using his extraordinary power to turn back time. This, combined with the touching scene in which Superman's adoptive father dies after sharing one final bit of wisdom, gives us a great character arc that makes Superman seem so incredibly human in spite of his almost ridiculous godlike status. Other scenes with Marlon Brando in which his character, Jor-El, explains to Kal-El, as our hero is actually named, that he is here because the native peoples are capable of so much and lack only the light to show them the way, are pure gold.The audio commentary on the DVD release shows other reasons why Superman circa 1978 will always stand head and shoulders above any subsequent adaptation. Many of the special effects techniques used to pull off the illusions we see in the film had never been used before. Many times, Richard Donner makes reference to the fact that nobody knew how to make the shots appear as his instructions specified, and the whole production was literally flying by the seat of its pants. That it works as much as it does entitles it to the same description as Spielberg used for Lawrence Of Arabia - it is literally a miracle of a film. Even more miraculous is how the special effects complement the actors rather than overwhelm them. Everything in the film was done practically, so the actors knew exactly what they were meant to be reacting to. This is not to say that CGI is without its virtues, but the difference it makes when an actor responds to a man flying a certain way because they really are seeing an approximation of a man flying is obvious. Sure, the looks on their faces might actually be saying ""I will be surprised if this works"", but that is preferable to ""What the hell am I looking at?"".Which brings me to the casting. Gene Hackman was born to play Lex Luthor. As subtle at times as he is overstated at others, Hackman proves that a tale of a superhero is only as good as the antagonists. Hackman's role calls for him to make his case through statements and gestures rather than eye-popping effects, and his mastery as an actor is proved by the results. However, if you cast the wrong people in the role of the main hero, the result can be just as devastating to the overall picture. A major talent search at the time yielded an unknown named Christopher Reeve, who prepared for the part by training with David Prowse. While Reeve's talent as an actor may be questionable, there is no denying the fact that he was born to play Superman. Every quip is delivered without missing a beat, and every chance to show Superman's rare vulnerabilities is exploited to the fullest. It was not until Anna Paquin in X-Men that I found a more satisfying portrayal of a superhero (this should not be confused with ""more satisfying superhero film""). John Williams, of course, is on hand to be the fourth member of the cast, delivering a score worthy of The Empire Strikes Back at times.It is for these reasons that I gave Superman, circa 1978, a ten out of ten. It makes me all the more certain that Superman Returns, circa 2006, will be a failure. Comparisons with the 1978 version are of course inevitable, and Richard Donner has set the bar so very, very high.",Superman
109,classicalsteve,America's Mythology Still Soars and Doesn't Seem Dated: May Be the Best Superhero Movie Ever Made,10,25 April 2009,"According to the filmmakers, there was a reluctance on the part of Hollywood to make a movie about the most famous of all American superheros. They feared that it would either be too campy, too sentimental or audiences would be disappointed when it was not the Superman they imagined. And actually, these kinds of problems have plagued many of the superhero movies that have been made in the wake of Superman's unparalleled and unsurpassed success. Somewhere, somehow, the filmmakers found that blurry area where the fantasy of the comic book and the realism of film could meet and produce the story of Superman on the large screen. I think the main reason the film works as well as it does is because of the fine acting and remarkable script which takes themselves seriously enough that the audience runs with it and yet maintains its fantastical and mythological flair. The entire idea behind Superman is pure American mythological fantasy on the grandest scale, and the filmmakers understood how to capture this idea tremendously well on film.Of all the elements that made it work, the script is on the forefront. Many subsequent attempts at screen writing a superhero from the pages of a comic book to the luster of the screen have had mixed results, and some of them had been in dire need of rewrites, such as the original Michael Keaton ""Batman"" and the Ben Affleck ""Daredevil"" (which desperately needed Frank Miller), both suffering a script in which the writers didn't seem like they quite grasped the material. Luckily, Superman's script was honed before it was shown. Every line reinforces the premise, the feel and the rhetoric behind the story. This is fantasy but it also has to be believable. Superman's initial encounter with Lois Lane, his response to her inquiring his identity as simply ""A friend,"" sets up Superman's character that permeates the entire film. He is not doing what he does to feed his own ego and/or gain publicity. He is helping for help's sake, and that is the very essence of Superman. If he had flexed his muscles and said ""I am Superman,"" the entire experience would have lapsed into farce of the Adam West Batman variety. Superman's combination of heroism and humility is coupled with a slightly different take on Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. Unlike the campy 1950's series in which the difference between Kent and Superman was like trying to distinguish Dracula and Bella Logosi, Reeve offers a Clark Kent that is a fish out of water. Kent is a stumbling and bumbling Midwesterner out of rural Nebraska who knows about as much about urban living as your average hay stack, which becomes a refreshing contrast between his two identities.Simultaneously, the evil but wickedly witty Lex Luther is probably the most memorable figure outside of Superman's inner circle. The devilish genius is enacting the crime of the century where potentially millions may die, and he does it with a smirk on his face and a knowing grin. Sort of a cross between Albert Einstein and Joseph Stalin. When asked by Superman if he gets his kicks by ""planning the death of innocent people,"" his response is ""No, by causing the death of innocent people."" There are a few in-jokes for those who know the Superman story, for example when, in the first Superman sequence, Clark Kent passes by an open phone booth, looks at it, and then finds an alternative place for the ""transformation"". And of course, Jimmy Olsen's habit of calling Perry White ""chief"" gets a little play at the beginning.But the script alone can't bring a movie success. You need actors who know how to deliver the lines in just the right timing and tone to convey the essence of the story and the realism of the characters. The major leads, particularly Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, and even Jackie Cooper brought a naturalism to the script that makes the fantasy seem real. Among the supporting cast, the standout performances have to be Hackman and Cooper. Hackman brings a haughty but underplayed sensibility that makes Luther an intriguing villain. He cuts down his lackeys with the kind of dry wit you might expect of Bing Crosby in the 1940's or even Cary Grant in his later films. And Jackie Cooper, who had been in the acting business for nearly a half-century, seemed born to play Perry White, the hot-headed but passionate editor of the Daily Planet. Cooper as White gives his reporters the assignment of interviewing Superman, which will be, in his opinion, ""the single most important interview since... God talked to Moses!""Many cultures have their mythologies, and it seemed that America needed its own. And it's called Superman, who is probably as recognizable to the typical American as George Washington. The filmmakers of Superman understood that mythology and constructed a movie that allowed the myth to play out on the large screen. If you look at ancient mythologies, Superman is similar to Hercules and King Arthur. He's basically a demigod enacting heroic deeds. Both can suffer and be destroyed under the right circumstances. Superman is the stuff that dreams are made of...",Superman
110,morrisonhimself,Terrible movie that insults Superman fans,2,19 March 2006,"Terrible script; worse directing.Making hokey the Superman story is an unforgivable sin. Dick Donner, in an interview, accepted the blame -- although I think he was trying to claim credit -- for camping up the script, which was already bad enough (by the execrable Mario Puzo).This movie was in many ways a typical Hollywood attempt at destroying any concept of decency, at making fun of morality or heroism. It was really disgraceful in many ways.Kirk Alyn and George Reeves were both better actors than Christopher Reeve and certainly were better as Superman. (Alyn had a silly bit part as the young Lois Lane's father in a scene on a train. The scene was cut and Alyn got no credit. TV Lois Lane Noel Neill was also in the scene. Both should be grateful the scene was originally cut, although in some versions it has been restored.)Phyllis Coates was the best Lois Lane ever, and far surpassed Margot Kidder in the role.Marc McClure's Jimmy Olsen was pleasantly reminiscent of the TV character as played by the multi-talented Jack Larson.

Jor-El, a member of the high counsel there, along with his wife, decide to send their son, Kal-El, to planet Earth so he may live. Once there Kal-El (Clark Kent) gets adopted by nice elderly folks who look after him. It's clear from day one that this is no ordinary boy for he's got superhuman strength. When his father dies Kent heads north and discovers his legacy in an ice palace built by a glacier in his possession.Fast forward a few years, Clark is working for the Daily Planet in Metropolis, falls head over heels in love with gutsy fellow reporter Lois Lane and in between assumes the role of Superman whenever he is needed. But keeping his alter ego as Clark Kent firmly intact.Director Richard Donner makes a truly spectacular film here. The story, written by Mario Puzo who also wrote The Godfather, takes it's sweet time to really get going, allowing the audience to fully get to know the background of Superman. It's a gutsy move really, modern audiences seem to find the film terribly slow moving, but I think this is what makes it all the better. In many ways, the hour plus before Superman even graces the screen is perhaps even better than what follows.Still, when our hero does finally show the film is non stop action and adventure. In it's digitally restored DVD edition, the film looks truly spectacular, amazing special effects considering the time of it's release and an overall joyful adventure in Saturday matinée fashion that's missing from today's Superhero movies.The script is very good and performances are terrific. Christopher Reeve quite simply IS Superman, this role made him and no one can do this role better than he did. Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, Superman's nasty villain. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty are very amusing as Luthor's helpers. Margot Kidder is very likable as Lois Lane, Superman's love interest, but somehow I can't help thinking that a better actress could have been found.Superman is my personal favorite in the Superhero movies department, Batman and Spider-Man are simply inferior.",Superman
112,Beta_Gallinger,"A long comic book adaptation with its notable shortcomings, but still very appealing",8,18 December 2010,"Adapted from the ""Superman"" comic book series, this 1978 blockbuster was the first of four films starring the late Christopher Reeve as the world-famous DC Comics character. This first installment in the franchise came out years before I was born, but I never saw it or even heard of it in my childhood. For at least the past few years, I've known about Reeve and his renowned portrayal of Superman, and the actor's sad fate which followed, but still didn't watch any of these films for some reason, even though I've seen many comic book movies in recent years. However, now that I've seen this first one, I can say that I am overall impressed, even if I don't rate it as highly as many others do.On the planet Krypton, Jor-El is a scientist who believes that the planet will explode in thirty days or less, but he cannot convince the ruling council of this. He decides to save his infant son, Kal-El, by sending him to Earth, where he will have superpowers due to his dense molecular structure. The scientist manages send his son away just as Krypton begins to destruct! In his small spacecraft, Kal-El lands in a rural American area, where he is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent. He becomes Clark Kent, and is raised by Jonathan and Martha on their farm in Smallville. Eighteen years later, Jonathan dies, and Kal-El/Clark hears a call and finds the green crystal which was sent from Krypton to Earth with him. After this, he decides it is time for him to leave, so he goes to the Arctic, where the crystal creates a Fortress of Solitude for him. He sees a vision of his father, who educates him for the next twelve years. Kal-El then goes to the city of Metropolis, where he lives with two different identities. He is Clark Kent, a reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper, but is also Superman, a ""caped wonder"" who uses his superhuman abilities to fight crime and stop disasters! However, it will be harder for him to try and defeat a certain criminal named Lex Luthor! At the beginning, we hear a kid reading a comic book, and this part seemed a little awkward to me. This is followed by the opening credits sequence, with very impressive effects making it look like the credits are shooting through space, though this does get tiring. Next, we are shown the planet Krypton shortly before its destruction, and this part is made memorable by such aspects as the visuals and Marlon Brando's portrayal of Jor-El. Listening to three criminals screaming as they float away is a little irritating, but fortunately, we don't have to hear them for long. After Clark Kent grows up on Earth, the story becomes very effective as we see him face the death of his adoptive father, and then discover the crystal and leave for the Arctic. The Arctic scenes are very pleasing to the eye, and the formation of the Fortress of Solitude is an example of the film's great special effects. The entertainment continues as we are shown Clark Kent/Superman's life in Metropolis. Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the protagonist isn't amazing, but he does have his charm and comical effect. The part where we hear Lois Lane's thoughts as she flies with Superman is a cheesy moment, but this is just one weak part, in amongst so many strong ones! There's lots of action and suspense to carry this comic book adaptation, and the movie can certainly be a visual treat, with its special effects and beautiful shots of the filming locations.Over thirty years have passed since this live action film version of ""Superman"" was introduced, starting a franchise featuring several more installments. It seems many who have seen this first installment in the franchise in the time since its release think of it as a masterpiece, and I can't say I'm one of them, but I still think this is one of the entertaining comic book movies I've seen over the years. It's a high-budget production with a great selection of filming locations, a mostly well written story and screenplay, very impressive direction by Richard Donner and cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, mostly decent cast performances, etc. It may not be quite the same as what we see in more recent comic book movies, but it was an absolute success when it was released in 1978 and has stood the test of time, as those who are into action/fantasy blockbusters today could easily find themselves liking it.",Superman
113,vip_ebriega,Looks like a swell time to fly...,8,14 February 2007,"My Take: Somewhat dated, but nonetheless an enjoyable comic-book adventure. Since much viewers have been exposed to Bryan Singer's admittedly terrific ""Superman Returns"", they seem to forget the real classical masterpiece that is this version. It features everything that must be seen in a real superhero movie. Great (if sometimes silly) plot, terrific performances and memorable bits. Many might not consider it as the best reincarnation of their childhood hero, but still, a die-hard superhero fan cannot live without watching the original. Christopher Reeve is perfect for the role of the Man of Steel. Never again can you find a Superman like him, hilarious and serious, all in one package. Richard Donner's suitable direction is flawless and John Williams' memorable score is great. For a swell time of flying, this SUPERMAN is still a soaring good time. And in case you're wondering, yes is still holds up pretty well! If you're looking at it as simply an innocent fun time at the movies. Rating: **** out of 5.",Superman
114,fmarkland32,It's Superman!,10,29 June 2006,"Christopher Reeve became the definite Superman in this classic adaption of the classic comic book, the movie details the story and exploits of the Superman orgin, with good performances from Marlon Brando,Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman (Although playing Hackman as a bumbling idiot is a flaw, minor as it is.) Superman is of course one of the best comic book to film adaptations. The super hero genre is a risky business because it falls in three camps. 1)The guilty pleasures which include The Punisher(Both 1989 and 2004), Superman III and Batman Forever. 2)Godawful adaptations which include Captain America, Batman and Robin, Elektra,Daredevil and Superman IV, and many more. 3)The great adaptations: Such as this, Superman II, X-men 1 and 2 and the Spiderman movies. What makes Superman better than say a guilty pleasure adaption is that it stays true to the comic as well as provides enough substance for those who don't like comic books. There is a real sense of wonder about this film, where you can believe that such a place exists. Compared to say, Superman III which relies more on goofiness and action (Infact all the guilty pleasure adaptations are this way.) Superman truly works as great entertainment and features a quirky and well written script. Once again though, Reeve is the definitive Superman.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)",Superman
115,vitaleralphlouis,Big Budget + Bad Acting = Foolish Waste of Time,1,3 September 2005,"Paying fat old MARLON BRANDO millions of dollars for his virtual walk-on role and miscasting Christopher Reeves were only the opening mistakes in this dreadful mess of a movie. The scenes where Superman begins on his native planet and the destruction of the planet ought to have been great, but they were not. My trouble is that I can still remember the far superior Superman --- not the Bang! Crash! Bing! mess from TV, which incidentally was better --- but the low budget Superman serial made by Columbia Pictures circa 1950. Back then they used home made and cheap special effects for the destruction of Krypton, but... BUT they were convincing on screen, as was the actor playing Superman and the girl playing Lois Lane. Big dollars and no talent do not formulate into good movie-making.",Superman
116,KnightsofNi11,A campy classic,7,1 July 2012,"Back in the 60's and early 70's superhero movies were kind of a running joke. There was no such thing as a blockbuster film spawned from a comic book. All superhero movies were hilariously cheesy B-movies with no name actors and whose budgets I spend in one month on gas. But then in 1978 Warner Brothers Studios released Superman. It marked the new beginning of the superhero franchise. It was a film that boasted a high profile director, big name cast members like Gene Hackman and none other than Marlon Brando, and lavish special effects that would truly bring the comic book world of Superman that had been so revered for forty years to life. The end result was a loud, flashy, and grand film that, by todays standards, would be considered very campy, but at the time it was the film that would forever change the face of superhero films.Superman is obviously the origin story of how the Man of Steel came to be, as well as his first battle against the nefarious Lex Luthor. The film takes the liberty of assuming that it's audience has an already decent understanding of the Superman mythology, and doesn't hinder us with verbose introductions. It does a good job at telling the story of Superman with all the details in place, but it doesn't spend much time in examining our main characters. For instance, when we meet Lex Luthor for the first time he's already an evil genius and he becomes Superman's arch nemesis as soon as he learns of his existence.Granted, this is how comic book lore works for the most part because that is the age old relationship between superhero and supervillain. Why does Lex Luthor hate Superman? Because he is Lex Luthor and Superman is Superman. However, given the already campy nature of the film these hurried characters, along with the rushed plot line, make the film feel shallow. Yet, in a way it is shallow and it knows it. It's only aim is to shower the audience with incredible special effects and grandiose sets that never cease to amaze, especially to an audience watching in 1978. And really, these are the things that just make Superman a fun film.At the end of the day we have to remember that Superman is just a superhero film. It's not an in depth character study and it's not a social drama commenting on why people like Lex Luthor do what they do. It's a fun, action packed, purposefully cheesy superhero film that definitely succeeds in what it is doing. It's a film of high quality with excellent production value. It is a lot of fun and shouldn't be missed by any fan of superheroes.",Superman
117,DarthBill,"The Man of Steel - impervious to plot holes, age, and tongue-in-cheek humor!",8,22 June 2003,"The first fifty minutes of this film are dead serious, as we go from Krypton's destruction to Kal-El/Clark Kent growing up in Smallville to his discovering/creating the Fortress of Solitude. After that we are subjected to some bad tongue-in-cheek humor as we meet a slightly illiterate Lois Lane, a bumbling adult Clark Kent, and a Lex Luthor who can only be defined as a ham. Then we see Superman go into action and the rest is history.Though some of the tongue-in-cheek humor is over done and plot holes like exactly what Superman does when he reverses Earth's history are a bit annoying, this movie still entertains, perhaps because it's not as depressing as a Batman film nor as whiny and self-righteous as an X-Men film. It's an easy going and yet exciting tale of heroics set against 1978 film making.Gene Hackman, a great actor, gives probably the worst performance of his career as Lex Luthor, but this isn't all his fault since this was back before Luthor really had a job description (Luthor being an evil businessman didn't come up in comics until the mid-1980s). Christopher Reeve overplays Clark Kent as a bumbling nerd, but this is forgiven in light of his likeable portrayal of Superman. For what it's worth, they were all no doubt looking for a way to distinguish the Clark Kent persona from the Superman persona. I never really liked Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, though. I wished they had picked Anne Archer instead.Some of the scenes deleted from the original release should have been kept. Most notably the few minutes where the Elders threaten to banish Jor-El (Marlon Brando in a respectable if brief role) to the Phantom Zone if he tries to leave Krypton or start up a riot (which is what they did to those 3 villains for their crimes) because that shows why Jor-El didn't make more of an effort to leave himself and the scene in the Fortress of Solitude where Jor-El's ghost instructs Superman that he must keep his secret identity as Clark Kent because he can't serve humanity 24-7 (""You're help would be called for endlessly, even for those tasks that human beings could solve themselves, as is their habit to abuse their resources in such a way."") and his enemies would go after his friends and loved ones (and to avoid punishing himself for his ""feelings of vanity."") Oh and another scene would have to be all the death-traps Luthor tries to spring on Superman when he's traveling through the underground lair (machine guns, fire, and ice, all done without aid of computers, mind you).But really, no matter what version you watch, this is a great film.",Superman
118,stamper,"Not perfectly made and dated at times, but nonetheless entertaining",7,21 September 2003,"In the wake of all the new superhero films being released and due to the fact that I did some delving into the 70's archive of film-making as well, I decided to see the original' Superman film with Christopher Reeve, before seeing any remake' due to be released some time soon no doubt. The names attached to this project were quite good, as far as reputation went (even back in 1978), including Gene Hackman (Academy Award 1972), Marlon Brando (Academy Awards 1955 and 1973), John Williams (Academy Awards 1972 and 1976) and Mario Puzo (Academy Awards 1973 and 1975). Still I had doubts about this film. First of all, because I never was a fan of Superman and second of all, because I didn't know much about the character's history. All that was about to change though, as I settled in front of my TV set to watch 127 minutes of superhero history.
As the film began I immediately recognized the style of music. This had to be John Williams and I must say that I liked the score, despite it resembled his work on Star Wars (released one year earlier) a bit. The music made the intro credits quite nice and I felt that I was off to a good start, a start whose quality was somewhat diminished by the part that followed. Now the acting in this part, by Marlon Brando in particular was pretty good, but the whole setting of the film, seemed to be something out of a Star Trek movie. Not that I mind such a thing in general, but I felt that there could have been a bit more explanation of for instance the sentencing of the culprits. There were other things there that could have been explained, but I'll get to that later. I found the music during Superman's travels to be quite annoying as well, but the film picked up after he had landed on earth. I was relieved and soon I began to lose my fear that this would be a standard sci-fi flick from the 70's. That fear though, would reoccur soon though, as Clark Kent left his elderly home and left for the world. Now this part, again, I didn't like too much, because it was not explained in great detail and because it could have been made better, just as the beginning of the film on Krypton. Luckily the film picked up in quality fast, as Kent became a grown man and Christopher Reeve took over the part of Clark Kent from Jeff East. From that point on the film became funny, thrilling and solid. The chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) was amazing, as was Christopher Reeves ability to play the geeky Clark Kent and hero Superman (together with different tones of voice). The only thing that spoiled their on screen chemistry was actually the mind-reading part somewhere in the middle of the film. This was completely pointless and ruined a scene which could have been good if that part would have been left out or if it would have been handled otherwise (it should have been shorter in any case). Gene Hackman made another good performance as bad guy Lex Luthor. Now I admit that not all of his lines were funny, as I've read in other reviews, but at least they did not feel awkward as to the extent where you ask yourself What was the point of that?'. All in all the cast (I also enjoyed Ned Beatty's performance) was picked with great care and professionalism (although they were not always used properly) and I feel that if there would be an Oscar nod for best casting, this film should have gotten it.
Now there are downsides to this film as well. I personally felt, that there was not enough explanation given to the audience at times. Of course we all understand how came to use that particular sign on his cape and we were told why he would have superpowers on earth etc., but there are still things that could have gotten a lot more explanation. How the heck, for instance, did Lex Luthor find out that Kryptonite would be harmful to Superman? Why is that so? How come Superman's father didn't warn him of that? I mean, he knew all about Superman's invincibility on earth due to different atmosphere! If he was so clever why didn't he mention that? I, as a person who has not much knowledge of the story surrounding Superman neither know the answers and the film nor can I derive them from the contents of the film as they were given me and personally I think that it is a big flaw of this film. The other flaws this film has, have to do more or less with the time in which the film was made. The rather bad effects and the overlong action scenes (as in the beginning with Krypton) are typical of most films made in the 70's. Now, the fact that the effects seem a bit outdated in this time and age doesn't bother me that much, but some of the action scenes in this film could really have been a bit shorter (as the Krypton scene in the beginning). Nonetheless this film had a number of well shot and timed action scenes as well and looking back at the film I cannot say that these minor flaws due to the decade in which was made undermined the overall entertaining and exiting nature of this film one bit. If some things would have been approached differently and there would have been more elaboration and explanation on some issues, this could have been a masterpiece. But even with those flaws it is one of the better films of it's decade and definitely worth a look if you are into superheroes, as it is in no way worse than this years Hulk.

119,ivo-cobra8,A Classic best origin story of a superhero of all time!,10,24 October 2015,"Superman: The Movie (1978) is the Original film and the only that is the best origin story of a Superman who changes himself into an ultimate superhero. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, the film is still instantiate classic till it's day.If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve, he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent, Kal-El last son of Krypton, and Superman, Earths savior from the forces of evil. It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies.Superman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though, the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! This is the best superhero of the 70's before Marvel and DC start making superhero movies. The origin story of a man who can fly, is terrific, believable and awesome. Marlon Brando's role was one of his best, the most films that become memorable for me are The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979) and this film Superman, he completed 1.year earlier this film, before he started filming Apocalypse Now (1979). What else can I say, that was already told? I love this film! I grew up with this film, this is the real original film which has a heart! Man of Steel (2013) reboot to Superman (1978) does not have a heart! This is the real film! The special effects are great, the CGI are barely in it, they aren't. The plot and the story are terrific. The cast is wonderful and acts believable. Superman and Christopher Reeve are the most beloved iconic heroes till it's day. For me Superman will always be Christopher Reeve no one else! I love Smallville (TV Series 2001-2011) and Tom Welling was playing young Clark Kent. Tom Welling will be Clark Kent for me, but Christopher Reeve will be Superman. Reeve also appeared in Season 2 and 3 as special guest in Smallvile which I love that so much. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10, 2004. John Williams theme score is the best score done for the character. I hear it and it makes me feel so uplifted and I feel like I can do anything. Great cast, beautiful score, and an Epic feeling that is lacking from movies in today's age. It is my favorite superhero film. Superman and his portrayal by Christopher Reeve is a masterpiece and is timeless . Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. This is a classic of the comic book hero genre, and in most respects the one that really set the standard for all comic book hero films that follow it. The special effects, sets, haircuts and wardrobe may all look dated, but Superman: The Movie remains among the most beloved films of the 1970s. Director Richard Donner brings the comic book hero to life in Christopher Reeve, who admirably adapts from the bumbling Clark Kent to the ultimate caped crusader. The entire cast is brilliant in its supporting roles. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the unapologetically wicked Lex Luthor. And Margot Kidder delivers a portrait of a strong, ambitious Lois Lane at a time when women were starting to break the glass ceiling. But it is Donner's dedication to the spirit and style of the original Superman's comic book roots, as well as to inject a heavy dose of humor, that make Superman: The Movie a classic. In some ways, it has still not been surpassed, even by the CGI effects and faster-paced action of today's superhero movies.The special effects and CGI look great and they don't suck. This film has a heart and it does not suck and is not bad. Marlon Brando was wonderful a touching movement performance as Jor-El, Clark's father. Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. A box-office smash, an Academy Award winner* and a fan favorite since it first flew into theaters in December 1978, Superman: The Movie assembles a cast and creative contingent as only a big movie can. At its heart (just as in three sequels) is Christopher Reeve's intelligent, affectionate portrayal of a most human Man of Steel. Watching Superman again isn't just like being a kid again. It's better. The movie's legacy soared even higher when director Richard Donner revisited this beloved adventure 22 years later and integrated eight minutes into the film. Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando (Jor-El), Gene Hackman (Luthor) and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) give indelible performances that fuel the film's aura of legend. Superman (also known as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film directed by Richard Donner. It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and stars Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, and Ned Beatty.I love this film and is the best superhero classic film ever made!!!! 10/10 it is my personal favorite Superman movie.",Superman
120,gab-14712,Is Christopher Reeve the Greatest Superman?,9,18 October 2017,"Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie is one of the first major superhero movies to be a major success. The movie was released at a time where they hardly ever came out and if there were any superhero movies, they mostly sucked. Well, this 1978 feature began to change how these type of movies would be made, but it would be many years yet before a consistent track record could be made. Firstly, I enjoyed this movie very much. In introducing people this character, I always tell them to watch this film first. It really captures the essence of who Superman is. The movie has a fair amount of action, but I like how the film is built upon characterization. We learn of the different world where Superman is from, why he is sent to Earth, his childhood where he learns he is not normal, and the meaning of his existence. Director Richard Donner and screenwriters Mario Puzo and David Newman were able to successfully incorporate these themes into the movie and it really created something special. Now the DC comics featuring Superman were huge in the 40's and 50's, so it was a good moment when Superman got the proper treatment he deserved.Jor-El (Marlon Brando) fails to convince the people of his world that their planet, Krypton is about to be destroyed. He resorts to his last measure in order to save his species-by sending his son, Kal-El (Christopher Reeve) to Earth. Being raised on Earth, Kal-El or known by his Earth name, Clark Kent will grow powerful skills where he will use them in the name of truth and justice. Clark Kent is raised on a farm by his elderly Earth parents (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter). When he becomes an adult, Kent becomes a bumbling, awkward newspaper reporter at the Daily Planet located in Metropolis. He also creates an alter ego which is called Superman, whose feats impresses the denizens of Metropolis. Superman/Clark Kent also finds himself a newspaper reporter to fall in love with-the hotheaded Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Meanwhile, ""the world's greatest criminal"" Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) and his henchman Otis (Ned Beatty) are up to no good as they plan the greatest real estate swindle of all-time. Can Superman save the day or is Lex Luthor really the world's greatest criminal? Part of what makes this film so good is the cast. Christopher Reeve is the quintessential Superman. No one can capture the image or persona as Reeve did. This is how Superman is supposed to be in my mind. He also makes a damn fine Clark Kent. With his charm, the overlarge glasses, his klutzy body, well it's just perfect. He channeled Cary Grant when doing this role, so he gave Superman a golden-age charm. Marlon Brando is one of the most difficult actors to work with and this film proved to be no exception. After all, he originally pitched Jor-El as a green talking suitcase. He was only on in the beginning, but his scenes were really powerful. Margot Kidder makes for a good Lois Lane, although it took me awhile to warm up to her. Someone please tell the lady to spell words correctly! Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty made for a fine duo of criminals, living in the underground lair at Metropolis. They added many of the humor, but sometimes the humor would go into campy territory. But these are two fine actors, so I really can't complain. There are also fine supporting turns from Jackie Cooper (who played Perry White, the hot-tempered editor of the Daily Planet), Valerie Perrine (who plays Luthor's love, Eve Teschmacher), and Terence Stamp (who cameos in the beginning as super-villain General Zod).Keep in mind that this film was made in 1978, so everything was made with practical effects. But the look of this film is beautiful. From the looks of Krypton to the arctic caves where Jor-El imprinted a memory of himself that would explain everything to his son-it just looks beautiful. The production design team did a wonderful job with Metropolis, turning it into its own unique city. When Superman is flying, it looks very realistic and that was one of my main concerns before I was able to see this movie.Another highlight to me is another iconic score by John Williams. He seems to create many iconic scores, huh? Just like Star Wars or Jaws or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he really created something special. Something that you can relate with when thinking about the film. It wasn't a serious score because of the film's tone, so he adapted something that was light-hearted. Good job, Maestro Williams! Overall, Superman:The Movie is one of the first good superhero movies ever to be made. It is fun, action-packed, and full of wonderful performances. The film does not take itself too seriously, which added to its sense of fun. The casting of Christopher Reeve is pitch-perfect as Superman. Rotten Tomatoes perfectly sums up this movie, ""Superman deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Christopher Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon."" I whole-heartedly agree. Superman is one of the characters defined with America, and this is a perfect film for that.My Grade: A",Superman
121,Ruskington,"A badly written origin story, propped up by the brilliance of Christopher Reeve and John Williams",5,13 April 2020,"It sometimes pains me to re-watch my favourite childhood films, as many of them simply do not stand the test of time. In the case of Superman, I now realise that this was not really a very good movie to begin with. Irrespective of whether or not the special effects were good for the time period, the film is a bit of a jumbled mess littered with corny dialogue.The movie does, however, have two major things going for it. The first is Christopher Reeve's incredible dual lead performance. I can think of few better casting choices in the history of modern cinema than this. The way Reeve morphs so gently between the nerdy, awkward Kent and the dashing, gallant Superman is almost like an optical illusion. The facial, vocal and kinetic changes are almost imperceptible and the way he instantly adopts the different personas is just pure art. Sadly, I do feel that Reeve fell victim to some poor writing; he has a lot of very corny lines that cheapen his character and degrade the movie.The other huge achievement is the absolutely spellbinding music composed by John Williams. This is probably my favourite ever movie score and widely lauded as one of the best ever. The way it connects with the opening credits is an epic moment in its own right.Unfortunately, there are many flaws contained within the plot and direction of this film that really detract from the viewing experience. The storyline is disjointed, the pacing is uneven, and the film is a good thirty minutes too long. The opening scenes set on Krypton are slow-moving and quite laborious to watch. I understand the need to set up an origin story such as this in a comprehensive manner, but these sequences suck the energy out of the film before it has even got started. It is over an hour before we get to see Superman properly in action and this scene is followed by numerous unconnected clips of him essentially working as a glorified beat cop.From here the story becomes increasingly disordered and bizarre with numerous logistic and practical improbabilities. Gene Hackman is wasted in this lazy attempt at a super-villain and his motives are unconvincing. The film leads to an underwhelming finale in which a distraught Superman reverses time to save Lois- a laughable piece of writing that sums up the clumsy nature of this film.Then we have the special effects. It is very hard to judge the CGI of a film made over forty years ago, but this looks extremely shoddy in places. It's hard to be overly critical, since the movie received very positive reviews at the time for its innovative editing. However, some scenes are so painfully bad (Young Clark Kent racing the train and Superman corkscrewing into Luther's underground den being prime examples) you would think it would be better not to attempt them at all.I can't say I liked the choice of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane either. I never really understood why Superman, or indeed Clark, would ever be attracted to her. I think she acts the part quite well, particularly in Superman II, but she just doesn't have enough sensitivity to shine in this role.It is a huge shame to see Christopher Reeve's excellent performance buried under such a poorly constructed storyline. This could and should have been an all-time classic superhero film but, despite some great moments, is little more than a dated piece of 70s nostalgia.",Superman

123,aesgaard41,You Will Believe That a Man Can Fly!,10,21 December 2000,"I was eleven when I saw this movie and it really did convince me that I would fly if I jumped off the roof.This movie is just that realistic in that it suggests that if Superman really did exist he might only really be as believable as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.Think of the number of people who have seen them against the number of people who haven't. While the costume may be the only star, Christopher Reeve gives the Man of Steel a certain dimension and boy scout personality as the hero takes on the mantle of protection too huge for even his shoulders. Margot Kidder is the first actress to give Lois a sexy but aggressive edge never before seen in the old TV series. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, however, is no more than a sinister comic relief who could have been portrayed closer to a prime underworld figure than an evil comedian. Most of the best lines are his. Marlon Brando turns in a bravado performance as the martyr of Krypton's doom. SPOILER:The movie jumps the shark with Superman spinning back the globe to go back in time. I have to ask why the crack didn't continue coming under her car just because he went back in time. Wouldn't previous-Superman appear and ask, ""Where did you come from?"" just before vanishing back in time to complete the sequence of events ? I guess in order to believe a man can fly you have to throw temporal logic out the window.",Superman

The real test of any movie like this is whether the story stands the test of time. Most people on the planet know the story of Superman. Quite why Lois Lane (Kidder) never realises that Clark and Superman (Reeves) are one and the same person is amazing. Lex Luthor (Hackman) is not so much evil as annoying in this movie.Most of the cast (Brando & Hackman in particular) are making some easy cash out of their names, but it's a pleasant enough movie if a little long. 7/10",Superman

This is a classic story told expertly by director Richard Donner, who picked the correct actor to portray the title character - the late Christopher Reeve (RIP), as well as having a near-perfect script to work with. Reeve not only brought Superman to life but also Clark Kent. He would be the only reason the sequels of the 1970s and 1980s would work - even when those films were below par, his enthusiastic spirit for the title role was very obvious. And then there's the classic score by John Williams whose Superman theme will always be remembered. This is a film that worked on all fronts and even 27 years later still stands the test of time.

128,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An epic movie that made me believe Superman can fly,9,7 May 2013,"In order to coincide with the upcoming Man of Steel next month, I've decided to make my review of this tale that captivated the audiences back at the 1970's and made them believe that a man can really fly. Before I begin this review, I would like to say that I haven't heard of Superman before, but I do love the director Richard Donner (who later made my childhood classic ""The Goonies"") and given the critical praise this received, I like to give my thanks to him for doing such a great job at making a classic example of a superhero movie.The reason why i'm giving this a nine out of ten is because there are some corny moments in almost the entire movie. But there isn't anything else to fault this epic film with. The story, despite it's corny moments, is compelling and dramatic with poignant moments including the romance between Lois Lane and Superman (AKA Clark Kent). The pacing is well done and takes its time to develop the characters. In fact, the characters are hard not to like them thanks to the solid performances from a great cast. Christopher Reeves did a solid job as the Man of Steel while Gene Hackman is a comic, but sinister Lex Luthor. Other cast members like Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane did great with the material they've been given.The directing from Richard Donner is lavish and focused, the cinematography and scenery is excellent, and the script is smart, witty, and funny. The best aspect, however, would have to go to the music score from John Williams. He has written some great scores and his score here is no exception. It has some poignant melodies with an excellent orchestra and the main theme that represents Superman is epic and memorable.Overall, aside from being far from perfect, Superman: The Movie is an example of a superhero classic that Hollywood had intended to do: make a superhero franchise that is beyond successful. With all of my heart, this deserves a solid thumbs up from me!",Superman
129,grahamsj3,OK but....,6,5 February 2004,"just misses the mark somehow. Acting is OK by pretty much everyone but the story just seems a bit lame. I think they'd have done a better film by adopting an old comic book story and writing a screenplay for it. Don't get me wrong, the film is OK. It just doesn't shine as it should with it's budget and cast. Even the usually excellent Gene Hackman just seems a little ""off"" in this film. I can't quite pinpoint where this one goes wrong. It just does.",Superman
130,RonellSowes,Takes Itself A Little Too Lightly,5,22 April 2021,"I think the first thing to mention about this film is the first thing you see. And the initial 2-3 minutes of this film are possibly the worst of any film of all time. It feels like it was going to say something before getting cutoff by the pretentious credits. And by no means do the films problems end post credits. It's not till over an hour into the film that it actually starts acting like a Superman movie. Everything before it is unnecessary and clunky build up that somehow manages to drag and yet feel rushed simultaneously. But this style is consistent neary throughout the entire film. It wastes it's time so when it finally gets around to something e.g. Superman saving/helping it has to cram it in.And it only makes sense that with such a poor beginning it should end on a equally low note.Not only is the way Superman turns time back ridiculous its needless. Since he saves her theirs no intention of a poignant ending and all it does is over power an already juggernaut of a hero. It makes you wonder why a man(alien) who can even send the whole world back in time is threatened by a cartoonish crook and his goomba henchman.I might say the best scenes in this film are those with Gene Hackman. I say might because though Hackman is a brilliant actor who can really illuminate his scenes, the character and dialouge he's given is so focused on comedy that all of his scenes are too steeped in silliness to have any real worth.However, while this might be more prevalent in some scenes than others, the film overall takes itself very lightly and doesn't strive to be more than a comic book adaptation.",Superman
131,AhmedSpielberg99,Christopher Reeve Is The Real Superman!,7,13 June 2018,"Before I watch this movie, I wondered if it is as convoluted as Snyder's Man of Steel. And I can that it's by no means that convoluted, although it's still somewhat messy, specially when it comes to Superman's origins part. That could have been easily avoided using enough time at the beginning instead of spending a lot of time showing Superman's abilities and powers. Also, the movie's run time is 143 min, so it really could have been used better.The thing that Donner did better than Snyder is sticking with the lighter tone. That made the emotional impact very strong, and almost every dramatic moment works very well. Also, this made the convoluted presentation of Kal-El's origins more acceptable.The dated special effects never bother me in any movie, but to be fair, we can see that they could have been a bit better in Superman, specially when we compare the special effects here with the special effects of Star Wars, which came one year earlier than this movie. Nevertheless, they still work, actually they are okay.Christopher Reeve's performance is iconic for good reason. He has a charisma that made love him as Clark Kent as well as Superman more than Henry Cavill, although I saw Man of Steel long before this movie, well, as I just finished watching this movie! Also, the chemistry between Reeves and Margot Kidder, Lois Lane, is great!One of the weakest points in this movie is the Villain, Lex Luthor. Neither Gene Hackman's weird, and kinda over-the-top performance nor every thing about Lex Luthor from his odd behavior, to his motives, convinced me.There are tons of plot holes, and logical gaps in this movie from its beginning to its end, and I really couldn't overlook all of them. Specially when it comes to the ending. Oh god! this is may be the most nonsensical ending ever put to film.Notwithstanding all the illogical stuff, I was very surprised seeing the movie taking advantage of almost every scientific thing that could be related to Superman, and to this story in particular. I don't want to spoil any thing, but I really wish if superhero movies nowadays be more science fiction movies rather than fantasy movies.On the whole, I had a blast watching this movie that arguably started all the superhero movies we love now. (7.5/10)",Superman
132,Hayden-86055,Brilliant acting with an ok plot,7,25 December 2020,"Christopher Reeve is undoubtedly the best Superman actor to date and Margot Kidder the best Lois, as well as Gene Hackman being the best Lex Luther. In short this film has a great cast. Unfortunately the plot doesn't match the acting talent.I think a lot of people give this film too much praise despite how dull the plot is, Christopher Reeve is fantastic and can play both Clark Kent and Superman to perfection, something other actors have failed to be able to do and is both comedic and serious. However, the plot wasn't as good as I remember and the Lex's sidekicks (Otis and Eve) came across more annoying than entertaining, Otis (played by Ned Beatty) especially as he's no way near Gene Hackman's level. The story plods along just a bit too slowly and the ending is unsatisfactory, but the beginning half and every scene with Clark Kent and Lois Lane is brilliant.7/10: A very fun film",Superman

134,silverscreen888,"Stunning Visual Fantasy Adventure; This Film is Fun, Has Everything",9,26 July 2005,"What interested me most as a writer when this film was announced was how the ""exposition"" would be handled by its writers, that and the question of the man-of-steel's flight capabilities. The character's flight was handled as a matter of routine, physically ignoring the laws of physics, but occupying a central place in the central character's arsenal of powers. The exposition, on the other hand, was handled by my standards even better. Improvements were made in more than half a dozen areas of the character's biography. The first portion of the film was devoted to a fantastically beautiful sequence on the unstable planet Krypton; the highly-evolved dwellers there lived among extruded spikes of fabulous crystalline elements; but their so-called leaders were as postmodernistic as Earth 'tsars' and public-interest charlatans. Like twenty-first century political types, they refused to believe their scientists'warnings about coming danger to their planet. Marlon Brando is introduced as Jor-el, leader of those not believed. He has constructed a rocket to take his own family away from Krypton's impending destruction, but his wife stays with him and they send their infant son Kal-el to distant Earth, where he will have a good chance to survive owing to the fact he will have super powers there. Krypton explodes; the rocket arrives on Earth. The baby is found by childless farm couple Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are amazed by the baby's strength and decide to adopt him as their own, rocket-borne advent on earth or not. We next see Clark Kent, as the boy has been named, as a frustrated teenager. He cannot fit in with the others about him, cannot play football and has a would-be girlfriend in Lana Lang but is ignored by the boys. He kicks a football into orbit, outraces a train, but is chided by his father for wanting an ordinary life, since that is not why he was sent to Earth. Then his father dies of a sudden heart attack. The boy goes off to the Arctic, to construct a ""Fortress of Solitude""; he tosses one of the crystals that came to Earth with him and the complex builds itself. So for the next years, guided by his father's prerecorded instructions, he studies to become what he was meant to be. And he emerges one day--flying, and clad in rich-blue tights and red cape, ready to fulfill his purpose on his new planet.. His first day in Metropolis City proves to be a memorable one. He saves Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane from dying in a helicopter accident, is introduced to the world by bewildered policemen to whom he turns over criminals, rescues a little girl's cat from a tree, and is hired as Clark Kent to be a reporter at the Daily Planet, hiding his identity behind thick black-rimmed glasses and a deceptive mild manner. the remainder of the film's screenplay weaves together three strands of story.One is the love story of Christopher Reeve as Superman and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane; the second is the machinations of Lex Luthor, brought to life amiably by Gene Hackman and his minions, as they steal two nuclear missiles and try to extort billions; and the third is Superman's trying to heed his father's last warning, not to interfere with Earthmen's destiny while stopping Luthor's plot.. In the large cast besides those named are Ned Beatty, very funny as Otis, Valerie Perrine as Luthor's girlfriend, Larry Hagman as a military officer, Jackie Cooper as an ebullient Perry White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen and Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter as Ma and Pa Kent. The elders of Krypton are played by notable British and European actors including Trevor Howard, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, Harry Andrews, Maria Schell, Susannah York and more. Richard Donner directed with a beautiful visual eye, with script by Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton. The cinematography was by Geoffrey Unsworth, with production design by John Barry and outstanding art direction by several talents. Stirring music and a lovely love theme was provided by John Williams and several others, and Peter Howitt did the set decorations. There are so many fine achievements in this spacious adventure, it is a bit difficult to choose among them. The flight Superman takes Lois on, the helicopter rescue, the first day in Metropolis City feats by Superman, the Krypton sequences, the lessons from his father, the Smallville sequences, the altering of the missiles, Superman's battle with kryptonite--green native rock fragments from his dead planet whose presence can kill him, and the final sequence where he goes back in time to change history to save Lois Lane's life--all are memorable. Were it not for the Otis sections being played as comic-book character actions, the film might have been recognized for the visual masterpiece it is, an adventure with humor, very moving sequences and Donner's beautiful and spacious camera work. A class fantasy for the sake of its ideas and it' fun.",Superman
135,virek213,"""You'll Believe A Man Can Fly"" (Truth In Advertising)",10,7 September 2020,"Where to begin??The advertising line that Warner Brothers had for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, when they unleashed it in December 1978, was: ""You'll believe a man can fly"". Given that the studio lavished a then mind-busting $55 million onto it, they had the nerves of riverboat gamblers who were going, perhaps literally, for broke. But they did indeed pull it off; and arguably, they created what still remains as close to a genuine cinematic masterpiece as any comic book-related film has ever come.No one who has seen the film needs a plot synopsis beyond the particulars, of a baby known as Kal-El being sent from the dying planet of Krypton to Earth to become a champion for truth and justice and, though it might be chauvinistic to say this, the American way. Once Kal-El grows up in the company of the Kents, a farm family in Kansas, portrayed by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter, he assumes the identity of Clark Kent when, as portrayed by Christopher Reeve (in a star-making turn like few before or since in a cinematic comic book opus) he goes to work for the Daily Planet in Metropolis. And after that, along with his awkward chumminess with the sardonic Lois Lane (played inimitably by Margot Kidder), the rest is superhero history, including his battle with master criminal Lex Luthor (portrayed with deadpan sincerity by Gene Hackman).Conceived by Russian brothers Alexander and Ilya Salkind (yes, that does sound weird), this film was by no means the first time the creation of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had made an appearance in movie theaters. But those past efforts were made on bargain-basement budgets, whereas this one was made for what, by 21st century prices, would equal what James Cameron spent on making TITANIC or AVATAR. And clearly there was a lot at stake, because the hype was pretty extreme, with tales of Marlon Brando (as Kal-El) getting paid an exorbitant salary in the millions for only two weeks of work, plus Trevor Howard (who plays one of Krypton's elders) nearly balking at working on the film because he hated Brando's heavy-handed behavior on the 1962 film MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, but doing so anyway when he was told that Harry Andrews, a long-time friend and fellow British actor, would also be in it with him. The end result was likely what began the stream of big-budget comic-book films that Hollywood has continued to do well into the 21st century. But it seems like SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE has managed to stand up as arguably the best of them, even though CGI has made even this film's Oscar-winning special effects work seem arguably dated in the minds of some.It does help that Richard Donner, whose previous film, the 1976 horror classic THE OMEN, was a huge hit, was put in the director's chair for this film, because he is able to handle both the grandiose spectacle of the piece and the moments of comedy (the Reeve/Kidder relationship; and Hackman's berating of his ""assistants"" Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine) with equal skill. More comic elements are provided with the exuberant performance of Jackie Cooper as the Daily Planet's editor Perry White. It could not have been easy for screenwriters Mario Puzo (THE GODFATHER), Leslie Newman, David Newman, and Robert Benton (the last two known for their script for the 1967 classic BONNIE AND CLYDE) to do it like that, but they more than managed. And who can forget John Williams' majestic music score, one that arguably exceeded even the one he had already done for STAR WARS, and which remains a staple on classical music radio stations to this day.That SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE won the Academy Award for special effects wasn't surprising. But by Donner's own admission, most of the film's ability to convince audiences that ""a man could fly"" would not have been possible without the huge contributions of British cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who had achieved considerable plaudits for his work on director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Because of Unsworth's contributions (which extended to this film's immediate 1981 sequel), the film is dedicated to him (Unsworth died in France on October 28, 1978, just two months before SUPERMAN was released).If it seems old-fashioned now, more than four decades later, for sheer entertainment value, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE is arguably the great comic book superhero film of all time. It truly set a high bar that, in many ways, has yet to be reached, let alone surpassed.",Superman
136,timdalton007,A Classic Superhero Movie,8,16 August 2006,"Forty years after first gracing the pages of comic books, Superman came to life in this film. That was nearly thirty years ago and the question is if this nearly thirty year old film still stands up today. The answer is yes and until the release of Superman returns this was the best of the superman films and is still worth watching today.Superman / Clark Kent and with Christopher Reeve in the role comes to life. Reeve slipped into Superman with apparent ease and whenever Superman is present on screen, he is there and one believes he is Superman. Reeve's certainly looks the part and his acting goes on to prove that he is the man of steel. Reeve's acting during the flying sequences sells the all ready good special effects to perfection. Reeve's also pulls of the humor of the Superman character with surprising ease and this goes on to prove that Reeve can be Superman. But Reeve's also pulls off the role of Clark Kent with the same ease he has as Superman. Reeve's version of Clark Kent is what Clark Kent should be: a klutz and a geek. Reeves wouldn't be sufficiently replaced as Superman until Brandon Routh took on the role.The rest of the cast is also outstanding. Marlon Brando as Superman's father Jor-El continues to prove his amazing acting talent. Brando plays the role with seriousness rarely found in a comic book adaptation and his brief appearances in the film are a highlight. Gene Hackman steps into the role of Lex Luthor with some mixed results. Luthor is not a very menacing villain, not entirely due to Hackman but also to the writing as well. Luthor seems to lack a large amount of menace and all too often the character is played more for laughs then anything. But Hackman does have a presence in his scenes with Superman. Margot Kidder becomes the perfect Lois Lane in this film. She captures the perfect blend of independence, damsel in distress, and realism that gives Kidder's Lois Lane more spunk then any of the Lois Lane's either before or since. Jackie Cooper is fun in the role of Perry White as is Marc McClure as Jimmy Olson. And one can't forget Jeff East as the young Clark Kent or his parents, played wonderfully by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter and of course appearances by other great actors like Trevor Howard, Susannah York, and Maria Schell. All in all, a great cast.If there is a problem with the film's cast it's in two character sin particular: Otis (Ned Beatty) and Mrs. Tesmacher (Valerie Perrine). Both characters are played for way too many laughs during the course of the film and often hamper the film down. But at least Mrs. Tesmacher redeems herself during the sequence with Superman inside Lex Luthor's lair. But these characters hurt the film more then they help it.The film's writers and director Richard Donner deserve much of the credit for the films success. Donner's belief in verisimilitude, along with some great writing, sells the film throughout. There is a sense of reality in the film that is missing from its sequels and most other comic book movies until recently. Though the films' final sequence involving Luthor's plan with California stretches credibility too far and actually hurt s the film, though it does lead to one of the great ending of all time (I won't spoil it for you).The films' special effects are another one of its pluses. For the most part the film's special effects stand up even today. The scene where Superman saves Lois from falling is a perfect example of this, as is the flying sequence with Superman and Lois Lane later in the film and the various rescues in California. But at times there is some obvious rear-projection during some scenes and the scene where Krypton explodes looks a little dated by today's standards. One can actually be led to believe, under the right circumstances, that a man can indeed fly and this is the mains selling point of Superman. And the films added scenes (found on the 2001 expanded edition DVD ) with special effects also stand up just as well today as they would have then.But there is also the film's amazing production design and the films' brilliantly done cinematography that sets it apart from other comic book movies. And the well-paced editing of Stuart Baird also stands out and actually improves sequences (look at the sequence in which the Fortress Of Solitude and compare it to the single shot version during the credits of Superman II to get my point).A review of this film can not be complete without mentioning the truly great score by John Williams. Williams, arguably at his best after his scores for Jaws and Star Wars, created one of the most amazing scores of all time. His triumphant opening theme brings the swooping 3D credit sequence to life in a way that has yet to me matched in my opinion. Williams uses the Superman Theme to great effect throughout the film, in both the action sequences and in the films more romantic moments. The beautiful love theme played during the flying sequence is a perfect example of the genius of Williams and his music and surprisingly the narration by Margot Kidder doesn't actually distract from the scene and in many ways it improves the sequence. Williams score never falters at any point during the film and it's a shame that this score didn't win the Oscar it was nominated for.With great performances special effects that still amaze today and a great score by John Williams, the film overcomes some of the problems from two bad characters and a rather forgettable ending. Superman: The Movie stands the test of time nearly thirty years after its relapse as a classic that, despite its flaws, still remains classic today.",Superman

I, personally, believe Superman, along with Superman II is one long movie, and both go together because many people, including me also think the second one is the best, but I think both are equally good, but it's the first one that starts it all off, so I give Superman the slight edge. Superman is a true Superman movie. It's mainly about Superman's origin. The villain in this movie is great, and it's none other than Superman's arch nemesis Lex Luthor, who also happens to be one of the most memorable villains in all of DC Comics, and not just in Superman. Lex Luthor, in this movie, was played by Gene Hackman, and I think he was the right choice to play that sociopathic character for that particular time.

140,dr_foreman,Great but not definitive,8,27 July 2006,"""Superman"" is a good movie - maybe even a great movie - but I don't quite agree with the consensus that it's the best superhero movie.I'll talk positives first. Christopher Reeve is simply an incredible Superman - he's charismatic and cool in costume, pleasantly dorky and fun as Clark Kent, and he has just the right iconic and handsome (but not too sexy) look. The rest of the casting is top-notch as well. Marlon Brando classes the joint up, of course, and Gene Hackman is awesome if not comic-accurate as a zany Lex Luthor. (I know Kevin Spacey was more ""dangerous"" in the new movie, but he just wasn't as cool!) Margot Kidder is lots of fun as Lois Lane, but somehow seems weird to me, sort of like an alien bird or something.I also like the first half of the movie, which is played very straight. The scenes on Krypton are pretty mysterious and cool (also cheesy these days, but for me that's a bonus!) Maybe better still is the segment when Superman grows up, which is also very serious. Casting Glenn Ford as Pa Kent was another inspired notion.The film falters a bit, for me, when the action shifts to Metropolis. I think my problem is that the whole tone changes radically. The beginning is so serious, but once you hit Metropolis you've got wacky Clark Kent, wacky Lois Lane, wacky Jimmy Olsen, and wacky Perry White, not to mention wacky Luthor and his wacky henchmen. That's a lot of wacky to cope with. I don't mind too much because a lot of the jokes are funny - but it just doesn't fit with all that dignified stuff on Krypton.Thankfully, Luthor's evil plan is very compelling, and well-realized with the help of some cool model effects. (The collapsing dam is especially neat.) Some of the other effects don't work as well, but on the whole this looks good for its time.So which superhero movies do I think might be better? I'd say various ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" films give this a run for its money, as does ""Batman Begins."" But I do acknowledge that Superman is the ultimate iconic comic book character, so his movie has a mythical aura that's missing from the others. That said, the guy's kind of boring, ain't he? When he's not played by Chris Reeve, that is...",Superman
141,vampyrecowboy,"Even in 1978, this was a big budget mess",4,31 August 2009,"Hollywood has taken Superheros to the extreme and it primarily started with this mess.While I think that Christopher Reeve is a fine performer and NOT for the Superman roles, he did a horrible job on here...because of the script and over all production and NOT as an actor himself.It's a EFFED up script with over the top acting by most performers, horrible effects, even by 1978 standards and poor production - even by 1978 standards.A lot more though could have been put into this to make it exceptional but was left out for whatever reason.Maybe I liked this when I was younger, but for 30 years later, if it was so damn good, I should still like it just as much.I've watched Back To The Future over 100 times and feel that it is superior in every aspect - even 24 years later.",Superman
142,raypdaley182,Doesn't wear well with time,5,18 September 2006,"OK, well the start of this and Superman 2 don't tally. Jor-el has nothing to do with Zod's sentence. He is obviously their advocate in court. The Elders pass judgment. Jor-el says nothing, neither condemning Zod or supporting him.There are at least 6 Elders who all say guilty. Even if Jor-el voted, Zod, Ursa & Non would be guilty by majority. Anyway the 3 criminals should be grateful to Kal-el, he saved them from the destruction of Krypton. Launching Kal-el into space starts the cataclysm that destroys Krypton. So Superman is responsible for the destruction of his own planet. If a nuclear blast can free Zod from the phantom zone why doesn't the explosion of Krypton free them? GAPING GOOF there.Infant Kal-el wouldn't be able to walk when he left the ship, his muscles would be atrophied, useless. Muscles only keep working in space if you exercise and Kal-el hardly had space to exercise.Isn't Lois supposed to be older than Clark? We see her as a young girl when Clark is already at high school. Jor-el lies when he says Clark is the only survivor of Krypton, knowing Zod, Ursa & Non are still alive. And he says the Red Krypton Sun caused their destruction, also a lie, he caused the explosion by launching Kal-el into space.OK, Clark went to The Fortress Of Solitude at 18, was there 12 years learning stuff off his dad. So he was 30 when he left.Lois Lane is an awful speller for a journalist. How did she ever get the job? The train station is yet another give away as to them filming in New York. Is Park Avenue a street in New York as well, is that Hackman making a deliberate mistake on his part? How is it that the helicopter pilot is unable to land from only about a foot above the ground. Superman has no jurisdiction to arrest the burglar apart from a citizens arrest, the policeman has no proof the burglar stole the jewels Superman shows him. The boat would just fall over in the street, it wouldn't stand freely like that. Those idiots flying Airforce One make several mistakes. They wouldn't crash with the loss of one engine and tiny bit of wing. They wouldn't have to notify civilian ground control ANYTHING! They'd be speaking to military control at all times.And by saying they are Airforce One instantly informs who they are speaking to the President is aboard. ANY flying vessel with the US President aboard is instantly Airforce One, as ALL Air Traffic Controllers everywhere know.The Daily Planet headline is untrue. Lois didn't spend the night with Superman. She spent a few hours of the evening with him. And at no time did Superman say where Krypton was, so how did Lex work out where it was?Anything that survived the explosion of Krypton & journey through space would have been tiny after it burnt up in the Earth's atmosphere. How did Lex know what Kryptonite was and what effect it would have on Superman? All sheer conjecture on his part.And the missile convoy wouldn't stop for any reason, no matter what they saw on the road. They certainly wouldn't stop to render any assistance. They might radio for help (highly unlikely as this would reveal their position and the position of the missile) but I don't think so. And at no time would the missile be left unguarded at all. So far to get the Kryptonite Lex killed a total of 3 people. So why is he sent to such a soft prison if he's committed murder several times. How does Lex know the frequency he transmits on will be heard by Superman, he has no idea, again just conjecture. Why isn't there more rubble when Superman drills through the ground. The hide-out is deep so there should have been a lot of rubble as Superman would have to had dug very deep.Lex fluffs his line ""Why don't you do yourself a FLAVOUR and freeze"". Good goof that. The hide-out wall would have collapsed before the door ever fell inwards.The missiles that Lex had tampered with would have both been checked over by technicians once arriving at their destinations. They would have discovered the alterations and changed them right back. So the missiles would never have gone off course.The earthquake creating Lex's new paradise would cause a tidal wave that would destroy everything that existed on that land. And put it underwater for a very long time, rendering it worthless, bankrupting Lex.Oh, and the missiles could both be manually destroyed from the control room they were fired from. Never once is that tried. Why doesn't Lois stop driving on the road, the most obvious thing to do. And Golden Gate Bridge wouldn't just snap like that if 1 or 2 cables broke.The train wouldn't have derailed at the speed it was going. And ""Superman"" doesn't know Olson's name but he called him Jim! Superman has no authority to deliver Lex to the prison, they have to be arrested by a policeman, go through a trial. Superman bypassed all that ignoring the American way completely.A generally weak ending.",Superman
143,grendelkhan,The best cinematic adaptation of a comic hero.,9,8 June 2005,"Superman was, and still remains, the standard by which all movie adaptations of comic book heroes must be judged. It perfectly captured the iconic nature of Superman, while adding cinematic flair. It also introduced a fine actor to the world, Christopher Reeve, a man who would prove to be a Superman of another sort. The film featured outstanding performances from veterans and relative newcomers, and effects which still hold up well, some 25+ years later.The film opens on Krypton, and immediately introduces us to Jor-El, Superman's biological father. As Jor-El, Marlon Brando elevates this movie to epic status from the moment he appears on screen. He adds a gravitas that lends credibility to the picture, removing it from the campy past of Batman.Krypton is a strange world of ice and crystal, not what comic readers had expected; but it works, and creates a truly alien environment. We get just enough of a glimpse to wet our appetite, before young Kal-El's escape.Next, we move to Smallvile, and a wonderfully understated performance by Glen Ford, as Jonathan Kent. It is this adoptive father who truly shapes young Clark Kent into the man who will become the Man of Steel. Ford exudes All-American wisdom and values. His time is short, but he brings full weight to it and his death has a major impact. Clark learns that despite his powers, he can't fix everything.Clark goes on a journey to discover his past. We see the birth of the Fortress of Solitude and the reunion (after a fashion) with Jor-El. Next, we move to Metropolis.In Metropolis, we encounter Jackie Cooper as Perry White, newspaper man of the old school. Cooper sinks his teeth into the character, providing laughs and energy to every scene. We meet Margo Kidder as Lois Lane, love interest to the Last Son of Krypton. Kidder had a quirky charm and reminded one of the movie heroines of the past, like Rosalind Russel in His Girl Friday. Kidder is the perfect Lois: tough, determined, sarcastic, and sexy. But it is Christopher Reeve who is the center of the viewer's attention.Reeve masterfully plays the dual role of Clark Kent and Superman. Although they are the same person, he gives each role a different personality. He stands and moves differently, changes the pitch of his voice. These are the skills of a great actor. Too bad Hollywood never seemed to come up with a script to match his talents.Now what is a hero without a great villain? Enter Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Hackman was riding high from his Oscar triumph in the French Connection. Here, he brings a sense of menace, intellect, and a bit of fun as the scheming genius and criminal mastermind. Although, you are left wondering why the greatest criminal mind would surround himself with a pairs of boobs? In Miss Tessmacher's case, the answer is obvious; Otis is another matter. They make great comic foils and Valerie Perrine is a treat for the eyes, even when she just stands in place. Ned Beatty has great timing and seems to be having fun.Richard Donner paces the story well. He has all the players in place and teases us with a slow build to Superman's arrival. The moment that Clark first pulls back his shirt, the audience erupts in cheers. ""Look, up in the sky...."" Reeve embodied the Man of Steel. He built up his body to give substance to the costume. It never seems hokey or out of place on screen. He moves with confidence and grace, always playing it straight. Reeve never betrays the character and creates the template for every actor to follow. He understands the noble nature of the character, the selfless desire to help people, without seeking rewards. He is a true hero, despite the cynicism and ridicule he faces.The movie triumphs on so many levels. The crucial flying scenes play out beautifully. When Reeve first flies towards the camera, then changes direction, we know we have moved beyond the old TV show. There are no running leaps or trampolines here; Superman just rises into the air.There is everything to be had here: drama, romance, comedy, tragedy, and thrills. The movie still holds up and remains the standard bearer for comic book adaptations. The succeeding chapters would lose sight, as comedy overtook heroics; but there is new hope for the future, as Brian Singer shepherds production of a new Superman. It will have a lot to live up to.",Superman

Then like a year or two ago I saw Superman: The Special Edition and I was right. Superman: The original version was incomplete! Superman: The Special Edition which is basically like the directors cut is an amazing movie! Director Richard Donner does a great job and Puzo writes a good script which is faithful to the comics. And the cast is fantastic. Especially Christopher Reeve who does a great performance balancing both characters even though it is very obvious that they're the same person. You'll believe a man can wear glasses and not be confused for Superman.I always thought that was corny.

145,richieandsam,Legendary!,8,19 April 2013,"SUPERMANI love this film... it is such a classic!After seeing the trailer for Man of Steel, my eldest daughter and I decided to watch the Superman films in order before Man of Steel comes out.I won't go into detail about what this film is about because if you don't know by now... you are living under a rock. :)We watched the Richard Donner cut. The movie is on for nearly 2 and a half hours... but it is still brilliant and didn't feel that long.What I liked about this one is it starts from the beginning. You see Clark's parents send him off as a baby to Earth just before their planet, Krypton, blows up and kills everyone. It even spends a bit of time during his teenage years. And his move to Metropolis as an adult.When this first came out, Christopher Reeve was not that well known for movies... so when you watch it you will notice that in the credits at the beginning it actually comes up in this order:Marlon Brando Gene Hackaman SUPERMAN Christopher ReeveOnce this film was made and released... it all changed and Christopher's name was at the front of the list for the sequels. This franchise made Christopher Reeve into the big star that he was.The effects were not that great, but for it's time they were brilliant. I love the look of this film. I once flew like Superman... it was cool!The soundtrack is also very good... John Williams did the soundtrack, and you can tell. He did the soundtrack to this 1 year after Star Wars. You can tell that it was him that did both films... there score is very similar.The acting is great, the story is brilliant and the whole film is classic!I will give this film 8 out of 10.A great film and a great character played by a legendary actor.

It's an endearing and entertaining tale that didn't have a single boring second from start to finish.
This movie is a great introduction to the character, spending enough time on the origin story that it leaves you feeling satisfied without dragging down the runtime, which isn't always an easy thing to do. This movie didn't feel like the 2 hours and 20-odd minutes that it was, the time truly flew (no pun intended) by. I'm looking forward to seeing the other Superman movies.",Superman
147,Al_The_Strange,"""You will travel far, my little Kal-El.""",8,11 June 2013,"Of all the superhero films ever made, Superman: The Movie was, and still is, one of the most epic experiences made. Even its opening credits sequence, with big blue 3D letters streaking at the audience across deep space, is an epic and awesome sight. From then on, as the film chronicles the origins of Superman and his first confrontation with Lex Luthor, the film sets out to deliver as much as it can; among the film's smorgasbord of spectacle, there are the otherworldly scenes on planet Krypton, Superman discovering his powers for the first time, numerous feats in which Superman saves lives and fights crime, and a thrilling climax where the Man of Steel's abilities are put to the test as he struggles to thwart mass destruction on a global scale. With so many action scenes and visually-inspiring sequences, the film covers a lot of ground, and it does decent justice to the classic comic-book hero.This experience is marred only by the age of the film. Despite its sheer ambition and scale, the film's special effects have not aged well, the styles appear outdated and gaudy, acting has its cheesy parts, and campy comedy clashes frequently with the sentimental drama. There is also a lot of absurdity involved. It's still a fun and enchanting experience, even if it is the product of its time.The story for this film is a long affair; half of it is devoted to Superman's origins, showcasing the fate of planet Krypton and Kal-El's upbringing in Smallville. In the last half, the film switches to Superman's life in Metropolis, and the subsequent struggles that ensue. A lot of the funner scenes occur in the last half, but the film overall builds up the title character really well, and explores some strong themes regarding fate and destiny. My only real complaint about this story is that it's rather uneven, and the climax feels somewhat weak.Regardless, this film is made competently, with quality photography and editing. Acting from Christopher Reeve is effectively perfect; Margot Kidder is endearing (even if her character is rather daft), Gene Hackman plays a seriously hammy villain, and Marlon Brando chews the scenery in his brief scenes (in a role that cost a whopping $3.7 million). Writing is not particularly deep, but it strikes the right tone and it is pretty good in general. Despite my complaints about the film's age and styles, it does use some very expensive sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The filmmakers and producers didn't exactly get along during this film's shooting, so the end product is especially admirable. John Williams' score for this film is classic! The theatrical cut of this film is decent, but on DVD and Blu-Ray, there is an extended cut available with something like 20 minutes of new footage. The film doesn't really need these scenes, but they are pretty cool, and a few of them do add a little more to the story and characters.Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",Superman
148,DavidSim240183,The greatest superhero epic ever told,10,28 June 2006,"Superman remains one of the world's most enduring superheroes. He is more than just a hero. He is a legend. A defender of the human spirit, what makes him unique is he's an alien brought up with human values. And in 1978 the Man of Steel was humanised and made flesh, courtesy of the impeccable casting of the late Christopher Reeve.Richard Donner directed the very first epic superhero film for the big screen, and he does magnificently. Before the Superman series was done in with silliness (not counting Superman II), Donner brought an epic flourish to the story of Superman by incorporating many different elements. Beginning as a Christ-like birth of the Son of Man, to the rites of passage as a young Clark Kent grows up in Smallville, to his eventual transformation into Superman.The fact that Superman works as well as it does is down to Donner's firm hand on the reins, and Reeve's marvellous performance. At the time of the film's production, Christopher Reeve was a virtual unknown. But he was born to play Superman. Not only does he resemble the character right down to the smallest detail, he brings a down to earth, human essence to the character that makes him intensely likable and a hero that you can root for.As for his interpretation of Clark Kent, this is where we see the flip-side to his personality. The bumbling, shy but affable news reporter that falls for his co-worker at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Theirs is one of the most unusual love triangles ever seen.Lois only has eyes for Superman, but can't see him behind Clark's thick glasses. She is tough and forthright with Clark, but goes weak at the knees at the sight of Superman. It's interesting to watch Clark compete with himself, and whether or not Lois will one day put the two and two together.There are quite a few conflicting styles at work. The opening scenes that show the destruction of the planet Krypton are sombre and deadly serious. Marlon Brando was paid an astonishing 4 million dollars for his 15 minutes of screen time. Although Jor-El is integral to the plot, it has to be said Brando's performance was rather lacklustre. He put virtually no enthusiasm into it, and although he gets some great lines of dialogue, he is sadly subdued compared to Reeve's warmth and authority, and Gene Hackman's slightly buffoonish but always menacing Lex Luthor.The comedy element is usually prevalent in Hackman's scenes. Although he is Superman's arch-enemy, there's a surprising lightness to Luthor's scenes. Hackman plays it for laughs but not strictly for laughs. His obsession with destroying Superman is always there, and when he exposes his weakness for Kryptonite, you can see the truly evil and twisted madman he really is.Superman's exploits are exhilarating to watch. When you see Reeve in costume for the first time, you feel very good about yourself. Superman's flying scenes are still pretty good, except for an occasional jerkiness, and whether he's saving Lois from falling off the top of a skyscraper or rescuing a cat from a tree, you enjoy following Superman on his crusade. With John Williams' sweeping musical score, you can't help but be carried along.Everything locks into place and the narrative is so simple to follow. Some of Superman's slogans and limitless good cheer seem hokey today, but it's a reflection of the changing attitudes of our time. Maybe we have become too cynical for our own good, and it's really quite nice to have faith in a symbol who actually believes in his own words. And what's wrong with that?Some of the set designs are breathtaking, especially the planet Krypton that seems an extraordinary glacial landscape, which includes the Fortress of Solitude, as well as the excellent cinematography of the Midwestern plains right up to the hustle and bustle of the city of Metropolis.The ending has always seemed unusual with Superman turning back the rotation of the planet Earth to change Lois' destiny. I don't see how that's possible personally, but if you really are willing to believe a man can fly, why not this?Superman really set the benchmark for superhero films to follow. Others like Batman, Spider-Man 2 and X-Men all have their collective strengths and are excellent in their own right, but Superman still sustains a sense of majesty, awe and most importantly, a tangible feeling of actual fun and enjoyment. Something that the empty-headed superhero flicks of today like The Fantastic Four could never hope to have.One of the true epics of our time that I hope never loses its power.",Superman
149,Rautus,You'll believe a man can fly,10,3 December 2007,"Superman is one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever made since it captures the essence of the DC comic books, Richard Donner worked really hard on this film trying to make it a classic, he wanted us to believe a man could fly and spent a while trying to find the perfect actor to portrait the Man of Steel, they found a man by the name of Christopher Reeve who acted the part out by was a little skinny so he had to spend time working out to get the muscular build of Superman. The acting is great, Gene Hackman did a fantastic performance as Lex Luthor. The effects are good although they feel a little dated compared to the effects in Superman Returns but they're still good and amazing at the time. Richard Donner did a great job directing Superman since he gave the film time to focus on each characters story. The music score for the film is effective for the film like the opening credits scene and other scenes were score is played. Superman is a classic movie and comic book adaptation that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10",Superman

152,charchuk,The classic superhero movie,8,15 July 2006,"The classic superhero movie, perhaps a bit dated but still fantastic. The origin story is done superbly, building up his beginnings without rushing through it too fast. Though the scenes at Krypton go on for a bit too long, and some don't have any effect on the rest of the film (mainly the trial scene - though it relates to the sequel), the film never feels boring and the pacing is perfect. The one that all other comic book films borrow from nowadays, with the perfect blend of action, romance, and comedy. Truly a classic.Though he is only third billed, Reeve is clearly the star of the show and delivers an iconic performance. Not only is his portrayal of Superman fantastic, but his dual role as the nerdy Clark Kent is even more difficult to pull off and, yet, spot-on. With Reeve's performance, there's no wonder how the characters don't put two and two together - the two roles are very much separate. Hackman is a great Lex Luthor, with perfect comic timing and good rapport with his sidekicks. Brando pretty much sleepwalks through this one, but he still makes it work. Kidder still irritates me as Lois Lane, she's the one major problem I have with the film. Very shrill and annoying.The only flaw I see in the story is the ending - not only is Luthor's plan completely implausible (like the military wouldn't check the codes again before firing the missiles), but Superman's solution to Lois' death is a complete cop-out. If Superman can turn back time, what's to stop him from solving any problem at any time? It removes an element of realism from the film and loses the suspense. Though it was nice to see Superman get really angry, to show that he's not emotionless. Everything else leading up to climax, however, was perfect.The effects are a little dated but still work, you can still believe Superman's flying. John Williams delivers another memorable score, and it works very well with the film. There are some scenes that are far too cheesy (saving the cat out of the tree, delivering Lex to the prison at the end), but they don't feel terribly out of place. And Reeve takes the role very serious, enough to compensate. Overall, one of the best comic book films of all-time and one of the better films of the '70s. Outstanding.",Superman
153,roghache,Amazing screen adaptation of the ultimate superhero,9,29 March 2006,"What a wonderfully impressive and fun movie! Christopher Reeve remained everyone's favorite superhero long after the release of this movie. He is fantastic here both as the dashing, legendary hero and also as his mild mannered, rather bumbling alter ego, Clark Kent. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Superman. They wouldn't DARE do a remake. Margot Kidder is also impressive as his love interest, Lois Lane, as she is swept off her feet (sometimes literally) by the flying hero. Also, Gene Hackman does a convincing and sometimes amusing villain, portraying Lex Luthor, a criminal with malicious intent to sabotage nuclear missiles and create an earthquake that would destroy California.Of course this is the classic tale of a small alien orphan sent to earth from a dying planet, Krypton. He grows up in the farm home of his older adoptive parents, the Kents. Discovering that he is blessed with super powers, the Man of Steel uses them for good, to fight crime in the big city of Metropolis. At least part time...his day job is as reporter, Clark Kent, for the Daily Planet. Here he becomes sweet on fellow reporter, Lois Lane, but she has eyes only for the daring caped superhero.Christopher Reeve brings the flying hero to life as he sweeps through Metropolis with his bold derring do, becoming quite a legend among the citizenry and capturing the fancy of Lois Lane. The Man of Steel seems to have a such a great time doing his bold deeds and showing off his powers, though all for such worthy purpose. However, it is the shy, unobtrusive, fumbling Clark Kent that I personally fell in love with. Wake up, Lois Lane!The comic book legend is unfolded brilliantly before our eyes, and the special effects are fun to watch. However, its plot and characters are so wonderful it hardly needs effects anyway. (Modern movies often require the effects because they are so desperately lacking in both departments.) Will Superman be able to save California from the nefarious designs of Lex Luthor? Will Lois Lane EVER wake up?For me, this is the quintessential superhero movie. It is vintage good versus evil, and we clearly know the villain of the piece, but all done so hopefully and entertainingly. Call me old fashioned, but I love the 'Golly, gee whiz' factor here that some other reviewers have mocked. This is the type of really fun (yet well messaged) movie that I would want my own kids to see. Pity there aren't more of its type these days.",Superman
154,theshadow908,The one that started it all.,8,1 July 2006,"Superman tells the story of a planet called Krypton. Its sun is going to explode, destroying the planet. Before this can happen, two parents send their son to the planet Earth in a rocket ship. Due to his alien biology, he finds himself instilled with great powers on Earth, and he uses them to become Superman, a flying hero dedicated to truth, justice, and the American way. Now, his abilities are put to the absolute test when he has to go up against maniacal genius Lex Luthor, who plans to destroy the west coast, and claim what's left as his own.Before 1978, the only comic book related things you could see on the screen were cartoons, serials, and movies like Batman (1966), which were meant as parodies. No one had made an accomplished, serious comic book film before. This is why Superman was such an ambitious project. However, Richard Donner pulled it off. He managed to work with the best special effects of the time and a great script, and he pulled off a work of art. Superman is amazingly close to comic book lore. It establishes his origin, his journey to become Superman, and his change into the geeky Clark Kent. The movie manages to stay serious, and yet action packed as well as really funny at some points. Donner was the right man for the job, because he tackled the first American icon and made it into an awesome movie.The acting was really really good. Christopher Reeve was the best choice for Superman. With his iron jawline and his jet black hair, he looks as if he stepped right out of the comic book. Gene Hackman gives a great and hilarious performance as Lex Luthor in a role that's both funny and evil. And of course, Marlon Brando, one of the greatest acting talents, taking on the short but sweet role of Jor-El, Superman's doomed Kryptonian father.Overall, Superman got the world interested in superheroes again, and it made Hollywood realize what a hot property comic book films can be, and it paved the way for more spectacular comic book films, and for that reason above all, Superman gets my respect.8/10",Superman
155,Enrique-Sanchez-56,Still Dazzling and Meaningful After Many Years,10,10 July 2004,"No comic-book story is greater and more beloved than this. 
It only followed that such a dazzling treatment should have been made in 1978 of the world's favorite superhero.From the opening credits, first scenes on Krypton, through his formative years on the Kent farm to his big city double-career as reporter and Superman, this movie delivers like few other movies about fantasy characters.  Certainly, no other favorite fantasy hero had been given this much respect from such an impressive array of talents beginning with the now legendary Marlon Brando and equally formidable talent of Christopher Reeve.To say that the movie had astounding special effects for its time begs for attention to this well told epic story.  It unfolds and we are drawn into the magic, the warmth, the humor and heart that all meld to form this wonderful whole.I purposely stayed away from this movie for many years.  It had had an astounding effect on me from the first time I saw it.  Fortunately, I knew the manager of the theater where it was showing and I was able to see it many times back in 1978.  I was able to immerse myself into its spell, binding me into those strengths to which all humans must hold fast.Today, I returned to it and saw that this was a sweeping tale.  Told in many different scenes which contrasted and built upon each other to create and recreate the story of this legend of an honest man who possessed a staggering set of powers - but who would only use them for good and for the good of mankind.Lessons which we should all behold in respect and erudition in these days of terrifying power misused.  A morality play, yes.  But with virtues which cannot be ignored or dismissed today or ever.I recommend this movie without reservation.

This is a film that aspires to be what movies are all about: creating an image and a product that has the viewer staring at the screen in awe for two hours, and it largely succeeds.The key to the success of this film, despite it's obviously fake (by today's standard) flying effects and slow pace, is the way the film chooses to portray Superman. If you want to watch Superman fly around like an emo teenager for two hours struggling with great power and great responsibility, this is not your film. If you want to watch a man shunned by society because they are different, or struggle with a secret identity, again this is not your film. If you want to watch a quintessential American hero flying around with a big ""S"" on his chest saving people and lifting heavy things while he tries to juggle a romance with Lois Lane (and by God, who doesn't?} this is your movie.This film is straddling a line between Adam West Batman silliness and fish out of water family fare handled with the innovative special effects and story gravitas that was then a part of summer blockbusters. Superman is able to take its story seriously without ever losing sight of the absurdity of the premise and its function as entertainment.So what, it doesn't take the subject matter seriously? Hell yes it does. We have the Godfather himself Marlon Brando, playing Superman's Kryptonian father in dead serious mode, explaining to Superman who he is, where his power comes from, and that he has been sent to earth because of our ""capacity for good."" We also have Gene Hackman as an over the top and enjoyably malevolent Lex Luthor with a plan that is absolutely bonkers. But the best thing about this movie is Reeve's portrayal of Superman/ Clark Kent. He plays the absurd happenings completely straight, He remains the best flesh and bones version of Superman from TV or film. No one else has encapsulated the character as well or totally as Reeve, which contributed sadly to this under rated actor never really emerging from the character's shadow.Superman takes Lois Lane on a joy flight, improvs himself into a train track, shifts the Earth's tectonic plates and reverses time before the movie's over.This is the type of Superman film the world wanted in 1978. Earnest, light and lacking even the vaguest hint of cynicism. Sadly it's also the type of Superman movie the world will never see again. We've become jaded, entitled and cynical. We're no longer interested in a character who is all powerful and pure. We want ambiguity and weakness in our heroes, and I don't personally believe this version of Superman has a home in our universe in 2015, and the world is poorer for it.But it's well worth returning to this piece of cinematic magic that showed us a pure, powerful alien faster than a speeding bullet, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and fighting for truth and justice in the American way. RIP Christopher Reeve: there was never another Superman like you.",Superman
158,kgprophet,Sets the mold for modern Super Hero movies,8,8 April 2019,"I recently went to a big screen revival showing of this classic movie. Unfortunately, because it was a digital projection, the quality of the picture was lacking. I'm not sure what type of transfer it was (1K, 2K, that sort of thing), but the compression artifacts were very obvious, especially in shots of the sky. The trade-off, with this video remastering, was the recreated sound mix. Back in 1978, stereo soundtracks were just beginning, with few theaters equipped with proper sound. This restoration used modern techniques, and digitally recorded sound effects, replacing things like gun shots with great results. Scenes of missiles flying by, the building of the fortress of solitude, an earthquake, all benefit with cleaner sound effects, boosted by a heavy woofer system. Better yet, a beautifully clear recording of an orchestra playing the iconic John Williams score.Superman was a huge gamble back in the 70s. Most films being released were more serious and real world, with our culture reacting to the remnants of the failed Viet Nam war and corrupt Nixon presidency. In 1977, an even larger gamble was attempted by the release of a space fantasy ""Star Wars"". Despite the overwhelming acceptance of that film, it was no guarantee people were interested in an Earth-based fantasy where a man flew around in tights and red underwear.It took the insight of the filmmakers to address those reactions within the film. Where you have everyday people talk about how crazy it is that a man is flying around in a blue suit. Superman was structured as an origin film, and it begins with the academy award winner Marlon Brando. The film adds integrity to the whole superhero world by being introduced by a dignified actor. Just as Alec Guinness grounded the mythology of Star Wars. Despite the high cost of Brando, his presence got audiences to buy into the Superman world.One thing that ages films from the 70s very commonly is the pacing. Not the case in general with Superman. There are only a couple spots that seem long, one being the opening titles. However, I thought it provided the music score a chance to provide a prologue, and the innovative animation still holds up in the world of digital titling. What about the fact that the first 5 minutes or so are spent setting up the sequel? Truth is, it is not good pacing to blow up the world at the very beginning of a movie. You want to spend a little time on this planet before it is destroyed. Then there is a prolonged sequence of the spaceship traveling from Krypton to Earth. But during that time we are treated to very elaborate star effects, and, more great John Williams score.The only scene that really goes too far is when Superman takes Lois on a flying tour of Metropolis (New York, including the WTC). The soundtrack features Margot Kidder flatly reading a poem ""Can you read my mind?"" It is corny, but does not ruin the film.One thing Superman achieves is the blockbuster feel, again something new to audiences. The first time Superman reveals himself to the city, there is a whirlwind of action scenes showing him saving people and intervening in a number of crimes. It starts with a scene of a helicopter trying to take off on top of a skyscraper. The scene is harshly lit, making for gritty photography when the helicopter goes out of control. The same for a car chase scene. Then he saves cat out of a tree. Then an effectively gripping scene of Air Force One getting in trouble in a storm.That sequence was engaging and more importantly, larger-than-life in its scope. Here we were encompassing an entire huge city. The scene puts a punctuation mark on the huge set of action scenes by displaying a large boat sitting on a city street in front of a police station. There is a fun chemistry with the main actors, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, and Valerie Perrine. There is a lot of banter between them that is engaging, and in the case of Reeve and Kidder, builds a relationship that has a great payoff. The scenes of Reeve as Klark Kent shows the actor has great comedic talents. Gene Hackman also steals the screen as the easily annoyed narcissistic evil genius Lex Luthor. Credit also goes to Ned Beatty, showing off great comedic abilities.
The dialogue is chaotic but coherent in the Daily Planet scenes. Director Richard Donner stages those scenes with a stylistic flair. There are a lot of technically difficult things pulled off in the making of this film. For example, for all the scenes of Klark as a teenager, every line of dialogue was replaced by Christopher Reeve. The effects work was famously very difficult, creating flying sequences that had never been tried before. Also looking impressive is the Fortress of Solitude and Krypton. Production design almost feels like a big James Bond film, such as the underground lair for Lex Luthor. What I appreciated this time is the emotional hook when Lois dies during the earthquake. Reeve's reaction in that scene connects with the audience, making for a great climax in his character arc, and a grandiose finale for the film.One of my favourite things about this movie, as opposed to the bigger action set Super man II, are the epic shots of Kansas (actually shot in Canada). Nowadays, background replacement would be used to insert grain elevators and farm settings. For this film, great care was taken to frame these iconic shots of Americana, evoking the simple happy life. This makes for a great contrast in the way Metropolis is portrayed as a chaotic world of people and lights. This film was part beginning of the blockbuster era, on a scale only seen in James Bond films. This was an event movie and still has legendary status of being one of the first ever big budget super hero movies that also set the mold for superhero movies to come.",Superman
159,tankace,Ubermench for the first time in the big screen and comparison with the modern Superman!,8,1 January 2017,"To start 2017 I tough to start with the patient zero of the superhero genre we all know and many of us has, me included have a religious almost respect for them as there are our modern-day mythology. In short the Richard Donner Superman though quite dated nowadays it still has this air of wonder and excitement for the existence of the Man of Steel. And with the later incarnation been below average I believe it is high time to review this flick.For starters it follows the origins of Superman from his birth to the dying planet of Crypton to his role as the hero of Metropolis. It is more or less a nice neat story full of color and well placed jokes. Well I first saw it I though ""It is fine but a little to corny and old-fashion, but as a whole it is more focused than the 2013 film and BvS. Now to be honest the action in Man of Steel it is pretty awesome and much better than the 1978, which in all honesty it is a bit lacking in terms of action and effects, but the inconsistencies in the plot and the undeveloped characters curtail its status to a just enjoyable flick. In short in Superman I carried or understood the characters and so I was invested in them, while in modern-day Man of Steel I didn't have that commitment.To go to the casting, it was on the spot with the late Christopher Reeve been pitch perfect of the role and Gene Hackman playing Lex Lothor very well and in let's be real he is the best Lothor even to this day (of real Mr. Eisenberg what were you thinking in BvS). Damn, I guess that we may never see a good Lex in the big screen with a decent machination. As for the rest of the cast it was quite good and memorable.And now the ending..well if you have seen the film it is obvious they jump the shark there, no spoilers but it mess the film in general. Any way that the only major weakness of the film as a whole.To conclude it is a classic of the genre, decent even today and a 8/10 for me for here made the Last Son of Crypton a text-book example of Nietsche's Ubermench.",Superman
160,Scars_Remain,Freaking Awesome!,9,3 March 2008,"I just this movie for the first time and loved it. It is the definitive Superman film and everybody should see it. I haven't seen the sequels, except for Superman Returns which I loved just as much, but I hear the others aren't quite as good. This, however, was a great film and should be remembered as such.Christopher Reeve is brilliant as Superman and all of the other actors and characters are amazing. The writers did a great job of sticking well to the comic books and being a comic book fan, I really appreciate that. The effects are brilliant! This movie was made in 1978 and it could give the movies of today a run for their money based on the effects.Superhero fans will love this movie without a doubt. I highly recommend it.",Superman
161,TheHonestCritic,This is the best superhero film in history.,10,8 May 2019,"As far as superhero films go, this one tops them all. This is the best DC superhero movie. It's tied with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) which is the best Marvel film, as the best superhero movie in cinema in my opinion. This is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. It's one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies! Everything is perfect; the story, the acting, the special effects, the sets/locations, and the soundtrack. All top-notch material! But, the real shining star in this movie is the Man of Steel himself, Christopher Reeve. It's like he stepped out of a comic book, and transformed into a real-life person! Not only is he the best Superman, but he is also the best Clark Kent as well. That's also a challenge, going back in forth in character between two different alter egos, and Christopher Reeve did it seamlessly. Very few actors can pull off playing multiple characters in the same movie, but Christopher Reeve did it. The side characters are also stellar. Margot Kidder is the best Lois Lane, Marlon Brando is the best Jor-El, Gene Hackman is the best Lex Luthor, Terence Stamp is the best General Zod, Jackie Cooper is the best Mr. White, Marc McClure is the best Jimmy Olsen, etc. When I watch this movie, especially looking at Christopher Reeve, I don't see an actor. I see Superman! Same thing with the rest of the cast, I don't see actors, I see those characters! The special effects are timeless, and still look better than most of the CGI effects today! The sets and locations are spectacular, and of course there's the perfect soundtrack composed by the one and only John Williams. Out of all the music composers in movie history, John Williams is my all-time favorite. Whenever I see his name in the credits as the music composer, I know we're in for a phenomenal soundtrack! This movie is perfect from beginning to end, and I could watch this movie on repeat for a whole day and never get tired of it. I know that most people are skeptical about the scene where he flies around the Earth and reverses time. But, I love it! If any superhero could possibly pull it off, Superman is the perfect candidate for it. Also, I know that some people criticize the lack of violence. Yes, violence and fight scenes may make a movie exciting. But, being a superhero is much more than just fighting, it's about looking out for the people, saving people from harms way, protecting your home planet, and watching over the rest of the universe. That is a true hero trait, and this movie pulls it off perfectly. Normally, I'd be disappointed about lack of fighting in a movie, but this one gets it right. Which is a very hard thing to do! It showcases that being a hero is more important than being a fighter, and that's what superhero films should be all about. Of course, I obviously give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Superman"" (1978), what are you waiting for? Go see it, I promise that you won't regret it! The movie is honestly that good, and well worth investing your time in. Watch this movie and you will see Christopher Reeve, the real Superman. He is, and always will be, the one and only true Man of Steel.",Superman
162,aarongnr,"Had this come out today (with improved VFX), people would've hated it",6,27 September 2020,"The dialogue is cringey and unbelievable, the story weak at best and it's honestly hard for me to grasp what there is that's good about it except for Reeves role changes between Superman and Clark Kent, which happens like 2 times.A montage of Superman saving people for 5 minutes is not interesting.
Timetravel as done in this movie is not interesting as it eliminates all stakes (and frankly didn't even make sense).
Lex Luthor in this is laughable. A clown in a basement with a woman who's motivations are entirely non existent and a whimsical idiot. L A U G H A B L E.
""Do not interfere with human history"". That line is literally ONLY in there to tell the audience: ""oh look, Superman acts against his fathers wishes to safe the girl. But why should I and he care about what his father says, because there are no clear consequences.There isn't anything that was actually really good about this movie.",Superman
163,GeorgeRoots,A Wonderful Adaptation Of An Iconic Super-Hero.,9,7 September 2014,"Richard Donner has pretty much set the ground rules perfectly for the first modern superhero film, and Christopher Reeve was an awesome Superman. It was also cool to find out that this virtually unknown actor took the role, and really made it his own. My point being that he refused to wear a muscle suit, began an all protein diet and muscle building program for two months under the tutelage of David Prowse (The guy who played Darth Vader's body). So yeah, Darth Vader trained Superman. And if that doesn't blow your mind Mario Puzo (Author of ""The Godfather"") wrote the screenplay, how can this movie fail? Marlon Brando is just as fantastic as always. Margot Kidder is my favourite Lois Lane, and the flawless Gene Hackman all do solid jobs. As I write, I must say that only recently have I got back into the whole mythos of Superman. Nowadays many people will see the special effects as dated, but I still thought while watching the movie that it has aged incredibly well. If the effects may be getting on, then the acting still remains sublime.Story (On what little there is), is practically the origins and it was pulled off incredibly well. Yet by the final act I was feeling this heavy sense of stupidity, I mean shifting the Earth's orbit the other way round reverses time? Not to mention, where's the other Superman? AND if he was capable of moving that fast shouldn't he have been able to get to both missiles in like a nanosecond? Either way, after seeing the whole movie I still really enjoyed it. It's considered a timeless classic, and I think it's more than deserving of that title. There's so much to enjoy about it.Final Verdict: Whether it's the scene of Clark Kent outrunning a train, or Superman and Lois flying through the clouds at night. ""Superman"" really is one of the most enjoyable, definitive Super-hero movies ever made. 9/10.",Superman
164,jmbwithcats,There can be only one,8,7 June 2004,"Christopher Reeves is Superman.  Armed with vulnerability, and unwavering determination, he gives Superman real wings.  Superman is honestly one of the very first movies I saw on the big screen. I was about 5 when Richard Donner brought this to cinema, so my world was small, and my eyes were wide.  In a word, impressionable, and looking for something to believe in. Christopher Reeves as Superman, flying to the sound of John Williams was all a child needed.  One could even hear the word Superman pronounced syllable by syllable in the theme song..- it's dreams eloquence and archetype all rolled into one.One thing you have to respect is the genius and ingenuity that brought this film together, and made it possible.  We take for granted the special effects in this movie, because of what technology we have today, but remember this is 1976-1978, they were pioneers!Sure some of the miniatures are very silly, downright laughable, but the feeling, the  determination, the sheer moxie and fervor of the cast  makes you believe, that man.. can.. fly.Just like my kitten can look at me and convince me with a look that I want to give her tuna right now... but, that's a little off topic.
Superman may have endless plot holes, for instance... why would Lex Luthor fire two missiles, one intended to  keep Superman busy, when Luthor thought Superman was dying in the pool with the kryptonite?  And that's actually just one of the smaller plot holes.But, in the final analysis, where other movies riddled with plot holes, dies a terrible death *cough*The Day After Tomorrow*cough*, this one soars above it's shortcomings by the sheer genius, creativity, and integrity of the film's merits.Christopher Reeves, Margot Kidder, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Glenn Ford, Jackie Cooper, to all the cameos, Larry Hagman, Rex Reed and more... they never stopped acting for a second. I never knew Mario Puzo was credited with writing the story, the same guy who brought us The Godfather.The chemistry of Ned Beatty and Gene Hackman was adorable :) but the best of all was Christopher Reeves... one man who made dreams come true.",Superman

They really hit it out of the park.Christopher Reeve may be the best cast actor in a role ever. And he really makes you believe someone can get away with a paper thin disguise.The rest of the cast is splendid. Gene Hackman creates a fantastic Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder is perfect as Lois Lane. She's very pretty but not some overly gorgeous Hollywood starlet, and she creates a perfect image of a Red smoking gritty New York reporter. (Though how in the world can she afford that apartment on a tabloid reporter salary ;) )Obviously the effects are dated in this 40 year plus old movie, but while I haven't seen Superman Returns, Superman flying looks a lot more real than Neo flying in Matrix Reloaded.

Filled with superb dialogue and a heart wrenching story that triumphs over any hero film out there, Superman delivers on everything possible in cinema, during it's time. The build-up of Clark Kent in act 1 of the film is incredible, telling the backstory of his life on the farm, which is something that is missing from many superhero films nowadays. The villains are not overly charismatic which I loved, because it focusses on him having powers and having people, rather than having to deal with a bad guy 24/7, which is what modern day superhero films always do. The screenplay is terrific for what it is, the acting is very good, and the direction and camerawork is great!

More akin to the boring boyscout that came towards the middle of WW2 than anything. That said, this as a movie is complete and utter crap. Bad acting, bad action sequences, badly made scenes like the one concerning the helicopter on the roof, it's complete and utter crap compared to Lynda Carter's spot on portrait of Golden/Silver Age WW, The Silver Age Batman of Adam West and The Flash with Wesley Schnipp. The worst amongst the best.

Choosing Marlon Brando as Jor-El was great but he doesn't have a lot of screentime. The first scenes of Superman on earth were good, besides the ridiculously looking train scene, which is actually so weird looking that it's almost good again. After that everything goes downhill.
Another thing I can't believe: 'Star Wars - A New Hope' was released one year prior to this with a budget of $11.000.000 while 'Superman' had a budget of $55.000.000. It's impossible to me thinking of why it had 5 times the budget - What for? Regardless that Star Wars has a nice to follow plot while Superman is just cheese stacked on cheese 90% of the time.

In Earth, Clark begins to figure out his mysterious power which he decides to use for the good of his city.First of all, I'll start off with what I love about this movie and that is the first 45 minutes of the movie which deals with the origin of Clark Kent back in his home planet, to his arrival on Earth, to being adopted to the point where he witnesses his ""father"" die and to the point where he leaves his mother. This is to me, the highlight of the movie and here's why: This here is where I was emotionally connected with the film the most. The acting here was definitely the best. Despite such minor performance, and such little screen time, Marlon Brando is easily the star of the movie in his 15 minute role as Jor-El. However, the supporting cast do a great job mainly Gene Hackman and Christopher Reve. Margot Kidder as Loius was at times, not very effective and a little laughable but is forgotten by great acting from the supporting cast.It is fair to say the dialogue is cheesy, the effects are heavily outdated, especially such environments which look like they've been drawn. I mean the original 'Star Wars' aged far better and it contains more visuals. The action type sequences in the movie are no longer that impressive but the biggest issue with the movie is, its rushed conclusion as it spends a good deal of just under one hour before the plot begins to move away from Clark's origin.Another thing I find laughable is how Loius actually finds out that Clark is Superman. I mean, its a little strange that no other person who has stayed with Clark for a certain time period couldn't figure it out. As a character, I didn't enjoy her much.Apart from Brando's amazing portrayal...as expected, the second in highlight for this movie is John Williams' amazing musical score which propelled the movie forward in its extremely long 5 minute opening credits sequence. This sequence did not bore me due to the amazing score.'Superman' is a classic superhero tale that was revolutionary for its time and loved back then...and even still now...but there is no denying that the effects in this movie, despite coming out an year after the original 'Star Wars' are far more outdated and poor to look at.

Yes, there had been television shows like ""The Adventures of Superman"" in the 1950s, but nothing had ever given superheroes, particularly the greatest one of all, much justice until this film starring Christopher Reeve came along. Additionally, this movie deserves a lot of credit for bringing appeal back to a character that hit a low point with a cheesy musical earlier in the decade.Part all that aside, and now consider the job that Reeve did as the Boy Scout. While the three sequels, particularly the final two, did not impress, it is safe to say that Reeve's acting was well-done throughout the entire series.With lots of charm, and full of respect to the legend that is Superman, the 1978 Richard Donner film truly is a classic.",Superman
177,antagonist117,"More than Star Wars, Superman touched off the era of the blockbuster",6,7 January 2014,"Some observers have credited, or blamed, 1977's ""Star Wars"" for inaugurating the era of the big-budget blockbuster, but 1978's ""Superman"" may be the real culprit. Like most of today's box office hits, but unlike ""Star Wars"", the Superman universe did not originate on screen but in another medium. The movie thus had a ready-made audience, namely comic book readers, and aimed to expand and diversify the property's fanbase through the casting of superstars with wide crossover appeal like Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman. ""Star Wars"" was inspired by out-of-fashion serials and adventures, but was an original, written-for-the-screen property and therefore a bigger risk. It was made by people who were largely unknown at the time, whereas ""Superman"" was always going to be the product of Hollywood's best and brightest. Its budget was $55 million compared to ""Star Wars""'s $11 million. ""Star Wars"", at least originally, had a ratio of heart to glitz that was the opposite of what the term ""blockbuster"" generally implies, and is the opposite of ""Superman""'s mix. It's not that ""Superman"" doesn't have some heart, but when it tries for emotion it usually lands wide of the mark. The most romantic scene in the movie, Lois' flight with Superman, is turned into something thoroughly laughable by a stupendously bad voice-over poem titled ""Can You Read My Mind?"" The spaceflight scene at the Fortress of Solitude in which the young Clark Kent learns about the universe from his father is affecting, but it is its myth-building and imaginative qualities that make it so rather than any chemistry between Jor-El and Kal-El. All of ""Superman""'s characters seem to stay at arm's length from each other. The camera keeps us at a distance too, preferring wide shots over closeups, perhaps to make the characters seem statuesque and larger than life. All of this may not make ""Superman"" a great piece of character-driven cinema even to the limited extent that ""Star Wars"" is, but it does help to make it a broadly-appealing blockbuster in the action/sci-fi/superhero vein. Today's glut of superhero movies, YA literature adaptations, and sequels to previous hits may well owe more to the risk-averse, highly-manufactured ""Superman"" than to ""Star Wars.""",Superman

I remember watching it again and again on a Beta videocassette, back when those were all the rage! I must have been around 6 or 7 years old back then, my english wasn't very good, so I couldn't understand almost anything about the picture. Still, I was just amazed to see a man could fly. And I remember all I could dream about back then was to fly, to stretch my arms just like Superman and to kiss this earth goodbye.A lot of years passed. Then, I heard the DVD was coming out, with tons of extra features. I had to buy it, for two reasons. One, I wanted to see just what did I miss by not understanding the entire movie. And second, I knew about Christopher Reeve's accident (actually, felt quite sorry for him) and I wanted to watch him on screen, since I had heard so much about his good acting in this film.After watching the entire DVD twice, I can say two things:1) Kids, and people who didn't get to see this movie on theatres, won't like it. 2) If there is one person who can walk again after such an accident, Mr. Reeves is it. He can do it.First. Why wouldn't people like this film? Judging it from the modern comic perspective, this film is way too campy, light, good hearted and benign. Compare this to Batman, by Tim Burton (my favorite superhero, actually). His Batman is a tortured soul, doomed to wander through the world fighting criminals. He knows he will someday die, most probably on the streets. He is haunted by the memories of his past life. He is a sad soul whose days are counted. Superman, on the other hand, is pretty much invincible. He did lose his parents, but in a much less traumatic way. He lives the life of a geek, yet he knows he is vastly superior to anyone else on earth. In short, he knows nobody can harm him, and he is mentally sane.A boring superhero for the times. But for my generation, it was just about perfect. I lived at a time when rock music wasn't supposed to depress you, or to make you want to kill your neighbour, or where every other line wasn't an insult to an ethnic race. The music of my time was pretty uplifting. The movies were uplifting. So, it was only fitting to have a happy superhero in strong red and blue colors.Also, the special effects seem too dated. The sets are very similar to the Star Wars ones, but I must say Star Wars hasn't suffered the passing of the years as this movie has. Why? Simple. Star Wars had a guy dressed like a cowboy, another with a white robe, and everyones hair styles were kinda restrained. This movie has bellbottom pants, huge hairdos, weird glasses and jive talking. Not a good omen for staying power.Now, why do I think Christopher Reeve will be able to walk someday? Simple. He is the most perfect Superman anyone could ever hope for. He is good, really good, humble, intelligent. And it seems in real life he is the same. He seems to be perpetually cheerful, despite his current condition. He is in much more in touch with his humanity than many of us. He cares for the rest of the people, making donations fo the cause. And everyday, he fights to be able to move again. What a guy. Watching the movie on DVD, I couldn't stop a tear flowing through my eye just thinking that the man who once flew was now strapped to a wheelchair. One of the people who taught me to be good, kind, and just, was now passing through one of the worst situations a man can go through.In short, Mr. Reeve will be able to walk simply because he didn't play Superman. He will forever be Superman in my eyes and in my heart.",Superman
179,brefane,Far from super,2,4 November 2010,"Long-winded, bloated, star and F/X-laden film is short on invention, wit, suspense, and wonder. In 1978, Superman was much anticipated, and a BO success, but it's disappointingly flat, and the opening scenes set on Krypton nearly bring the film to a halt. Richard Donner(The Omen)directs with little consistency; the whole film is unwieldy and disjointed. Christopher Reeve is well cast and makes a likable hero, and Margot Kidder is an agreeable Lois Lane, and they prevent the film from being totally forgettable. Hackman is acceptable if uninspired as Lex Luther, but no one else really registers. The plot is ho hum, the pace non existent, and the special effects are downright cheesy-looking especially considering the film's big-budget. Sitting through this film isn't a pleasant waste of 2 and 1/2hrs. This Superman doesn't soar, it bores. The sequel directed by Richard Lester is much more enjoyable.",Superman
180,rparham,Superman stands supreme,9,21 June 2006,"In the mid to late 1970s, the big budget comic book film adaptation was an almost unheard of thing in Hollywood. Sure, comic book characters had been featured in the Saturday serials that kids flocked to in the 1940's and 50's, and Batman had been brought to both the television and silver screen in the late 1960s, but in parody form. However, when producer Alexander Salkind and son Ilyia Salkind envisioned a grand film adaptation of the iconic DC Comics character Superman, they were braving new territory for modern film. What they delivered with Superman, under the capable direction of Richard Donner, was a film that not only birthed the comic film adaptation genre, but defined it as well, setting the bar high for everyone who followed. Superman still stands as the best example of comic book film-making to date.Superman opens on Krypton, a planet orbiting a red giant star. Jor-El (Marlon Brando) a Kryptonian scientist determines that the sun will explode in less than 30 days. Believing his world doomed, Jor-El decides to send his infant son, Kal-El, to the planet Earth, whose yellow sun, combined with Kal-El's dense molecular structure, will allow him to be incredibly strong, almost indestructible and able to defy Earth's gravity. He crash lands in a Kansas corn field as Jonathan and Martha Kent (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) are driving along. They adopt him and name him Clark, who quickly demonstrates his special abilities, and they determine that they must keep his abilities secret to prevent Clark from being taken away from them.After Jonathan's death by a heart attack, Clark, drawn to the North, hurtles a crystal from his ship into the air into the distance in the frozen wastes of the North pole and it grows into a giant fortress of crystal. He discovers Jor-El has left recordings to teach him of his past and his heritage. Eventually, Clark (now played by Christopher Reeve) finds himself in the great city of Metropolis, as a reporter working for the great newspaper the Daily Planet. He quickly finds himself taken with his fellow reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) who has a insatiable desire to get a story. It is shortly thereafter that Clark dons his alter ego: Superman, complete with an outfit of blue and red tights and a cape to identify himself. The public is taken with this spectacle, as he performs several deeds to help people in distress. Meanwhile, mastermind super villain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has set up shop beneath Grand Central Station and has hatched a devious plan to use two misdirected Nuclear missiles to create a new separate continent for himself.Supeman doesn't play fast and loose with it's characters or his origins. This is very much a traditional Superman story, but presented as to make you believe in the material. Superman is a unique film in wide variety of ways. It adapted the famous Superman character and all his trappings into a believable universe, but it did so without cheapening the character or playing anything silly. Superman is a film that has a tremendous respect for it's source material. And yet, at the same time, it is not afraid to kid with iconic elements of the legendary character. Long before cinema was ""self-aware"" Superman was able to wink at itself without bringing itself down to the level of self-parody (it would take two sequels to reach that sad depth). For example: at a moment where Superman is trying to change into his outfit, he runs up to a phone both, used in previous media sources as Superman's changing room preference, but with modern phone booths the open, small alcove style, Clark merely stops, looks it up and down, and keeps on walking. It is a perfect example of poking fun at itself, but never losing the appropriate respect either.It also offsets some of the Superman traditions with a new take on the villains. Lex Luthor, as realized by Gene Hackman, is evil, for sure, but he also manages to come across as completely in love with himself to the point of providing comedy (A perfect line when he is addressing a henchman ""Do you know what the number 200 has in common between us? It's your weight and my IQ.""). Lex is villainous as necessary, but not so that he isn't able to have some fun with the character. He might very well be the birthplace of the villain that is evil and amusing at the same time. Where the film really works is the romance between Superman and Lois Lane. She is smitten with him, and he with her, and as the two first meet and he takes her on a flight of Metropolis, you can feel the chemistry.Superman has stellar casting; almost everyone is near perfect in their roles. Reeve, an unknown at the time, was discovered after a long talent hunt, and he embodies both Clark Kent and Superman perfectly. He gives Kent just the right amount of ditzyness and uncertainty and then offsets that with Superman's confidence and charisma that he makes it easier to swallow that Lois is unable to tell them apart. Kidder is also great as firebrand Lane, always after her story, but obviously taken with the Man of Steel. Hackman, as previously mentioned, has just the right mix of charm and venom to sell narcissist Lex Luthor. The creators weren't worried exclusively about big names, they found the right people for the job.Everything else, from John Williams classic score, to it's quality visual effects (especially for the time) lead Superman to be a complete success. No other comic adaptation has matched it yet, and it seems difficult to believe any will.",Superman
181,Old Joe,A comic book hero comes to life!,10,8 January 2002,"I am jealous of anyone who was in their teen years when the first Superman movie was released way back in 1978. I was born in that year, but if I could have been born 15 years or so earlier, it would have been terrific. I wish I could have seen Superman, the movie in the Cinema. In my view, this is one of the all-time classics.First of all I will describe what the movie is about. With his home planet Krypton about to destroy itself, Jor-El, sends his only son Kal-El to the planet earth. His ship lands in Smallville, Kansas where Martha and Jonathon Kent adopt the child, they name him Clark. As he grows Clark, discovers he has great powers but can not work out what his destiny is. After his earth Father dies, Clark leaves Smallville to find out who he really is. Clark discovers he is a Superman! So after this, Clark moves to Metropolis and becomes a reporter for the tabloid, The Daily Planet. After the gossip gets around that a man in a blue and red suit can fly, everyone wants to know about him. The public learns he has superpowers like super hearing and X-ray vision. Plus he stands for truth, justice and the American way. But to foil the peaceful plans of Superman, is the brilliant criminal mind, Lex Luthor. Can Superman save the day? Will good triumph over evil? 
The role of Superman is one I will always remember from this series. Christopher Reeve is one of the best finds for the role of Superman. Chris was superb. Whether he acted like the nerdy Clark Kent or as the Man of Steel, it was done to perfection. Scenes like when Clark first meets work colleague Lois Lane or when Superman leaves after being interviewed by Lois Lane and returns to her apartment as Clark Kent. Reeve changed his Clarky nervous way to try and reveal he is Superman. But when he decides not to, Clark steps back in and the transition is done as if Reeve was meant act the double-life of a superhero. I don't know if many people know, but it took many months in a talent search to find the perfect actor to play Superman. Whoever made the choice made the right one, because this role needed the right actor or the film could have been a real disaster.The most famous scene from Superman would have to be when the Man of Steel saves Lois Lane from the helicopter she is about to fall from. As Lois falls Superman catches her. I love the script here. `Easy miss I've got you' says Superman in is stride. Lois then asks in a panic `You've got me, whose got you?' This is one of my favourite scenes from the Superman series.
Well without more cast members Superman wouldn't have been made. Playing Superman's Arch-Enemy and criminal master Lex Luthor, was Gene Hackman. Hackman played the evil Luthor character with charisma just as good as Reeve did for Superman. Then we have Daily Planet's best reporter Lois Lane, portrayed by Margot Kidder. Any number of actresses could have played the role of Lois, yet Kidder was the correct choice. I want also comment about the role of Jor-El, Superman's father played by Legend actor, Marlon Brando. It was flawless. I haven't seen many of his movies, yet his small role in Superman gave the movie tremendous impetuous. I really loved his dramatic character and the way Brando portrayed it; he got it just right.The other credit should go to director of Superman, Richard Donner. I love the way he brought this film to the big screen. For instance, the start where we are watching the young boy reading a comic book was a brilliant way to start this film and I say the credit for this should go to Donner, because I believe he would have wanted to start it in that way. Many of the flying sequences also have the feel of Donner, getting them just the way he wanted them. Unfortunately he did not remain in the director's chair for Superman series and thus some of the later films lacked the class which this one has. Finally the soundtrack of Superman is another part of the film which is known all over the world. The theme is so dominant; it really gets me going. The credit for this needs to go to composer John Williams. It is a powerful piece of music. John also wrote the music for the classic trilogy, Star Wars. All in all, I am a fan of this movie and whether we see a new superman movie in the new millennium, I agree that no-one can replace Reeve as the man of steel or that the new Superman film can be better be than it's original. Sure the film has better chance to shine with the technology that it will have at it's disposal, yet it won't have the same appeal and respect this one deserves.Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10",Superman

Yes it's a little dated and the scene with him turning the earth to go back in time is a little silly but you can't deny how special this film is to Superman fan's.Christopher Reeve is amazing as Superman and still to this day is the best Superman and this and Smallville was what got me into this character and introduced into the world of Comics and Superheroes.Everyone does a brilliant job in this movie Lois Lane played by the late Margot Kidder (R.I.P.) is fantastic and an iconic performance for Lois Lane.This movie is just special to me and so nostalgic and like I said its where I started with comics books and has a child I loved these movies and still do and this what turned me into a comic fan this is beginning.Favourite moment for me is when you finally see the Fortress of Solitude being made and he becomes superman and the amazing scores plays which just inspires hope in any Superman fan.Verdict 9/10 a great superman film yes it has silly moments and is dated but so nostalgic",Superman
185,Sober-Friend,Review of the 3 Hour Edition,8,25 February 2018,"In 2017 Warner Brothers released the much sought after International Television edition to fan approval. It sold more copies than expected (It was back ordered for weeks) and it is a must see for ""SuperFans"". This comic book movie is the best movie that set the standard for all comic book movies. However it is almost insulting. It is one of the best movies of the 1970's and should have been nominated for a slew of Academy Awards. Nobody in this film is miscast or gives a false performance.Now this 3 Hour Version is not my favorite version of the film but it is still great to see. Many scenes in this version or just really scene extensions. I can see why most of the scenes were cut! For example The opening Krypton destruction footage goes on far too long! However this film is still a treasure to see. It is nice to see it in the widescreen format instead of the 4x3 Pan Scan Video that I have had for years! This film holds up 40 years later and most of the effects work better because they are HANDMADE MINIATURES and look for authentic than CGI effects that pollute films of today!This film is all about ""Superman"". How he got to earth and how he saves the day. Powerful & fun film. Much better than all other comic book movies that have been produced since. In fact its miles above them all!",Superman
186,Sober-Friend,I watched this one night and then found out in the morning about Margot Kidder,8,25 May 2018,"To me there is no better comic book movie than ""Superman"". This film set the template and NO OTHER comic book film has come close. In fact most Big Budget Hollywood films never have half the charm as this 1978 film.This film tells us everything about ""Superman"". His real parents and his trip to earth and his earth parents. Once he arrives in Metropolis he lands a job at the ""Daily Planet"" as Clark Kent. He also happens to fall for Lois Lane. Just as quickly Lex Luthor hatches a plan to destroy California in order to monopolise the real estate market.Movie magic at it's best! I want to point out that margot Kidder was the best Lois Lane. She made Lois a modern woman. She made us all fall in love with Superman. It also proves that ""Behind Every Great Man Is A ""Great Woman""",Superman
187,PCC0921,Hollywood Proves a Man Can Fly,8,13 January 2021,"I remember seeing this movie in the theaters as a kid with my Mom and enjoying every minute of it. That hasn't changed too much even today after seeing it probably a dozen times since. It is true that the film has aged a little, but all that really applies to is the special effects, which are still pretty good. One of the big selling points to this movie back in 1978 was the efforts of the filmmakers and the acting of the main character, Christopher Reeve, who proved to us that a man can fly. You can still see that energy in the film even today.There really are no bad points to this film however, there is a reality factor that is lost, especially near the end of the film. I am a firm believer that any film needs to have a strong believability factor in it, even one based on a comic book. That is one of the true magical things that make movies great and if a filmmaker can't pull that off than he/she begins to loose the audience. A good example of this is the train scene, near the end of the film and the controversial reverse earth-rotation scene. There is a lot going on in both of those scenes that is hard to believe, but the overall movie works great.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Superman

189,freaky_dave,The Best of The Best in Super Hero movies,10,2 July 2006,"After seeing the well done Superman Returns, I found myself filled with nostalgia and took a look back at the original 1978 film. I also found myself comparing both films, and even though I enjoyed Superman Returns (I've seen it twice already) I found that the original was superior, and it wasn't because of special effects either. It was because it had more interesting characters, and actually contained more action. Talk about surprises.Christopher Reeve is the iconic Superman. I don't think anybody could ever replace him. Brandon Routh in the new movie was not the problem though. After watching the original film, I discovered that minor characters like Jimmy Olsen and Perry White were much better because they seemed to be more a part of the movie. Even Ned Beatty as Otis was much more interesting as a henchmen of Hackman's Luthor than Spacey's goons. And it must also be said that Margot Kidder was still a much better Lois Lane then Kate Bosworth. Of course like Reeve, I don't think anybody could play the role of Lois Lane like Kidder did.To continue with the other characters, Gene Hackman was a much better Lex Luthor than Kevin Spacey. Maybe it's because Gene Hackman had fun with the role whereas Kevin Spacey does not. Gene Hackman gave Lex Luthor a personality, but Kevin Spacey's Luthor is just grouchy and mean. Of course Spacey did make Luthor a much more evil character, but I still kept wondering where Hackman was to add his tongue in cheek humor to the role.Comparing both films, I found that the Original Superman was much more fun to watch. Yes both films add character depth to the Clark/Superman and Lois story, but the original contained much more action that just zipped along and kept you entertained. Superman Returns was a little slow at times, but upon watching the original film I did not feel even a little bored. Even through there was a long sequence at the beginning of the first film before the excitement in Metropolis, I felt that Donner did all the right things to built the story and suspense in a matter that just kept you glued to your seat waiting for the good stuff. Singer does not have this with his film, and I also didn't like how much he copied from the original film to make the new movie either. I enjoy a nod here and there, but Superman Returns went to far with what it borrowed. It could've used a dose of it's own imagination. Superman the Movie had a lot of this.So my verdict is in. The 1978 Superman the Movie is the better film even though Singer's had better special effects. It also remains at the top of my list of super hero movies, followed very closely by Spiderman 2.",Superman
190,kingofdanerds,The film that set the standard for high quality superhero films,8,11 June 2021,"The 70's were an interesting time for superheroes and TV/movies. We had large numbers of TV shows with different degrees of success but what was common with all of them was that they were silly in nature for the most part and not something that you would take seriously. It would not be until 1978 until we got the first big superhero film, Superman. Superman had a big marketing campaign and a lot of hype was built up for this film and it was warranted. The film was a huge box office success and a huge critical success. The film was directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Superman II, and The Goonies). The film stars Marlon Brando (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, The Island of Dr. Moreau), Gene Hackman (Superman II, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Antz), Christopher Reeve (Superman II, III, and IV), Ned Beatty (Shooter, 1941, Superman II), Margot Kidder (Superman II, III, and IV), and Terrence Stamp (Superman II, The Phantom Menace).The planet of Krypton has been destroyed and the only survivor has made his way to Earth where a family adopts him and he becomes Clark Kent. He learns to live his life with these powers he has and must learn to keep them a secret. After learning who he truly is, he becomes a news reporter and also fights crime as Superman. But there is a villain by the name of Lex Luthor that is threatening to use nuclear devices to destroy part of California.Superman has often been considered to be one of the best superhero movies of all time. I simply do not believe it. I think it is a well made film and looking back, this is where it all started for superhero films. I should note the obvious postives about this film. Starting with the amazing John Williams score for this film. It is grand, epic, and entirely memorable. Instantly recognizable and if you have not had the chance to listen to it yet, I would highly recommend doing so. Next, is the acting and characters. Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent is one of the best casting choices ever made. He plays the role fairly well and gives the character likeability. For many, Christopher Reeve is the only Superman and I would have to agree on that. I honestly prefer Christopher Reeve over any other actor as Superman. The other actors do fantastic in their respective roles here. My only complaint would be Gene Hackman. I don't find him to be entirely believable as the villain and to be fair, this is only something minor. Perhaps it is because he is not the typical bald Lex Luthor we usually see. A good superhero film should be able to balance action and other scenes. The action is fairly good and if you are someone looking back at superhero films in general, it is truly astonishing what they were able to do. That would be all thanks to a fairly large budget which for a film like this, really needed it. It needed something that would further deviate it from the crappy television superhero shows. Now when there is not any action, we have touching scenes between Superman and Lois and whatnot. The scenes for the most part are fine to watch. Some of the scenes will provide laughs for those looking for some humor in their superhero film. Also seeing some chemistry between characters is really nice to watch. The cinematography is truly amazing with some beautiful shots (especially towards the beginning). Now on to the negatives. The special effects for a large part of this film are good. But only a large part. The small part of this film's special effects are not that great. Overall the effects were great for it's time but there are some that are not very good. Towards the end, we have some miniatures that you can clearly tell they are miniatures. This is sad because the film's budget was really huge and to see that this film still has bad effects, is truly shocking. If you do not believe that some of these films effects were not good in 1978, watch the Siskel and Ebert review on Youtube or wherever and see what Gene Siskel has to say. But I won't say that they take away from the overall experience. You have to take into consideration the technology back then and the overall image that the creators had in mind and also what people wanted to see. As already stated, Gene Hackman (for me) is not the most believable as Lex Luthor. The film's run time is about two and a half hours and there are certain parts that do tend to drag the film at times. Lastly, that ending. People who have seen the film know what the ending is and most people defend it without any good reason. All I can say is that it is just plain stupid.Superman is a good film and has great acting, great score, some good special effects, and was a game changer in the superhero genre. But if you asked me, this film is far from perfect.",Superman
191,David_Frames,"""The son of Jor-El, on this planet!""",7,11 November 2006,"Richard Donner showed them all how it should be done when he selflessly accepted a $1M paycheck to helm this definitive adaptation of the then 40 year old DC comic. It's a joyous synthesis if you will (and frankly even if you won't) of old fashioned Hollywood storytelling acumen partnered with technical innovation and a epic neo-romantic soundtrack from John Williams, so satisfying it's like drinking the dream factories' creative juice from a soup tureen.Superman is an aesthetists dream come true  a complementary selection of stylistic sweetmeat from the American filmmaker's buffet. Whether Donners playing with the epic with Krypton's final hours or the intimate in the scenes based during Clarke's formative years in Smallville, the directors assured hand can be felt throughout. By building the film using character actors like Glen Ford & Big Stars like Brando and Hackman to support Reeve's debut in the title role, Donner produced something which felt mythic and grandiose as well as fresh - the inspired casting of Christopher Reeve in particular an indication of how well the director understood his material. It's become almost a truism to say that Reeve IS Superman but a viewing of Singer's recent Superman Returns with Brandon Routh in the title role reminds you how good Donner's choice really was. The man almost bleeds decency as the man of steel but he's no mere hunk of muscle  handsome, intelligent and capable of genuinely differentiating his Clarke Kent from his Superman, Reeve anchors the film in a way that brings the iconic character completely to life. Whereas many other comic book movies opt for the infantile and mere spectacle over substance, Superman takes it time and roots the character in an epic and carefully built narrative that lends the film a huge amount of weight, transcending its bubble gum packaging. The aforementioned John Williams is also perfectly cast  his score is so shockingly good that one can only imagine Donner applauding when he first heard it and John Ottman crying as he reprised it for the latest instalment knowing his own score would be a childlike effort by comparison. Yes, Williams compliments the changes in tone perfectly and creates a theme as large as Superman's mythological status.Of course it isn't perfect but then neither are you so lets not be too judgemental. The ending, historically a point for pause amongst the film's legion of fans is pretty ridiculous and feels like a fudge but Super-saves don't get much bigger than the world been turned backwards to undo a catastrophe even if it is a load of Salkind (and yes the plausibility of real world elements external to the stories sci-fi conceits DOES matter, I don't give a sod what you say  its only by Superman reacting against the real worldly that his powers seems fantastical). It seems mealy to criticise Donner for this though when so much of Superman works perfectly. 30 years on it remains one of the best movies of its kind and considering the volume of competition in the intervening years that's no mean achievement. Super you might say.",Superman
192,Gideon24,A Star was Born as well as a Cinematic Franchise,8,6 March 2015,"The granddaddy of all comic book movies was the 1978 adventure Superman: The Motion Picture, a richly entertaining adventure which follows Marvel Comic's most famous character from his humble beginnings on the planet Krypton, his teen years in Smallville, and his concurrent romance of Lois Lane and battle with criminal mastermind Lex Luthor.Director Richard Donner has crafted a beautiful film that takes a grand adventure and puts some very human faces on it. Donner has crafted a film that envelops us from the beginning with equal doses of suspense, laughs, romance, terror, and warmth.Marlon Brando received top-billing, even though he only appears in a few scenes as Jo-rel, Superman's father. Then unknown Christopher Reeve turns in a star-making performance as Clark Kent/Superman and, if the truth be known, his nerdy and clutzy Kent is the most charming part of his performance. Margot Kidder revived a comatose career with the emotional spitfire she created in Lois Lane and she creates stupid chemistry with Reeve. Gene Hackman beautifully underplays as Lex Luthor and gets solid support from Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty as his mistress and stooge.The film has state of the art special effects (for 1978) and became an instant classic that spawned three sequels and countless imitations and re-inventions, but this is the original and it still has enormous re- watch appeal.",Superman

He plays Clark Kent as nerdy and shy and plays Superman as heroic and wondrous. This is a role he is still remembered for today. Simply put, Reeve IS Superman. He is so much better than Brandon Routh it isn't even funny.We also have a superb supporting cast. Margot Kidder is wonderful as Lois Lane, Clark Kent's love interest. Her chemistry with Christopher Reeve really clicked. Gene Hackman plays Lex Luthor with aplomb.

The action and excitement in the film will keep your eyes glued to the screen.The movie may be 2 and a half hours long, but it's so perfectly paced that you don't even notice.Aside from a few unintentionally cheesy moments and some dated special effects, everything in this movie works.

194,BrickNash,A great film which has unfortunately aged badly,7,13 May 2012,"Just to start off I'd like to state that I am possibly the biggest fan of the Reeve Superman films. This was my childhood from as early as I can remember and I still watch them to this very day.The concept for this film was nothing short of epic and director Dick Donner pulls out all the stops to deliver the goods and for the most part he pulls it off.Probably Donner's most inspired choice was in the casting of the magnificent Chris Reeve. Reeve is a proper actor, flexible and convincing in almost everything he does and in this his character acting shines through as he plays the dual roles of the heroic Superman and the bungling Clark Kent. Gene Hackman also provides a wonderfully colurful villain in Lex Luthor. The production of the film is as big as you could get for the time and you can tell that meticulous detail was taken to shoot every scene.Unfortunately this is where the praise slows down. The problem is that the entire film is just too slow. The opening scenes in Krypton and Smallville are wonderful, dramatic and extremely touching but the whole film takes a major downfall when we enter Metropolis. Superman does very few actual heroic deeds and there just seems to be a lot of talking in between. The epic drama was great for the origin at the start but the rest needs much more meat and the lack of a proper physical foe in favour of disasters really doesn't deliver. The other problem is that the film is a product of it's time. I have absolutely no doubt that Dick Donner and the whole cast and crew did the most cutting edge work that they could, but the reality is that the level of effects that Superman needs to be convincing just didn't exist in 1977. Even as a child I could see it was a screen behind the actors when they flew. Another problem is that the film absolutely reeks of the 70's. The dialogue, the mood and the blatant fashons stand out like an embarrassing sore thumb and in places make the film look cheap and a bit tacky. In saying all this, the crew did an absolutely stunning job with what they had and it's still a great film, but it's a great film which has aged badly.If you are going to watch this film, watch the uncut version which has more scenes and a bit more action in it.",Superman
195,Ibuk,Super in every way,9,21 July 2008,"Though I prefer Superman 2 to the original the original is still a superb comic adaptation. Even though I didn't see it on the big screen(I was born a coupe of years later) I had it on cassette when I was a child which I eventually wore out because I watched it so much. Funnily enough I was a bigger fan of The Incredible Hulk than Superman but that didn't stop me loving the Superman movies. It was only a couple of months ago when I was browsing through my local videostore when the boxset of Superman 1 and 2 caught my eye and decided I had to buy it. After watching them both I can say they haven't dated one bit. For its time Superman was a very expensive project and you can see why, the special effects are outstanding and still look terrific even today in the days of CGI. Then there was the cast, Marlon Brando(he demanded a very grand sum for a small part as Jor El),Trevor Howard,Gene Hackman and Glenn Ford. I didn't mention Christopher Reeves and Margot Kidder in the previous sentence because they weren't huge stars before it but Superman gave them their big break but borh would never get success again after Superman. The theme tune by John Williams is one of my favourites along with Star Wars,Raiders of the lost ark and Jurrasic Park. Superman was the first movie adaptation of a comic book superhero(not counting the campy made for TV Batman) and paved the way for other Superhero adaptations, for instance Batman(1989), X Men, Spiderman and many more. It is a real shame that Superman 3, Superman 4 and Superman Returns could not match the brilliance of the first two. Superman brings back very fond memories of a pleasant childhood and can still be enjoyed and appreciated by the younger generation who didn't grow up with the Superman movies.",Superman
196,LuboLarsson,A Classic,9,31 March 2002,"Superman the Movie is a brilliant film, which has probably been tainted by the poor third and fourth films in the series. The original is usually the best, and I certainly think thats the cas with the Superman series. The effects are fabulous for the time, remember this was before CGI and they were groundbreaking when the film was made, Christopher Reeve is fabulous in his dual role, Margot Kidder is the best Lois Lane ever and Gene Hackman puts in a great performance as Lex Luthor. John Williams music for Superman is probably his best ever and thats saying something! Get the DVD to appreciate the film in full. *** 9/10 ***",Superman

He is raised by earthy parents who know of his special powers.Eventually Clark Kent(superman ) played by Christopher Reeve. leave home to find out his destiny. Kent travels to metropholis and the daily planet. Kent takes a job here as a reporter. Meanwhile,Lex luther played by the brillant Gene Hackman is plotting to destroy California with a massive earthquake. Superman finds out of his plot and attempts to stop him. The suspense builds during the earthquake sequence as you wonder who lives or dies. The special effects are great considering it was made 20 years ago.

So Louis the smoker is worth more than all the hundreds of lives he decided not to save after reversing time.Great logic.",Superman
199,cosmorados,This is no fantasy! No careless product of wild imagination!,8,13 July 2008,"The trial of three villains on the planet Krypton is the unusual start for this movie and introduces us to the legendary statesman and scientist Jor-El trying the three criminals, giving us a glimpse of his level of oratory and intellectual skills as he puts the case to the council in nothing but damning terms. After they are cast into the phantom zone Jor-El has a further battle on his hands, which is that to convince the council that the planet's red sun is about to go Nova, sadly this is the battle that he loses, and after promising that neither he nor his wife would leave Krypton, hands a death sentence to him and his wife. He is determined however that his son will not endure a similar fate.After sending his son in a rocket ship to earth the sun explodes and the planet is destroyed. The rocket sustains Jor-El's son Kal'El for the three year journey till he lands in Smallville in Kansas and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. This boy does not become Superman, and this is the strength of the movie, for this boy becomes Clark Kent, and it is Clark that makes Superman, his sense of decency and moral compass is created by Jonathan Kent and after Clark leaves Kansas and heads north to create the fortress of solitude, the visage of Jor-El fills him in on the startling truth of his heritage.After about what seems to be 10 years Clark heads back to Metropolis in order to take up his place at a great metropolitan newspaper and become the hero we know he is, tackling disasters fighting crime and meeting his arch nemesis, Lex Luthor. This is the movie that largely started the superhero genre, and when I say that I mean the superhero movie with a big budget, great script and great cast.The unknown Christopher Reeve is magnificent as both Clark and Superman and his performance is perfect as he switches effortlessly between the two characters. Marlon Brando is exquisite as Jor-El and his turn as Jor-El may not be worth what the studio paid for it but it is still a very fine performance, but the big scene stealer here is Gene Hackman, who is delicious as the evil and malevolently greedy Luthor, who regards Superman as little more than inconvenient muscle. His dialogue is terrific and performs it with relish and gusto that grants it so much more weight than it had on the page.The direction is excellent and the John Williams score is yet another one of those at the time which displayed the full range of his amazing abilities with the opening score being the most obvious highlight, but the best moment being the music work when Lex first speaks to Superman in the daily planet, listen well, the music work here is extraordinary and gorgeous.That said the only spoilers for me are some dodgy effects moments and the Lois Lane poem on her ride with Superman, which is really lame. Other than that it's still a film that has largely stood the test of time. Still worth a view.",Superman
200,droog-56936,It's A Bird! It's A Plane! It's Major Movie Superman!,7,21 September 2019,The movie that started it all. At long last a proper superhero blockbuster Superman changed the way the big movie studios thought of the comic book genre. At times clunky and lacking a villain with gravitas it seems a bit kitschy but the scenes on Keypton featuring Marlon Brando as Superman's father Jor El still stand up today.,Superman
201,Solnichka,I can't believe this film doesn't get more love ...,10,4 July 2006,"This is an amazing film, from start to finish. Twenty-eight years later, as the new attempt at Superman hits the theaters, this film is still the platinum standard of excellence in comic book visualization.From the opening scenes on Krypton (is there any better threat ever issued than the one from Zod?) with Marlon Brando -- in one of his most underrated contributions to film lore, I might add -- to the Daily Planet and the underground world of Lex Luthor, the film just shines. It paces well, looks good even today, and the acting is as good as it comes.The dialogue stands out to me in this film; there are so many great one-liners, I have found myself over the years using them and dropping them in casual conversation in social settings (""Otisburg?""). Gene Hackman just oozes perfect as Lex Luthor in this film; taken as a stand-alone performance -- not factoring in his other turns as Luthor in the sequels -- it may be one of Hackman's best. And he's got a lot of good ones.The weakest part of the film to me is Margot Kidder; she was too much of a chain-smoking sleaze for me, and whether that's fair or not, oh well. The character may be the problem, and I'm just blaming poor Margot for it, although her later personal problems haven't helped my perspective, either.",Superman

203,RCWjr,Set the standard for all comics to film,10,26 June 2006,"This film was the first to capture the elements of the comic that drew people to the character in the first place. Donner and company gave us a fantastic piece of pop culture here.Reeve through the bit players all bring to life characters beloved by many. The TV series was extremely popular in its day. I think the film captured what the TV series did right and gave the overall story a much needed updating to make the character ""cool"" again.I remember being excited about seeing this film in theaters when it came out in 1978. After Star Wars the previous year, the bar had been raised on effects. Superman delivered and I truly believed that a man could fly.",Superman
204,chucknorrisfacts,It's a classic!,7,19 June 2010,"In 1978, Richard Donner directed ""Superman"", an action-adventure/fantasy about the iconic DC Comics character starring Christopher Reeve as the titular character, Margot Kidder as love interest, Lois Lane and Gene Hackman as the Man of Steel's nemesis, Lex Luthor.As a lifelong comic book fan, I have many fond memories of watching this movie as a child. I've watched it many times over the years and I still think it holds up well despite being over thirty years old.The beginning is absolutely flawless. Here's what was done right: Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Even though Brando was ill-prepared for the shoot, reportedly refusing to learn his lines, reading them from cue cards hidden off-camera, Brando turns in an impressive performance. Obviously, impressive enough where Warner Bros. didn't feel the need to recast for the role for 2006's dud, ""Superman Returns"".Other spot-on moments from the beginning of the film include: Kal-El's escape from the doomed planet Krypton, the planet's eventual destruction, his ship crash landing on Earth and its discovery by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who would become Kal-El's adoptive parents and would rename him Clark Kent. Clark's time growing up on the Kent farm and going to Smallville High clear up through Jonathan's death and Clark's decision to leave his mother, Martha, and the farm to fulfill his destiny, was done to absolute perfection.Unfortunately, the movie is unable to sustain that same level of perfectionism. The movie starts to feel a little campy as it goes on. I blame this mostly on how the character of Lex Luthor was written and how harebrained his evil scheme is. No offense to actor Gene Hackman, I think he's a great actor but was, in my opinion, a lousy Lex Luthor. Ned Beatty's character of ""Otis"" wasn't any better.Christopher Reeve's performance, on the other hand, was amazing. He manages to effectively play both Clark Kent AND Superman, that's not an easy task! I'd say most could get away with playing one or the other but not both. Reeve makes it seem possible that people could be tricked into thinking Clark Kent and Superman are not one in the same by how masterfully and distinctly different he portrays each.Overall, I'd still say I enjoy the movie, however it is different to watch it as an adult than it is to watch it as a kid. You're not able to suspend your disbelief quite so much and the hokey villains don't help. However, Reeve more than makes up for it and that's why I still think it's a great movie and definitely worth checking out. It pretty much paved the way for all superhero films to follow it. It's a classic!",Superman
205,possumopossum,Not Bad,7,28 August 2007,"Christopher Reeves even looked the part. That's the first thing I thought when I saw this movie. Very impressive. The show has a sense of humor without being over the top about it like the BATMAN television show and the Joel Schumacher films. (My favorite line from the film is when a burglar is climbing up the wall of a high rise building and Superman meets him halfway up and says, ""Is there something wrong with the elevator?"" Very Eastwoodesque. (By the way, didn't they once ask Clint Eastwood to play Superman? Seems like I remember hearing somewhere that they did.) And the music by John Williams. Man, oh man! John Williams and Ennio Morricone are the greatest composers alive. I could listen to that driving theme all day. Coupled with those great graphics in the title sequence and you've really got something to watch and hear.My biggest gripe is Lex Luthor. I know I'm going against the flow here, but I really don't think Gene Hackman makes a good Lex Luthor. He's a great actor and I liked him in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and UNFORGIVEN, but not as Lex Luthor. They also made him look more like a clown rather than a dangerous criminal mastermind. Wasn't Yul Brynner still alive back then? If so, they should have cast him as Lex Luthor. Hackman does seem to have fun and he gives it his all, I'll give him that much.I also don't like the way they introduced Luthor's character. (Lex Luthor with hair? Even if it's a wig? WRONG, O GREAT AND MIGHTY KRYPTONITE BREATH!!!!!) I seem to recall as a kid reading a comic where Lex Luthor and Superman were both foster children of Johnathan and Martha Kent. Lex was a boy genius, but the Kents kicked him out of their house when he turned to a life of crime. Don't know if that was really a story or if I dreamed that, but I think it would have been very interesting if they had incorporated that into this movie. I also thought the way Clark changed into Superman was kind of lame. Jumping out a window and his Clark suit melts off and he is in his Superman costume? I don't think so. Everybody in New York City (excuse me, Metropolis) saw that. So much for a secret identity. Otherwise, a very good movie. This began a time of optimism in movies that, at least in the seventies, the movies were clouded with confusion and pessimism. I'll give this 7 out of 10.",Superman
206,rcolgan,It's still a timeless classic,8,16 May 2014,"Currently we live in the age of the Superhero. Every summer there's always a box office hit like Dark Knight or The Avengers that we'll all want to see with comic book films being the modern epics of cinema. But before Joss Whedon formed the avengers, before Raimi brought the web slinger to motion and even before Burton brought the Batman to the big screen, Richard Donner was the first to bring superheroes to the screen in epic form with the 1978 smash hit Superman.There were others beforehand such as the 1966 Batman, but this was the first major comic book success on the big screen. One of the main reasons for this is that it was the first time Hollywood was treating comic books seriously. Whilst films like Batman were funny, Superman was the first Superhero film to tap the potential of the comics, largely because of the great writing in the film with the likes of Mario Puzo focusing on bringing the comics to the big screen maintaining the epic character in all his greatness.The writing nails all the key aspects of the character in the film. They maintain his godlike powers, but at the same time still show there are limits to his powers as well, as we do see him go through struggles throughout the film. But more importantly he maintains Superman's perfect ideals throughout the film showing just how far he'll go to saving every life and making it his duty to protect all from a cat in a tree to stopping an earthquake he has to do it all.But obviously not all the credit goes to the writers to bringing the character to life, with Christopher Reeve doing nothing short of bringing the epic character to life on screen. It's one of those truly great times when the role has been perfectly cast. He even looks just like the comics with the right face and muscles to look just like the last son of Krypton. Plus when he's Clarke Kent he has an entirely different presence on screen, successfully demonstrating his knowledge of the character. Then there's the finer details such as the way he majestically flies through the air is really an awesome sight.It's also a real testament to the effort put in to the film that a lot of the special effects that went in to the film still hold up pretty well today. Largely because there's a certain beauty in the way Superman flies. One of the best examples is a classic one shot take in the film where Superman flies off screen and Clarke Kent walks back on. Whilst it is awesome to see the bullet speed Man of Steel, it can't be denied that there is something so iconic about how Superman flies in the film which helps it to really stand the test of time.That's not to say everything in the film still holds up well today. For example, Lois Lane's character is now pretty annoying. She's a mixture of 3 personalities. Being rude and obnoxious for no good reason, being love struck for superman and being a screaming victim. Seriously, I'd bet that if you were to cut together all her scenes in the film she'd spend around a third of her time doing nothing but screaming... There's also some of the comedy between Luthor and Otis. It's funny but it seems out of place more belonging in a Laurel and Hardy sketch then a Superman film. Also it seems odd that Luthor would keep a henchman who repeatedly screws up time and time again.Then there's the end of the film with Superman literally turning back time by spinning the earth backwards. Yeah, out of all the film this is the part that doesn't hold up well. Partly because of the lack of logic (if it happened we'd all probably just fly off the earth) but also because it gets the ideology wrong as not even Superman can do everything. But it's also laughably ludicrous and unnecessary making it by far the weakest part of the film.But overall there is no denying that Superman not only stands as one of the first Superhero movies, but also as one of the best. Just like any film, some parts have become outdated over time. But the finished product remains one of the greatest of the superhero genre and a timeless classic that should live on through the generations.",Superman
207,clydestuff,"Superman may fly, but much of this movie is grounded in caricatures",6,1 August 2004,"Before the Man of Steel hit the big screen back in the seventies, courtesy of Producer Illya Salkind, Director Richard Donner, and Warner Brothers, we were assured that we would believe a man could fly.  I am not one to doubt studio promotions, but just like everybody else I was game to find out if it was so.  Did I come out of Superman: The Movie believing that indeed the son of Jor-el also known as Kal-el also known as Superman also known as Clark Kent could take to the airways without benefit of plane, hot air balloon, rocket pack, or zeppelin?   Nahhh...of course not, but Christopher Reeve looked a lot better faking it then any of his predecessors such as George Reeve and Kirk Alyn.   The truth is that Superman: The Movie has a whole lot going for it besides the flight abilities of Reeve.  It also has a multitude of things that work against it.Unless you're some kind of a vampire who has been locked away in a casket for the past hundred years or so, you pretty much know the story.  The Planet Krypton which has a Red Sun was spinning around out there in the far reaches of space somewhere.  Jor-el (Marlon Brando) had come to the conclusion that Krypton was going to explode wiping out all Kryptonians. Unable to convince anyone else of his findings, and not having a spaceship available that would carry him and Mrs. Kal-el (Susannah York), he packed up his only begotten son Kal-el along with his pampers and blasted him off towards Earth.  Since Earth has a yellow sun, this would somehow increase the density of Kal-el, giving him super powers far beyond anybody but the publishers of DC comics could ever imagine.  After being adopted by a farm couple known as Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter & Glenn Ford), Kal-el became young Clark Kent.  Later in life he took a job as an ace reporter at the Daily Planet ran by Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper), which he used as a secret identity until he was needed to get down and get funky in his identity of Superman, protector of truth, justice and the American way.   It was at the Daily Planet that he met the love of his life, Ace Reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder).  Lois had the hots for Superman too as long as he was Superman and not Clark Kent.  When he was Clark, Lois wouldn't be caught dead in a Honeymoon Suite at Niagara Falls with him.  But that's another story, as you well know.Before dispensing with the well known back story, Superman opens with a sequence where three criminals are banished into The Phantom Zone in order to set up Superman II.  You just have to give it props for that instead of waiting until just before the credits role to tack on the obligatory sequel setting end as most film makers have a penchant for doing.  Of course it helps when you know for sure there's going to be a number 2 before your number one makes it onto the big screen.   Marlon Brando is okay as Jor-el but I can never seem to shake the feeling that I'm watching Brando in a white wig our forefathers would themselves have been proud to wear, and his delivery amounts to giving some kind of lecture to the Continental Congress. Krypton itself is not at all like one would imagine having read the comics, as it is displayed here as some kind of eternal homage to cubic zirconium.  It's pretty to look at but has no substance.This movie version doesn't spend much time with Clark as a boy, but they are some of the best moments in the film in spite of the fact that Jeff East who plays young Clark had his dialog dubbed by Reeve.   Other than near the end of the film, it's the only time the film shows some real heart regarding Superman or anyone else in it.  One almost hated to see Superman/Clark grow up.In the comics that I grew up with in the sixties, Clark was always portrayed to be somewhat of a coward by Superman, in order to help protect his secret identity.  In Superman: The Movie, Reeve's Clark is not only a ""girly man"" but is pretty much a bumbling idiot.  While it strikes much more of a contrast between Clark and Superman, it is overplayed and overdone to the point that it ends up making us dread the moments when Superman does become Clark.  That being said, when Reeve does put on his cape and takes flight, his portrayal as Superman is without peer.I don't have much of a problem with Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane as it seems to be right on the mark as the character was written for her. The problem is not with her characterization but not for one minute do we believe in Superman's sudden infatuation with her or why he is even attracted to her.  The only concern Lois seems to have is where is her next big story coming from and how long it is till her next cigarette.  She seems to be the epitome of a liberated woman, so the fact that she would suddenly go ga-ga over Superman doesn't quite hold water even if he does take time out to rescue her early in the picture, and later give her flying lessons. The relationship is never developed in a way that makes any sense at all.Gene Hackman is way over the top also as Lex Luthor but at least he does it with a bit of style and fun.  Not so Ned Beatty who plays his henchman Otis. Otis is supposed to be comic relief, but the only relief you'll get is if you pop a couple of antacids in order to be able to stomach the character. We do not for one minute believe that Lex Luther would keep a total dunce such as Otis around for any reason, as there would just have to be less excruciatingly painful criminals in Metropolis willing to run errands for him.  The character of Otis is more than just an annoyance as every scene he is in drags the story down to a mediocre level.  Valerie Perrine's Miss Teschmacher is kind of a dumb bulb also, but her character is at least kept in check to the point where she is even likeable.  And alas, just as most of the characters are in this film, Perry White is played by Jackie Cooper as a simple minded goof ball.What is good about Superman are the flying sequences.  As a matter of fact when Superman is zooming around performing various rescues ranging from a cat to a president and capturing criminals, the film as a whole takes flight.  The special effect all around are well done, especially Superman's rescue of Lois from a helicopter, and later as he races around California to repair the damage being done during an Earthquake.  The scenes where he takes to the sky with Lois for a romantic interlude are almost lyrical.
John Williams give us another one of his no holds bar musical scores.  Its well done for this kind of film, and apparently the producers and director thought so too as it plays over top of some of the longest running opening and closing film credits known to man.  In other words, when the film starts you'll have plenty of time to still pop another batch of popcorn, run to the bathroom and make it back to your recliner before we come close to reaching the planet Krypton.Besides Otis, the biggest problem with Superman: The Movie comes near the end.  In order to resolve a plot situation which if left as it was would have caused major problems for the subsequent sequel, the writer, director or somebody has Superman perform a stunt that reeks of lazy film making.  It opens a plot hole as wide and as deep as the Grand Canyon.  Usually in a film based on a comic book character, one can overlook such devices, but this one is so glaring and obvious in its ineptitude that it one will be forced to mumble a certain word pertaining to bull droppings.  I haven't felt this cheated since my first girlfriend dumped me for another guy.Superman: The Movie is highly watchable in many aspects.  With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen, it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time. Unfortunately, when you can only make me think of what might have been or could have been, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Superman: The Movie is a C+.",Superman

209,jwpeel-1,The Man Of Steel in the flesh - you will believe a man can fly,9,31 July 2004,"This is the first truly great superhero movie. I still remember the chills and excitement of just knowing the movie was about to be made when I first heard the news in the late 1970s. And right up to the very moment I was waiting in line at that New York theater when I heard people who were peaking in for a glimpse of the movie saying how ""he"" (Christopher Reeve) looked exactly like the Superman in the comics.Just about everything in the film work from a different from those happy audience viewers, and even after having seen it just tonight, is still hold up so beautifully. From little touches like the sight gag of the phone stall instead of a booth (Superman, in the old Max Fleischer cartoons since into his red and blue types in a booth, and it became a great cliché) to the initial rescue of Lois Lane and those fabulous Krypton scenes with Marlon Brando as Jor-el, this is an epic motion picture.For years, I proudly coveted my commercial edited copy from ABC television with the outtakes featuring Noel Neill and Kirk Alyn, and I even taped the seemingly, never-ending end credits from the first HBO showing so I wouldn't have to hear ads for other ABC television programs every time I watched it. Now, I am glad to own the DVD with all of those scenes intact.It is such a shame that Richard Donner didn't get to work on the second film, which so many people find superior to the first, but I find a mess. Okay, maybe I'm a purist, but I don't recall Superman ever having the power to take away someone's memory with a kiss, and too many of the special effects seemed cheesy and obvious... and I won't even get into the bad script.The biggest shame about this picture is that the actor Jeff East, who played the teenage Clark Kent, never got to play Superboy. I truly loved seeing Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxton as George and Martha Kent and the Smallville scenes were some of the truly great moments in cinema history.Christopher Reeve will always be the first true superhero on film, but I was upset with his commentary on George Reeves's padding on the old TV series. George Reeves will forever be the very best caped crusader from the planet Krypton. But tell a Christopher Reeve was a great 70s Man Of Steel.Long before the Marvel superheroes got their due on the silver screen, this film made comic book heroes big, big, BIG box office.

210,moviemattb,A Film That Made Us Believe That A Man Can Fly,10,6 September 2015,"Before there was Spider-Man. Before there was the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and before there was Batman; as well as any other comic book movies that were made. There was a movie that putted the test of its time for comic book movies throughout the decades, and that movie was called the one and only ""Superman."" This was the first ""Superman"" movie that started it all before the sequels, and the two reboots. Not including the movie serials from the forties because I'm more concern on Hollywood's own attempt on making a Superman movie that was taken seriously. Also, making it look like that this was the real deal. The movie tells the origin story of Superman as he was born on a distant planet called Krypton, where Jor-El sends his infant baby son Kal-El to Earth as Krypton is about to be destroy. So, Kal-El goes by the name Clark Kent as he was raised by the Kents (Earth parents) in Smallville, and then moves on to Metropolis as he gets a job at the Daily Planet. So now you have Lex Luthor, who wants to make his own ""land"" while Lois Lane needs savings, and the list goes on and on. You already know the story, so why go into much detail? Because you know the movie from beginning to end. I know the character of Superman, but never was that much of a fan as I was a fan of Batman. As time goes by, I now am a fan of Superman and nothing more that I can say about. This is such a wonderful movie, as both the cast and crew had made such an achievement to make a movie about a man that can fly from the comics, and transform it into a movie on an epic scale. Richard Donner was able to make this movie as it was all done taken seriously, but also having the joy and excitement which it makes this movie very entertaining to watch; very talented that Donner is, and should be most proud of on making this movie. The story is perfectly told as we see Superman going from being a baby boy; a teenager and now becoming the Man of Steel. I love the look of the film, as it was all done on such an epic level and not have it watered down. Aside from Hans Zimmer's music from ""Man of Steel,"" which I do say that it is brilliant but John Williams' music really soars beautifully, and I really love the theme that he created. The special effects are still impressive, before technology has change by using computers; it was such a big task on how to make Superman fly, and the special effects team did such a believable job on making us believe that Superman can fly. Sure there are one or two parts that don't hold up, but I still believe that the effects are impressive. The film is filled with such a great cast of actors and actresses that are believable to bring their roles to life. Marlon Brando was absolutely great as Jor-El, while Gene Hackman is very good to play Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder really did such an outstanding job to play Lois Lane. Of course, she is the damsel in distress and there is nothing for me to complain about. At least, Lois Lane's characterization was changed from being a damsel in distress to a woman that is actually doing something in ""Man of Steel."" Before I admired Henry Cavill's and Brandon Routh's interpretation, I really love Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman. He really captures that role perfectly, and he will always be remember as Superman. The movie does go at a really good pace, and I really enjoy for its wondrous moments. The movie is more of a character based, and less of an action movie. I know there is action, but its not like what ""Man of Steel"" did; so its pretty much all done in a traditional way. The ending where Superman turns time back does not annoyed me, nor about the whole glasses issue that no one can identify that Clark Kent is Superman. I know this movie very well enough, and it still continues to be a wonderful movie. I am giving ""Superman"" a 10 out of 10.",Superman
211,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,A Great Example of a Superhero Film,8,23 June 2019,"Review:
'Superman' (1978) is a film deserving of praise better than a 7.4 rating on this site. While it is campy and silly: it's still the best film in the Superman franchise without a doubt. And without a doubt, still one of DC's best films. My praises are your praises, Christopher Reeve was an excellent choice to play Superman. He looks just like the caped Kryptonian, and knows how to play the part. And the film does an excellent of telling this character's story.From the start of his origin, to his romance with Lois Lane, to the start of his days as the Man of Steel. This film gives us what is possibly the best version of this iconic origin story. One thing I love about this version, is that Lois is a damsel in distress, but is still a likable character, and not some airhead, like she was depicted in earlier Superman related media. And the romance between Clark and Lois still remains as the best romance story across all superhero films. I don't even have to talk about the endlessly iconic flying scene, that in my opinion, beats the upside down kiss in 'Spider-Man' (2002).The effects for the time, were amazing, and while they don't hold up today, you can tell they were amazing back then. They said, ""You'll believe a man can fly"", and they didn't lie. And for it's influence on the history of these kinds of effects, I have to praise it in this category.Many may call this silly, or say it's not as good as you remember. Or other films have gone beyond this one. But I think this film's just as amazing as it was back in 1978, when it was originally released to theaters all over the world. This is not only one of my absolute favorite comic book films, it's one of my absolute favorite films.",Superman
212,frankwhat,"Good, But Not That Good",6,15 December 2004,"This is a movie that could easily and effectively be turned into a successful remake. One message to all the counterparts of CGI out there should watch this because it could've easily been saved had the special effects been somewhat comprehensible. The other big complaint I have about this movie is that the villains are too incompetent to be scared of. I mean they were like the complete opposite of evil and were seemed more of a comedy relief than anything else. Without real bad guys there was a big hole where I could sense immediately that the storyline would fall flat before the big finale. Gene Hackman and even Ned Beatty are so much better than they appeared in this...it really did them no justice. I also don't see what the big deal about Christopher Reeve was either. I mean yes he's tall and he's good looking but I wasn't amazed with his acting at all. They talk about how much he worked out and everything but the plain and simple truth is that he didn't even get that big compared to the bodybuilders of today. Unless they're all on steroids now which could very well be true.Final Flight:Movies: Maybe back in the day.DVD Purchase: Didn't enjoy it.Rental: Yes, but once was plenty!",Superman
213,japamo,"Respect the ""S"", Respect It!",8,17 July 2012,"Boy, how can I write an original review of ""Superman: The Movie""? Just about everyone knows about this guy: where he's from, what he can do, what makes him tick. If somehow you don't know, ""Superman: The Movie"" will spell it out for you. I guess the best I can do is focus upon how our love and need for ""Superheroes"" is stronger than our urge to insult them.Of all the things in the world to satirize, you would think superheroes would be among the easiest. Come on, vain, self-important, overconfident, naive jerks wearing colored underwear running around getting into trouble while fighting bad people and stopping bad things from happening (and all without getting paid)? What a joke! And yet, in my opinion, when movie directors take a satirical approach to a superhero movie, they usually turn out an unmemorable, unsuccessful product. Why? I think it's because, deep down, we want to believe in and respect superheroes and their admirably unselfish goal to make the world a better place.This is why ""Superman: The Movie"" (hereafter STM) got it right. Especially in our cynical times, it is sort of tempting to make merciless fun of a near-perfect demigod who really does care for all people and fights ceaselessly to protect them. STM does not. Yeah, it needles some aspects of the Superman mythos (e.g. telephone booths you can't fit into, Clark not even feeling the collision of a taxi that gets damaged, Lex Luthor's elaborate real estate plot, Lex Luthor's inept henchman Otis), but it does so with gentle kidding. Instead, STM takes the time to introduce Superman from the beginning, from his origins on Krypton to his interactions with the Daily Planet staff and especially his offbeat romance with the flinty, independent Lois Lane. We learn more about Superman than just the ""Super"" part - his wonderful powers, abilities, and weaknesses. We learn about the ""man"" part too - his values, his objectives, his hopes, his fears, and his kind, courageous heart.Superman has been called the ""Man of Steel"", but he has also been called ""The Man of Tomorrow"", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures. I think STM acknowledges this, and hints that all the action, special effects, adventure, and battles of any superhero movie are meaningless unless we respect and believe in the ""S"" - not just Superman, but also the ""S"" we all potentially have underneath.",Superman

Of course Gene Hackman is excellent playing the evil Lex Luthor. I also liked Ned Beatty as the bumbling Otis. John Williams did an outstanding composing for the film and theme song.

There is no other superhero movie that even comes close to the glory of superman other than of course, Nolan's Batman. This show brings another reality into this reality, and sucks you into it. Its not far fetch and outlandish.",Superman
217,glenn-aylett,The best film of the seventies,10,30 January 2021,"I've seen Superman numerous times since it was first released in England in 1979 and never tire of the film/ I( Also it was the first film I was allowed to see unaccompanied, so has another reason to watch for me). In a decade where the film industry was dominated by cynical anti heroes, Superman stood out as he was a real hero with no personality flaws.I think the main reason I enjoy Superman is for someone who was born after the 1950s television series and only had very vague memories of the late 1960s cartoon series, it was a perfect introduction to how Kal El from Krypton became Clark Kent and Superman, and I enjoy the early years in Smallvillle where he grows up and develops his special powers, such as racing against an express train and lifting his parents truck to replace a wheel.While I won't go into great detail about the plot, as most fans will know this( Lex Luthor buys up worthless land in the Californian desert and steals an ICBM to wipe out the west coast of California, so his land will soar in value), it is an idea typical of self styled Lex Luthor, the self named criminal genius and recurring foe of Superman. Also Luthor is played brilliantly by Gene Hackman, who portrays Luthor as a witty, sharp dressed and very intelligent master criminal who thinks nothing of killing millions of people to prove his criminal genius and enrich himself..Indeed Superman is brilliantly cast throughout. The then little known Christooher Reeve switches effortlessly from his role as the bumbling, hapless Clark Kent to a very convincing Superman. ( Reeve trained for several months under Dave Prowse to achieve the correct physique for the role). Margot Kidder, again not very well known in 1978, is excellent as Lois Lane, portraying her as a fearless, tough and liberated woman( similar to the comic books) who nevertheless falls for Clark/ Superman. Special mentions have to be given to some of the star names in the film, such as Marlon Brando as Superman's father on Krypton, Glenn Ford as his stepfather and Ned Beatty's role as Luthor's inept henchman, Otis, who adds some comedy to the film.However, the main reason for watching are the special effects and the sets. The earthquake scenes in California, where a dam bursts and the Golden Gate Bridge starts to collapse, are as good as anything from the CGI era. Then Lex Luthor's hideout under Metropolis deserves a special mention. An abandoned railway station similar to the former Pennsylvania Station or the Great Hall at the old Euston station in London that serves as Luthor's headquarters, the set designers and craftsmen at Pinewood Studios really worked hard to make this set look authentic. No surprises when Superman was nominated for an Oscar for its special effects and set design as these are the best things in the film and have never dated, even after 42 years.Overall in terms of casting, plot, special effects and set design, Superman has never been beaten, until a sequel was released in 1980 that was just as good and followed on from the early scenes in Superman, where General Zod and his two followers are banished from Krypton for treason and end up on earth.",Superman
218,phillafella,Truly Remarkable Masterpiece.,9,23 June 2003,"SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE may as well be the greatest DC Comics superhero movie adaptation ever made.  It is filled with fun and excitement.  Christopher Reeve gives an outstanding performance as the Man of Steel, and Margot Kidder is very impressive as Lois Lane.  Gene Hackman is excellent as arch villain Lex Luther.  The effects are fantastic and the story is quite amazing.  Despite its length, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE never gets boring or dated.  This is the Superman movie to see.5 out of 5",Superman
219,mwcrunner,"Pretty good here, but didn't get how Superman could reverse time",6,28 April 2016,"This was the first time I've ever seen this movie about Superman and I know a lot of people grew up with this and enjoyed it, but I just don't get the ending to this film. How can Superman reverse time when he actually hasn't done it in the comics? I mean Superman reverses time in order to save the world and his girlfriend Lois Lane and defeat Lex Luthor. If there was actually a comic of Superman reversing time, the ending to this film would've made a whole lot more sense. I mean the Flash can travel through time back and forth and that makes sense. Now no offense to anyone who likes the Superman movies with Christopher Reeves, but I'm not a huge fan of those movies. I like Man of Steel better then this film, but still this is a pretty fair movie but the ending to this didn't make a lot of sense to me.",Superman

Okay, now that that's out of the way, I look back and remember how disappointed I was with 'Superman-The Movie' after all the hype.
'You will believe a man can fly'?!?!? How about
'You will believe in the power of matte shots'?
-especially when Superman is chasing the atomic missile across the country-pretty fakey stuff. Or how about 'Superman saves toy village from toy a broken dam? I could go on and on. Sorry, but to me, this film ended when Superboy (Jeff East) says goodbye to his mother in the wheat field- a touching scene, the best in the movie. I wiil say I did love Superman 2, though. Thanks.",Superman
221,Jerry Ables,One of the greatest live action superhero gems ever produced,10,3 January 2004,I think that this movie was a most excellent opener to a dynamic film series.  The story does a most excellent job as it takes us through Superman's boyhood right up to him taking his stand as defender of all things good and just.  I always had sort of a soft spot for Christoper Reeve as Superman and Clark Kent because I always thought that his awesome performance made the two seem so likable.  He's also helped by a great supporting cast to make this film the precious cinematic gem that it is.,Superman
222,SSJAniFan,You will believe a movie can be BORING.,1,20 June 2003,"CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE SUPERMAN MOVIE!For the past 6 years, I have constantly been asking myself one question: Why am I never able to finish watching the original Superman movie?  It seems as if every time I try to have an entire viewing of this film, I usually just fall asleep or turn of the TV after about an hour and a half of this film.  Why?  Because the movie is BORING AS HELL.  We have to wait that long for Superman to actually make an appearance in the flick.  All the previous time is wasted on making him become Superman.  Some scenes that should have been shortened include when Clark journeys to the Fortress, Kal-El's arrival on Earth, and Krypton's Explosion.  I could rant on other scenes that need to be shortened, but I still have the rest of a summary to go on.Like I said, by the time Superman finally shows up, I'm too bored to care about the rest of the film because everything else has been wasted.  But, one time I actually managed to watch the entire movie, did the lack of Superman get made up for in the end?  Did we have a good plot?  Hell no. Lex Luthor isn't some insane criminal who wants to take over the world, whether it be by force or, as the Luthor post-1986 did, manipulation, but a common crook who wants to take over some.... real estate in California. REAL ESTATE?!  The only thing that's making him a threat is because he hijacks two nuclear missiles(pretty pathetically, I might add).Also, the ending is horrible.  I mean poorly-thought out horrible, similar to what helped kill the Matrix.  You see, Superman solves all these disasters, but as a result can't save Lois.  She gets killed, and Superman decides to do the one thing he promised not to do... alter history.  He turns the world around, and sets time back by, I don't know, five minutes. Then he goes down to see the now-living Lois.  BUT WAIT!!!!  SINCE IT'S FIVE MINUTES AGO, SHOULDN'T ALL THOSE DISASTERS THAT WERE HAPPENING BE OCCURING AGAIN!?  Also, Lois was killed in the flick by being buried in a landslide. For some unknown reason, when he turns back time the landslide itself is not occuring again.  With plotholes like this, one can wonder what the writers were doing all this time.  It's also hard to believe that this film was scripted by the same person who wrote the Godfather.Okay, I've been ranting about the bad all this time, so what's good?  Well, Christopher Reeve is actually able to give off a believable performance as Superman.  His emotions can actually feel real, and make us be actually care for him.  When Lois does kick the bucket in the movie, we can actually feel his grief, and how he must make the difficult choice of either obeying his father's wishes or bringing back the woman he loves.  And of course, there's John Williams's brilliant musical score, with some of the best soundtracks on the face of the earth.Of course, good music can't be the only factors in making a good production(I said the same thing about Final Fantasy VII.)  All in all, a disapointing film.  However, it is better than the even worse second film.BOTTOM LINE:  If you want a real comic-based movie, see X-men, or Batman, or Daredevil",Superman
223,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Reeve makes this movie,9,28 February 2008,"Superman has become the blueprint for the Superhero origin movie. Its basic plot structure has been copied over and over again, most notably in Batman Begins and Spider-Man. Christopher Nolan said Superman the Movie was probably his biggest influence when he made Batman Begins. You can find minor Superman influences in many of today's super hero movies. Peter Parker opens his shirt to reveal the spider-logo ala Superman. Superman is most notable because it was really the first comic book movie to take its main character seriously. While it does have a stronger comedic element than more recent comic book films, it is nothing compared to the 60's Batman movie or T.V. series. The first half is dead serious, with very little humor at all.We all know the story by now. With the Planet Krypton about to explode, a wise scientist places his son in a spaceship headed for Earth, where the yellow sun will give him great powers. Taking the name of Clark Kent, the alien visitor devotes his life to protecting truth, justice, and the American way. His commitment as guardian of the world interferes with his love for Lois Lane. The dastardly Lex Luthor hatches a plot to destroy Superman and kill millions of people in the process.The film has aged in many respects, but Christopher Reeve is probably the best casting decision in a comic book film to date. He pulls off the corniest lines because he imbues his performance with great sincerity. Other actors would have come across as over-the-top in an Adam West sort of way. But Superman was only half of his performance; his Clark Kent is just as good, if not better. He is so different from Superman you can actually believe they are really two different people, despite the flimsy disguise. This was new for the on screen portrayal of Superman, because George Reeves and Kirk Alyn's Clark Kents did not attempt to hide their identity with anything more than a pair of glasses. Clark Kent is fascinating because he is a combination of Superman's sincerity and a major dose of clumsiness, as well as a lack of confidence, all leading to a hilarious performance. I only wish the film had explored how Superman felt about his disguise a little more. The other cast members are a little more controversial with contemporary audiences. Gene Hackman's humorous Lex Luthor is the polar opposite of what the comic book Luthor is today. Considering the comic book Lex Luthor of the time was just a mad scientist, I think they did an excellent job adapting him to the movies. I love Ned Beatty as Otis and Valerie Perrine as Miss Tesmacher. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane seems to be a point of contention too. I thought she was smart, witty, and funny. Her chemistry with Reeve helped the film immensely.The film's most common criticism is probably the accusation that the film is uneven. I think most fans actually agree about this, but nobody can agree what part of the film is better. The first half is a very serious origin story that runs too long for some people, while the second half is more comedic and has more plot holes. I can see why some people find the shift in tone a bit jarring. I sort of look at this film as two short stories put into one. I think the origin story up until the part where Superman saves Lois Lane for the first time is perfect. Perfect. It feels like a modern American myth come to life. The film's major flaws are in the climax, since Lex Luthor's nuclear missile plot feels shoehorned into the story. Superman reversing time is probably still the biggest cop-out in comic book films. This scene is just an example of lazy writing at its worst. It came about as a compromise, since the original ending for the movie was a cliffhanger that involved the nuclear missile freeing Zod, Ursa, and Non from the Phantom Zone. The producers felt the ending needed to be more epic and not dependent on a sequel, therefore they decided to use the written ending for Superman II which involved time reversal. I don't know if Donner went into this willingly. I probably would have given the movie a 10 were it not for these problems.I must not forget John William's epic score, probably my favorite of all his works. The lesson every composer should take from the main theme is that in order to write a good Superman theme you must be able to say the word ""Superman"" to the music! The flying effects have also been praised for good reason, as they created some of the most magical moments in cinema history. Unfortunately, due to a now famous feud between the director, Richard Donner, and the producers, Alexander and Ilya Salkind, Donner was fired and Richard Lester replaced him. I think Donner's main strength over Lester was that he knew how to balance humor with serious subject matter. We see the beginning of the Lester humor overdrive in Superman II, and again to a much larger degree in Superman III.Superman is probably the strongest picture in the series overall, although the second film has some advantages over it. All in all, Superman is simply a very fun film, and I wish more people could appreciate comic book films like this today.",Superman
224,jrs-8,Hit and miss blockbuster,8,8 March 2004,"""Superman:The Movie"" was the Christmas blockbuster of 1978. For months ahead of time there were teasers and posters and toy promotions. You couldn't go anywhere without seeing a reference to Superman. Alas, as is usually the case, the hype was greater then the movie. ""Superman"" is an enjoyable movie but it isn't the great film some have said.The first big problem with the film is its tedious beginning. It takes its sweet time on Krypton introducing many characters we will never see again (outside of baby Kal-El and father Jor-El). Thank goodness for the presence of Marlon Brando in these early scenes. Then we have to go to Smallville to see the young Clark Kent discover his powers before he moves on to Metropolis. This section picks up the pace some and offers a wonderful performance by Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent. But the fact of the matter is it is a full 40 minutes into the movie before we get to Metropolis and almost an hour before Superman makes his appearance. Why wait so long? The audience wants to see the Man of Steel.The second big problem is the performance of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Hackman plays Luthor as if he is guest starring on the Adam West ""Batman"" show. He's too goofy to be taken seriously so we don't see him as a threat. There is never a doubt who will win between Luthor and Superman. Even when Superman lays drowning in a pool with a chain of kryptonite on him there is no real threat.Lastly, the final sequence with the destruction of California looks terribly cheap in some places. This is surprising since this was a multi million dollar budgeted epic. Especially cheap looking is when Hoover dam bursts and we see neighborhoods destroyed in its path. The houses are obviously fake miniatures. Director Richard Donner has claimed Warner Brothers insisted on a Christmas opening so he didn't have enough time to work on the effects. Warner Brothers would have been smart to hold out until summer of 1979 to have given Donner more time.On the plus side there are some terrific special effects. The performances are all pretty solid, especially Christopher Reeve who could have looked terribly silly in the Superman cape but pulls it off. Margot Kidder was good as Lois Lane and their love story (or the beginnings of one) is better then the good vs evil plot. Jackie Cooper is well cast as Perry White. As Hackman's villainous cohorts there is Ned Beatty who is so goofy he is almost unbelievable and Valerie Perrine as the vixenous Miss Techmaucher. She is around only to add eye candy and she does look great.Overall I would say ""Superman"" is a good but not great film. The first sequel is just as good though parts 3 and 4 diminish in quality.",Superman

226,hotrobinproductions,The Godfather of the superhero Genre,10,17 April 2019,"The amazing Godfather film of the Superhero Genre. It brought not only the first live action superhero to the big screen, but impacted and proved to Hollywood that superhero films can be possible. The score is the greatest score in not only the superhero genre, but movies period. A sound as iconic as Star Wars, John Williams score really grabs the audience to believe this movie. The script is amazingly written from beginning to end. This film is over 40 years old and looking back at it today you can pick it apart from effects and certain jokes all you want but you cannot deny the magic that they crafted off such limited things at the time. Richard Donner is what Sam Rami was to the Spider-Man trilogy. The first is amazing, with a sequel arguably better than the first, with a very frustrating 3rd because of studio interference. This film set the golden book standard to how a origin film should be told. And they use the format in superhero movies today, period. The film may not have the most complex themes or plot twists, but it actually makes the film even better. Currently, Shazam and Wonder Woman literally ripped the pages out of this film to craft the beauties they made. This film has such beautiful character development, and feels so alive. I have my fair share of love for superhero movies but no other film I have seen can capture the magic this film made. The only problem I can come up with for Christopher Reeves, is he literally set the god damn bar sooo high. HE IS SUPERMAN. He has the charisma his acting is amazing and you feel as if it makes so much sense the reasons he does things. I like to compare this film to Man of Steel or maybe to Superman 2 because of general sod in that film.

227,MovieGuyFunTime,Still The Best Superman Movie,10,15 July 2021,"'Superman: The Movie' was the first full-length, big-screen production of a superhero character, graduating him from decades of being accessible only via comic books and low-budget TV serials. This film, and its extraordinary box-office success (all around the world), proved the concept of superhero movies. Multiple sequels of Superman followed and blazed the trail for other mega-success superhero franchises such as Batman and Spiderman.40-plus years have passed since the film's release but for me, it still is one (if not the) best superhero film ever made. The story is great. The characters are great. The dialog is great. It has heart, soul, charm, warmth, wit, humor, chivalry, decency, style, class, humility, honor and romance. It is a joy to watch and it gives the viewer a good feeling and hope in humanity.The more recent film, 'Man of Steel', is a fine film. But in comparison, the heart and soul of the Superman character, what makes him so great, is too often obscured or upstaged by non-stop, budget-busting CGI action and effects. The 'star' of the film is the CGI and not Superman (or anyone else). The characters all lack depth and genuine emotional response. The atmosphere is drab, dreary and bleak. The actors are all operating in a sterile world of blue/green screens which produces an emotionally detached vibe through the whole film as they do their best to interact with world around them that isn't really there. However, in this 1978 film, the humanity literally flies off the screen. Sure, the effects are dated by today's standards but state-of-the-art CGI cannot replace or even compete with great acting and a great story... it can only enhance it but only up to a point.'Superman: The Movie' is still the best. It is uplifting and colorful. It is everything Superman should be.",Superman
228,CalDexter,Look Ma No Wires!,10,12 August 2006,"Superman The Movie plays like a catalogue of great movie moments, from the memorable 'trial' scene on Krypton to The Man Of Steel saving the west coast from a major earthquake, the film is mostly a joy from start to finish.One of my personal favourite moments in the film is actually a scene that was omitted from the original screening but was restored in the 2000 DVD release. Superman talks to his father about revealing his true identity to the world, and as his father's hologram fades...he reaches out to him only to be left totally alone. A moving moment enhanced by John William's magnificent score.This film belongs to Christopher Reeve. His performance as Superman is so alive so heartfelt and done with 100% conviction that you feel that no other actor could do better. Next to Reeve, Brandon Routh is a plank in a red cape in the latest movie.Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor is hugely funny with some small moments of wicked sarcasm ('No...by causing the death of innocent people!') Ned Beatty is funny as Otis as is Valerie Perrine as Luthor's girlfriend.Margot Kidder is ideally cast as Lois Lane. In fact she is to her role what Chris Reeve is to his part. Kidder is not the Most Beautiful Woman On The Planet, but she has an air of attraction about her, and what was of central importance was that Superman's relationship with Lane was real and not half-baked romance. The 'can you read my mind' sequence in the movie is a little bit too long although again, John William's music makes the flying scenes truly majestic and romantic.Some of the special effects are a little grainy (Superman flying through the city, looks like a cut and paste job) but other moments are still superb: The moment he saves Lois and catches the helicopter is one of the highlights.A classic in every sense of the word, Superman: The Movie is most certainly the benchmark for which all future comic adaptations will be judged.

The point was supposed to be, You'll believe a man can leap tall buildings in a single bound while being faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive... Sticking semi-true to the origins but dancing around the comic lore, the film did what it needed to do and what none had been allowed to do since the serials of the 1940's and '50's... bring a comic book legend to life.Forget story, just look at it for what it is supposed to be, a comic book movie. Only Superman could have pulled it off at the time, celebrating his 40th birthday, being the first real hero to grace the big screen with a big budget in living color. Sure Wonder Woman and Spiderman trailed the Hulk in 70's TV comic exposure, Superman's '50's series and Batman's '60's series still a fond syndicated memory, but this was the BIG TIME. Batman, though planned to follow closely, (Adam West's big screen rendition still in pop culture) wouldn't get his big screen re-duex till his 50th Birthday, by which time Superman had faded on film and thankfully so.Revamped by DC/Warner's for the 21st Century, 'Superman Returns' erases the damage of 'Superman III' and 'IV' creating itself as the immediate sequel to 'Superman II', which was easily better than the first film and better than any sequel since.Comic epic and doing just what the film should, taking you on the journey through the comic pages.",Superman
231,charlessmith702210,Sole survivor of doomed planet becomes world-famous superhero,7,8 April 2013,"The heart of the lively music by John Williams, who would be featured in both the main ""Superman"" theme, and ""Can You Read Your Mind?"" (which would be the famous ""Love Theme""), starts right in this first of the movie sequels focusing on this world-famous superhero.It all starts in outer space in a fictional planet called Krypton, and inside a part of the planet, the Krypton Council, made up of about 20 members, which included Jor-El and his wife, face their reality that the planet is going to be locked into its gravitational pull to the sun, eventually causing Krypton and everything within it to be destroyed. Upon orders of the Krypton council, as we see Krypton's first stages of destruction, a baby from Jor-El's wife is to be encased in a special satellite that will be launched out of Krypton and will have its homing beacon as the satellite goes through deep space through the solar system to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.Then, the final stages of Krypton's destruction show things like endless new crevasses which causes some members of the council to fall to their deaths, and the others dealing with crashing ceilings and exposure to higher and higher temperatures, even with the successful launch of the satellite.Of course, Krypton blows up completely, and focus now runs on the satellite carrying the sole survivor of the Krypton explosion that does crash to earth, but the baby survives. A family then takes that baby (which was Kal-El before it was Superman) and starts to rear them.From there, Superman quickly grows up, showing such super strengths as lifting up a car, and then, the revealing of Clark Kent is now in place as Superman meets up with Margot Kidder, who plays ""Lois Lane"", at the Daily Planet newspaper. From there, in the wilderness, Superman finds his own Krypton crystal glow stick in the nighttime sky, and throws it at a large distance into the ground, and then an spectacular explosive metamorphosis of that stick turns into Superman's home--the Crystal castle, in homage to Krypton.Later on, we see the first fruits of a villain that will force Superman into a challenge--Lex Luthor, who is a maniac who wants a conquest in the real-estate world. He wants to rule the California coast by creating an earthquake in the San Andreas fault by a nuclear missile impact--and after the earthquake's destruction, going on to create what he calls the ""Costa del Lex"", or Lex's Coast.To confuse Superman, Lex orders that not one--but two--nuclear missiles be fired, and to make the challenge harder, he forces Superman to hold a Krypton ball with chain that causes him to be weak. After recovering, Superman does stop one of the missiles and sends it into space, but realizes that he cannot stop the second missile as it impacts the San Andreas fault. At the same time, Lois Lane was in her car just near the fault line trying to do a reporting assignment, and then, at a gas station, she realizes the quake is starting and has to get out just before the gas station explodes. Superman then goes right into the heart of the fault line and recovers it but not completely. Then, he does several life-saving miracles during the quake not realizing that Lois Lane gets hit by a fault track aiming a direct hit towards her car. The car ends up swallowed in a ditch and added rocks and mud and dirt eventually consume and kill Lois. Superman does arrive but it was too late to save her.Superman then takes out the doomed Lois, leaves her on the ground, gets loudly resentful at his loss, and then, with his super-powers, does a ""turn-back-the-time"" technique by flying all the way to the troposphere, and then, does a supersonic fly-by hundreds of times around the earth to get back to when Lois Lane was alive (about 3-4 hours), and then, circumvents the earth in another direction about 30 times to bring the earth back to normal time. With this, Lois comes back to live a second life.Lex Luthor is then flown to prison for his deeds, and that was it.But I recall that the earthquake recognized Superman's weakness--sometimes he focuses on saving other people more than people that he usually are friends with.",Superman
232,highclark,"Is it a turkey....no, it's Super, man.",8,16 January 2005,"With the opening credits being the only true anchor into the time in which the film was made, the film of Superman then plays out as one of the best made 'comic book movies' of the 20th century. With its sweeping natural vistas of real cornfields and clouds, the viewer starts to get a taste for at least one third of what old time radio listeners of Superman heard as, 'Truth, Justice and the American Way'. And as this film is two and half hours long, there's no need to worry, there will be more than enough time to get to sink our teeth into a lot of 'truth' and 'justice'. This certainly becomes true when we see the young Clark Kent (Jeff East) hiking up North to create his own fortress of solitude where he is surrounded by 'Just Ice'. Young Clark heaves a green crystal rod (looking suspiciously like the rod that happens to attach itself each week to Homer Simpson) a good distance across the frozen North Sea until the crystal lands on some frozen ground. The crystal then melts into the water and disappears. This green crystal then reappears in a very different form when added to the salty water of Earth, as it creates a gigantic rock candy crystal fortress for Supreman. It is here that Superman learns the 'truth' about his past through the turning of many other clear crystals. These clear crystals conjure up the floating image of a white haired Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's father. Jor-El explains to Clark all about what to expect out of the new life Clark is destined to live and even answers all of Clarks questions hundreds of years in advance. This process takes 12 earth years or 7 minutes of film.Once Clark understands fully his mission in life, he then heads to Metropolis (as played by New York: see 'On the Town', 'Midnight Cowboy')to land a paying job working as a newsman. He gets the job and starts his dual life as the mild mannered Clark Kent by day and the overtly colorful costumed spandex Superman by night. The film is pretty much a series of close calls from people falling out of helicopters, buildings, bridges and dams. There are also many of the obligatory 'damsel in distress' episodes between Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Superman. I've never been someone who understands the appeal of Margot Kidder. Wasn't there an actress in Hollywood at the time of the making of this film who would've been better choice for Lois Lane? Anyone? Perhaps a fast talking Barbara Stanwyck type from 'Meet John Doe'? Or maybe a 'take no prisoners' type like Rosiland Russell in 'His Girl Friday'? No? No one? How about anyone of those two I just mentioned at their advanced ages? Not to be too harsh, Kidder did an o.k. job, I just don't see her as Lois Lane. I think that even a 14 year old Teri Hatcher would have been better for the part....well, maybe not. For me, Kidder was the one person who dragged the movie down. I would have mentioned Valerie Perine as Eve Teschmacher to be another culprit, but she isn't in the movie long enough to matter. For the most part, Perine luxuriates underground with Lex Luthor(Gene Hackman) in a plethora of costumes, most notably a top that pushes much of her talent up and out, well within eyesight of those who don't need to posses x-ray vision to see her blossoming talent.Which brings us to what is really good about the film. Gene Hackman is brilliant as Lex Luthor. Besides the selection of Christopher Reeve as Superman, this casting choice was by far the most inspired. Hackman teams up with Ned Beatty who plays Hackman's right hand man, Otis. Otis is pretty much a comic buffoon who messes up almost every plan that Luthor dreams up. You have to wonder, why if Luthor is so brilliant, does he surround himself with such incompetent help? Their scenes together are worth the price of admission. I wished there were more of Hackman and Beatty in this film.Glenn Ford is good in the little time he has on screen as Clarks adopted father. There isn't enough time on screen for Susanah York or Terence Stamp to leave their stamp, but that would be rectified by the time of Superman 2. Jackie Cooper as Clark's boss at the Daily Planet is pretty average. Seeing Marlon Brando dressed up as Jor-El carries with it a sort of embarrassing charm. We also see Trevor Howard on screen for less than a minute, talk about a 'Brief Encounter'.All in all, I enjoyed watching the movie unfold. Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman to hit the screen. A gifted actor in other dramatic roles away from the Superman movies, Reeve also brought a very light touch as a comic actor to the role Clark Kent and a commanding presence in the role of Superman. 8/10.Clark Richards",Superman
233,beejer,He can fly...he can fly...,9,5 January 2000,"Superman is a great entertainment. The special effects are dazzling and you'll find yourself believing that Superman can really fly.The first part of the film deals with Superman's origin and is populated with such notables as Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard, Susannah York and Maria Schell. The second part deals with his arrival on earth and his adoptive family (Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter). The balance of the film deals with his arrival in Metropolis, his first appearance as Superman and his battles with the evil Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).Christopher Reeve is excellent as Superman and his alter-ego, the bumblimg Clark Kent. He is a good enough actor to make both characters seem believable. Margot Kidder is suitably wide-eyed as Lois Lane and Jackie Cooper makes a good Perry White. Hackman and Ned Beatty are way over the top as Luthor and his assistant Otis. Valerie Perrine plays Luthor's moll Miss Teschmacher.The score by John Williams is excellent and the direction by Richard Donner keeps the action flowing.Watch for brief cameos by Larry Hagman and the original 1948 Superman and Lois Lane, Kirk Alyn (only the back of his head) and Noel Neill.",Superman
234,Jetset971,Greatest superhero movie ever!,10,1 December 2010,"This movie is without a doubt the greatest Superhero movie ever made! It hit the right note in every single department. They really captured the mystical splendor and legend of Superman, without resorting to A campy comic book formula. Christopher Reeve was perfectly cast as the man of steel, Gene Hackman, is spot on as Lex Luther. Even Marlon Brando, who by this time was notoriously just trading his name for easy rolls and HUGE paycheck, gives A wonderful performance as Jor-El. The script and direction is flawless, giving us A vivid story that doesn't skip the natural progression of this space saga. The effects, for its time, are astounding. I could go on and on, this movies never gets dull. I could watch it over and over again and find some new aspect every time. Highly recommended this movie, but I would caution people on the sequels. Superman 2, not as grand but worthy, Superman 3 and 4 horrible and really horrible. Just watch this movie. Its so worth you time!",Superman
235,KillerLord,The Most Amazing Trend Setting Superhero Movie Ever!,10,7 May 2007,"If there is a movie that brings smiles even today, it is Superman The Movie filmed in 1978. Most people do not seem to know this movie or understand its importance especially after the breed of superheroes all equipped with their computer graphics have taken over the screen.Let me point out that in 1978 the project undertaken was the most expensive and was considered by most people as a project that would start but would never end. There was not a single computer graphics tool that could ease making a man fly. All had to be done with wires and cranes and mixing and embedding! Earlier when a superman TV show came out, they had to show the flying sequences as cartoon and the ground fighting as motion picture. So on ground we would see real characters and after he had fought all the bad guys he would fly off. His flight would now be animation and now real. It was that difficult! A 5 second extra stunt added to the movie meant about millions of dollars of expenditure. Yet, the Salkinds and Donner did not budge and kept working hard until they finally revealed the greatest superhero movie of all times  Superman The Movie. They said, ""You'd believe a man can fly"" and we did.Christopher Reeve is simply the most charismatic superhero in the history of cinema. His transition from Superman to Clark was simply amazing. His smile, the pose with arms on hips and cape blowing is a benchmark. And Gene Hackman plays the sarcastic, sadistic and evil Lex beautifully.I know many people who find many things silly in this movie in terms of graphics possibly because they try to benchmark it against the newer special effects. This is a wrong thing to do. For those who have watched this movie after having spent too much time in modern era of computer gaming and special effects, you will need to do a little bit homework, gain an understanding of the period and the difficulties encountered during the period to come up with a movie. And if you still do not gain respect for the movie, then only the wrong may be said about you. One can seen in fact that many of Superman's flight sequences are much smoother and more realistic and it makes some of the modern graphics look crappy or childish.The special effects are revolutionary, the story great, the dialogs crisp and the acting great. Even today many love watching the movie and it still brings excitement to its viewers. A great classic of our times that will never be forgotten and shadowed. It is indeed sad that Christopher Reeve passed away, the man who gave us the most convincing Superman! A masterpiece of a movie!",Superman
236,AttyTude0,What a difference 40 years make,1,20 September 2021,"So I saw this when it firt came out 40 years ago (yes, I'm that old). At the time it was a great succeess, at least where I lived.Fast forward to present time. Hubby and I are watching it as I type.... Oh, dear. What a difference 40 years make. Now I find it slow, boring, and interminable. How they managed to make an action film that moves at glacial speed is a feat in itself, though one hardly worthy of praise. And Margot Kidder as a woman so bewitching that she's worth turning back time for (and by such method!)? Are you kidding me?Anyway, I agree with everyone who panned this film. Not even nostalgia could make me give it more than 1 star. Some things are better left buried in the past.",Superman
237,Tyson14,I believed a man could fly,10,16 August 2014,"As soon as I heard that Christopher Reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favourite scene in ""Superman."" This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the ""Daily Planet"" building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big ""S"" that stands for truth, justice, and the American way. The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman. The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film ""Superman Returns,"" and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people). Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.The tagline for the 1978 film ""Superman"" was that ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel. Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent. Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about ""Superman"" after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).Richard Donner filmed ""Superman"" and a lot of ""Superman II"" at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think ""The Three Mustketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers""). But there is decidedly a sense in which ""Superman"" is three different films. The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon. The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).However, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts. Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell. Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty). No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else. The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree. Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humour than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way. The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.Watch ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" again some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role. But to honour his memory skip the third and fourth ""Superman"" movies. If you want more of Reeve then go check out ""Someone in Time"" (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can ""think"" yourself back in time), ""Deathtrap"" and ""The Remains of the Day."" If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of ""Smallville"" are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.",Superman

239,Small-Screen-Superman,Pretty darn lame compared to its reputation,5,3 July 2015,"It's hard to communicate how much of a let-down this movie was the first time around. It's not downright terrible or anything, but it falls SO short of being great that I just can't get over it.I'll start off with what I did like. It had a few really funny moments, its concepts had a lot of potential, and if you sort of stop paying attention for a minute, you do sort of get swept away in a feeling of ""epicness"". Plus, oddly enough, I actually really liked Clark Kent and thought he was the best, funniest, most endearing part of the entire film, which is sort of weird considering that everyone complains about how he's depicted. I don't completely disagree, honestly, but I still liked him for what he was.But now for the problems. One of the biggest: Superman himself. Unlike some, I think Superman can be an extremely great character, and I love him to pieces when he succeeds at least mildly at reaching his potential. But here, he just doesn't gel with me. He doesn't even think of becoming Superman until he's TOLD by his biological father. He doesn't even THINK to use his powers for good until he's told to do so when he turns 18 - and he's not even someone Clark knows already or has previously formed a connection with. As such, Superman isn't a result of Clark's own morality and desire to help people - he seems more to be a result of Clark learning that he's a super special alien. That's just not what Superman's all about to me. To me, Superman is a good person, and that's the most important thing about him. As I see it, the reason why Clark became Superman is just to help people, and it came about as a result of internalizing the moral instruction of his adopted parents, not from just suddenly being TOLD when he's an adult by someone he didn't even know before. Everyone likes Superman for different reasons, but for me, this movie just COMPLETELY missed what I like best about him.In addition to Superman seeming disconnected from humanity and needing to be TOLD to help people, Superman also fails to show many particularly compelling traits you would expect from a hero. Think about it - the day is saved by Lex Luthor's henchwoman, not him! Throughout the entire movie, I fail to see him show any particular cleverness, endurance, courage, or anything. (I guess you could argue that turning back the world was ""clever"", but I found that plot point so completely, utterly, painfully stupid that I can't agree.) He just IS super, and I guess that's supposed to be enough, even though that's just a part of his biology as opposed to who he is as a person.Bottom line, I just don't find this version of Superman compelling at all. He lacks volition, his motives and everything he does seems to be motivated more by Jor-El than his own desires, he doesn't seem to have much emotional attachment to humanity, and there's just so little to him beyond his physical abilities. And to be perfectly frank, I didn't like Christopher Reeve's performance other than his Clark Kent (which, again, I enjoyed despite its problems). His acting seemed to reinforce Superman's lack of emotion and energy.This movie also suffers from having stuff just happen because it's supposed to happen without exploring why. They don't bother explaining why Jor-El decided to include a Fortress of Solitude- creating crystal in Kal-El's space ship. They don't bother explaining how Superman ""knew"" he had to go north when he turned eighteen. They don't bother explaining where Clark got the Superman costume or why he wears it. They don't bother explaining how or why Clark decided to become a really pathetic-acting reporter. In fact, AFTER he becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, THEN he asks Jor- El why he needs a secret identity. If Superman didn't plan on keeping a secret identity for any length of time, why did he bother coming up with the disguise and even getting a job? And why did he choose this particular disguise or this particular job, anyway?Perhaps one of the biggest unexplained plot points of all is, why does Jor-El want Kal-El to ""become an inspiration to humanity"" or ""show them the light"" or whatnot at all? The reason why he sent Kal- El to earth was to save HIM, not for humanity's sake. This is a big reason that I feel the ""Superman = Jesus"" analogy the movie tried to push fails. Jor-El isn't shown having any actual motives to inspire his son to become this Christ figure. They COULD'VE shown him having such motives, but they didn't. His desire to have Kal help humanity just appears without an explanation in Jor-El's character being given.Add to these serious flaws nonsense like Lex Luthor just DEDUCING the existence of Kryptonite and Superman turning back the world to turn back time and hopefully you should see why I think this film is so lame. The really annoying thing about that latter one is that it actually could've made more sense if they'd just had Superman fly faster than the speed of light to go back in time, but they chose something utterly stupid when they had another option that made more sense (even if I'd rather he just not go back in time at all). And then there's Lois' painfully lame attempt at poetry...I know I might've liked this movie better if I was born back when the special effects would've actually seemed impressive, but does a movie that relies on special effects to be good really deserve to be considered a great film?tl;dr: Clark Kent was funny, nothing else was particularly good. Sorry.",Superman
240,ryanskywalker-87402,We all believed a man could fly,8,8 March 2017,"As I'm sure you're aware based on my past write-ups on superhero films, I take them somewhat serious. I think they're a fascinating reflection of the times they were created in; at best functioning as a meaningful vessel for audiences to contemplate things like morality, justice and humanity; at worst they usually are pretty entertaining. Superman, arguably the oldest superhero, is a fascinating character to dive into; to explore from multiple perspectives and if anyone would like to dig into that, I'd be more than happy to in the comment section.Richard Donner's Superman confidently approaches the Superman character from a whimsical, tongue in cheek angle. This, to me, is its greatest failing, because the depths it reaches in the Superman character are really quite shallow in the end. We see Clark and Superman as they are defined in the comics, and Donner successfully establishes their demeanor and overall motivations. As an adaptation of the comics, it really does quite well. All of the characters are there, portrayed quite aptly by a talented cast, and Donner takes no serious deviations from the source material except for one major piece (which I'll discuss in the next paragraph). It's a safe film, albeit a minor one in thematic scope and subtextual meaning. The plot is too absurd to take seriously.But there are some things to love about this 70's retooling of the Man of Steel, and most of those can be found in the core relationship between Clark/Superman and Lois. Both actors kill it, bringing comedy, cleverness and heart to their roles, really succeeding in making each character an sympathetic one. Some of the visual effects are great in an antiquated sort of way, softening the conceptual absurdity of most of the script. And Gene Hackman, while butchering the character of Lex and limiting the stakes that are even possible to feel in this mostly cartooney story; is fun enough in his archetypal buffoonish villain role. And back to that deviation, I love Donner's interpretation of Krypton. It's such a ballsy and artistically risky move on his part, negating the comics vision of Superman's home to make it his own. The conceptual art and subsequent direction of the first fifteen minutes is marvelous, so disparate from the loud and cluttered world creation we see today and instead vying for a muted, advantageously dull color palate with serious, formalistic script leanings and performances. Casting Marlon Brando as Jor-El was a stroke of genius. Williams' score is deservedly iconic as well.What this fundamentally comes down to is what I seek in a superhero film. Personally, the most compelling piece of the Superman character is his place within the world; whether that be as a god or a malevolent (or benevolent) figure. Superman as a symbol, as an ideal and a spiritual icon. Superman taps into this barely, defining the character but again, taking a very whimsical approach to these ideas. The villain, plot and origin story does not work at all here, but other key elements do. The charm, the strengths of Superman can be summed up, or found in one, beautiful and phenomenal scene. After the infamous romantic flight between Lois and Superman, Clark turns up at Lois' apartment for a date and he *almost* comes clean about his dual identity. There's a brief moment where Clark adjusts his bent-over, anxiety-ridden posture and stands tall as Superman does, embodying the confidence, strength and base masculinity that goes with it. After a brief consideration, he decides to wait, and again slumps back down into Clark. Superman's costume is Clark, the hero is his real identity. A wonderful, endearing and loaded twenty second scene that recalls the subtlety superhero cinema has largely lost confidence in. I like this movie a lot, but Snyder has done infinitely more interesting things with the character in his widely maligned two film stint with him.",Superman

While a few sequels (while the second is great all inferior), a new Superman, Batman, Spiderman and countless DC and Marvel movies being made I admit I haven't seen them all, but this one takes the cake. Perhaps you had to see this one as a child, but thanks to some wonderful acting, amazing music and direction from Richard Donner this is a very moving and motivating story for everyone.They really cram a lot of story into the version that I have seen (runs at 143 minutes) and I would completely agree that what audiences found acceptable in 1978 may not apply so well today from an opening credit sequence that runs too long, but hey, I don't care it mixes in maybe from favourite score of all time by John Williams with some beautifully cheesy late 70s effects. We follow Superman's father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) who believes his planet of Krypton will explode after its sun goes supernova. The high council toss away his pleas and in turn to save his only son Kal-El he sends him in a spaceship to Earth where his dense molecular structure will make him stronger than any mortal man. He lands on Earth where he is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) in a pretty cool scene. When he grows older he moves to Metropolis where he works for the Daily Planet as Clark Kent the nerdy, no-nothing, ultra old-school boy from the mid west. He works with and falls for the attractive Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), yet there is the most brilliant criminal mind of our time working in the underground depths of the city; Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman is simply wonderful in his hammy spin of the character). Along with his buffoon sidekick Otis (Ned Beatty) and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) he plans to detonate the San Andreas Fault causing California to slide into the ocean depths.I think to this day Christopher Reeve is underrated as an actor as he did a fabulous job in this and all the sequels. To go along with Richard Donner's great direction (and my thoughts that he knew the material and appreciated it as well) there was a pretty darn good script co-written by Mario Puzo who wrote THE GODFATHER.The big thing that I love about this film and SUPERMAN II is that it does take its material seriously, but doesn't take itself seriously. It is swimming in camp at times much like the comics did at that time as well. Today they seem to have gone the other way in taking itself seriously, but to me the camp that is within these films brings a high level of joy and fun.Maybe give it a shot to the younger group who may have never seen this film. It is different than the comic book movies they make nowadays, but it was huge at the box office as well raking in over $300 million. Also starring Jackie Cooper as Daily Planet editor Perry White, Terence Stamp as Zod (who returns for the sequel) and Susannah York as Superman's mother Lara.",Superman
243,superboy478,Verisimilitude,10,26 February 2002,"Superman is a gigantic movie with incredible special effects, awsome acting, a memorable script!!!!!!!One thing that producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind did well in their part was finding the perfect director, the perfect crew, the perfect cast. I must say that if Christopher Reeve was not a part of this movie, this movie would've been campy and boring. Same goes for Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman.The movie begins with an INCREDIBLE title sequence, then shifts its way to Krypton where Jor-El is sentencing three villians into the phantom zone, then finds out about the destruction of Krypton. Then, he decides to send his baby son Kal-El to earth so he can live. After the destruction of Krypton, baby Kal-El's starship crahses into Smallville, Kansas where he is taken into care by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Played excellently by Glenn Ford and Phillyis Thaxter). As he grows to be a teenager, he goes by the name Clark Kent and starts to learn about the abilities he has. After the death of Jonathan, Clark heads north where he ends up creating the Fortress of Solitude. He then sees his father again, and begins 12 years of training.Then the movie cuts immediatley to Metropolis where Clark Kent becomes a member of The Daily Planet, meets Lois Lane, and does battle with Lex Luthor.The new DVD to Superman is very worth getting. It is full of exciting features including documentaries and a commentary by director Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz.The movie is followed by three sequels that are all worth seeing! Congratulations to Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind who have made the movies more exciting.",Superman
244,jerry_dean67,The ONLY superhero movie worth watching.,10,19 May 2000,"This movie is a solid 10! While the picture isn't flawless, it comes close. The acting and character development is absolutely perfect. The storyline is very solid and enjoyable. The special effects are awesome. This movie is so enjoyable on so many fronts that I have very rarely found anyone who hasn't liked it since I first saw it 22 years ago.
I am very pleased that I recorded it last night when it was shown on ""American Movie Classics"" in the ""letterbox"" format. Believe me, seeing the widescreen version of this movie is the ONLY way to view it. I can't believe all that is missed by viewing it in the pan and scan mode (full screen is filled) compared to watching it in the widescreen/letterbox format (black bars at top and bottom of screen).One of the all time classics of motion picture history.I'll rate it a 10. That's as high as it goes folks!",Superman
245,asd29,Good but could have been better.,7,7 February 2021,"Great spectacle at the time and remember the character is based on a comic book which are always far fetched and hokey anyway, i think the film tried to play that tone and i think some viewers look through its intent, the film is a flawed classic and was a cinematic experience at the time , its the most slow burn in the series and some of the characters are annoying and the plot is questionable and an ending that nearly kills the whole point of the film, but reeve is great as superman, hackman does a good job with lex luthor and the effects are pretty good for the time of its release, overall good but also a little bad , but christopher reeve as superman in great colour still defines the experience of this movie.",Superman

Don´t count me in as a DC superfan as there are others who watches Teen Titans, Smallville religious and more unlike me.",Superman
247,Theflyace,You'll Believe a Man Can Fly,8,13 March 2013,"When the credits fly onto the screen and the the John Williams score cues up, you know you are in for something very special. Superman the Movie is a game-changer, as well as a great film. It's fun, reverential, Americana, and nostalgic for all audiences. It did not come easily though, as it took a lot of creativity, sweat, and technical ingenuity to make the believability of Superman shine.The producing duo Alexander and his son Ilya Salkind (more of Ilya's vision, Alexander could really care at all) sought to make an ""event film."" Writers (especially Mario Puzo) were brought in, but unfortunately, the many comedic writers made the approach seem campy and stupid. But when the Salkinds hired director Richard Donner, the project really got off the ground and took on a great form. Through his motto of verisimilitude, the special effects, writing, and acting all stepped up to a level of excellence not seen before in a film like this. This was a mammoth, making both Superman I and II AT THE SAME TIME. Imagine the pressure forced upon these filmmakers and their dedication to make it better despite this pressure. In the technical areas, the artists involved also excelled to greatness. The special effects are really good, and many of them still hold up beautifully well. John Williams followed up Star Wars with another truly great score, (one of his top 5 scores in my opinion.)This film is essentially Superman's origin story, ranging from his father Jor-El (Marlon Brando in a phenomenal performance as per usual) sending his son to earth to escape planet Krypton's destruction, all the way until he becomes the Man of Steel. There comes a threat from Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California to own land and form it to his needs. Lois Lane (played by Margot Kidder) is the archetype of a strong determined career woman, but with a vulnerability and tenderness that is very believable. The chemistry between Superman and Lois seems very believable, which is the result of great acting and smart direction. It also lends to very sweet and touching scenes between them, as well as John Williams' best love theme ever composed (next to ""Across the Stars"" from Attack of the Clones)The strongest aspect of this movie is Christopher Reeve. He was an unknown actor who got a huge opportunity. His performance is one of the greatest seen in any medium. He has done the impossible by embodying what people think Superman is, which is the true sign that something right happened when he was cast by Donner and casting director Lynn Stalmaster. And as Clark Kent, he is nerdy and hilarious (even though the glasses are a bit unbelievable these days) and hides his love for Lois (as both is characters) very well. When I first watched the film, I thought, ""yeah, that's a good guy. That's Superman."" Even after his tragic accident, he really became Superman when he refused to give up on his cause to cure paralysis. I want to rank this film at 10/10, but I can't. There are some things that are dated, which isn't technically a problem but they are kind of noticeable these days. The ending is bit frenzied (Huge Shocker: the turning the world back was the original ending of Superman II, not this movie) and the special effects during the ending Earthquake sequence looked rushed (the crew had to make a certain release date therefore subcontracting the model effects to other lackluster companies to meet demands) Some lines of dialog are kind of silly nowadays, but in the 70s that kind of writing was the norm, so I give it a pass. The solution Superman comes to (turning the world back in time) is very controversial, but I think it makes sense. After Lois dies in the earthquake, Superman cries and gives a blood curdling scream in pain. He can't live without her, and wants to save her. Jor-El reminds him that he can't interfere with history, showing to the audience that he actually can, something he didn't quite realize. I can see why people would question the logic and overall physics of the scene, but personally, it didn't think it dragged down the movie at all. It never bothered me as a kid, and it still doesn't bother me now.But all nitpicking aside, this is one of the best movies ever made. Its fun, real, and exciting. You'll believe that a man can fly, and you may be flying along with him when watching this movie.",Superman
248,andrewnmiller,I still believe a man can fly.,10,13 December 2015,"Growing up, I was never a fan of Superman. I never read any of the comics nor did I watch any of the movies or cartoons, so going into Superman The Movie, I didn't know what to expect from this film. Sure enough, Superman completely blew my mind with its portrayal of the title character, kick-ass score, ground-breaking special effects, stellar performances, and incredible visual design. Had it not been for this film, the superhero film genre could've been completely different.The story begins on the planet Krypton, the Ruling Council condemns Generals Zod, Ursa and Non to living death in the Phantom Zone. Soon after, Jor-El is unable to prove to the council that Krypton will soon explode. In order to save his infant son, Kal-El, he sends a rocket enclosing the baby towards Earth. Upon arriving on Earth, the child is discovered and adopted by Martha and Johnathan Kent and is given the name Clark. At the age of 18, following the passing of Johnathan, Clark uncovers a green crystal which compels him to travel to the Arctic, where the crystal creates the Fortress of Solitude where a vision of Jor-El tells Clark about his ancestry and teaches him about his powers and his duties. After 12 years, he begins working at The Daily Planet where he fosters a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane. Later on, Lois is embroiled in a helicopter accident where standard ways of rescue are impossible, obliging Clark to appear as Superman for the first time and soon is a celebrity. Meanwhile, criminal mastermind Lex Luther has fostered a plan to make a fortune in housing by purchasing vast amounts of desolate desert and divert a nuclear missile to the San Andreas Fault line which will sink California and will leave the desert as the new West Coast and only Superman can stop him.When it comes to judging the movie, it has to be judged by the criteria set for the films of the late 70s and early 80s, but that's not to say that it doesn't stand on its own 37 years after being release, but its true nature may be forgotten if one doesn't remember when and how this film was made. Richard Donner obviously knew what audiences wanted from these characters and he was walking on thin ice when it came to bringing The Man of Steel to the big screen, but Donner mangles to bring everything Superman stands for from his morals to his love for Lois Lane to the table and works it all in perfectly.As with most superhero films that I've seen thus far, the cast in Superman: The Movie is superb: Marlin Brando is and will always be Jor-El, playing the role with such an enduring presence and class as well as being the guiding light for his son. Phyllis Thaxter and Glen Ford are great as Johnathan and Martha Kent and while they receive much less time on screen than Brando does, their roles as Superman's ethical models are just as important to the story. Margot Kidder plays the role of Lois Lane to perfection, capturing the stubbornness and durability of Lois as well as the love-struck woman whenever Superman is around so well, plus she and Christopher Reeve have excellent chemistry whenever they are together on screen. Gene Hackman brings the character of Lex Luther to life in the most surprising way by being oily, diabolical and sarcastic and also provides much of the comic relief without becoming campy or too silly. Jackie Cooper is excellent as Perry White and Marc McCure is great as Jimmy Olsen. However, the star of the movie is Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman in what will always his signature role to me. He embodies the character and creates two completely different personalities to a point when one is certain that a pair of glasses and a curled hair is a spot-on alter ego. When he's Clark Kent, Reeve is a goofy reporter but also pure and truthful and at the same time being the polar opposite of Superman. As Superman, he is towering, bigger than life, tough, straightforward and too good to be true.The visual effects in this film were revolutionary for their time and even today, most of them are still spectacular even through some look a little dated in parts. Seeing Superman fly for the first time didn't fail to astonish me and left me with sense of wonder. The action in the film is also well executed with the missile sequence being the stand-out piece for me.Of course, I can't talk about this movie without talking about John William's soundtrack. The man is a musical wizard and when it comes to Superman, he delivers a score that so much more than just a heroic theme, but also captures the spine-chilling atmosphere of Krypton, the peacefulness of Smallville and the romance and heartbreak of Lois and Superman's relationship perfectly. The film is reinforced further by Stuart Baird's rapid editing, John Berry's extravagant production design, Yvonne Blake's superb costumes, and Geoffrey Unsworth's otherworldly cinematography.Now, there are some issues I have with this film like when Lois dies and Superman is mourning, he flies around Earth so fast that he changes the rotation of the planet and reverses time. Not only is this a purely selfish act on Superman's part, but it also goes against what Jor-El told him about interfering in human history, plus he suffers no consequences for his actions. I also felt that Man of Steel did a better job at making Superman relatable than this film did. Also, I would have liked to see more of Clark's teenage years and dealing with be different, but apart from these issues, this movie still holds up incredibly well even today, so do yourself a favor and give this movie a watch, it will blow your mind.",Superman
249,citizenchris,a review,8,25 April 2004,"Richard Donner's Superman film stands amongst an unfortunately small pantheon of good comic book films.  Why aren't their more good comic book films? After all they are both primarily a visual medium.  The  pre-visualization process in films often referred to as storyboarding look a hell of a lot like a comic book. Many of today's action and Sci-Fi films borrow liberally from comic book conventions. Heck, its now apart of our pop culture language. You'll be watching a film (not necessarily one based on a comic book)and someone will comment `that's so comic book'  So why don't films based on comic books end up decent. Why do 80% of them suck.heck some would say 95%. And why is a little film released in 1978 called Superman still one of the best. First of all why comic books don't usually make good movies. You might expect me to list all the reasons why Hollywood usually gets it wrong. I'm not going to do that. I am of the opinion that comic books .specifically super hero comic books.shouldn't be made into films. You see suspension of disbelief goes so far when you are witnisting a live action portrayal of a work of fiction. You can see a guy dressed in blue and red tights in 2d comic page and it fine. For some reason we accept it. Heck take that same concept and put it in a cartoon or video game and we accept it. But for some reason the bar is way higher when you take a real actor and put him on screen in that costume. What was once nifty camp or down right fun is now silly. So why dose Superman work? It works because it manages to balance how much its willing to take itself seriously. The filmmakers, I'm speaking now of Tom Mankiewicz and the afore mentioned Richard Donner. They knew that to pull this off you cant go completely camp, that would betray the character. But on the same token you cant make it all serous and no fun. They seemed to know exactly where that line was and crossed it only slightly. Superman is an American icon; they seemed to respect this fact. Certain scenes like Superman getting the cat out of the tree are pure iconic imagery. From the interstellar beginnings, featuring a great performance by Mr. Marlon Brando himself. To the extremely picturesque Americana of his Smallville upbringing. The first two sections of the film seem to bring the icon though the pages and ot (what was then) contemporary America circa 1978. It's this journey that makes the rest of the film believable. Few films portraying super heroes do even (what would seem to be) the simple task of telling the characters origin properly. In taking the time to do this the film is already light years ahead of any films of this type. In viewing the documentaries on the Warner DVD one discovers that it was Brando and Hackmans attachment to the film that got it off the ground. But the star of this film isn't Jor- El or Lex, its in the name. So yet another in a series of good decisions on the part of the filmmakers was to cas an unknown as the titular alien in the cape. Christopher Reeve plays the clumsy geek that is Clark to perfection. An actor who so completely owned that part I find it hard picturing anyone else in the role. When the time comes to reveal Superman to the word, the stark contrast in the two `roles' he plays is never more apparent. Gene Hackman is fantastic as the self proclaimed `worlds greatest criminal mind' Lex Luthor. He seems to be having so much fun antagonizing Supes. The only casting choice I sort of disagree with is Margot Kidder. Growing up with this film (and its subsequent sequels) I always though she was too silly for the role. When one views the screen testes and sees the other actreses considered this only cements my feelings. Their were at least two that I felt would have been better in the role. All in all we are left with a film that is as classic as the hero it portrays. As I write this Hollywood is clamoring to put together a team for a new Supes film. One ca n only hope that they assemble an equally fine group of filmmakers this time around. Though even with all the CGI and technical gimickery they have at their fingertips these days, it seems unlikely that any team will be able to re-create the magic.",Superman
250,Asentiff2004,You will believe a man can fly....,9,30 December 2013,"An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where his fate and destiny is to become its greatest defender, and its greatest superheroOne of the most critically acclaimed comic book movies, one in which made the late Christopher Reeve a household name and the face of the Man of Steel for a generation and several to follow. Wonderfully acted by all its principal players. Donner directs this film brilliantly. A mesmerizing score conducted and composed by the master, John Williams. For its time the effects were astounding as one of the biggest challenges facing the production was making a man fly believable and above the standard man on a wire routine, one in which they achieved brilliantly. Overall an extremely enjoyable film and perhaps one of the best of all the Superman films. Some might argue that this film has aged but I still believe it hold a charm to it that to this day still not only resonates with the viewer but leaves one inspired, as to what can be possible in film. There has been an attempt to recreate the magic and charm of the first Superman and few have come close, where as others have failed. The first Superman film is a must see for all ages and regardless if you're a comic book fan or not, Superman holds a little bit of something for everyone.",Superman
251,Chiller7,Severely overrated,2,20 July 2015,"First of all, my familiarity with Superman: I know Superman from the cartoons, which I've been a fan of since I was a kid; I've seen Man of Steel (2013), which I enjoyed; but I'd never seen the 1978 Superman until today in 2015 at age 30. I never had any reason to avoid it, just never had the chance to watch it until now.I fully expected this movie to feature some excusable flaws due to its age. I knew the effects would be outdated, the pacing would be slower than today's typical roller-coaster-ride approach to pacing, the mood would be cheesy in that old-movie kind of way. I expected all that and was prepared to overlook them. Another classic effects-heavy film, almost the same age as this movie, Star Wars (1977), remains perfectly watchable to this day, so why shouldn't Superman (1978), right? But what I didn't expect, considering this movie's generally high ratings and status as a ""classic,"" was how utterly brain-dead stupid the plot would be! Sorry for trampling on your childhood memories and nostalgia, but this is a bad movie that gets way way overrated because of the iconic status of its lead character, Superman, and because of the good performance by its leading man, Christopher Reeve. But Reeve's performance alone really is no excuse to elevate this movie to its undeserved status as a true classic.The plot: I actually have no objection to the villain Lex Luthor's dastardly plot to sink California into the sea. This is a comic-book movie after all and the old Superman comics were no stranger to ridiculously silly plots. What is inexcusable however and, frankly, damages the movie, though, is the utter eye-rolling-stupidity of the events throughout the film showing how this plot is carried out. Lex Luthor is supposed to be a genius criminal mastermind, but it seems the writers' idea of making him appear smart was to make everyone else he interacts with into brain-dead buffoons. Those corny scenes of the cartoony villains effortlessly tricking the mentally-challenged Army soldiers were just insulting to the viewers' intelligence. If they had introduced an additional plot point in which Luthor sprayed the soldiers with some idiocy-inducing gas or something like that, it would at least make some sense.The romance: This was painful to watch. Lois is an annoying character. She's supposed to be an experienced and respected reporter, yet she doesn't show the slightest bit of competence or professionalism at anything she does (especially that awkward interview scene... ""Can you see my underwear?"" Really?). Clark is given pretty much zero reasons to fall for her, yet he does - I guess because he's the male lead and she's the female lead and that's the only reason. Why would he suddenly fall for the mean lady at work who's a kinda disrespectful to him? The flying scene with the narration was just cringe-worthy. Why didn't they fill that scene with a song, instead of a weirdly inappropriate voice-over?I know it seems like I'm completely trashing this movie, but it's not all bad. As I mentioned, Christopher Reeve was quite good. He looks perfect, he's emotional when he needs to be, he plays the dual personalities well, and he's actually very funny as the bumbling Clark Kent.What was a bit weird though, was Clark's personality. It's normal for a superhero to have two personalities, the superhero persona, and the public civilian self. The bumbling klutz Clark Kent persona is clearly an act, but it seems like the Superman persona is also fake. The good-natured goodie-two-shoes boy scout personality doesn't really resemble Clark when he was a kid, his true self, which this movie unfortunately ignores until we possibly see a bit of it again at the very end. It's a personality that's quiet and introspective, wondering about his role and place in the world. If he was like that when he was a kid, there isn't much reason to completely change, so much so that he seems like a different character when he's older, right? His kid personality feels like Superman's real personality, the personality we should have seen more of. I know the old-school fans are gonna hate me for this, if they haven't stopped reading this review already, but Man of Steel (2013) did a better job of showing this side of Superman.",Superman
252,Roger_Sterling,The role Christopher Reeve was born to play.,10,23 September 2006,"I was watching look, up in the sky: the amazing story of Superman a few months ago, and they were showing all the different actors that tried out for Superman/Clark Kent. NONE of them pulled it off like the late great Christopher Reeve did. I just saw this movie in its entirety for the first time, and it was much, much better than I expected it to be. All the performances were great: Kidder, Hackman, Brando, and of course the main man. It truly surprises me how easily Reeve pulled off being the clumsy, bumbling Clark Kent and the calm, confident man of steel. This may very well be the best superhero movie ever, but people say Superman II is even better. If it's better than this one, I'll definitely check it out.",Superman

255,k_g_barreto,"A true classic, worthy of the world's greatest superhero",9,3 December 2019,"Watched this film yesterday for the first time, forty years after its release, and still holds its magic. I watched the 3-hour-long cut, not the original cut, that I think it's better. I was sleepy in the first 30 minutes of the movie, but it's really not that boring. The 'prologue' with Jor-El and the end of Krypton was really good, liked Krypton design, but I am aware of the limitation they had back there. The rest just felt too long, somethint I think doesn't happen in the 2-hour-and-half original cut. When Clark's ships wrecks on earth, his teenagehood, lots of comteplative shots in the Kent's farm, Fortress of Solitude, no dialogue at all, it just felt too long.But the movie really starts to me when we see Daily Planet for the first time. Adult Clark introduction made me smirk. Christopher Reeve is perfect as both Superman and Clark Kent, and make you believe he's 'not' both. The scene where Clark take off his glasses, adopt a more confident posture and prepare to confess to Lois Lane he's Superman, but give up, put the glasses back to his face and adopt Clark Kent's persona, a insecure and awkward guy, is really good, and shows how Reeve is good at this role.Luthor was also good to me. Even if I don't like the whole 'hard into real estate' take, I like how he acts, with all his cockyness, ""Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive for both you and me? It's your weight and my IQ"" Not the best take, but a good one. I understand the goofiness, with Otis and Teschmacher, they need a comedic relief, and it is a family-friendly movie made for kids in the 70s, some people didn't like, but it was ok for me.And for a movie that was made four decades ago, the visual effects were really good, and I was impressed in the third act, with the earthquakes, it looked really 'palpable', real in some aspect, so as the space shots, but it was already made in Star Wars and before that 2001, so nothing that was never seen before.I think I could call Superman: The Movie timeless, even with the cheesy parts, Truth, Justice and the American Way, and featuring a 'dated' character to some. It's better than most MCU movies, and DCEU as well, captures the essence of the character, and the best example of this is the hero's theme, made by the genius John Williams, I loved the dialogues between Clark and Jor-El, and some other parts that evolved Superman to me. And the movie is cool, that's enough.",Superman

Not only is Superman a strong man, but inside, he has a tender and almost hurting sentimentality.  Reeve acts his role with directness, yet subtlety.Gene Hackman's semi-comic performance as Lex Luthor, ""the greatest criminal mind of our century!""  backs up Reeve's fine work.Other memorable faces -- Ned Beatty, Valerine Perine, and even the legendary Marlon Brando -- make this film a sight for sore x-ray vision.  There's a lot of depth here, but still a great amount of fun!",Superman
258,mrrockey,The One and Only Superman Origin!,9,30 July 2013,"Superman: The Movie is where it all started. Without this film, the superhero movie genre would never have even started. Yes, there were some films that helped the genre along the way such as Tim Burton's Batman, Blade, X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman Begins but this is the first superhero movie that had a huge budget, was serious in tone(with the exception of the Lex Luthor bits), and was a huge blockbuster. So knowing that, you probably already seen this film or at least know a bunch of scenes and lines from it. But with that being said, does this film still hold up after all these years? In one word, yes. Yes, it's a little corny and dated in spots but overall it still holds up and here's why. Firstly, it's an epic. Most superhero movies today are very basic in plot structure and feel very small in scale(Iron Man, Thor, Captain America) but this film has a huge long plot and although it doesn't have a lot of action, it still fells like an epic because of the way it spans over years of his journey becoming Superman. In fact, we don't see Christopher Reeve until at least 45 minutes into the film, and yet, this film isn't boring. The first act in the film is the story of how Krypton gets destroyed and how Jor-El sends his son, Kal-El into planet Earth. What really works about this act, is that we don't just see him launch the ship to Earth and then the planet explodes. Instead, we see the drama that Jor-El and Lara face as they realize that planet Krypton is approaching its doom and how there's nothing they can do about it. The scene where they decide to send their son to Earth is a very touching scene and it's great that the writers chose not to have them just send him away quickly as the planet's exploding to make it more exciting. The second act in the film is the story of Kal-El, or Clark Kent as he's named by his foster parents Jonathan and Martha Kent having problems fitting in with his amazing abilities(super strength, speed, hearing etc). He wants to show the world what he can do but Jonathan wants him to keep it a secret and moments later, he dies of a heart attack. I like how while this act is dramatic, it doesn't feel too much of a downer like Man of Steel did. We get some fun stuff along the way too like when Clark runs with his super speed as fast as a train. After Jonathan dies, Clark discovers the Fortress of Solitude which is a replica of Krypton where Jor-El's consciousness reveals to him where he came from and what he was destined to do on Earth, to inspire hope in others as Superman. This scene has a bit of 70s cheese to it with the space effects going on as Jor-El's educating Clark but I love the shot of him flying out of the Fortress as Superman.The third act is when Clark finally becomes Superman, stops a bunch of crimes, gets romantically involved with Lois Lane, and has to stop Lex Luthor's scheme of blowing up lands and taking them over. Not only does he develop the identity of Superman but he also has the alter ego of Clark Kent, a shy and clumsy reporter of Daily Planet. One thing that's different with this Clark Kent than with the previous George Reeves Clark is that he isn't a confident, upstanding guy like George was which I prefer. I mean, think about it. When all he has to disguise himself is a pair of glasses and a different way of combing his hair, he needs to create a different personality for himself. So this provides a far-fetched but entertaining way of making the audience believe that he can actually fool people like that. Christopher Reeve really shines as Superman, he's confident, charming, witty, handsome, and intimidating when he's dealing with Lex Luthor. The scene where he's interviewed by Lois is really clever and charming and results in a romantic flight set to a great John Williams score. But how's the villain?Lex Luthor in this film has often been criticized by fans for being played by Gene Hackman in a comedic and goofy tone but you know what, I think he's hilarious! His arrogance for his intellect and his interactions with Ms. Tesmacher and Otis is just comedy genius in my opinion. But this is a villain all up to taste, if you don't like villains that are played for laughs instead of menace then this movie might not be for you. But I think he fits perfectly into the tone of this film.So those are the things I love about this movie but here's some things that bothered me. The film is essentially about responsibility and Jor- El even tells Clark in the Fortress not to interfere with the course of human events but he ends up spinning the Earth backwards to turn back time to save Lois from the earthquake caused by Lex's missiles. I wouldn't mind this even though it's not scientifically accurate but it bothers me how he gets no consequences from this. I also think that while the special effects looked great for the time, it doesn't look that great today. But it is 35 years old now so it's expected.But overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it to all comic-book fans, film fans, or just casual movie-goers. Just don't expect to see the modern Lex Luthor on film. If you want that, then watch Superman: The Animated Series instead. I give it a 8/10.",Superman
259,movieguy81007,One of the Best Superman Movies,10,16 January 2007,"Superman is one of the best Superman movies. Christopher Reeve does a good job as Clark Kent/Superman, Margot Kidder does a good job as Lois Lane and Gene Hackman does a good job as Lex Luthor. I wish Christopher Reeve never died. This movie was well directed by Richard Donner. I even like his Lethal Weapon movies. I do not want to forget that Marlon Brando did a good job as Jor-El. I like the score by John Williams. I like the production design by John Barry and I like the photography by Geoffery Unsworth. This movie has a great starting. Even Superman Returns uses the same starting. I thought Superman Returns was better then the original Superman.",Superman
260,SHB_73,The greatest Superhero movie ever.,10,6 January 2005,"It was only a matter of time when the Superman comic Strip would be adopted into a major motion picture, and in 1978 it came to be. The movie basically tells the origin of Kalel, the last survivor of the distant planet of Krypton who is rocketed to earth before the planet explodes. On earth he is discovered by the Kents and given the name Clark Kent who soon realize he is no ordinary boy. The movie proceeds with young Clark struggling to keep his powers a secret. Until the day comes when he moves into the big city and saves Lois Lane revealing himself to the world. The movie combines great special effects with a wonderful storyline that is lacking in so many Superhero movies of today which tend to focus more on action than story. This movie works on all levels from action, story, special effects and the cast which includes Oscar winners and acting legends Marlon Brando as Jorel, Kalel's father and Gene Hackman who plays Superman's arch enemy Lex Luthor and is probably one of the best cinema movie villains. But the movie belongs to newcomer Christopher Reeve who I can say with confidence that no one could have played Superman better. Reeve makes you believe he is Superman and whenever he switches to his alter ego Clark Kent he convinces you that they are two different people. Margo Kidder also makes a good Lois Lane and Ned Beatty is hysterical as Luthors lovable but dumb sidekick Otis. The Tagline for the movie was ""You will believe a man can fly."" and they were right.",Superman
261,GEM-20,I do believe he can fly,8,29 July 2001,"One of the great joys of the Superman character was his bright, upbeat, and positive nature. His adventures took place in daylight, not darkness. He was invincible, with magical powers we all wished we had. The world loved him and he was a true hero.This is the antithesis of Batman, who was dark, mysterious, brooding, and elusive. There are no hidden sides to Superman from the fans of the comics and films. Surely, he tried to keep his identity from everyone while being Clark Kent, but that was all, and we were in on the secret.Batman maintained a great cloak from everyone in Gotham. We were not entirely sure what his next move was going to be. Countless times, even Robin and Alfred failed to understand him.While this makes Batman an interesting character, (I am a Batman fan) it opened up a serious problem in translating him to film. In the '60s, he appears in a campy TV series. In 1989, director Tim Burton decided to dispense with the established backstory that was published in DC Comics, in favor of an inferior one where the Joker was the killer of Bruce Wayne's parents.In the 1978 film, the producers of Superman lovingly embraced Superman's origins. He was sent to Earth by his parents as Krypton was destroying itself. He is found by Martha and Jonathan Kent and raised to adulthood. He moves to Metropolis to work for the Daily Planet with Lois Lane, and Perry White is his boss.The film won Academy Awards for music and visual effects. Did Batman win any? Let's face it, under the wonderful direction of Richard Donner, and the beautiful cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth, no other hero film comes close.While the 1989 Batman film was lauded for having cast Jack Nicholson as the joker, Superman has casting in spades: Christopher Reeve is great as Superman; Gene Hackman chews up and savors his role as Lex Luthor; even though short, Marlon Brando does a beautiful job playing Jor-El, Superman's father. Glenn Ford also had a short role as Jonathan Kent, but he made the best of it.There is more. Margot Kidder is a perfect Lois. On the DVD, you can watch screen-tests of other actresses auditioning for the part. None had the magic of Kidder.Let's not overlook the wonderful casting of Jackie Cooper as Perry White. He had perhaps the funniest line in the film: while telling his reporters he wanted a story on Superman, he says that getting an interview with Superman will be the single most important interview since God spoke to Moses!!Let me give a special recommendation here. In 2001, Warner has remastered the film and released it on video and DVD. If you can, get the DVD, because the extras are incredible: three documentaries on making the film; the screen tests of the actors; theatrical trailers and a TV commercial; a written history of the Superman character; deleted scenes and audio out-takes; Dolby Digital 5.1 sound remastering, and more. For anyone who loves this film, the disc is the ultimate.Lastly, this is a film you can share with your family, not full of foul language or violence. Go for it!",Superman
262,bethlori,The best superman movie ever!!,7,22 April 2021,This movie was boring to me at first but I watched it when I was like 6 so yeah but I just watched it and the special effects are just flawless!! It starts out with like a 20 to 30 minute story of how they banned a band of criminals then marlin Brando says the planet is gonna die they have a laughing spill then rumble rumble they send little Superman to earth then we spend 5 minutes just hearing and watching Superman shoot off in to space with joe el talking!! Then finally he comes to earth naked and like not just a flash of a butt no full frontal nudity!! Disturbing!! I was scarred for life after watching that!! Then he picks up the car then these people take him in he grows up to be a out sider then he runs home!! His dad says he is special then has a heart attack!! A sad funeral blah blah blah!!! He then grows to be a middle aged man working for a news paper and makes friends with Lois lane we go on a second plot- Lois lanes love for Superman!! They fly together for like 20 minutes borin!! Then we go to lex Luther with his plan to destroy California!! What a stupid plot why not have him blow up earth!! The rest is history!! This movie is like 2 hours long very long!! The original script was like 400 to 500 pages long!! Gosh that's long they cut out a lot of the script!! So enjoy this horrible review and movie!!!,Superman
263,fullonrobotchubby,Not a bad first try.,5,17 August 2006,"I've had conversations about favorite movies and the worst movies, but one time a new topic came up: What movie fits right smack dab in the middle? What movie is completely half and half with good and bad parts? Personally and so far, Superman is my top candidate for this position. On its behalf, it wisely goes over the usual movie ending time limit and gives more to the fans. The visual effects were done well considering the era, Christopher Reeve set a high bar to leap for any other who dares to play the Man of Steel, and the score by John Williams fits the hero to a T. The movie is indeed revolutionary in the comics-to-movie genre, but great Caesar's ghost are there a lot of glaring errors! Let's at least have the visual effects make sense! I always pity AND laugh at those three actors in the float away prison square or whatever that crap's supposed to be. Marlon Brando gives nothing to the movie except his name and orange skin (while he got $3.7 million and only 13 days of work on the set), and it seems like Mario Puzo wrote a final script with napkin pages. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is just as much of a clown as his assistants (Ned Beatty shouldn't pick on the mentally retarded like that), and finally, can anyone point out anything appealing about Margot Kidder's Lois Lane? She sure didn't do any feminists any favors by dorking out around Superman every meeting. My favorite scene happens in Smallville, when young Clark Kent gets left behind by peers, races a locomotive for a short cut, and greets his twerp comrades with a smirk. This at least fed Superfans a little of the nectar they were after. Cheesy or not, this is a necessary film for any movie buff, especially the ones who, God help them, want to fully understand the career and choices of Marlon Brando.",Superman
264,clh-1,The greatest...,10,22 May 2004,"The absolute best of the Comic Book adaptations. The great thing is that it predates the current run of the superhero movies by twenty years and it still out classes them. The special effects are great and the casting is the best and truest of all the Superhero films ever to be made. The story has the right mix of everything. Humor, action, tragedy, uplifting excitement. Christopher Reeve actually flew off the pages of the comics as far as I am concerned. It totally ruled! 10/10 **** two thumbs up and I give it an A+The direction was also great too bad richard donner was fired from Superman II. It could have been that the sequel really outdid the original and stayed off the disappointment of Superman III",Superman
265,Dock-Ock,"A Classic, but the best is still to come.",8,23 May 2001,"Superman : The movie, is first and formost a breakthrough movie of the genre. It takes itself seriously, and every penny is put on the screen. However the good visuals and the excellent interpetation of the character by Christopher Reeve, plus the superb support from the likes of Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder, remain he best thing about the movie. At  times it tends to take itself too seriously, and goes over board with melodramatics and sentimentality. For a true exciting and close to comic book perfection watch Richard Lesters Superman II [1980]. Top marks to the spirited direction from Richard Donner. The flying scenes, well, do make you believe a man can fly. The production is designed wonderfully and looks excellent. Metropolis looks like Metropolis and Krypton looks like Krypton [they are both Pine wood]. Overall this is Christopher Reeve's movie. He is Superman. He fills the suit and it fits nicely. His performance will be a hard one to top for any actor in the future who assumes to role. And John Williams music is also brilliant [although in my opinion better interpetated by Ken Thorne in future movies]. So, yes, a classic. But the best was yet to come.",Superman
266,zurnderrick,"Cheesy, yes, but still a true classic",8,27 August 2009,"Superman is one of the greatest super heroes of all time, and Richard Donner's Superman does not stray too far from his comic book purpose. It is a fun, action packed super hero film with one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen in film.Christopher Reeves is great as Superman, he really brings out a lot of the hero from the comics. Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman are also great as Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. The special effects are also something to bring up. I love it when Superman spins around Earth several times, reversing Earth's rotation, causing him to travel into the past so he can save Lois. John William's score is also something to bring up. Heisthe one that brought us that title theme we think of as soon as we hear Superman.Superman is a fun super hero film that has a lot going for it. It may be cheesy and campy at parts, but it is still a delight to watch.",Superman

A fantasy world where truth, justice, and the American way is not John Wayne BUT Superman!The character of Superman has his flaws like a pair of glasses being his disguise and a green rock being his only weakness but he is still a great character that symbolizes hope and Richard Donner does a magnificent job of capturing that in this motion picture that's full of hope and excitement.You'll truly believe a man can fly!RATING: 4 STARS (****)",Superman
268,Rovin,Possibly the best comic to movie adaptation,8,15 March 2000,"Superman was the first film I saw in a theater(after seeing everything else in drive ins). I never wanted to see a movie through a  windshield after seeing this one!It was a truly epic film--and after watching it again recently--definitely superior in quality and care to the Batman films(INCLUDING Burton's overrated contributions). These days no filmmaker wants to depict a comic book character in their traditional costume--they  want to cast physically inappropriate actors, and make the costumes out of rubber--as if this makes them more real(its a movie people!!!Who wants reality???). The filmmakers were very smart in the way they introduced Superman to Metropolis by having a bystander comment on his costume--that was all the ""reality"" they needed. It gets a laugh out of the audience and allows the character to be himself. Superman shows that you can take a character in a  ridiculous costume seriously--if the filmmakers treat the character seriously. It helps that Reeve was a very good choice for the role. I think i would have preferred a more serious Lex Luther, and a more fantastic threat(alien monsters, robots etc) but as delivered the film is quality(as is its sequel). Donner and Puzo deserve alot of credit for treating Superman with respect. It shows on the screen.",Superman
269,Adam-the-tall-1,Just a classic.,9,8 October 2020,"This movie was truly breathtaking. I recently rewatched it and I'm amazed at how well it holds up. Every actor in this movie will forever be the definitive version of that character, Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman in particular. If you didn't like this, you're lying to yourself because you want to be edgy. Yes, this is silly and campy, but that's part of why",Superman
270,fraserkieran,Casting alone makes this great,10,1 March 2020,"Not only does this film have an interesting origins story but the action and acting alone are more then enough to make this great. I often consider this and godfather two films where you cant find a fault in the cast.

271,killbill_28,Still The Best Super Hero Movie,10,19 May 2006,"I recently just saw this movie on DVD in its Director's Cut version. And I must say that this movie still rocks the house in special effects, action, story and music! Richard Donner and his crew did a great job bringing Superman to the big screen. The story is simple, the action is great, the special effects are mind blowing and the music is powerful!!! The late Christopher Reeve played the best Superman and really brought the character to life. Gene Hackman is pure evil as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder played best Lois Lane you have ever seen. I still think that this is the best super hero movie ever made. (Spiderman and Batman were still good).The DVD of the film is A+, the picture has been cleaned up really well, its nice and sharp with no grain. The remastered sound which is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital is loud, clean and very sharp. They also added new sound effects in the movie, its ashame that they didn't release it in DTS sound! This is still the best Superman movie to date. See this movie if you haven't yet. You will be surprised. 10 of out 10!",Superman
272,epatters-3,Best Superman movie,9,4 June 2008,"What a great film. One of the best Superhero movies ever. I have been a big fan of these movies since when I was 6 I believe. This is one of my favorites. R.I.P Marlon Brando and R.I.P Christopher Reeve. I own a box set of the first 4 Superman movies and of the 5 films this is my favorite one in the series. If you have not seen it, please, rent it, buy it, whatever. It is fun. It is Rated PG. It is good for the family. The acting is excellent. Richard Donner does a fantastic job at directing this film. A great script. Superman's costume is great. Christopher Reeve is excellent as the man of steel. It is a classic. If you are a fan of superhero flicks, then this is for you. My overall rating is 8 out of 10 stars. I highly recommend this film. Enjoy. Thank you.",Superman
273,TheOnlyOwen01,The definitive superhero origin story,9,30 August 2021,"There's no denying that Superman (1978) is a groundbreaking film. Yes, a lot of the effects are pretty dated but this is truly a landmark in cinema. Without it, we probably wouldn't have The Dark Knight trilogy or the MCU. It was made at a time where making superhero movies was considered childish and juvenile but Richard Donner (Rest In Peace, good sir) pulled it off.One thing this film nails is that it has the absolute best opening credits in movie history. I can't think of something that's more stylish and at the same time epic as that. It's sets the tone for the film perfectly: an epic superhero film about a man with incredible powers who's a symbol of hope and it keeps that tone throughout the whole movie.Performances are iconic to say the least. Christopher Reeve is still the definitive Superman. Despite Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill being good in the role, nobody stops Reeves. Gene Hackman steals every scene he's in as Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder is a wonderful Lois Lane and the legendary Marlon Brando is, of course, fantastic as Jor-El. This film also perfectly embodies Superman as a character and what he means. He's hopeful, heartwarming and heroic.One issue I have with this film is unfortunately the effects. Some of them are really dated. It's quite sad considering that these were groundbreaking at the time but they haven't aged well. Some of them look pretty good as well as some cool set design and cinematography though.On an overall scale, Superman (1978) is a fantastic film. To this day, it's my favorite Superman film and my favorite origin film. And I can't end this review without mentioning the absolutely fantastic score from God himself: John Williams. This has got to be my favorite thing he's ever done. Just phenomenal. Highly recommend this film.",Superman

So, there is no doubt that the movie about the world's most iconic hero has become an icon within itself.Superman The Movie charmed, dazzled, and thrilled countless audiences in its initial release during the Holiday Season of 1978. Although Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando were advertised as the stars of the production, little did the public know that soon they wouldn't be able to say the name Superman without the face of the late Christopher Reeve coming to mind.From the brilliant and vibrant score by John Williams, to the epic direction by Richard Donner, Superman The Movie will no doubt live on in America's heart as a true classic, and the first of its kind, never to be outdone.",Superman

276,zach-69,Reeve is Superman!,10,11 November 2006,"First off, I love the Superman Movies! Christopher Reeve knew how to bring Superman and Clark Kent to life. He is one of the greatest actor's I have ever known. He was hysterical as Clark, very strong, but gentle as Superman. He just had that screen presence that made me want to watch Superman over and over and over and over and over! The sequels to the movie were great too! I love the rest of the cast! Now, last years Superman Returns, SUCKED! Bryan Singer didn't know what he's doing! Brandon Routh is one of the worst actor's I have ever seen! He doesn't resemble Chris, he looks like Lois and Clark's Dean Cain from the t.v. show. Yuck! So many things wrong with the film! I hated it! Smallville, YEEEEEHAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!! Smallville got me back into enjoying Superman, then I saw Christopher's Superman Movies again. I LOVE SMALLVILLE! Sure, Clark isn't flying yet but Tom Welling is soaring!!!!! He is one of my favorite actor's! The first episode I saw of Smallville, I thought Tom was Chris by mistake. LOL!! He is the spitting image of Chris, he's funny, energetic, brings out Clark Kent like never before! Smallville is the story of Clark Kent in his pre-Superman years. Tom has those same intense, bright blue Superman eye's that Chris had! Brandon Routh's eye's are naturally brown, HE WORE CONTACT LENSES FOR THE MOVIE! AAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!! Tom is Chris' successor in the mythology! In the episode Whisper, Clark get's blinded by Kryptonite, toward's the end of the episode he get's his sight back, and for the very first time wears glasses, and he looks EXACTLY like Christopher Reeve..... I KID YOU NOT! Tom should have been Superman, not Routh! My advice: See Christopher's Superman movie's there are four in total, watch Smallville, and completely skip Superman Returns! I guarantee Tom will excite you, he's a treasure and stands proudly next to Christopher Reeve. (Tom and Chris knew each other before Chris passed away on October 10,2004.) He will alway's be Superman! WATCH SMALLVILLE! ROCK ON TOM!",Superman
277,brijess-2,An Epic Film!,8,31 January 2003,"Watching Superman The Movie is an experience. Not only are you treated to a film good for the kids, but there are also many moments that will thrill adults. The movie is filled with emotion, action and incredible excitement.
The movie opens with long introductions about Superman's past and his time growing up on Earth. We are treated wish such scenes as his launch into space, his ""naked"" discovery on Earth and his ""calling"" to go north. All of this fills pretty much the first hour of the film but we are never once bored.Once the action moves to Metropolis, it is almost like a whole new movie. The interaction between Lois and Clark is simply priceless. Their early scenes together build on what is to come, even moving into Superman II. Margo Kidder was perfect for this role. She just had the right look for Lois: attractive without being a Super Model. It was just so sweet how Superman took to her. We are also introduced to Lex Luthor and his gang. Gene Hackman was perfect for this role and he really steals ever scene that he is in. The thing about Superman is that it has an epic feel to it and it never looks back. From the launch of ""baby"" Superman to the climatic ending sequences, we are drawn into the story. The witty dialogue is also one of the best aspects of the film. Whether it is the nonchalant comments from Superman (i.e. ""Bad Vibrations"") to the famous, clap inducing ""You've Got Me? Who's got you?"" you never feel that any of the film is scripted. And the special effects, while dated (the miniatures LOOK miniature), are also extremely good. The DVD version is an absolute joy. You get 9 minutes of new footage, including more scenes in the Fortress of Solitude with Marlon Brando. There are several behind the scenes looks and several trailers and cast bios. The enhanced sound is also very impressive. When the credits at the beginning started to appear and then fly by, I was just taken back! I wasn't expecting it at all and it was a taste of things to come. You can even hear shards of kryptonite flying through space after Krypton explodes.
Superman The Movie is one of the best comic book movies in the same tradition of greats like Dick Tracy and The Shadow. If you or your kids have never seen it, this is a must have. If you have, relive the magic again.",Superman
278,Russell Dodd,My all time favourite,10,13 July 1999,"This is a wonderful film.  It has to be said.  Fantastic script, direction and acting, the greatest soundtrack ever to come out of the movies and a source of inspiration for us all. Reeve is perfect as the man of steel, strange visitor from another planet and who arrives in Metropolis in time to thwart Luthor's plan of making a killing(literally) on the real estate. The atmospheric score and the ensemble of scenes cover a broad scope of emotions.  From sadness and sentimentality of Smallville to awe and wonder of the Superman March, used throughout the last 2/3rds of the film, the triumphant love theme stands out most of all as Superman treats Lois Lane to a romantic flight of the city.  Exciting, dynamic and brilliant.Only 2 moans:  The time reversal business had no logic and Margot Kidder's recital of 'can you read my mind?'This is a film for all the family.  A must see.  A film worthy of repeated viewing.",Superman

Now living in Metropolis, Clark takes up a job as a reporter for the Daily Planet and starts to fall head over heals for fellow reporter Lois Lane. But then Clark is also using his powers to help the better of mankind as Superman, who the people of Metropolis start turning to for help. But in the shadows, criminal genius Lex Luthor launches a sinister plan to make himself known by detonating two missiles in different parts of the country with only Superman to oppose him. Will Superman save us? Or will Luthor's plan succeed?Richard Donner (who directed The Omen and Lethal Weapon) did a fantastic job on the Superman movie because he's the best director in Hollywood. Christopher Reeve is the best Superman in classic cinema. Also Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor are also great. It's the First Live-Action Movie of The Superman Franchise. It's got Action, Adventure, Drama, Romance and Sci-fi in it. My favourite Scenes are Superman saves people, hangs out with Lois Romantically and Saves everyone from the Sean Andreas Earthquake. I've watched it so many timesI give the movie 10/10Thanks for ReadingNow Available to Buy on iTunes, Google Play, 4K UHD, Blu-Ray and DVD.",Superman
282,adudewhoiscool,One of the best comic-to-movie adaptations ever!,10,31 August 2006,"I saw ""Superman"" for the first time and I regret not seeing this earlier. The idea of seeing the ""Superman"" movies first came up when I started seeing the trailers for Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns."" Unfortunately, I decided against seeing them because I thought they would be too cheesy for this day and age. Now after seeing this, I appreciate ""Superman Returns"" even more since I could finally identify the tribute that Bryan Singer made to Richard Donner's classic. Some of this is cheesy, but currently with all of the comic book movies available now, I really did not mind it. At 2 hrs 31 minutes, there never was a dull moment.The infant Kal-El, of the planet Krypton, makes his journey to Earth in a ship constructed by his father, Jor-El, just as the planet explodes. He grows up to be a perfectly normal newspaper reporter named Clark Kent. Clark Kent learns of his real identity from the ghost of Jor-El. He has great powers - he can fly, outrun a train, and lift up a 1-ton truck. One night, after leaving work, he sees a helicopter crash on the building's roof. From that night on, he will be known by a new name, Superman. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has plans that would wipe out the California coastline. Superman must race against time before millions of innocent people are killed.The casting is excellent. What makes ""Superman"" so marvelous is the performance of Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-el. If Christopher Reeve did not do a good job, this would be bad. Besides Reeve, Gene Hackman also steals the show. Gene Hackman portrays Lex Luthor the same way that Jack Nicholson portrayed the Joker eleven years later in Tim Burton's ""Batman."" It was campy and silly, but very fun. Marlon Brando gives a great performance as Jor-el, though he was only there for 30 minutes. Margot Kidder, though her voice is very irritating, portrayed a decent Lois Lane. Kidder and Reeve had excellent chemistry together and ""Superman"" succeeds because of that.I cannot review a ""Superman"" movie without discussing the John Williams score. He is a genius and if I were in charge of making a blockbuster movie, I would have John Williams because everything John Williams touches turns to gold. The same can be said about the ""Superman"" theme. When I think of John Williams, I think of the ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" theme first, but this is still classic and it holds well today, as evident in ""Superman Returns."" Visually, ""Superman"" still holds up, even in today's standards. Never did I watch the movie and think, ""It is obvious wires were used."" I am sure everybody, after viewing this in 1978, believed that a man could fly. Those days, because of it's time, a director had to do more then use amazing visual affects to impress a crowd (which is plagued by movies today) and Richard Donner did that here.I have nothing bad to say about this film. ""Superman"" was ahead of its time and the evidence is known by being considered the very first epic comic book movie. With the amazing score of John Williams, the directing of Richard Donner, and the casting of Lex Luthor and Superman, this is still one of the best comic-to-movie adaptations ever created. I recommend you skipping the rental because this movie is so amazing you will have to buy it right away.",Superman
283,tomasg-69814,SUPERMAN THE (EXTENDED) MOVIE.,9,21 June 2018,"I intend to give a review on the long TV-version, who´s release last year on Blu-Ray made most Super-fans delighted.I myself found it very enchanting, and think that the added material are very well sewed in, and enriched the experience of watching Superman The Movie.Some seconds here and there, a few never seen shots even some hard core fans never had seen before. 
You don´t mind that the sound not is in full surround stereo - besides the opening and final credits - because the now ""complete"" cut is so great fun to watch.Yes, I know that this otherwise great movie lacks of a gripping plot.
Some say It´s a slow and dull story, that mainly fills the last quarter only.But I see it different.
This 55 or so million dollar budget show is to me an example of the perfect mix of great Sci-Fi, Drama, Comedy and Family stuff.1970's style.The typical photo, the classic angles. And of course the great special effects, and a most enjoyable dynamic soundtrack from the mastermind of John Williams.Putting the Theatrical, Special and Extended editions among each other in a sort of head-to-head triangle is unfair.Director Richard Donner perfers his S.E, of course, saying that it was uneccesary to put in in ""all the crap stuff we got rid of"".
(His comment to the WB 183 minute version.)One man´s coffee is another man´s cappuchino, Richard.....For me the experience of the Extended version was the creme de la creme.Why moaning about something so classic, wichever take you watch - or perfer?Like ""Star Wars"", who had it´s premiere the year earlier, the production team wanted and needed a few well known superstar actors to lift the cred up.Every Superman fan - I think - knows all about the struggleing Marlon Brando stuff. Not gonna tell it here.Gene Hackman was in first ancuios about his repetation as a serious actor, if he agreed to join - of what he thought it was - sort of a PG 7 movie.I´d bet that his fee, compared to his contribution to this movie, made his big Lex Luthor grin even larger, for months. 
(And knowing his Superman stuff was fullfilled, even for pt. II.)
But....you can´t imagine anyone else today fill his shoes in this.
He did his proffessional job great.Chris Reeve was one in about 200. 
One of a couple of hundred screen-testers, who finally impressed the team so much that he got the job.Refusing to wear a muscle-fillout suit, he built up his Superman himself.
(Supported by Star Wars bad boy Darth Vader....physically played in the first SW-trilogy by body builder David Prowse.)R.I.P, Christopher Reeve.
The red boots will never be worn by any other, with that dignity.My short summary of the Superman - The Movie ( The ""Cuts"" aside now.)Great Krypton opening. Touching Kal-El take-off.Impressing landing on earth scene. Houmorus, but with drama.-Smallville part: Great. (+ greater....)
-First Fortress of solitude scenes, +(Jor-El´s eduecation.)Then we take off!And see Chris fly.And you already know the rest.-Takes a newspaper job. ( As Clark K.)
-Supringsly fast falling in love with Lois.
Or she, with him?
(Margot Kidder; great!)
-1st superman show-off.
-Lex L. enteres, villian plans as if it´s a 007-movie.
-Rockets!!
-Superman hurries to fix up the earthquake.
-But misses Lois!""If I could turn back time....""Puts Lex and Otis behind bars.
Smile to the camera!!You know all about this, Superfans.I will Quit here.
If You Please.The original movie promised ""Next year Superman II"" in their ending credits.
(Delayed by many reasons not mentioned here.)I´m done with my Superman review. For Good.",Superman
284,Bats_Breath,"Best Comic Book Film Ever, but you probably won't like it if you were born after 1981",10,7 January 2002,"This is the best comic book to movie EVER.  But I do realize that this film really doesn't appeal to anyone born after 1981.  Granted, I was born in 1975, and I myself really can't remember when this film first came out in 1978, BUT, this movie and the sequels were still very popular in the early and mid '80s---which I do remember.  ABC reran the Superman films till about 1986 or 1987.  Every year kids and adults could count on seeing Superman and/or Superman II roughly twice a year. It was a cool little event for us.  People born after 1981 really would have missed that time when this film and it's sequels were still on a high. They were just too young.  I realize that that there are people born after '81 that are Superman fans, but usually they fall into two categories:A)They are film students and realize what a MONUMENTAL accomplishment Superman: The Movie is and how underrated it is.  After all, this film had legendary cinematographer Geoffery Unsworth, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Trevor Howard, Jackie Coooper and Star Wars designer John Barry working on this film.  Also featuring Juliard trained actor Christopher Reeve and respected director Richard Donner.B)Someone somehow exposed these films to them at a young age.  Maybey throught video tape or for whatever reason they weren't as superficial as their peers.Even by the late '80s, I remember kids my age already began dissing Superman The Movie, because the Tim Burton Batman film was coming out and this film was seen as dated.  Now those were kids MY age.  We grew up with this film. So I know most people younger then me hate this film and rip into Superman for being dated from the late '70s and early '80s.  As for people my age, I know that even when they dissed this film in the late '80s, everyone my age or close to my age will always have special place in their heart for Superman The Movie.Finally, when I went to buy the Superman SE DVD back in May of 2001. I went to my local Best Buy and the 17 year old clerk at the counter said ""Suuuuuuuperman"" very sarcastically.  I embarassingly said, ""Yeah it's cool, you should check it out"".  I guess I figured he may be my age or at least close to my age.  He slammed his scanner thingy on the counter, looked up at the ceiling, rolled his eyes and began bobbing his head as he said, ""Uhhhh, well you see Superman is a bit before my time.  Superman seemed more like an '80s thing. The only Superman I know of is that Lois and Clark show"".  He then handed my bag to me in disgust and said, ""I was only born in '83"".  I restrained myself from beating the kid seneless.  Weird thing was I worked at the same Best Buy only 5 years ago when I was 20. This 17 year old kid was quite a bit younger then me yes, 7-8 years, but he we weren't 15 years apart or something like that.  He treated me like a 50 year old man buying a Beattles CD or John Lennon or something.  Anyway, this encounter confirmed what I always knew----very few people born after 1981 like Superman The Movie.  To them it's ""Eaaaa--aaauuuu, the '80s!""",Superman
285,nirome,The Superhero movie on which all other superhero movies are based on,10,11 January 2019,"I'll start off by saying right off the bat, that this is probably my favourite superhero movie for numerous reasons. I happen to be a huge fan of the comic book character, always have been, ever since I was a kid. This is probably the first superhero movie that I remember watching as a kid and I have very fond memories of it. That's one reason.
The second one, is that, as an adult, I really got to appreciate how much work and above all, how much love was put into bringing this wonderful character to the big screen. Before the Salkinds did it successfully, no one had dared attempt something like this on such a huge scale. No expense was spared. They threw everything at it. They started out by trying to get the best cast that was available at the time to play the main roles and after exhausting and never ending casting auditions, with some pretty crazy ideas about who was going to play Superman, names like Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman were thrown out there, they finally settled on the one man who would forever, in my mind, embody the best attributes of the character. Everything from set and costume design, special effects, sound design, script, acting, cinematography and a truly memorable score by John Williams, probably his best soundtrack, is top notch.
The three act structure of the movie is clearly defined, not only tonally but also visually. We've got the other worldly and wonderfully eerie visual look of the scenes that take place on Krypton, the bucolic and almost dream like quality of the scenes that take place in Smallville during Clark Kent's teenage years and the bustling and fast pace of the city life in the Metropolis-set scenes. The movie moves along a very quick pace, no dead spaces, it is superbly and tightly edited and masterfully directed by Richard Donner.
The third reason is that this movie managed to catch lightning in a bottle at a time where nobody, neither the producers nor the audience believed in the Superhero genre. Dooner's paved the way for future producers and directors to try and emulate what this movie achieved. Has deeply inspired directors the likes of Raimi, Nolan, Singer, with different levels of success, to put out some of their best work. Raimi with Spiderman 2 and Nolan with Batman Begins have been by far the best exponents of what can be achieved when a filmmaker is truly motivated and inspired.
And fourth and final reason. To date, no movie has portrayed or been as faithful to its source material as this movie is.
Kudos to Donner and the Salkinds for giving us one of the best movies of the 20th Century and the best example of how a Superhero movie must be made.",Superman
286,ZookGuy,One Of the Best Superhero Films So Far,9,28 May 2007,"I was flipping through channels when I found Superman on HBO Family, and I liked it from the start. And for it's time, it had very impressive special effects. Sure it's a bit campy, but thats the fun of it. Marlon Brando was so good as Superman's father on Krypton, but he was only in the film for about seven minutes (He got crushed by a meteor or something that destroyed Superman's home planet.) And Gene Hackman's excellent as Lex Luthor, the maniacal, homicidal, super-rich, super-evil villain (I'll bet you Jack Nicholason learned a few tips by watching Hackman in this movie for his role as the Joker in the ten-years latter film Batman.)Christopher Reeves does a high-flying job as the high-flying superhero. What makes this film have so much wonder is that it's like other superhero films and comic books earlier, but than it's not like them. So all and all, Supermen is a fine superhero movie, just don't watch the sequels besides the Bryan Singer one.",Superman
287,georgeredding,"exciting, great cast, excitement for kids and high humor for adults",8,14 April 2021,"Though the story is eternally far-fetched, it does make for great viewing, and that's mainly because of the photographic effects. The cast is well-picked.It starts off with Krypton being self-destructed, thanks to Jorel, (Marlon Brando) finding guilty three persons who are insurrections. Callow (sp) (?) Jorel's son who becomes Superman, ends up falling to Earth; Susannah York is great as Callow's mother. After the baby Callow falls to Earth, specifically in Smallville, IA to a family known as the Kents, his ""earthly father (played well by Glenn Ford,) is truly a loving father; the mother's name is Martha Clark Kent.Jackie Cooper is excellent as the boisterous editor of the newspaper the Daily Planet, Margot Kidder does well as the adorable lady with whom Kent becomes so taken, Valerie Perrine as the not-so-nice girl Miss Tessmacher is perfect in this role, Ned Beatty is wonderfully stupid, and Gene Hackman, as the diabolical Lex Luther fits into his role well. Though he was not well-known at all, Jeff East does well as the teenage Clark Kent. And Christopher Reevesis perfect for the part of

288,mathijsschaap,Simply a masterpiece,8,25 September 2015,"Today it would have been Christopher Reeve's 63th birthday and what way to remember the legendary man than by reviewing this movie?Christopher Reeve is my all-time hero. As a child, I was hypnotized by his performance as Superman. He was the first and last hero I ever wanted to be. Who can forget the legendary way he portrayed Clark Kent and Superman?This movie was the first superhero movie that took it out of the campy image. Richard Donner approached the story as a true story. He did his homework. Yes, some effects are outdated and yes, it still has some campy elements. Marlon Brando's watch is an unforgivable little mistake, but in every way this movie is not worthy to be underrated for what it did in the history of cinema, especially for superhero movies.There would not have been X-Men like we know it now, let alone all the other superhero movies.This movie is legend, and so is the sequel in its Richard Donner's version.Christopher Reeve will always be the one and only Superman.",Superman

290,theojhyman,The true definition of an epic movie,10,19 March 2000,"An epic movie is something that comes along very rarely. It can only attain this status when there is the combination of every aspect of filmmaking working together to create a flawless piece of film: that is, the acting, direction, cinematography, editing, sound, music score and the script. Some common examples tha of an epic motion picture that I would agree with are Gone With The Wind, Ben Hur, The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Close Encounters, and more recently, Braveheart and even the animated Prince of Egypt. Superman (The Movie) was released the year I was born, but I was fortunate to see an original print of it in the cinema just a few years ago. I must have seen it well over 200 times, but every time there is something new to be picked up. This is because of the combination of factors, starting with Christopher Reeve's simply amazing performance, portraying Superman and Clark Kent as two contrasting characters, giving Superman his strength, courage, modesty, pride and witty sense of humour, opposing this with Clark Kent's clumsy, cowardly, shy personality. Reeve's performance was in a class of its own, at a level, well above even those actors nominated for Oscars that year. Now, Christopher Reeve didn't make the movie and his performance could only have been enhanced and perfected because of such people as Richard Donner, Mario Puzo (and the many other writers) and also Geoffrey Unsworth, the cinematographer. Richard Donner's personal vision won through after a huge increase in the budget and an extremely long shoot. His dedication to the humanity within Superman's character and the reality within this fantasy made this film so believable that all critics and audiences at the time were astounded. Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography compares only to that seen in Gone With The Wind or Ben Hur. Every shot in Superman was a masterpiece - lit with absolute perfection. This can be seen through the contrasting styles used at the beginning on Krypton - fantastic and brightly lit, compared with the harsher, more grim and real light used to portray the city of Metropolis. Not only does this combination of so many writers succeed in creating a wonderful script, with such excellent wit and humour, drama and romance, but the story by Mario Puzo, with obvious input by Donner and Reeve as well help to make this motion picture a true epic. The way it moves from Krytpon to Smallville to Metropolis to the California finale, introducing and concentrating on so many different characters,  at different places and times, and doing this so successfully makes this film so compelling and fascinating for any viewer. With such an incredible number of characters and situations to include within one film, the editor Stuart Baird must be credited, along with Donner, to having made this film shine. Not many people could succeed in putting together a jigsaw puzzle that contained a million pieces and this film did. Along with Christopher Reeve was a huge cast. All these actors portayed their characters just perfectly - starting with Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Glenn Ford, Jeff East, Marc McClure, Valerie Perrine and of course Marlon Brando. When you look past his status as 'The Marlon Brando' and look at his portrayal of Jor-El, Superman's father, his performance also adds to the film's status as a true epic and masterpiece. Another aspect of the movie is the fact that, besides the astounding special and visual effects used at the time (which won an Oscar), the best thing is that they didn't have the technology of CGI and Reeve seemed to perfect the art of flying just as Superman would. Some might say that the most memorable aspect of the movie is John Williams spectacular score and whose composition of the Superman theme lifted the movie to even greater heights. Every aspect of this movie comes together in perfect harmony, creating a classic motion picture that should be re-released for its 25th Anniversary in cinemas worldwide...and perhaps, the only director, worthy of taking on the new 'Superman Lives' movie is Richard Donner, with assistance by Christopher Reeve.",Superman
291,theojhyman,Why isn't this way up in IMDB's top 250 ?,10,12 September 2002,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made - not in terms of Hollywood blockbusters and box-office grosses, but technically, creatively and artistically, this movie surpasses all the blockbusters of today. It is an amazing special effects movie without the technological facility provided by today's CGI. The cinematography is shot with an epic scope, reminiscent of the cinematic styles of Gone With The Wind and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cast is magnificent and the amazing thing is the lead role of Superman was an unknown actor - this is unheard of now in blockbusters, yet Chris Reeve proved to be the heart and soul of the movie, and his performance, along with Richard Donner's direction, makes this film stand the test of time - an all-time classic for all age groups. We wanna see a 25th Anniversary re-release in 2003 ! Now people - get voting and put this movie up in the IMDB Top 250 list where it belongs.",Superman

293,fdpedro,"""You will believe a man can fly.""",8,28 October 2003,"Created in the by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the late 1930s together with Batman, Superman eventually became the most popular super-hero in the entire world. Like the dark knight, the patriotic man of steel that suffered many changes (flying power), spin-offs (Superboy), and cheesy TV moments (Superfriends) over his long career. In the late 1970s, Warner Bothers decided to bring the man of steel to the big-screen as a big-budget summer movie of the year.In 1978, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE was released world-wide, becoming Warner Brother's highest grossing hit ever since then. Quite surprising after such a troubled production schedule. Originally, box-office sensation was supposed to be a Paul Newman-starring campy take on the comics a-la the 60s Batman TV show. Eventually, the idea was changed to a serious (really serious?) adaptation.In the far planet of Kripton, Jor-El (the one and only Marlon Brando) predicts his civilization's doom thanks to an explosion caused by the Kriptorian sun. To save the life of his son, Kal-El, Jor decides to send him to a far distant planet called Earth. After years of traveling, (and presumably frozen) Kal-El ends his long, long journey and hits the Earth like a meteor. Adopted by an elderly couple, he grows up to become high-school looser Clark Kent (and what super-hero isn't a high school looser?). After the tragic death of his adoptive father (Glenn Ford), Clark (Cristopher Reeve) embarks on a 10-year journey to learn who he truly is. This entire process lasts for about 40 minutes. If SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE had been recently produced, it would last for about 20 or 10 minutes done with a funny ""let's get to the action"" narration, which proves how today's audience lost their patience.The rest of SUPERMAN is what is already expected. Clark moves to Metropolis (New York City) to work as a journalist for the DAILY PLANET, falls in love with reporter Lois Lane, (the wonderful Margot Kidder) fights Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), etc...The now-familiar storyline is only a back-seat as to the wonderful popcorn feel-good time that is SUPERMAN. It is just one of those pure magical perfect movies that are not that perfect anymore, but you can't help but enjoy. Director Richard Donner, fresh from the horror classic THE OMEN, makes it what it is by adding well-balanced moments of action, drama, comedy, camp, darkness, and even a romantic well-remembered scene (""Can you read my mind?"").Originally written as a four-hour long epic by Mario Puzzo (THE GODFATHER), SUPERMAN was chopped in two parts. The darker and more mature SUPERMAN II would be filmed simultaneously and released the year after (similar to the recent THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) but the firing of Richard Donner eventually led to SUPERMAN II become what many consider a badly-edited flawed picture.Special effects designed by dozens of collaborators were truly revolutionary for their time. This was all done before the magic of CGI, leading for the actual creation of effects that had never been fully used at that time. SUPERMAN holds the credit with STAR WARS as a revolutionary technical film. Instead of using stop-motion animation, the flying effects were a combination of blue-screen, invisible wire-work, miniature effects, etc... that today sometimes looks more real than a CGI cartoon jumping around buildings (*cough* THE HULK *cough).John Williams composed the original music for the film. Inspired by the previous incarnations of the Superman musical theme, John created what is, hands down, the most brilliant super-hero soundtrack ever. There is never a flawed track badly used in the film. Right from the opening credits, one can only dream what SUPERMAN would sound like music-less. If you remove Williams's music, certain parts of the film would look dated, poorly edited, and down right embarrassing. Take the ""Can you read my mind?"" moment. What would that scene be without Williams brilliantly orchestrated composition?The true special effect in SUPERMAN is Christopher Reeve himself. Try pronouncing his Superman lines without sounding like an idiot. Reeve doesn't just play Superman, he IS Superman. Forget George Reeves' or Dean Cain's campy TV portraits, no one else can play a serious Superman like Reeve. While Batman keeps changing film-to-film based on his chin, Superman was never replaced by any other actor because of Reeve's screen presence. And, of course, this was all pure luck since Reeve was virtually unknown back then. It proves how non-star power based casting can work indeed. It doesn't matter that Marlom Brando AND Gene Hackman are credited before him in the opening titles (or that Reeves' names appears AFTER the title is shown) Reeve is the main star of Superman. Marlon Brando does a short but effective appearance as Jor-El, and he was unfortunately missed in SUPERMAN II. Gene Hackman plays a brilliant humorous Lex Luthor. And while unnecessary, Ned Beaty's Ottis is rather acceptable as the lovable goofy side-kick. And there is the forever underrated Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. With her husky voice and sharp brunette features, Kidder steals the show with her performance of a stereotype sharp and witty reporter who does anything for a front-page headline.But what proves this film's success is that it did make all of us believe a man could fly. Either it was Christopher Reeve, John Williams, Richard Donner, or the entire SFX crew, SUPERMAN is indeed a wonderful family movie that could be a breath of fresh air after recent disappointing takes like DAREDEVIL.",Superman
294,Twilight_Wraith,"Beautiful, fun and Romantic even 24 years later",10,12 May 2002,"If there is one superhero movie i have always admired and loved from my childhood down to my mid 20's, it's Superman. It is so unlike the typical superhero flicks of today with more predictability than a Roger Corman production. Christopher Reeve is perfect, he has to play two parts, the Man.... and the Superman. I call this movie beautiful because it has some wonderfully romantic scenes, such as Superman taking Lois to fly. It's a cleverly written story, each scene, every piece of dialogue contributed to either character or story. It was really well written by Mario Puzo, writer of The Godfather. This movie is also very well told by John Williams masterful and perfect musical score. Without this music score, this movie would be incomplete.

296,grendel-37,Richard Donner's Finest Hour!,10,15 January 2005,"Richard Donner, after a beginning directing TV shows has made several fine movies, The Lethal Weapon Series, Omen, Toy, etc.Without doubt this is his finest film, the film where it all jelled, all worked. A witty, funny, and oddly adult script, manages to continuously amuse and endear kids and adults of all ages. And of course a brilliant cast of newcomers and veterans, breathe life into this tale... of a Super Man.First seen when it came out, when I was a wee kid, I remember it well. The first viewing. I remember, there with my family, Ma and Pa, and baby sis making noises somewhere, I remember loving it.Being blown away by it.I didn't know Glenn Ford or Trevor Howard or Jackie Cooper, I'd seen Brando on TV in old black and white movies, Reeves and Kidder were newcomers, all I really knew back then... was this movie was FUN. It was Superman... done right.Nearly 3 decades later, and it is still... Superman done right. Knowledge and ever greater special effects does not dim my love for this film, it enhances it.Now I do know who Jackie Cooper is, and Trevor Howard, and Glenn Ford, now I see how rich this movie is with a celebration and a respect of those who have come before. The original Lois Lane on the Train, Noel Neill.There's a loving generational message here in the casting, that complements the generational message of the story. It also happens to have perhaps my favorite scene, visual scene, ever, the one I remember seeing ,in that theater of long ago, and thinking ""Wow"".Photographed by the great Geoffrey Unsworth, who the film is dedicated to, the scene I'm referring to is the one with Clark and his mom in the cornfield, and the camera finally panning up, up, and away.Thirty years later.... and it still takes my breath away. That and of course the now classic flight of Lois and Clark, around New York. To a preteen kid it felt like magic. And to an adult, far removed from that kid,it still feels... like magic.It is easily... in a world that now has made a routine of Comic Book movies, the best of it's genre. But it's not just a great ""comic book"" movie, it's a great... movie. And that's why it was a box office hit, and that's why it remains, a perennial favorite. Like Peter Pan it speaks to us... of stars to reach for.There's something absurdly hopeful; something tender and beautiful and endearing and hopeful about this film. Something ineffable that becomes, daily, ever more valuable... in a world that increasingly destroys all those things.A brilliant film, with a compromised sequel that's almost as good (and two other sequels that you should avoid like the plague). A film that celebrates the medium and the myth, and that part in all of us... that dreams of flying. ****.",Superman
297,snakejenkins,The first great comic book adaption.,8,6 June 2001,"Since I was a child I've loved this movie despite it's many problems (one of which is a script that is a little too goofy at times) but it survives because the parts of the film that were right (and those were the majority) were extremely right. More than any other comic book Superman would be the most difficult to translate to film because of the main character's wide eyed and honest look at the world.  A hero who doesn't lie and fights for truth and justice would be difficult to believe in any film, but put him in blue tights and red undies and he's even less believable.  What Richard Donner did to make this work was to not poke fun at his main character but have the rest of the world seem odd and crazy for being so cynical and bent on power and lies.Make no mistake, there are no truly grand sociological or philosophical messages in the film, but there are many great moments (the best of which is the awe-inspiring opening credits sequence).  There is, however, a great message to film-makers on comic book translations. If you don't take your characters seriously, we won't take your film seriously.Superman is a pure entertaining delight and something that the entire family can enjoy.  I give it a thumbs up!",Superman
298,alfCycle,Decent beginning to the superhero movie genre,6,12 May 2017,"I'll start this off by saying I have never been much of a Superman fan. Batman, X-Men and Spider-Man have always been my favorites, going back to watching those great animated series as a kid in the early 90's. I guess my introduction to Superman was the Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher ""Lois & Clark"", which I also watched as a kid. With that being said, I can appreciate what this movie meant in giving the world the first real superhero blockbuster, and Christopher Reeve was and is the perfect on- screen portrayal of Superman. However, I can't say that I really enjoyed this movie that much. It is a pretty good movie, but, in my opinion, is nowhere near the great film it seems to be regarded as by most people. I liked the first half of the movie with the origin story, but the second half of the movie is too full of ridiculous plot points and nonsensical story-lines. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is basically a cartoon villain with an absurd Pinky & The Brain-esque master plan to sink the west coast of the U.S so that they would then own new ""beach front"" property. It reminds me of something The Joker might come up with in the Adam West Batman series, which I love. Problem is, unlike that series, this movie does not play like a comedy spoof. It is a lighthearted superhero movie for the most part, but its overall tone does not lend itself to ridiculous self parody, which it ultimately becomes in the end. I absolutely hate the reverse the earth ending. If he can do that, why not do it every time something bad happens? I know his daddy said not to, but that didn't stop him here. Why didn't he do a few more spins and stop the entire earthquake from happening? You can't tell me no one died during that entire thing? Come on! This is the problem with having a superhero with almost unlimited powers. It takes all the sense of danger and tension out of the equation. This is why I have never really been a Superman fan. He just isn't very interesting as a character. At least not to me. Some might say I am nitpicking and that every movie has plot holes, but the ones in this movie are so blatant and obvious that I can't overlook them. I could never buy the whole ""he's wearing glasses and slouching so nobody can recognize him"" bit. OK, fine for strangers on the street, but come on Lois! Isn't she supposed to be a top investigative reporter with a keen eye for detail?. Anyway, I probably sound like I hate this movie, but I don't. Overall, it is a fun movie with some good moments, but far from a masterpiece.6/10Recommended for those that enjoy flying men, falling women, x-ray underwear gazing, the transformative power of eyeglasses and single- hair curling, follicly challenged criminal masterminds, bumbling sidekicks, hairbrained schemes, Sophie's missile choice, earthquakes, earth reversing time travel......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Three",Superman
299,d-maxsted,Still Amazing After All These Years,10,27 April 2011,"After the huge success of ""The Omen"" director Richard Donner made his true mark on the world of cinema with what most would agree is then and still is the greatest portrayal of 'The Man Of Steel' ever to grace the big screen. Massive in its production and filming schedule,one only has to listen to his directors commentary to understand just what was involved in making this masterpiece,not to mention filming the second Superman movie back to back with the first,he created an icon in cinema history. After its release Superman went on to amount a massive $300.000.000 plus around the world and director Richard Donner became one of the most sought after directors in the world,his movies dominated our big screens for more than 20 years. Yet when we think of Superman in the 21st century Im sure everyone would agree that Christopher Reeve was then and always will be seen as the man who made the world believe a man could fly,his portrayal as both Clarke Kent and Superman is nothing less than brilliant,just watch Superman Returns,actor Brandon Routh who was cast is a true compliment to what Christopher Reeve gave us over his 4 outings as Superman,he looks and even sounds,as uncanny as it was the first time he spoke as Superman,like Christopher Reeve....I think Superman fans around the world would agree that if Superman Returns was not a tribute to the legacy of Christopher Reeve then nothing was. Of Marlon Brando as Supermans father,one can only say this..""WOW"" A motion picture that has stood the test of time and will do Im sure for many many years to come Christopher Reeve...Thank You..We Miss You",Superman
300,saxon-7,Not so Super,4,10 December 2006,"The movie adaption of the Superman comic focuses mainly on Superman/Clark Kent's first time at the Daily Planet, where he get to know Lois Lane and ultimately has to save her and the Camera boy Jimmy from an earthquake caused by Lex Luthor (in his own words ""the greatest mind on earth"").As far as plot goes it quite straight forward, the bad guy is continually hemmed by his dumb associates while Superman saves the day and again. The only thing to point out here is the fact that Superman at one point turns back time by flying really fast around the planet in orbit, which is a bit of a let down to me.The acting and effects is beginning to show it's age but is okay the time considered, although the white suits that the Kryptons are wearing are very bright as if the lightning is wrong (too much). As for the best performance I'll have to say Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor is th best while Christopher Reeve also does well, but in general the acting isn't very astonishing.As the first Superman movie and the time considering this is an okay movie but non the less it only get 4 out of 10 as I didn't find it that captivating.",Superman

302,grange85,Woeful,3,19 September 2005,"I am absolutely astounded that this truly woeful film is garnering any praise at all. The film takes an absolute age to get going and then falls apart between some barely tolerable action sequences. The casting is awful - even Gene Hackman, who should be able to do villains in his sleep makes a lame Lex Luthor. The part where Superman takes Lois for a trip is enough to make the most sturdy toes curl with its creepiness. The plot is very poorly developed and the viewer is expected to accept unquestioningly certain things that really required an explanation.That this film generated sequels is a mystery, and that the sequels were equally poor is no surprise at all - really...don't waste your time with this, I wish I hadn't. I stuck it out because my eight year old was watching with me - even he was disappointed.",Superman

Margot Kidder's poetry while flying around?: F 4. All of the horrible, horrible liberties taken with physics: F------- 5. Clark's mom doesn't have the 'attributes' of Anette O'Toole: F In watching it now, it is almost impossible to believe that this movie could have grossed anything, it has 'straight to video' written all over it.

Christopher Reeve did a fantastic job.  If only they could do this with the latter Batman sequels (George Clooney as Batman?!  What were they thinking?)  I also thought Gene Hackman was pretty good as Lex Luthor. He added quite a bit of arrogance to character., making him not only evil, but also pompous about it.

305,retroguy02,A straightforward superhero movie that could've benefited a lot from some more high-powered action,8,16 August 2008,"Although I am not a big fan of Superman, I got this movie's DVD mainly because, as a fan of superhero movies, I felt that ""Superman: The Movie"" simply had to be in my 'have-seen' list. Before I review the movie, I'd like to say that this is the first and (so far) only Superman live-action movie I have watched, so I can't compare to other installments in the series. So here's what I thought about ""Superman: The Movie"": The story of ""Superman"" is fairly simple, and anyone who doesn't even know anything about Superman (highly unlikely in the first place) will have no problem following it. The movie does a great job of explaining Superman's origins, and is cohesive throughout. Sometimes the story is far from being politically correct, especially the way it deals with the laws of physics, but that's okay with me in a ""Superman"" film. ""Superman"" also makes a rather smart decision by keeping its mood lighthearted; it's definitely not campy, and there are a few serious moments, but ""Superman"" is by and far devoid of any darkness or disturbing elements, and in a mostly positive way.Since there are no (per se) super-villains in this movie, one-on-one 'boss battles' against Superman wouldn't have made much sense, and thankfully there are none in this movie. But I felt that a few more wham-bam sequences could've been tremendously helpful, since there are fairly few memorable action sequences, such as when Superman saves a plane from crashing; the climax, where Superman simultaneously tries to save two deadly missiles from hitting targets far apart; however, one of the missile lands and causes an earthquake, and while Superman is busy cleaning up the mess caused by the earthquake, his girl Lois Lane succumbs to a landslide caused by the disaster, and so Superman reverses the world's time in (against his morals) order to see Lois alive again. I'm also glad that they didn't go with the ""defies-all-odds-and-saves-both"" technique for the climax. I'd also like to point out that the special effects in ""Superman"" look fairly impressive despite their age, especially during Superman's flight, which also featured the best cinematography in the movie; the action scenes are no less technically, but it's just that there are not quite enough of them.The acting is decent from most of the major cast, but I often found myself being more interested in Christopher Reeve's performance than the movie itself. Being ridiculously handsome and managing to believably play the archetypal superhero and a geeky journalist at the same time is a massive double-edged sword, and Reeve aces at it. Margot Kidder comes second as Lois Lane, even though (as far as I can recall) the Lois from the Superman cartoons was smarter than the one in the movie; regardless, Margot's chemistry with Reeve is the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie so far, and the two are always interesting whenever together on screen. The remaining cast, including big names like Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando, do a good job with the script they're given, but the character of Lex Luthor should have been less cartoony for a live-action adaptation IMO. And the guy who plays Otis annoyed me every time he came on screen.And then there is the soundtrack, with the opening theme being one of the most famous elements of the movie, and rightly so. However, in my opinion, the best element of ""Superman"", after the acting, is the production design, with the most imposing sets being the dreamy Fortress of Solitude and Lex Luthor's underground lair, which is just the right embodiment of sinister luxury hidden away behind Metropolis' murky subway system.With the lack of a lot of high-impact action, my favorite moment from ""Superman"" was one of its subtlest scenes. It goes something like this: Lois invites Superman to a private interview at her balcony, and when she discovers that he can see through things, she naively asks him if he can tell what color her underwear is. Realizing her mistake, Lois instantly apologizes. Superman replies that it's okay and that there's a flowerpot made of lead in front of her, so he can't see through it anyway. Then Lois asks him about his favorite color. With a naughty smirk, Superman looks directly at Lois and instantly replies ""pink"", and both of them break into giggles. All of it is done in such a 'cute' (don't be mistaken though, it's in REALLY good taste) and organic manner that I myself almost started giggling, and so will many people who get what this scene meant.""Superman"" is a sincere, straightforward superhero movie that's not dark, true to source and features some great acting and production design. But for my liking, there was nothing very memorable about Superman's story, mainly because about 90% of the time I could accurately predict what would happen next -- ""Superman"" rarely tries to innovate, and a healthier dose of action sequences would have would have gone a long way considering the movie's straightforwardness, and a more serious villain would have also been helpful to a lesser extent. But despite that, ""Superman: The Movie"" is definitely no bummer. Aside, since it's aptly rated PG, it's also great for the younger crowd. RATING: 8/10.",Superman
306,say_andy,The most boring 45 minutes of a comic book movie I've ever seen.,2,7 April 2005,"Before watching Superman, I was prepared to allow for less-than-impressive special effects and funny hairdos, since it was released in 1978. I was going to judge the effects based on effects from films contemporary with Superman, not modern films, and maybe get some campy fun out of some of them. I'm willing to forgive the silly glowing white tinfoil suits everyone on Krypton wears, because that was a pretty common way for the future and futuristic things to be portrayed. I remember believing that we would all be traveling via jet packs and flying cars by now. I got a kick out of the flying disc that captured General Zod (Terrance Stamp) and his cohorts to send them to their punishments, even though it looks really silly (as a kid, it really freaked me out). On the positive side for special effects, I must say that the film does a pretty convincing job with Superman's flying, especially for the time.But, special effects and aging aside, I was shocked at how utterly and completely boring the movie was. Booooooooooorrrring. The first 45 minutes, focusing on the destruction of Krypton, baby Kal's trip to Earth, Clark Kent as a teenager in Smallville (who doesn't look anything like the man he'll grow up to become), the death of Pa Kent, and Clark's time in the Fortress of Solitude were the most boring 45 minutes of a comic book movie I've ever seen. It literally put me to sleep. I couldn't believe how much it all sucked. To make things worse, scenes were added to this snooze-fest for the DVD release, making it all longer than the original.I'm assuming they spent so much time indulging in Superman's origin to A) make the movie feel more epic, and B) to get Marlon Brando (who plays Jor-El) more screen time. I hung in through this because I knew it got better. Then the Smallville stuff happened, which was beyond lame. You'd think the parts where Clark showed his powers would at least be cool, but it only made things worse. I've never seen a more gay run than the one teenage Clark exhibits when racing alongside a train. Seriously, he looked like a marionette (which, you will note, is a much gayer word than puppet).But, I persevered (after a night's sleep), and continued watching, knowing that the movie would get better once it headed to Metropolis. Of course, when the first third of a movie is terrible, it's already not a good movie. But, I had to see it through, if for no other reason that my home city, Calgary, doubles as Metropolis, and its always fun to see your own city on film (well, unless your own city is Los Angeles or New York, then its old hat). And you know what? The film did get better when it shifted to Metropolis, and the reason why can be summarised in two words: Christopher Reeve.Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the bumbling Clark Kent, juxtaposed with the confident and heroic Superman, is spot-on. Perhaps the best portrayal of a comic book character ever. It's pretty fun the first time you see each side of Supes portrayed on screen, and Reeve manages to maintain his solid performance throughout. The problem is that almost everything that surrounds his performance sucks. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is terrible, made even worse by his bumbling sidekick played by Ned Beatty. Margot Kidder is fine as Lois Lane, but nothing special. She has a nice scene when she meets Superman at her apartment, after he saved her life, but it's completely ruined by her god-AWFUL mental poetry while flying with Superman. Seriously, it sounded like it was written by a seven year old girl.Skip to the big exciting climax, which is one of my favourite bad movie moments of all-time. Lex Luthor is successful in detonating a nuclear missile along the San Andreas faultline, leading to an earthquake that should swallow up the entire west coast. Superman fights to stop it, but fails to prevent Lois Lane's death from being swallowed and crushed by the torn-apart Earth. Here's the best part: mourning the loss of Lois, Supes does the only thing he can-- he flies around the Earth so fast that it reverses the rotation of the planet. Forget whether or not such a thing is even within Superman's capabilities, I'll allow that it is. What's awesome about this (and by ""awesome"", I mean ""awesomely horrible"") is that reversing the Earth's rotation causes time to move backward. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Why the screenwriters (amongst whom is The Godfather scribe Mario Puzo) thought this would lead to time travel, instead of say, causing everything on Earth that is not apart of the ground to fly off into space, is beyond me. And even if you do except the time travel, why on Earth would Superman not travel back in time long enough to prevent the nuclear bomb to go off? He only travels back far enough to prevent Lois' death, says hi to her, then leaves her and Jimmy Olson in the desert with a car with no gas (which makes you think that he thought her initial death was just too quick-- I guess he prefers starvation and dehydration). How did this even save Lois? Wouldn't the earthquake swallow her up again once Superman left? The movie then ends with Superman bringing Luthor and Beatty to prison, without ever showing how Superman captured them, because, really, who wants to see a guy defeat his archnemesis in action movies anyway? These things are best left to the imagination. I was shocked and dumb-founded at how overwhelmingly bad this movie was, absolutely terrible. I'd rather watch Batman & Robin. 2 stars out of 10, with Christopher Reeve being the only thing keeping this from getting a zero.",Superman
307,nedron,"Great first half, very good second half",9,7 July 2002,"This film still holds up very well after almost 25 years.I recently had the chance to see the new theatrical cut at a local electric pleasure palace (The Ohio Theatre) and the the film was as good as I remembered it. Seeing a film in a theatre is a very different experience from seeing it on television or some video medium.It's been about ten years since I saw the film theatrically and I still get the same vibe. The first half of the film (up through when Superman flies out of the fortress of solitude) is incredible and probably ranks as some of the best filmwork ever, particular Richard Donner's work as director and Geoffrey Unsworth's camera work. Some of John Williams' best music is in the first half of the film. Many people remember his main title theme, but ""Death of Pa Kent"" and ""Leaving Home"" are far better examples of what Williams is capable of.Beginning with the introduction to Metropolis, the film takes a right turn into Mugville. I still enjoy the second half of the film, but it markedly different in tone from the first half. One has to wonder what the film would have been like if the film had stayed on the serious path of the first half. It's only for the oddness of the second half that I don't give this film a 10.This is one you should definitely in a theatre with a large screen.",Superman

I don't care how much in style they'll go on ""Superman Lives,"" it will not match up to this classic in any ways. Richard Donner did a superb job directing this movie as well. It also had the humorous twisted Lex Luthor, who Gene Hackman played magnificantly, as well as Ned Beatty who was his dimwitt henchman Otis. Who could ask for a better story? So much has been missed!

311,nycrules,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,10,5 May 2004,"Note to Hollywood: PLEASE DO NOT REMAKE THIS FILM AND DESTROY ITS LEGACY!Any Superman remake would have to be a complete departurefrom this cinematic masterpiece and present something socompletely different and far removed from what was presentedhere.  The magic of this film is timeless and I have not seenanother movie come close to its greatness.  Cecil B. DeMille's""Ten Commandments"" would be a close second.  Director Richard Donner brought the story of ""Superman"" to life with justthe right balance of the film's various elements.  He stayed true tothe comic legend with dignity and tremendous care.  RichardLestor, who directed parts of Superman II, and the dreadful III wentmore in the campy direction which could've easily happened herebut Dick Donner and his team fortunately kept that from happeningand made sure the storytelling stayed sincere.  With all of the CGIspecial effects technology available today, none of it can compareto the beautiful artistry that went into the visual effects utilized at thetime.  Various techniques were combined and used as well astotally new techniques created specifically for the film which allworked together and blended beautifully.  Yes some of theminiatures look fake to the modern day movie goer but this movieis all about the suspension of disbelief.  There is no doubt in mymind that no other actor can fill the shoes of Christopher Reevesas Superman.  He is a great actor who not only nailed the role butportrayed to audiences just the right balance between the qualitieshe posessed as Superman and Clark Kent in ways no other actordid before him and no actor likely will after him.  Margot Kidderalso was by far the best actress to play Lois at the time and hadan on screen chemistry with Christopher Reeve that is rare andalso magical which obviously worked in the film's favor.   The film'ssoundtrack by John Williams is also the best of all time.  It ismajestic, rich, and awe inspiring.  Film majors should watch andstudy this one closely.

The effects in this first movie were quite a sight to see as well, as I discussed with my father. Unlike many older movies that I watch, Superman isn't as corny as the usual flick. Even with the less advanced graphics and special effects that make things much more realistic in today's movies, Superman still holds a special place in my heart and this movie follows suit.The contrast between Clark Kent, the nerdy reporter, and Superman is great to see, although I believe the second Superman movie does a slightly better job of portraying the stark differences in the double-sided character. I do like the portrayal of Clark's parents as slightly older folks, which make the heart-attack his father experiences and the longing for a child more grave.

316,gothamite27,The first true comic book movie...still one of the best.,10,7 June 2005,"Granted I have not yet seen what looks to be the ultimate Batman film (Batman Begins) so far, Superman (or Superman: The Movie as it is usually called) is by far my favorite, simply because it was a pioneer in film-making, much like the later Batman movie by Tim Burton.Before Superman, comic books were widely acknowledged as being campy and outrageously silly, as the popular Batman show depicted. Superman was a movie that just proved that this was not so.The story is known well. A scientist, Jor-El (the late, great Marlon Brando) foresees the demise of the planet Krypton, however his peers (also played by well established actors) hold naught but disbelief in his findings. They ban him and his wife from leaving Krypton...however not his son.Needless to say, Jor-El sends his son hurtling into space towards the distant planet Earth, where he grows up to discover that under Earth's yellow sun, he has acquired amazing physical powers.Christopher Reeve plays Superman to the peak of perfection. Possibly the finest portrayal of a superhero in film history. His warm smile and comforting eyes are the pinnacle of what makes Superman such an iconic character.Lex Luthor, Superman's arch-rival is played relatively well, if not slightly campy by Gene Hackman.The story overall, is solid and enjoyable, however it doesn't flow as freely as it should. The story is set into three main chapters that just follow one another without any true sense of continuity.1. Krypton's demise, Kal-El(Superman's true Kryptonian name)'s trip to Earth.2. Superman reveals himself to the world.3. Lex Luthor plots to nuke California.The budding love interest of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane is sprinkled on to lukewarm effect amidst the heroics.One of the things that annoyed me more than anything in this near-perfect film, was an irritating scene towards the end, that, despite it's drama, goes against the whole 'revamping comics' image that the film tried to set.Lois Lane is on her deathbed following Superman's failed attempt to save her.So Superman flies around the world and turns back time and saves her. I am well aware that this is a film about a man who can break the laws of physics, but even still this is slightly ridiculous for my tastes.OVERALL: This is a quite beautiful film that was unfairly dwarfed by the extravagance of Star Wars which is why it will not be as well remembered. Still, comic book movies are still unable to capture the essence of their source material the way this one did and despite some small errors, is definitely a film that should be in your collection.",Superman
317,UlrikSander,A great early superhero movie.,8,19 February 2006,"Richard Donner's SUPERMAN was released 11 years before Tim Burton's dark BATMAN (1989), which is regarded as one of the best superhero movies yet. Tim Burton took the source-material seriously by giving the Batman character multiple dimensions via the internal Batman/Bruce Wayne conflict. The duality of superhero identities has ever since been a very popular theme in superhero movies such as Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN franchise and Christopher Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS (2005) etc. Everyone find that anti-heroes are cooler than heroes. STAR WARS is the classic example: the morally flawed Han Solo is much more interesting than the perfect Luke Skywalker. Yet somehow Donner (and Christopher Reeve) succeeded in portraying The Man of Steel as an arch-American hero (patriotic, ethical, and strong = perfect), without making the Superman character uninteresting. That's quite an achievement, and after-all Superman is not a ""super-anti-hero"".The casting is ingenious. Christopher Reeve (Superman/Clark Kent) is the best Superman yet. He has an ability to alternate between being handsome as Superman and clumsy as Clark Kent, which Brandon Routh of Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) never achieves in a convincing manner. Gene Hackman combines devil's charm and wit perfectly in the role of Lex Luthor. Marlon Brando is terrific as Superman's moralistic father Jor-El, and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) plays the straight girl without being boring. The special effects are on cutting edge. Superman's flying scenes were actually done convincingly. They looked far more artificial in especially SUPERMAN III and IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE, but in Richard Donner's original movie the flying scenes look great. It's hard to understand how they achieved it. John William's score underlines the Superman character's heroism perfectly, although it resembles his STAR WARS theme a bit much.The only flaw of SUPERMAN is the manuscript. The movie spends approximately 40 minutes introducing the characters and setting up the Superman universe. That's too long. It takes away time from the actual story. Like in SUPERMAN RETURNS, there is also a slight problem with the climax. It's as if Superman isn't up against big enough forces, therefore the threat never creates enough tension. This is one of the few things the three sequels actually manage to pull off better that Donner's original. Yet this is an action-packed Hollywood blockbuster that has great cinematic qualities, and because Donner pulls off making Superman an interesting superhero, it's a classic. Although a classic with a few problems. 8/10",Superman
318,rbylakx,Superman: The best superhero movie to date.,10,12 November 2000,"Superman The Movie is still the best superhero movie to date. Thank the director, Richard Donner, for maintaining to the comic book storyline and introducing us to then newcomer Christopher Reeve. Reeve's portrayal of a humble, quirky, klutzy Clark Kent and dynamic, powerful, might makes right ""man of steel"" is dead on. Perfect casting. The soundtrack provided us with a nice feel for the movie. Excellent music. The Superman/Lois Lane love theme of them flying through the night sky was my favorite.      Superman the Movie is a film that fills you with a yearning to be like it's main character. Looked up to, powerful and super. It is a very well made movie. Still the best superhero movie to date.",Superman
319,kmthomas-1,You Will Believe A Man Can Fly,10,11 May 2003,"Superman is my favorite all-time film.  No sense lying about it, as you'll figure it out from my glowing review.  This was the first movie my father ever took me to see.  I remember it as if it was yesterday (although my mind has probably filled in a lot of blanks).Christopher Reeve was Superman.  Period-end-of-paragraph.  Singularly, the greatest casting job in history.  He helped redefine the character for a new age.Gene Hackman was marvelous as Lex Luthor.  Superficially, he was a walking joke, but beneath that, you can see just a twinge of insanity.  One of Hackman's most underrated performances, I think.The special effects were vastly superior to anything else of its day.  All ""Star Wars"" had to do was photograph a couple of non-moving models and place them in front of a black matte.  Superman had to work with a moving human being and real backgrounds, not the white-dots of outer space.This movie created the comic genre, and addicted a generation of kids to comics.  It remains, and shall remain, the benchmark for all comic book adaptations.  None have come close.",Superman
320,markblumenthal,Does not hold up 40 years later,7,27 July 2017,"I know that when this film was released people went nuts, but it just does not hold up 40 years later. It is asking a lot of any movie to stand the test of 40 years and in some aspects this film does. The title song is a classic. Reeves as Superman is played to a ""T"". Even Lois Lane's character is great. I did not enjoy the portrayal of Lex Luthor but to the films credit, no Superman film has been able to deliver a great Luthor in my opinion. But other than that it falls short. The film does stay true to the source material which i liked and was a groundbreaking film of the time, but watching it today, I really felt like I was watching a movie that was made in 1978.",Superman
321,neil.harris,A fresh look at a classic,8,1 February 2000,"I recently watched this film on Channel 5, and apart from the obvious ad. breaks I was still able to enjoy it.However, I have some critisisms, as people on this site seem to love a film just because it is old, and has been given the blanket term ""classic""Before you say it, no my title is not hypocritical to what I mean, only to say this film is an entertaining work, but the first hour is just not necessary and could have been cut to about 20 minutes. To anyone who STILL has not seen it, the rest of the review may be considered a SPOILER so best go away now.The film comes into it's own when Clark appears in Metropolis and starts work for the Planet, but although there are a few nice moments before that, most of the plot is just too slow to keep alert.Reeve IS Superman, of that there is no doubt, and he always will be in my mind, and Hackman does a good job as Luthor, but I don't think much of Margot Kidder as Lane, she seems a little too corny, even for this. The story is strong, the origins explained(eventually) and the effects good enough to survive in this day (just about).A fine film from the man of steel!Neil",Superman
322,mhsvikings,"A classic, no other comic book movie comes close",10,12 June 2003,"Superman the Movie is a really fun, enjoyable movie and just about as perfect as you can get for a comic book movie. The acting is top notch with Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman in a legendary performance as Lex Luthor. You'd have to be ""The Grinch"" to not smile when you watch this movie. Hopefully they won't come out with any more Superman movies because I don't think there is any way they could be close to as good as this one. Perfect 10/10.",Superman
323,shanfan_14,A tribute to a distinctly American myth,10,16 August 2003,"I've always loved this movie and believe it treats my favorite superhero with exactly the right balance. It is sweet, funny, poignant and action-filled all at once, and the effects hold up well, even today. Richard Donner gave this major story in American mythology just the right touch to make it both human and superhuman. The music is integral to all its aspects, as well: John Williams' best, in my opinion. I hope no one tries to remake it with some generic-looking 20 year old to cash in on a nom-du-jour. This is the definitive treatment of the original story and shouldn't be spoiled (think of the truly shudder-producing rumors that Nicolas Cage (!!) would next portray the hero).",Superman

The story line needed much more improvement, and the action is to slow, it needed more action or battle. It wasn't a question of acting or the actors, more of a fluke by the producers, writers and directors.",Superman
325,mlevens1,An under-appreciated masterpiece of American pop-culture,10,21 June 2006,"This is the best super-hero movie ever made.When was the last time a super-hero flick was penned by Oscar-caliber screenwriters? Puzo won an Oscar for THE GODFATHER (1972). Newman was nominated for an Oscar for BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967). Benton has won several Oscars for his writing and directing, most notably for KRAMER VS. KRAMER (1979).And a great many of the actors were Oscar winners, most notably Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's father.Playing Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El is Christopher Reeve. His dedication to the role is outstanding (in this and three sequels, mind you). But in 1977 Reeve started a serious exercise regimen. His goal: to look like the Superman in the comic books, the one we all grew up with and love. George Reeves and Kirk Alyn, the two previous live-action ""Superman"" actors looked no more like Superman than a child at Halloween. Reeve took the idea of the live-action super-hero drama a big step forward.This movie also exhibits state-of-the-art special effects, (Oscar-winning effects). You watch this film and you really do believe a man can fly. This was done in an age before computer and digital images.",Superman
326,dragonmysterious,Superman.,7,9 June 2013,"Christopher Reeve does a great job of portraying both Superman and Clark Kent. I like the part on Krypton where they show the other Kryptonians wearing uniforms with different Kryptonian symbols. The destruction of Krypton was not specified clearly.Throughout, the movie is very slow-paced and takes its time, especially during the first hour of the movie. Gene Hackman couldn't convince me that he was Lex Luthor (not just because he was wearing a wig).This film shows a very classic Superman with a classic suit which he got from Jor-El in the Fortress of Solitude. It serves as a great introduction of Superman and his main adversaries (Zod and Luthor, even though there was a lack of action scenes. Most of it was just Superman saving the world. No heat vision,etc. Superman defying Jor-El's orders was a good part of the film, but the ending was not so well done, with Superman saving Lois by turning back time. It was not specified how Superman could do that, and if there are any limitations. This would lead people to believe that Superman can just turn back time as and when he likes. If so, there is no need to save the world if he could just prevent everything from happening.Do not be mistaken, I am a big fan of Superman. He is one of my favorite superheroes (next to Batman). This movie is good, but I expected more from it.",Superman
327,harpreetc,Reeve Rocks!,9,20 June 2006,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I was five years old! I think I have never stopped my admiration of this super hero from then, mainly because of how he was portrayed by Christopher Reeve. Whenever anyone mentions Superman to me, I picture the extremely handsome, black-haired, blue-eyed Christopher, smiling into the camera as he takes a turn around the planet in space! The plot of the movie leaves a LOT to be deserved, but I realised that as I learnt more about movies and I grew maturer. But that hasn't stopped me from giving this a nine rating because I feel that this movie impressed the hell out of me as a kid and that is what a good movie on a comic book should do! If kids can suspend their disbelief at certain plot holes, than I shall do so now! No qualms.However, I never thought Margot Kidder failed to do justice to Lois Lane's character! I mean c'mon! She just isn't pretty firstly, and secondly what's with the scratchy voice?? It grates on one's nerves. She has her moments - ""you've got me? who's got you?"" - but overall, I think the casting sucked here.Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor! Stupendous! He is funny, but an absolute scamp and no one doubts that he is cold-hearted.This movie is a must see for those who haven't seen it - I wonder if there are many out there who haven't - and if you haven't I recommend this one highly! Your perception of Superman will take life!",Superman
328,monkeysontoast,My childhood hero...a disappointment?,6,16 July 2006,"What happened here?! I definitely recall liking this movie a lot when I was little...but I'm starting to think that the ONLY reason was because Superman was in it. I can't believe how...disappointing it was watching it again. Nostalgia definitely wasn't kicking in here. Aside from Chris Reeve, who was perfectly cast (as Superman, at least...still not a fan of his bumbling, geeky, cowardess Clark), what did this movie have to offer? If you took out all the scenes of Reeve flying around saving people, and edited them together, you'd have a better movie than this was. I mean, you have a scene that qualifies as the cheesiest movie scene of all-time (Lois and her 'can you read my mind'...umm, thinger), an actress that totally doesn't fit the mold for Lois, the longest 45-minute start up in any movie known to man (which featured a teen Clark, that for some reason, annoyed me to no end, and looked nothing like Chris Reeve...and who looked like a damn puppet racing the train), and some ridiculous notion that Superman can turn back time (and somehow, when turning back time, alter the events that took place, without actually doing anything except stand there). Not to mention that Gene Hackman as Lex is well, pretty dull...and seems to have a little too much knowledge about kryptonite and it's ability to harm Superman...how does he know this exactly? Yeaaaaa... Either way, if only for Chris Reeve and his excellent Superman, I still give the movie a 6/10.",Superman
329,kanerazor,So wonderful and majestic-an all-time classic!,10,17 February 2003,"There are a number of films that make me think ""nothing represents movie magic better than this"" because they are incredibly grand and  beautiful. That small list includes The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain, Star Wars, Superman: The Movie, and E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial.  There is no question that Superman is the least lauded out of all of those; however, it is a movie that never fails to leave me in awe.      
Director Richard Donner and writer Tom Mankiewicz were simply overflowing with passion for Superman, and treating him as an American myth resulted in this amazing labor of love.  The opening shots of the comic book opening with the child's voice over were such an inspired touch, and then we see the the awesome opening credits as John Williams's score sets the perfect mood of grandeur and wonder befitting the greatest of all superheroes.  The segment on Krypton may look fake by today's standards but considering the resources they had at the time it was an outstanding achievement and just as easy to appreciate now.  Much has been made of the symbolism of Jor-El as God sending his only son to Earth, and I feel that lends the film an extra level of majesty.  The segment in Smallville was just as compelling in its own way (according to Mankiewicz, they were very deliberately trying to make this movie like 3 different films).  The film was differing from the comic book substantially, doing away with the whole concept of Superboy and showing Clark Kent as an confused awkward adolescent not knowing who he is or where he came from, or having completely grasped what his powers are or why he was put on Earth.  I actually wanted to see more of this part because it's so fascinating, but the idea is being explored beautifully right now in Smallville.  The part where the tragedy occurs and Clark realizes he must leave is so poignant it made me want to cry.  Then in the fortress of solitude, we are back to the grandeur of the Krypton segment, and the film continued to leave me in awe at how many levels it worked on.In Metropolis things get much lighter and faster, but no less exciting.  The early segments watching Superman save people are great, and the romance with Lois Lane is really nice (although the not-very-charming and too-old Margot Kidder is the movie's only flaw in my book).  That especially goes for the flying part, with its very touching voice over expressing Lois's love for Superman.  Gene Hackman is perfect as the hilariously evil Lex Luthor, and the whole final segment with Superman foiling his plot is consistently thrilling.  The ending of the movie has drawn a lot of criticism, but I personally found it very moving watching Superman think so strongly with his heart.  And who's to say you can't do what he did-is there anyone who can fly and has his strength that can prove that?  The montage of voices from earlier in the film made it a very powerful moment.Whatever virtues the film may have, by far its greatest is Christopher Reeve.  He nails the role so perfectly it amazes me that they were able to find such a person.  Superman is a perfect boy scout, and the role could have been incredibly corny, but Reeve, by coming across as both so innocent and so charming, makes it virtually impossible NOT to be won over by him. And he also is perfect in the equally challenging role of Clark Kent.  As portrayed by Reeve Clark was not just the bland alter ego of the exciting Superman, but rather someone who was  hilarious and immensely likeable and charismatic despite being the biggest nerd you will ever find.  For his incredible effort, Reeve can take the satisfaction of knowing that he helped make a film that remains a major classic a 25 years after its release.  I was born in 1981, and so never got to see this in theaters, but I hope Warner Bros. will release that director's cut on the big screen where it belongs.",Superman
330,osnelgro,Some great idea's,7,3 February 2006,"Superman is a cult classic and unbelievably I hadn't seen for a very long time. I had always put it off but when it finally came time to see it I became very excited, superman is a classic was the only thing running through my head. Then I switched it on and the music went off and the three criminal were sent some where far away. Then after that quiet a long time not a lot happened but it was all building up to superman in action. When he began performing unbelievable acts like flying and super strength I thought yes now it gets good. A lot of people will tell you that the beginning acts of superman were weak but those people are not taking superman is a bit of a comedy in to consideration. Once Lex Luther came in to it, it really turned out not to bad, superman became a very likable character. The movie had some great ideas like the way superman caught the bullet and the being a bit of a comedy.In conclusion Superman isn't fantastic but it is certainly worth the watch but you must take the fact that it is very old so the special effects arn't fantastic in to consideration.",Superman

However, I don't like the average score it had (7.2/10) and it deserves much better like 8.5 and more.

333,The_Sun_Toucher,"""You will believe a man can fly!""",10,14 June 2000,"Back in 1978, this movie set a standard that has yet to be equaled, let alone surpassed.  In the past twenty years, we've seen many live-action adaptions of comic-books, none of which can compare to Richard Donner's towering achievement.  Nearly two decades later, this movie still retains a sense of awe and wonder.     The film works because the director takes the character and his story seriously, but not too seriously.  The movie finds the perfect balance of drama and comedy, homage and parody.  Donner remains faithful to the source material yet still manages to make the movie palletable for a mass audience. In other words, he pleases the fanboys and the casual moviegoer. This has to be one of the most fully realized films ever made. Everything is as it should be.  The Casting, the Score, the Character development, the script.  With all of these great ""production values"", SUPERMAN still somehow manages to be MORE than the some of it's expensive parts. I hope that Bryan Singer and Sam Riami use this film as a reference point.  If the X-MEN and SPIDERMAN can come anywhere near the quality of this film, I'll be more than satisfied.",Superman
334,ar87,My favorite movie ever,10,16 August 2001,"My rating - 5/5 stars CONTAINSPOILERS December, 1978 - 21 years after the Adventures of Superman TV show, Richard Donner brought us one of the most magical, awe inspiring movies ever to hit the big screen. This was a simple hit or miss project. During the search, Richard Donner thankfully stepped in, and proposed a largely unkown actor, Christopher Reeve, his biggest role being in a 1951 soap opera entitled Love of Life. Standing at 6'4"", sporting dark hair and blue eyes, Reeve looked as though he had just stepped out of a Superman comic book. The script was written by the popular Mario Puzo, with help from David and Leslie Newman, Robert Benton, and Tom Mankiewicz. In order to guarantee a large number of viewers, Marlon Brando was cast as Superman's father, Jor-El. Gene Hackman was also cast as the fiendish Lex Luthor, also a big actor at the time. Another large addition to the movie was John Williams, who composed some of the greatest music of all time. From action scenes, to romantic scenes, his music fit with the movie perfectly.The movie begins with the Krypton Council banishing General Zod, Ursa, and Non to the Phantom Zone. Jor-El attempts to convince the council that Krypton will explode in no more than 30 days. The council, not believing a word, warns Jor-El that he will be banished to the Phantom Zone as well, if he tries to cause a panic on Krypton. Jor-El promises that neither he nor his wife Lara would leave the planet, however, he never mentions his son, Kal-El. Kal-El's spaceship is ready. Jor-El bids him farewell, and Kal-El begins his journey to his new home, Earth. The ground shakes, walls collapse, and finally, Krypton explodes.We see shots of Kal-El in his spaceship, slowly growing. As he enters Earth, parts of the spaceship melt away. We see Jonathan and Martha Kent in their truck. The ground shakes as the spaceship smashes into the ground. Jonathan and Martha find Kal-El. Due to the shaking of the ground, the truck has been damaged. As Jonathan gets under the truck, the truck collapses. Amazingly, Jonathan is still alive, and the truck is being lifted by someone - Kal-El. Jonathan and Martha are both thinking the same thing - he's an alien.We see a football team, and then a water boy - it's Clark. Lana Lang invites Clark to play some records. Unfortunately, he has too much work to do. As the football players and cheerleaders drive away, Clark kicks a football in anger. It disappears in the distance, obviously in space. We see and train, and amazingly, Clark is racing it. With a jolt of speed, he jumps past it, towards his house. Clark meets his father at the farm, who talks to Clark about showing off, and makes Clark realize that he is here for a reason, definitely not to play football. Jonathan Kent grasps his left wrist, a sign of a heart attack, and collapses.Clark and Martha Kent are at the funeral. In the next scene, we see Clark in his bed. There are strange noises, and Clark follows them into the shed. He wipes away brush from the ground, and opens a trap door. There is a green glowing crystal inside. The next scene is very beautiful. Clark and Martha talk on the fields. Clark realizes that he has to go, and finally, after one last hug, and bids his mother farewell and heads north.Clark is walking in snow, he suddenly stops. He opens his backpack up, takes the green crystal out, and throws it out of instinct. The crystal disappears in the snow. Suddenly, we see flashes, and loud noises. Massive ice formations are erupting from the ground. After one more flash, we see the fortress of solitude, in all of its beauty. Clark walks inside, and takes a look around. He takes a clear crystal, and inserts it into a tube. A hologram appears, it is of his father, Jor-El. Jor-El talks to him, and answers his obvious question, ""who am I?"" The camera is flying through space, and it's obvious that Jor-El is teaching Clark. Years pass, and we see a shot of Superman standing in the fortress. Suddenly, he flies towards the camera, and out of view.We are introduced to the Daily Planet, reporter Lois Lane, photographer Jimmy Olsen, and the chief, Perry White. Clark seems to stare at Lois a lot, it's obvious that he likes her. Lois and Clark walk out of the building, and are met by a thief. He takes them into an alley. He asks for Lois' handbag - she slowly gives it to him, but then purposely drops it. As he bends down to pick it up, she kicks him in the head. In slow motion, he takes his gun out and fires. We see Clark's hand shoot out, and catch the bullet before it hits Lois. Clark falls down purposely, and the thief runs away, thinking that he's killed Clark. Later, we see Otis, Lex Luthor's henchman, walking down the streets. He is being followed by a detective. Otis grabs a newspaper, and then heads for the subway. He stands by a door (the detective is watching) and a train cuts him out of view. When the train is gone, Otis has vanished! The detective walks towards the door, and pushes it. We hear another train coming by, and we see a hand pushing a switch forward. As he pushes it forward, the door moves forward. With a jolt, he pushes the switch as far as it can go, and Harry, the detective, is thrown into the train, and crushed. We see a lair, with Lex Luthor and a woman (Ms. Teschmacher) inside. Otis comes in and gives the newspaper to Luthor. Luthor sees the front page, and knows that his plan is working smoothly - There will be a missile test, involving 2 500 megaton bombs.Back in the Daily Planet, Lois leaves Clark, and goes into the dressing room. She is going to take a helicopter to the airport - Air Force One is arriving, and she plans to ask the president a few questions. She is in the helicopter, and we see a wire shaking. The wire breaks off, and ties itself to the helicopter. The helicopter flies around in circles, and crashes, at the very and if the building. The pilot passes out after hitting his head, and a screaming Lois hangs on for her life. At the foot of the building, we see Clark. He picks up Lois' hat, that has fallen. He looks up, and sees Lois and the helicopter. He runs into a building, and changes into Superman! As he flies up, Lois loses grip, and falls. Superman flies up and catches her. The helicopter falls off of the building as well, and Superman catches it, to the cheers of the crowd below. Superman leaves, and Lois faints. Superman goes on a Super-spree, catches a burglar, saves a cat from a tree, saves Air Force One after it has been struck by lighting, and catches some robbers in a boat.In the extended version, there is a memorable scene, where Superman talks to Jor-El about the night. Afterwards, we see Lex, Ms. Teschmacher, and Otis in the lair. They discuss Superman. We see a scene in the Daily Planet with Perry lecturing the reporters about getting an interview with Superman. Lois sees a note in her hand, which says ""Tonight at 8, your truly, a Friend.""
We see Lois waiting. Superman comes, and they talk about his statistics. He talks to her about his x-ray vision, his invulnerability, and his speed. He offers her a chance to fly with him, and they take off. It's a very nice scene. In the end, Lois tries to communicate with Superman telepathically, she thinks he can read minds. He takes her down, changes into Clark, and comes into Lois' apartment. He is about to tell Lois who he really is, but he chickens out at the last minute, and they head to get a burger.
There are many memorable scenes in this movie, too many to list. I'll skip to the end.Like a classic James Bond movie, Luthor explains his plans to Superman. He manages to stop Superman, puts a chain around Superman with a piece of Kryptonite attached to it, and throws Superman into the pool. Ms. Teschmacher finds out that one of the missiles is headed towards Hackensack, New Jersey, where her mother lives. She saves Superman, on the condition that he will save her mother first. He does, and as he hurls the missile into space, he sees the other one his the San Andreas fault. The entire state of California shakes. Superman saves a train, a school bus, etc. He pushes the San Andreas fault back up, but that doesn't stop the aftershocks. As he saves a town from being flooded, he remembers about Lois. He finds her dead, inside her car, which fell into a crack in the Earth. His sadness turns into anger. Not able to handle it, he flies into the air. He stops, and hears voices. He hears Jor-El telling him that it is forbidden to interfere with human history. He hears Jonathan Kent say that he is here for a reason. Finally, he hears himself, ""All those things I could do...all those powers...and I couldn't even save him."" He flies away, and spins around the Earth. The Earth starts spinning in the opposite direction, thus turning back time. He comes back to Earth, and sees Lois alive. He then takes Luthor to jail.This movie was, in my opinion, the best movie ever created. It was better than the sequels, although they were all great as well. This movie has a magical feel to it, that is hard to find in most other movies. The movie was, in fact, a hit, and three sequels were created, by different directors however. This is a classic film, and if somehow, you've never seen it, I recommend renting the DVD and checking it out. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, if you have seen it, watch it again, right now.",Superman
335,ar87,"Exciting, engrossing, magical, funny, serious, romantic, epic. The most perfect movie ever.",10,20 February 2003,"Two nights ago, I viewed the Special Edition of Superman: The Movie (STM) on DVD. I hadn't played that DVD in several months. And I hadn't watched the movie beginning to end for over a year.Superman has always been my favorite movie of all time, since I first saw it on VHS as a kid. In that time that STM has been collecting dust in my cabinet, I've seen some great movies, masterpieces even. And I convinced myself that STM was still superior, though it was obvious to me that I was biased because of it's sentimentality to me.After seeing it again, my God. This IS the best film of all time. It is SO magical, it makes E.T. look like a movie about aliens. SO entertaining, Indiana Jones can't touch it. It takes itself seriously, but it's still funny. It is a HUGE movie, a total epic. And I can't forget, the music isthe best I've EVER heard. I'll go through the highlights chronologically:Krypton: Wonderful acting by Brando as Jor-El in his touching speech to baby Kal-El (Superman). Beautiful music when we first see Krypton.Smallville: MAN, the cinematography here is excellent, maybe the best I've ever seen. Little Clark saving Jonathan is perfect. I love his speech to his son later on. His death was flawlessly done, the funeral was tragic. Clark leaving and his goodbye to Martha is again, perfect. I love the music, I LOVE IT.Fortress: One of my favorite parts of the movie is when we fly through space while Jor-El talks. THIS is magic! We see Superman for the first time, he flies gracefully, the music is perfect, we're in for a great movie.Metropolis: A little bit of humor gets mixed in and I love it. Christopher Reeve's Clark is a loveable nerd. Some people find his Clark embarrassing...I think Reeve did it perfectly. He once said that there had to be more than glasses standing in for a character. Exactly. Oh, and although Lex Luthor is a villain, you can't help but grin everytime you see him. Superman and Lois share some very romantic scenes together. Even the toughest of men should feel warm inside at their flight together.The finale is outstanding. Some people find it ridiculous because it doesn't make sense. I don't know much about special relativity, but perhaps Superman isn't spinning the Earth, maybe he's going back in time by surpassing the speed of light.

336,doneil4,Forever a classic,10,13 September 2020,"To say I'm not a huge superhero fan. I do love Superman The Movie. Since I was a very young kid and now I'm just over a month away from turning 25. Superman will forever be one of my favourites. As I mentioned above, superheroes aren't always my cup of tea. I don't mind a few of the Batman movies (especially The Dark Knight Trilogy) and the Spider Man films that starred Tobey Maguire. My reason for mentioning those films is just to point out that I'm not being biased. And to prove that you don't have to be either a DC or Marvel fan to enjoy a film based off one of their comics. But what makes Superman The Movie stand out? Especially a film that has since been rebooted and is now 42 years old.Superman was done in a very much different style, and comes from a very much different era. It was like it was made to be it's own thing as well as respecting the origin of the story. I hope that makes sense to others, I can't really explain it other than that. But it's a heartwarming, exciting, emotional rollercoaster that you will keep you very much entertained. And another thing, Superman The Movie was very much made with passion and effort by people who cared about making this film. Something that we don't really see anymore. And let's certainly not forget Christopher Reeve. This man made this role his own. He played Superman/ Clark Kent with heart. He was and always will be Superman.And to say this film was made in the late 70's, I'd like to think many will be pleasantly surprised at how good the effects still hold up, at least for it's time. So don't be put off by that, you won't be disappointed. And as well as Christopher Reeve, the rest of the cast is great as well. You'll never get actors like this ever again. I mean you've got Marlon Brando as Jor El for one thing, Gene Hackman nailed the role of Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and Ned Beatty, who plays the hilarious role of Otis.Superman The Movie is more than a superhero movie for me. It represents a golden age of film that sadly, will most likely never return.So do you love superhero films? Then what you waiting for. Watch this classic.
Not big on superhero films but looking for something to watch? Superman is one I'm sure you can make an exception for.",Superman
337,axklein,Could've been better,7,24 June 2004,"CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!...... The first Christopher Reeve as Superman movie starts off regularly.....don't get me wrong, the opening credits are the best possible and it all seems good until you realise that about 40 minutes have passed without seeing superman in action......and that's the first problem....the begining is just too long.... But when Superman swings into action everything seems great.....until superman flies into Lois Lane's apartment(played by Margot Kidder.....mmmm.....there could've been a better choice for the role), and when this happens nothing is wrong really.....it's corny....but just a bit compared when superman takes her for a ride......here the great special effects we had just seen slip a bit.....and then we hear Margot Kidder talking in her mind(Can you read my mind?).....it's so dumb and extremely corny.....an scene all superman movies fans wish it wouldn't exist......... Then it all gets better.......the earthquake in california is a great menace...even for superman......even for Mario Puzo(the story writer), who couldn't think of a way out for the problem.....so then we see superman reversing everything(by changing the earth's orbit backwards!!)....this is the point where the movie falls down....actually when superman returned to earth after reversing everything, we should all be watching the earthquake again....because he REVERSED it!!!! that wouldn't stop the earthquake........definetely a terrible mistake..........even so i love this movie........mainly because of some great scenes(specially when superman appears for the first time), and for John Williams' excellent musical score(nominated for an oscar at the time).....and for christopher reeve.....the best of all possible actors to portray the hero........i just wish those terrible mistakes hadn't happened..... This movie is followed by three sequels......the first one(Superman II) is great........but the other two(specially the fourth one) are a disaster.............for this one i give it ***1/2",Superman
338,masondbk-599-80448,awesome,9,6 January 2014,this movie should be on the top 250. Christopher Reeve is the perfect superman and that is a fact. what it lacks in action it makes up for in story and writing this movie is beyond great. the premise of this movie is that Lex Luthor is going to buy desert real estate and then destroy the rest of California forcing real estate prices to soar through the roof. Of course superman finds out and has to stop Luthor and save the day. So in the end great acting magnificent story before this movie I didn't like superman that much now I do.

339,mcshermansmithy,A Superhero Classic,7,17 February 2014,"Superman was considered to be a groundbreaking film in the superhero genre back when it was released, but does it still hold up to this day?Special Upsides: Christopher Reeve is still a great and iconic Superman. Everyone else is good in their roles. The story is still pretty well-written, credits to Godfather writer Mario Puzo, and the film does have a good uplifting feeling to it. Plus, it has that awesome theme song by John Williams.Special Downsides: While Margot Kidder is still a very good Lois Lane, I didn't like how she could never figure out that Clark Kent was Superman. Next, while the film does try to fully express the themes of power and immortality, I feel that corny scenes with Lex Luthor and his stupid henchman just get in the way of those themes. Finally, that stupid ending where Superman spins the Earth around to turn back time!Verdict: While some elements don't hold up today, Superman is still a superhero classic and is recommended for any superhero fan.",Superman
340,Mintroll,funny movie loved for a long time,8,27 July 2016,"This movie has been created 18 years before I was born. I am surprised that superman was able to fly in 1978. And I like the imperfect flying technique. Recent films tend to be prefect because techniques came to be able to realize it. But I think Superman(1978) would not be interesting if it is not created in that time. Instead of technique, story is well considered and so funny. Superman is so cool and mysterious. We know Superman can do anything, and the ways is often crazy. On the other hand, he plays normal as a Clerk. Only the audience know that Superman and Clerk is the same person, so his conflict that he is perfect but has to be imperfect is one of the point worthy of note.",Superman
341,mg!,A brave critical review.,4,6 May 2002,"The reviews for Superman, do not reflect the overall score somehow.  So, I'm going to be one of the few (if not only) contribute a critical review of Superman.  Though there are lot of good things about the movie, I think its extremely dated.  I thought Reeve was stilted and clumsy.  Perhaps it was considered hip when it was made, just as Margot Kidder was considered sexy??!!.  Kidder's role of Lane was self-centered, self-serving, and self-ego.  She probably played herself.  Perhaps a 1978 audience demanded camp. And unlike other comic book villains, Lex Luthor was not insane - but a criminal.  To be balanced, here is what I liked: Marlon Brando and the Krypton world. Life in Smallville with the teenage Clark. Gene Hackman as the over-the-top villain.Many initial super-hero movies have simplistic plots.  Superman is one of them.  Though I'll buy Luthor's real estate scheme, I didn't like the execution.  It's ending was contrived and the ""I'll just go back in time"" was eye-rolling.  Why don't Clark do that in every movie?A modern PG-13 audience, (filled with 13-year olds) are more sophisticated today than the adult that went to the movies back in '78.  And perhaps that's why we may see ""Superman: Reborn""Do away with the camp, please.My grade 4/10.",Superman
342,jo007r,You will believe a man can fly!,8,16 August 2000,"That was the tagline for 'Superman The Movie' back in 1978.  By todays standards, the special effects are a little dated, but the story and screenplay hold up and make this film a timeless classic. 
Despite the incredible length of the opening credits, the audience is treated to one of John Williams' best musical scores, and we are all psyched and ready after hearing the Superman theme.  This film takes its time in introducing us to Superman as a child, and his parents.  Glen Ford is excellent as his father Jonathan Kent.  The younger Clark Kent Jeff East looks perfect as a younger Superman, was his voice dubbed by Christopher Reeve?  The scenes with Brando in this film are nicely executed, and he is convincing as Superman's father.  The funny thing is that by the time we see Superman as an adult nearly 30 minutes of the film have gone by. 
Christopher Reeve is incredible as Superman and Clark Kent, this film not only propelled him to stardom, but also showed off his acting skills by contradicting Superman and Clark Kent, the scene with him and Lois being pulled into the alley is incredibly hilarious, mainly due to Reeve's interpretation of Kent.  As Superman he shows us more heart and emotion than any other Superman before him.  His smile lights up every woman's heart who sees it, and his relationship with Lois Lane is incredibly convincing and nicely written.  Gene Hackman does a wonderful job at portraying Lex Luthor, though his scenes are not that challenging nor demanding, they are very entertaining. The chemistry between Reeve and Hackman is great.  Just about everything in this movie is wonderful, and will entertain you time and time again. 
This film could have easily been a disaster, but thanks to hard work, wonderful writing and tremendous care being taken by the producers, this is the best comic book movie ever made!",Superman
343,wadetaylor,I don't get it.,3,12 February 2005,"OK, I am not a comic book guy, so I apologize if I offend anyone, but I HATED this movie. This is the only movie in which I remember ever stating that fact out loud at about the 20 minute mark, then groaning at the end as I said ""I hated that movie."" I don't get it, I don't understand why this is supposed to be good. First I found the swooshing credits, just about the most annoying credits I have ever seen, they made me want to puke. I was so confused with Marlon Brando getting top billing for basically a cameo, the glowing suits, the people being confined to a shard of glass then being released into space, I couldn't figure out what was going on. We then get the brief glance at Clark as a teenager looking nothing like he does just a couple of years later. I really hated this movie, I thought the dialogue was stupid, I thought the part with Superman and Lois flying was stupid, I thought Lois dying in the first movie and Superman rotating the earth to save her would have been better used in a later episode (I know they didn't know then that there would be more, but where do you go from there?) To me it was all capped off by Superman just dropping off Lex and Ned Beatty without showing how he captured them. Oh Man, I hated this movie. Going in, I thought I was going to like it. I liked other comic book movies: Spiderman 1&2, X men 1&2, and Batman, but I hated this movie. I have told people that it is far from the worst movie have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of bad ones, but I hated no other movie like Superman: The Movie.

348,derrickneal-98015,Superman Origins,7,1 October 2019,"Before the deluge of superhero cinema there was Richard Donner's Superman- the first big budget superhero movie. Taking Superman as a whole, there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be, and it never apologizes about its origins. There are numerous sly nods to many aspects of Superman lore - a young Clark Kent outracing a train, Clark stopping a speeding bullet, the race to find a place to change into the Superman costume when a telephone booth has been replaced by a kiosk, and the reference to ""truth, justice, and the American way."" Christopher Reeve is good as superman/Clark Kent and Margot Kidder gives a good portrayal as Louis Lane. Also, on hand are Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman to lend some heft to the star cast although both ham the scenery. Richard Donner's Superman has been superseded by many better superhero films, but it was the first of its kind and as such shall always remain special.",Superman
349,frannywentzel,You'll believe a man could fly - as for the rest of the story...,8,19 June 2006,"By the time this movie had been released, the naive idealism that begat the original Caped Crusader had long been tossed asunder in the post-Vietnam/Watergate America with the idols of Church and Country duly smashed by the post-modern 1960's generation. One telling symbol of the sea-change in the culture is the scene where Clark Kent seeking a place to change out of his street clothes briefly contemplates one of those new-fangled kiosk pay-telephones before selecting a revolving door.Details like that actually worked in this movie. Too bad major aspects of the plot don't work so well if you take a second to think about them. Like, for example the Army/Navy ballistic missile test that is key to Lex Luthor's real estate scheme.In the middle of the Cold War the United State government gets the bright idea to launch not one but two FULLY ARMED NUCLEAR MISSILES as a ""test"". Because there's no way the Soviet Union could possibly misinterpret such an aggressive act. And because you really want to test a new weapons system with live warheads. Oh, and it's not like the Atmospheric Nuclear Test Ban treaty Kennedy signed in the early-60s wouldn't still be in effect.Once you get over the wonder of what is the whole point of this you still have to wonder how Lex Luthor could've deduced that a chunk of Superman's home planet would have any measurable effect. The best I could come up with is that Superman's powers are a defence mechanism and the presence of Krytonite relaxes those defences. But the movie never mentions that.Then one must wonder if Lex Luthor ever considered the massive economic depression that would've resulted in the loss of California its infrastructure and its 20 million tax-paying residents. Think the devastation of World War One, which ended Europe's primacy in the world.Incidentally California wouldn'tve even fallen into the sea. To this date the San Andreas has about 30/35 metres of plate movement stored up.And while we're nitpicking - can you really hold a 707 jetliner in the palm of one hand and not have the thing collapse around you?",Superman
350,hexfield,Christopher Reeve IS the Man of Steel,7,25 March 2000,"NOTE:  I included what some may consider spoilers on the first few scenes. Nothing big or crucial, but read with care...I finally got around to watching this classic film the other night.  The dramatic opening credit sequence really got me psyched, and somewhat contrary to my expectations, Marlon Brando was great as Jor-El (how could I have doubted Brando?).  I enjoyed watching the setup scenes on Clark's high school years and his discovery of his Kryptonian heritage.  I admit, however, that I was really waiting for the young Jeff East to exit and for Chris Reeve to step in as the older Clark/Superman.  Finally Clark completes his studies on Krypton's past and we see a short teaser scene of Reeve flying toward the screen in his classic reds and blues.But the film makers managed to keep me in suspense by stopping the action there and cutting to a scene of the bustling offices of the Daily Planet. Lois chats with Jimmy Olsen and then proceeds to enter Perry White's office where she is introduced to Reeve as the be-speckled Clark Kent.  Folks, these next three or four scenes comprise the true apex of the film, not to mention the best bit of acting I've seen in some time.  In fact whenever Reeve is onscreen (as Kent or Superman) you're guaranteed a fantastic performance, but this is never more evident than in his scenes as the bumbling reporter.You won't even fully realize how talented Reeve is until the scene in which he's talking to Lois offstage.  He begins as Clark.  Then he starts to work up the courage to reveal his secret identity.  He removes his glasses. Considers things carefully.  And begins to speak as Superman.  IT'S AMAZING!!  He grows about 4 inches, his voice (which you probably hadn't even noticed was high) deepens a pitch or two, his expressions and gestures become noticeably more confident.....and then he decides against the revelation and IMMEDIATELY returns to the nerdy Kent.I had no idea just how in control Reeve was of his every move.  This is so ironic and heart-breaking considering this master thespian is now almost totally paralyzed.  Seeing the determination and commitment he gave to this part, I am more sure than ever that Christopher Reeve will walk again someday.The rest of the film was well written, but really only a few echelons above average.  I would give the film a 6 or a 6.5 but Reeve shot my score up to a high 7.  For those of you who haven't seen Superman yet, I won't detail anymore scenes (and there are several more good ones).  But needless to say it is a MUST SEE.  Go rent it, make some popcorn, and watch it with the lights out.  Up, up, and AWAY!",Superman

First of all, Christopher Reeves didn't play Superman; He is Superman. I cannot think of any other person playing this role. Christopher Reeves nails it. John Williams score for the movie is genius, The song screams Superman. I agree after Superman 2 they were some really bad Superman movies. If Man Of Steel turns out to be bad then I guess Superman movies will just end. But I have a lot of fate on Zack Snyder, he's made some really good movies like 300, Watchmen, Dawn Of The Dead.

354,ulyssesgammahose,Review of the 3-hour extended cut,8,22 October 2017,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news....but the new 3 hour cut is not worth watching. It just makes everything longer for no reason, it's clear why the extra scenes were deleted in the first place, and a lot of it actually detracts from the film. The most worthwhile additions are: Superman saving Miss Tessmacher from Lex's pit of big cats; more on Lois' interview with the Native American; and more disaster movie action during the earthquake.But most of it is just padding and jokes which fall flat. The scenes of the Metropolis cops pursuing Otis? This is now twice as long, for no real reason. There are longer establishing shots. There's stuff we don't need to see, like Clark and Lois getting a taxi after the alleyway mugger incident. And so on. We get a lot more of Lex, Otis and Miss Tessmacher messing around, and most of it is simply not very good. The whole sequence of them changing the nuclear codes and encountering the soldiers on the bridge is now much longer, and full of gags, but ruins the underlying danger of what's happening. In fact that sums up my feelings on the 3 hour cut as a whole; I thought it would make the film seem more epic, but it actually makes it more of a comedy. The only addition which is funny is when Otis follows Lex around, trying to squeeze the water out of his robe. The best thing about the 3 hour cut is that is shows you what a film editor does. By looking at this and then the normal version or the Donner cut, you can see that by trimming the fat, making everything more succinct, clearer and pacier, you can create a better movie.",Superman

Go into it open-minded, expecting to see a film made in the late 70's, and you won't be dis-appointed.The basic story follows Supermans origins, on Krypton, and a little backstory or Jor-El, Supermans dad. As Superman comes to Earth, he falls for Lois Lane, who falls for Superman, not Clark Kent. So then CLark and Superman, the same people, fight for her affections, along with their battle with Lex Luther.Some corny parts in the movie include how Clarks clothes kinda fade out into his Superman outfit, and some cheesy dialogue between Superman and Lois, but then again, I don't know how they talked back in the late 70's.Overall, this movie is worth your time, especially, if your a new Superman fan, as am I.

358,IrishWriter34,A genuine classic that still hasn't gotten its due,10,16 May 2002,"Richard Donner's 1978 film SUPERMAN has to be one of the most misunderstood films of all time. In an age where it's ""hip"" to deconstruct superhero characters and make them grim-n-gritty and/or vapid teen idols, the movie can't help but come off as a valentine to a bygone era. And with the advent of SMALLVILLE and a proposed new Superman movie (in which producer Jon Peters and his crew have been trying for the past 10 years to radically alter everything about the character except the name), even Superman fans have taken to bashing Donner's film, sneering at it as being ""campy,"" too reverential of the source material, and too ""dated.""And yetnothing could be further from the truth. Far from being ""dated,"" SUPERMAN is just as fresh and timely today as it was 24 years ago, and the spectacular digital restoration (including a new sound FX track-the original had deteriorated) makes the movie look just as fresh and new as the latest box-office hits. Even more impressive is how the special effects have held up; except for three brief front-projection shots, you can still believe a man can fly. I can only imagine that the ""dated"" claims have to do with the film being 24 years old and having been made before CGI and choppy MTV-style editing came into use, because there's nothing else about the film that dates it to the 1970s. (Do yourselves a favor and watch the 3 documentaries on the DVD. They give incredible insight into how much work was put into the film.)And then there's the script, by Tom Mankiewicz (credited to Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton). When producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind first developed the project, they intended it to be a camp comedy. When Donner and Mankiewicz came aboard, the film was altered into a serious piece, and the end result is magical. We're given an epic depiction of the origin of Superman, beginning with the Krypton holocaust, going thru his childhood in Smallville, and finally ending up in Metropolis where the adult Superman faces his first trial-by-fire in his encounter with Lex Luthor. The story has plenty of humor in it, but it's still played straight, and runs the entire gamut of emotions. The oft-criticized ending, in which Lois dies in an earthquake and a grieving Superman defies his oath to not interfere with human history by flying back in time to save her, is the defining character moment for Superman. In defying the orders of his father and following his heart, Superman rejects his alien heritage and embraces his humanity. It's a great moment, but yet it's one that too many people are quick to bash because ""he can save anybody that way."" They don't see what it really means as a character bit. Making the story even stronger is Donner's taut, reverent direction, as well as some truly great acting. Christopher Reeve IS Clark Kent/Superman, body and soul (his own size mirrors the physical stats of the comic book character). Playing the role with heart and conviction, Reeve literally becomes the character made flesh. Marlon Brando, in his small role as Jor-El, is also excellent, bringing a commanding dignity to film. Gene Hackman's sociopathic Luthor, a guy who merrily jokes and brags about himself while planning an act of genocide simply to make big real estate money, is both funny and chilling. Add to this knockout trio fine performances by an international cast of superstars, and the film comes alive. Also of note is the powerful score by John Williams. Those condemn this score as being ""too heroic"" need to have their hearing checked. Williams delivers more than just heroism; he captures the eerie ambiance of Krypton, the rural warmth of Smallville, and the romanticism and tragedy of Superman and Lois' relationship beautifully. And to cap it all off, he gives Superman one of the most unforgettable fanfares in film history. Further strengthening the film is Stuart Baird's brisk, punchy editing; John Barry's lavish production designs (including the memorable crystalline Krypton); Yvonne Blake's clever costuming (the glowing Krypton costumes, and a flawless rendering of Superman's classic suit); and Geoffrey Unsworth's misty, ethereal cinematography, which enhances the fairy tale aspects of the character. Every step of the way, the film successfully brings Superman and his world to life.That said, SUPERMAN has its flaws. Ned Beatty's Otis character is mostly a non-entity; he doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. And Margot Kidder is badly miscast as Lois; not only is she far too tomboyish to play what in the comics is a glamorous character, but she comes off more like Reeve's vapid sister than she does a feisty love interest. Their scenes only work because Reeve makes us buy into the movie. Watching the screen test for Anne Archer-a much better and much better-looking actress, I can't help wondering why she wasn't cast as Lois instead. She would have been perfect opposite Reeve. (But to be fair to Kidder, she was way better than most of the other actresses tested-Stockard Channing in particular was awful.) And there's a really careless glitch when Superman saves Air Force One; the film is reversed when he grabs the plane, so his emblem and spit-curl are both backwards. But in the end, those flaws aren't enough to weaken SUPERMAN's impact. It was and still is not only the best comic book movie ever, but it's also one of the finest films ever made, period. Those who bash the classic version of Superman and this film while supporting the planned Jon Peters version should definitely reconsider their stance. This is not an inept drek-fest like BATTLEFIELD EARTH, nor is it a heartless, soulless mess like the Peters film promises to be. This is a beautiful, heartfelt piece of Americana, crafted with love and respect. SUPERMAN deserves to be seen as the classic it is, not to be disrespected and forgotten.",Superman

Let's just hope that the new Zack Snyder movie will be just as good (if that's possible). I can't wait to see Superman II! My favorite line was probably Zod's final line in this movie. ""You will bow down before me!"" That is just hammy acting at it's best:)",Superman

361,brendancrowl,I Believe A Man Could Fly,7,23 April 2020,"Richard Donner's 1978 film, Superman, is considered by many as a classic DC film to millions of fans. Christopher Reeve stars in this movie as the man of steel himself, Superman, who was once from the planet Krypton and was sent into a portal down to earth who is then discovered by the Kents and becomes their son. Personally, I think Christopher Reeve is the best Superman of all time and plays the part perfectly. Stan Lee himself once said in an interview, ""That first Superman Movie was superb. It not only brought in kids. But also families and made people think these are fascinating characters."" This was actually my first encounter with anything Superman related because after that, I myself became a fan of Superman. From movies to comic books.",Superman
362,Anton Versluys,"Darkness and grittyness aside, this is was Superman was meant to be.",9,23 July 2018,"Salkind's Superman movie, directed by former television craftman Richard Donner has long ago departed from its shelf of mere adventure movie and is now a pop culture phenomenon, deemed -however- as a bit too dated or campy for current audiences. This ambitious production is indeed far from the strong drama overtones from Fox's X-men series, the exaggerated misanthropy of (the good ones) Batman films or the cool cynism from Iron Man, just to mention some examples of what superhero genre has produced over the years. At the very begginning, when superhero productions were mostly adventure serials made for TV with lower budgets and campy effects, this initiative came mostly as a show-off statement from Alexander and Illya Salkind, who encouraged themselves to prove they can do a larger than life movie on one of the most conspicuous american characters. The well know story of the alien refugee who become Earth's biggest champion of justice is, at its best moments, a canvas to universal themes rendered as fun-driven adventure plot with, at the date of its release, sophisticated special effects.That being said, the greatest virtue of Donner's Superman is not in the dated production design, the old-fashioned visual effects or the campiness that drags the second part of the plot. Superman is, above it all, a movie that installed a canon and serves as a multi-layered tale of themes on what makes a hero, that lead us from one to another interpretation after several viewings. Seeing this movie as a child at late 70's, we were mostly mesmerized by the visual effects; as an adult, in the other hand, we are more sensitive to the powerful subtleness of intimate scenes, like the iconic moral strenght of the Kents or the almost naive determination for good of the main character. The perennial magic of this movie lies on its soul, and the faithful translation of what Superman was meant to be: the greatest boy-scout who ever existed. At this point, this origin story it's a character driven tale which serves it's purpose with help from the sarcastic (without being too harsh or abrasive) counterpoint of Lois Lane, the cartoonish evil of Luthor and the casual cynism of any Metropolis citizen that depicts a funny snapshot of society at the end of seventies.The religious alussions are subtle too, in the perfect balance of fantasy and symbolism without being too preachy, which is the most criticized point of the recent versions of the character; there's no another awkward ""Jesus-Superman"" parable here, just the adequate keys to install some universal conceptions to massive audiences about what Superman is. IMHO, perhaps one of the most notable and powerfully emotional scenes is when the big guy jumps outside Perry White's office and goes through the Metropolis skyline searching for Luthor's threat, while a bunch of office girls run and cheerish to admire her beloved guardian the instant he flyes near their window, and short later some pedestrians at the street are witnesses of his power while Superman seems to be unawared of what he inspires; that IS Superman: an unlikely force of good seen over the shoulders of astounded people who stares in disbelief, not only for the amazing nature of such outlandish powers, but also because he embodies an almost naive sense of willingness. Powerful and effective, a movie that wanted to be as big as life itself, but has become a classic because its most remarkable achievement relies on its light-hearted simplicity.",Superman
363,ryleereiter,Monday Movie Memories,9,8 December 2020,"I can't express how pleasing it is to me to revisit classic movies from a lifetime ago. Many modern films emphasize sensationalism and the glory of extreme measures in visual effects to impress the audience beyond the prior blockbuster with the same design. I understand the importance to progress, but when did everything have to become a competition? Older movies can make you cry, laugh, smile, and feel joy all in the same reel of film. The lack of these elements in a film only make the wave of nostalgia that much more enjoyable to ride in a film like Superman (1978). The personality, writing, and theater style performances by the cast have this movie sitting at a 9/10 on my ratings log, which has inspired me to begin a Monday tradition for revisiting older movies, and claims the honor of my highest score given since beginning my movie review hashtag last month.

Growing up in Belfast during a very dark time in the countries history movies and music was my only escapism (it was the same for a lot of kids) not knowing quite what to expect as a twelve year old' then the opening titles began and it became a life changing experience. If ever a movie had to live up to is opening title this was it' and it didn't disappoint. This guy can save the world and maybe he can come over here and save us (bit naive maybe but I was twelve) but this was very profound movie for me and I have never felt that since superman. So as I was saying just writing a review just wouldn't do it any justice' this wasn't a movie this was a couple of hours when the world outside didn't matter to me' as far as I was concerned all these troubles were happening somewhere else and that was because superman was here' and when the infant superman was put in that pod to escape his troubled planet' well it couldn't have been more profound for any kid in a troubled world. In now in my late forties and have a grandson I cant wait for him to get a bit older and give him the cinema experience, it wont be the same one I had but a couple of hours in a dark theatre will thrill him I'm sure, rest in peace Christopher Reeve.",Superman
365,MrLuthor89,Truly one of the greatest Epic Comic Book movies of all time.,10,17 July 2005,"Nowadays, comic book movies are being released every two months. Most of them rushed into production, without any real time to make a smart, intelligent, and cinematic type of a comic book movie that fans or non fans would like to see. This was not the case in 1977-78. Richard Donner was given the task to create the first movie of it's kind. The one that started it all...Superman. What superhero would better start off the trend than the Man of Steel? The hero that has become an American icon and a symbol for pop culture. As director Bryan Singer of Superman Returns would say, ""You could go into the jungle with a cross and an S, and the two would be equally recognized."" Every genre has those special movies that were made early in the game, that would be repeated or looked back on with admiration, but very few can point the finger at a film and say ""That is where it began."" This is where comic book films were born...In Superman.The film opens with the beautiful and far more advanced planet of Krypton. On this planet, we witness the respected elder, Jor-El (Marlon Brando), passing judgment on three malevolent characters named General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran). After the elders of Krypton find these three villains guilty, Zod promises vengeance on his jailer (Jor-El), and is sent into the vacuum of space encased in the Phantom Zone, only to return in a later chapter. Jor-El is known to be neither irrational or impulsive to his peers, but his theory of the planet's destruction is quickly shunned by the others and he is forbidden to speak another word of it. As a result, Jor-El sends his child, Kal-El, to live on our planet Earth, where he would learn to live among us. After his departure...the planet of Krypton, along with his father and mother (Sussanah York) is destroyed. Enter Smallville, a quiet, southern town, where the two kindest farmers, Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford) adopt the newly landed Kal-El, and name him Clark Kent. In his teen years, following the death of his adoptive father, he returns to his routes, with the help of the crystals he arrived on our planet with. Within the confines of his Fortress of Sollitude, he learns from the spirit of his true father, Jor-El, and becomes...Superman.Upon his arrival at Metropolis, Kal-El/Superman assumes a new identity...the bumbling and pathetic Clark Kent. He is shown as a fool, who uses words like ""swell"" and slouches. Naturally appearing as a non-aggressive wimp to his boss (Jackie Cooper) and co-workers, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure). Eventually, Clark falls in love with Lois, who in fact, loves Superman. As the world meets and greets their new hero Superman, an evil plot is brewing below the streets of Metropolis. The ""feindishly gifted"" Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is planning the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Upon buying thousands of acres of useless land in California, he'll send a rocket towards the San Andreas fault, allowing the rest of California to fall into the sea. Luthor is joined by the dim-witted henchman, Otis (Ned Beatty) and the gorgeous and also dim-witted bad girl, Ms. Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine). After his plan to kill Superman w/ kryptonite fails...Luthor watches as Superman reverses his plans and saves the day. Superman, while forbidden to interfere with the mortality of the people of Earth, turns the planet and it's time backwards to save the woman he loves, Lois (who had died in a car wreck) from death. After Lois's rescue, Luthor was locked up for a good sentence of life plus 25.While the special effects were marvelous for their time, the actors lit up the screen along with the impeccable and unforgettable music by John Williams. Christopher Reeve shines in his career defining role as the Man of Steel. While being an over grown boyscout, Reeve still projects a great charm and presence that no other actor was able to bring to the iconic role of Superman. Reeve also deserves credit for being able to play it straight when Hackman and Beatty where having a blast being insane villains in their scenes with him. Reeve was and always will be...Superman. Gene Hackman began the trend of having big stars chew the scenery as the villain in the comic book film genre. While Hackman refused to wear a bald cap or shave his head for the film, he wears noticeably silly wigs throughout the movie, making his baldness obvious. While some will criticize his ""wig"" choice as well as his comedic approach, at this time in comics, Luthor was a boring 2 dimensional mad scientist (this was long before he became the corporate villain we all know), so I believe Hackman brought a much needed wit and charm to a seemingly boring role. His humor and his brilliance as an actor make the seemingly unbearable character on the page a brilliant piece of acting. Margot Kidder allows us to see who Lois Lane is, a great and beautiful reporter, who is in love with a super hero and can't spell to save her life. The rest of the cast that surrounds Reeve, Hackman, and Kidder play out well. Finally, for the glorious 20 min and $4 million cameo from the late, great Marlon Brando. His performance in this film is so good that you wouldn't believe that Brando's name would never be attached to Superman til after his unfortunate passing. But from what was seen in the film, especially the ""I could embrace you in my arms, my son"" moment, its a shame those Salkinds cut him out of part II (looking forward to the Richard Donner Cut). The special effects, the music, the performances, and the epic scale, do Superman the super justice it deserves.R.I.P. Christopher Reeve...The Real life Superman9/10",Superman

Hackmans Luthor plots to sink the west coast into the sea and delivers excellent one liners to his on screen nemesis. The immortal Christoper Reeve is by far the best actor ever to play the man of tomorrow, his strut and looks as well as his intelligent portrayal of Clark Kent make for a fangirls dream.

367,theperfectmarysuekiller,What a Major Disappointment- this is no masterpiece,3,21 August 2014,"I honestly do not get why people love this film so much. Did I even watch the same movie these guys did?The movie starts on Krypton, a surprisingly dull set piece that looks more like something cooked up by a designer who is very rich, yet lacking in imagination. Nothing makes it really stand out as a truly alien world, making for a rather forgettable set piece.Once Superman arrives on Earth, we see his origin story, which doesn't particularly stand out to me, largely due to the movie not really examining what his experience with his powers are like when he is young and can't control him. Another point of contention is that when he is 18, he is played by an actor who doesn't fit the look of Superman. We get to the part where he works at the daily planet, which is watchable.The acting is decent, for the most part, I'll give the movie that much. But I honestly feel it could have been put to better use.Now, for the plot. My first problem with this is that the missiles Lex Luthor steals would not be transported in any state for which they would be assembled and fit to use for the safety hazards this would pose. My second problem is that even a 100 megaton yield hydrogen bomb on top of a fault line would not be enough to cause a major earthquake. If Lex Luthor was such a brilliant scientist, he should have known that. It just doesn't make sense.My third problem is that Superman brings Lois Lane back from the dead by reversing time itself by going backwards around the Earth (with terrible yet unintentionally funny special effects), which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It also kills what precious little suspense was there to begin with because Superman could theoretically keep doing this whenever he felt like it. It really just felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and pulled something out of their asses to keep the plot going.This movie suffers from a terminally bland character who is never endangered by anything but kryptonite, and whose only personality trait is ""nice"" and other slight variants. We never see any of the dilemmas a godlike alien who was the last of his species and an alien to the planet he lives on would face. Instead, we see a smiling, perfect hero who is not merely incapable of doing wrong, but incapable of being tempted. If ""nice"" and ""perfect"" are the only personality traits one has to go by, than it becomes meaningless. The smiling, easygoing hero feels forced and fake.I have heard that Superman being nigh invincible is interesting when he has to avoid being tempted to use his powers for selfish purposes, which would be true if he was capable of being tempted.With poor special effects, a plot greatly weakened by holes and general lack of logic and an overdramatic score that blares out even when nothing of importance happens, I got one of the biggest disappointments of my childhood in this movie. And what frustrates me the most is that if Superman could be written so he is less one dimensional, it would be a movie worth seeing. Ultimately, though, this movie is a dull, unfulfilling exercise in wasted potential lack character development, a good plot, a good score and decent/interesting special effects. This, however, is just my opinion and you can feel free to have your own.",Superman

369,lilievitra,A Super Sort of Kindness in Superman,9,26 May 2019,"I re-visited watching Superman as a grown up and what a surprise and delight it was to watch it again!! What touched me the most in Superman/Clark Kent this time around was his Gentleness, his Great Respect for mankind, his Softness, his Great Attention for others, his Great Patience, his Vulnerability!! Where do you see in films nowadays men and superheros even more with that level of true consideration for others without looking ""unmanly""- ""Soapy"" or a ""Looser""??? I think Christopher Reeves managed exactly that. That ability to bring strenght, gentleness and forgiveness in others. It is like Christopher Reeves finds a way to infuse that ability that Superman has to ""forgive"" mankind all the time for being imperfect. He plays this underlining act with Lois Lane that says:""i will make you believe i am a fool to you and the rest of the world. And boy aren't i having fun making you believe i am goofy and foolish."" Like it is almost a relief for him to be that goofy at times. I hadn't noticed that as a kid. Despite looking ""perfect"" as a goody two shoes, in his eyes and his manner I now see that Christopher Reeves has infused the persona of Superman with intelligence, great humility and adoration for any kind of life. If you hear him in interviews, you can hear the type of real person he was. A very humble person. i can now tell that Christopher Reeves took to heart to bring this character to a place where very little superheroe goes...which is showing a sort of unconditional love to others. I must say that Lois Lane is quite annoying as a character. Not very professional or kind, very cold hearted. It makes the film less appealing. Margot Kidder acting doesn't come across as she really wants to be in the set. I didn't feel she was very invested in the role. Yes, the plot is a little all over the place. But I must say that i was amazed by the Krypton scenes at the beginning. All krypton settings have been beautifully done. Very imaginatively done and impressive for 1978. And of course the sountrack! Genius when you think about it! how mythical now!",Superman
370,popsicle820,Superman,10,31 December 2000,"I have read every comment on this site about the movie.  Some of you hate it.  Most of you love it.  Thank God.  I guess most of you didn't like the going-back-in-time sequence.  One of you commented that Superman was willing to risk the entire planet to save the woman he loved, or something like that.  I love everything about the movie but that comment made me look at that part in perspective.  Hey, yeah.  That's right.  I didn't think about that.Anyway, I was a year old when this movie was released.  I first saw it when I was six and I always watch it when the opportunity presents itself.  And I can't believe that not everyone has seen this movie.  I thought everyone on EARTH saw this movie already.  It's one of the best ever made.  EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BY NOW.  A definite MUST-SEE.My favorite part is the helicopter scene.  It's the most spectacular scene I've ever seen in any movie.  Ever.  Just the best.  Can never be equaled. I especially love the way Superman looked at Lois when they were at her place and she was interviewing him.  ""If I had a girlfriend, you'd be the first to know about it.""  That was Superman's line when he gave her the ""look.""  If I didn't get that line right, correct me.I've seen the movie so many times and every time I watch it, I find that there are so many things that I still did not understand.  So every time I watch it, it's like watching it for the first time all over again.  It's like magic.  Something new every time.I thought the movie was perfect until I read all your comments.  Now I want to be part of the writing team.  Let's start with, how come the earth opened up only until it was enough to reach Lois' car?  Why didn't it go beyond? That would've been more believable.  And yes, when Superman did the go-back-in-time bit, what happened to the aftershocks? Lois mentioned the earthquake and all that stuff after Superman went back to her.  But the aftershocks should still have been there.  He would be there just in time to save Lois from drawing her last breath.  She would be in the process of being buried alive but just in time for him to get her out of the situation. Or just in time to give her a frantic mouth-to-mouth.  That would have been more dramatic and it would give Superman a chance to save her one more time, with Lois knowing about it, too.  They would hug.  Superman would help Lois to her feet.  They would be both very filthy.  They would be about to kiss when Jimmy shows up and Jimmy would tell them that he got great pictures of the aftershocks, including the earth opening up and going BEYOND Lois' car. He would also say those lines he said in the movie when he interrupted them. I think that would have been better.  Sorry to all who hate the going-back-in-time part.  I wouldn't change that for the world. But if it had been done my way, you wouldn't have hated it at all.
I'm sure there are other parts that need rewriting but like I said before, every time I watch it it's like watching it for the first time all over again.  But I wouldn't change the actors, the writers, the director, the producers, the cinematographers, the special effects people, everyone whose name was mentioned in the closing credits, and definitely not the music. It's perfect.  They all did a wonderful job.There is only one thing I don't like about it now.  Now I see that the racing-the-train scene was just a camera trick.  When I was younger, I thought it was an awesome scene.  It was real.  Now it's not.  I hate the fact that I'm now used to all this digital technology that I am beginning to see the limits of this movie in special effects.  At least the flying still looks believable to me.  At least most of it.  I even hate saying that last part.One of you also commented that Christopher Reeve not just has the looks of Superman but also the HEART of Superman.  I like that.  And someone else said that in real life, Mr. Reeve is a real superman because in spite of what happened to him, he still remains strong especially since he has all the encouragement and love that his family gives him.  And I sincerely hope that one day, he will walk again.  I will live for that day.  Because red cape or not, HE IS SUPERMAN.",Superman
371,Hildebrando_Martins_Almeida,"This English production was made to distract and it executes perfection that task, therefore, don't wait more serious.",8,9 September 2006,"Notices for the editors: I don't know how to write in English language. This text was translated by electronic translator of the Portuguese for English.This English production was made to distract and it executes perfection that task, therefore, don't wait more serious. After all, as to take a film whose protagonist uses such a ridiculous clothes seriously? The first dialog of the film, said for Soft Marlon, it is: "" This is not fantasy "". He was referring to the destruction of the planet Kripton, but as the film it is pure fantasy, then it ended up being a little ridiculous. Actually, the own written insists on leaving clear that this film is an amusement for all the ages to the they insert a series of humorous scenes: Clark Kent, adolescent, arriving before the friends; Clark tries to change of clothes but the modern phone cabinet doesn't facilitate its task for faster than he is; the thief that beats a bar of iron in the head of the hero; Clark identifying the color of Lois Lane pants; Otis, Lex Luthor's awkward assistant, etc. At that time of its accomplishment, the publicity informed that "" You will believe that the man can fly "". Yes, still today, same being confronted with the spectacular digital effects of the films of the present time, the scenes of flight of the hero resist marvelously. The ransom of Lois and of the helicopter it also continues very good. The rifts in the soil, provoked by the earthquake, also resisted at the time. One of the details that were still worse (yes, at that time already they were bad) they are those scale models when it dams it it tears and the water destroys the houses. The sceneries that create again the world of Kripton leave clear the lack of inspiration of the responsible persons for this section. After all. how is it possible to live in a world as that? There are absurd rights that nor they should be mentioned, but I insist on stressing for they be serious mistakes: 1) when Superman takes Lois Lane for a night flight she gets to just support the weight of the gravity in its body holding the fort of the fingers of the hero. Now! Who has flight capacity it is him, not her. She only drops when the hands of both they come unfastened. 2) if it existed in the real life a man capable to fly faster than the speed of the light, would he get to change the rotation of the Earth and to do the time to retreat? Superman rotates in high rotation and it penetrates in the soil, but the stones that are thrown for the sides don't hurt the people. These other mistakes are already original of the creator of Superman: if he is invulnerable, as it gets to cut the hair and the beard? And the uniform ridicule, was it ordered in some dressmaker of Kripton? I also want a clothes that doesn't tear, it doesn't dirty and doesn't disintegrate. How is it possible the people they recognize not that Clark Kent is just Superman because of some glasses and a slight change in the hairstyle? It is worth to stand out the very competent professional works of two: Geoffrey Unsworth's formidable picture, and Richard Donner's direction that knew how to combine the action scenes, romance and humor well. Who likes of the film can never deny that a lot of its charm is due to its great cast: Reeve is impeccable, as much as disturbed him Clark Kent, or as the fearless hero. Hackman nor he needs to make an effort to demonstrate its talent. Ned Beatty, an actor that nor everybody notices, it is very funny. Glenn Ford, in a fleeting participation, leaves good memories. It is Marlon Brando  always a splendid actor  no matter how much it has despised its role, it won a voluminous wage for few minutes in scene and it attracted a lot of publicity to the film. Still on the cast: Margot Kidder, in Lois Lane paper, was old, thin and ugly. The producers made a serious mistake when climbing the actress for this film. In the following films, in spite of its good performances, she was still thiner. Forget the daily problems, to see ""Superman - The Film "" is a diversion for every hour, for all the always.

It's SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE,10,3 July 2003,"There are movies that have captured the imagination of generations, like the Star Wars movies (God, how I hated the Star Wars movies) and the Indiana Jones trilogy, Superman is one of them.A year ago, if you'd asked me what I' thought of the movie my answer would be ""it CRAP"". But, I go the DVD free with the British movie magazine EMPIRE and thought ""Okay, well, I'll give it a try"". I obviously did and fell in love with it.The movie starts of on the planet Kryton, Kal-El/Superman/Clark Kent's (Christopher Reeve) home planet, where evil the evil General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas) and Non (Jack O'Halloran) are being sentenced to life imprisonment in the Phantem Zone by the Council of Kryton lead by Jor-El (Marlon Brando), Superman's father. Jor-El's theory of Kryton's destrucion has been over-ruled by the council and he and his wife have been forbidden to leave the planet. Jor-El's theory is right. Just before Kryton blows up Jor-El sends baby Kar-El to earth where he is brought up by the Martha and Jonathan Kent (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford).

373,mygreatness321,This film really is Excellent,10,20 September 2005,"I watched this film the other day for the first time in say 5 years plus. As a kid I watched it all the time on a video my parents taped from Christmas Day 1983, (I know this since it has the Queens Speech just before it). I thought I knew the film off by heart therefore, until the other day.... SPOILER: The scene near the end where Superman finds Lois' dead body was extended from the 'cut' version I had seen, to the point where he is basically just staring at her in silence for about 3 minutes. I found this to be very powerful indeed and showed Christopher Reeve to be a pretty damn good actor. My opinion of this film had always been good, and this opinion was backed by critics always giving it 5 stars - but this scene added further weight to that view.Aside from this it is truly excellent. The first 40 minutes or so are concerned with the origins of Superman, the relationship with his adopted parents, and how this shapes him. Marlon Brando's part, while relatively small, is very worthwhile and enjoyable to watch. The film then moves into comic book territory and is almost completely different. The same change you get from country to city I suppose, the fact that the young Clark Kent is played by someone other than Reeve despite the fact he can't really be much younger enhances this change. It's a very brave thing to do midway through a film which is already working perfectly well.From here we get to see all the things we expected: Mild-mannered Clark Kent, heroic Superman, the hint of a love story, an excellent comedic villain played expertly by Gene Hackman, and a brilliant bit of pacing so you never get bored.The score is a classic, no doubt about that, probably in the top 10 of all time. If you doubt it, watch this film again and listen to the music.This film is outstanding and for me still the benchmark for all superhero films.

The dorky news reporter Clark Kent is obviously the dashing, muscular humanoid alien Superman. I thought the film provided a good beginning and introduction to Superman's life, history, and home. This might not be the best program for a family with young kids to be viewing. Lex Luther's female accomplice's wardrobe features some inappropriate/revealing outfits. In one scene Superman is seen completely naked as a boy. Several people die (obviously), one of which is murdered by being run over on a subway track. There is some mild language. The green screen superimposing for some of Superman's flying sequences do look primitive by today's cinematography standards. All that set aside, I absolutely loved most of the graphics, animations, explosions, effects, and sci-fi prop and wardrobe creations.",Superman

I usually hate it when they tell a comic story from the beginning, it takes too long to tell the origin, so the movie goes on for 4 hours, or ends up sucking, this is not the case!

379,mbeswick99,A wonderful film,10,20 May 2003,"I agree with many of the previous reviewers. This really was one of the fore-runners of the fantasy event films that seem so common these days. Unlike modern blockbusters however films like Superman did not fizzle out almost as soon as they opened, but instead seemed to dominate the cinemas for months. Indeed as well as being very much part of its age the first Superman film also helped to define it. It's of a time when Hollywood films, even the big budget fantasy scripts, were still made for an adult audience. The film has a sly, literate script that embraces the mythic qualities of the Superman legend at the same time as it gently mocks some of its more innocent aspects. The first half is stunning: a beautifully shot homage to pastoral life and a sensitive depiction of a young alien's 'growing pains'. The second half is equally good. The seedy, frenetic pace of Metropolis life contrasts sharply with the rural idyll of Superman's upbringing, taking the film out of the 50s and into the cynical 70s. From here on Superman most resembles a hybrid of disaster movie and urban comedy, but it works. The cast is faultless. Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder share true chemistry (in the dvd screen tests you can see that they clicked from the start) and Gene Hackman, sometimes criticised for this performance, makes for a memorably smug yet comic Lex Luthor. Spider-man did very little for me. I liked the first Batman film to a degree, I liked Batman Returns a lot more, whereas Forever and Batman and Robin put me in the mind for jumping off a bridge. I thought X-Men was good and I hear decent things about X-Men 2. I don't think any of them come close to Superman however (or indeed Superman II), either as an adaptation of a treasured comic character or even as good, old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment. I think a lot of people who have not seen this film since they were children and who probably dismiss it now need to see it again.",Superman
380,Cryogenic,Rousing and wondrous,10,6 July 2003,"You had better believe this film is flawed and that, in the final analysis, not a lot happens (the entire picture feels like The Most Expensive Prelude Ever Made for Superman II) ... but I defy anyone not to be intensely moved during several key moments and awestruck during many others. Superman: The Movie is a lavish blockbuster on the surface and is filled with a warmth, love and respect that no other film before or since has yet replicated (or, dare I suggest, ever will). Forget the fact that the third and most extensive act degenerates into camp; the performances will carry you through. Forget the fact that what Superman does in the climax defies all sense of logic and reason; the performances will, once again, carry you through. Contrary to popular opinion, neither of the other mega hits of the same era -- Star Wars or E.T (good as they are) -- accomplish what this film sets out to do and achieves. Superman is a visually arresting experience that will make you feel young at heart and believe in magic again.",Superman
381,Ship_Captain_XplOrOrOr,"First ever ""modern F/X"" movie!",10,3 February 2004,"This was the first ever movie I saw at a movie theater in my entire life. I was sooo young back then, but I have a perfect memory of seeing it. I remember after it was over running up to the front and looking behind the curtains thinking there were hand puppets behind it LOLOL!This is an EXCELLENT F-A-M-I-L-Y movie! Perfect for kids as well as adults. It saddened me that the more recent Batman movies, as well as later Superman movies, felt a need to use formula story aka the main character beds the woman exactly after a certain time.The superhero in this movie was REAL - he cried, he got angry, acted selfish, and even hinted at how he could use his powers in michevious ways. It was things like these examples, and how the Hero deals with it, that made this movie sooo nice... standing the test of time, and a CLASSIC! Without mindless violence, cussing, sex, and more of the former and latter.
This movie did NOT rely on the F/X to carry it. Though the F/X were incredibly groundbreaking at the time, and still hold up today. I'm also amazed they were able to get soo many big name actors for it. I guess they were Superman fans when they were kids heheh.",Superman
382,Myrzan,Superman fails where Burtons Batman succeeds.,5,15 December 2005,"IMDb recommends to see Tim Burtons Batman if you liked Superman. I myself would recommend that you skip this and see Batman instead since in my opinion Batman is a good movie and, well, this is not.I read some of the other comments before writing mine and I got the impression that most of the people who like Superman had seen as a kid and it really impressed them. Well, maybe at the time it got released (in 1978) it was something really groundbreaking (I can't really tell since I wasn't born until two years later) but now it looks in my opinion pretty lame. The special effects (including techniques like fast forwarding and rewinding the tape) were often rather campy and, what's worse, the plot also wasn't generally that impressive and it had a few pretty annoying holes too.I'll list few of the things that (more or less) annoyed me in the film:Lex Luthor reads from a newspaper that Superman is from Krypton. From this he is able to deduct in about 5 minutes that some pieces of kryptonite must have wound up on earth and that they must be unhealthy to Superman because their special radioactive vibration level or something.Luthor and his henchmen generally suck. Someone compared them to the 3 stooges and I agree. The villains in Burtons Batman are loony in a quite charming way. The villains in Superman made me feel like twisting my arms.At one point Luthor and co. stop a military truck carrying a missile by staging a car accident. The whole convoy stops and everyone gathers on the accident site. No-one seems to pay attention to guarding the missile and Luthors assistant fiddles with it. Right after this they stop the convoy again because the assistant screwed up the first time. This second time they block a bridge with a truck of their own and again no-one properly guards the missile.Superman jumps out of a window of the Daily Planet building. We see him diving downwards and his costume magically changes in mid air. I mean his suit sort of morphs into the Superman costume. I did not know he could do that..San Andreas vault is moving and we see this big crack opening on earth. Superman fixes the vault and we are shown the crack-forming-clip backwards. Uhh.Superman reverses the time by flying really fast around the earth so that it starts to turn backwards.The jump back in time is also messed up, time goes backwards alright but when Superman changes the direction of time back to normal (by flying really fast around the earth in a opposite direction, naturally), (bad) things that should start happening again just don't.This movie might be passable if you want to take trip down the memory lane or you are 12 yrs old or you aren't very demanding with movies (meaning you like stuff like 'The Fast And The Furious' for example). Otherwise see Batman.",Superman
383,atlassub34,Suffers from a chronic superhero movie issue,5,12 April 2014,"While Christopher Reeves plays a fantastic Superman, the movie fell short where many movies do in that the super-villain isn't a challenge for the superhero. Lex Luthor is an evil genius, but he is not portrayed, in this movie anyway, as someone who could challenge and defeat Superman, even in a battle of wits.I'm a huge superhero movie fan and have been a comic book collector for 25 years. It is my opinion that any time you have a superhero movie where there is no physical compatibility between the superhero and the super-villain, the end result is a disappointment. For example, Superman 2 was a great success and received a solid rating from me, mostly due to the challenge of super-powered General Zod and his minions.This movie is worth a quick watch solely to help you enjoy Superman 2 more.",Superman
384,RobTheConqueror,Still full of charm after nearly 40 years,8,14 January 2016,"This is the movie that kickstarted the superhero movie genre. Without this, we would likely never have had undoubted masterpieces like The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 or The Avengers and for that this movie deserves a ton of credit alone. It took the questionable idea of adapting a comic aimed at children and made into a wonderful experience with powerful characters and emotions, as well as some genuinely great acting.While Hackman's Lex Luthor seems stupid and campy to today's audiences despite the great performance, as well as the rather stupid ending of Superman reversing time through....flying around the world fast enough? everything else holds up remarkably well. Reeve is utterly perfect in the role and absolutely embodies the character in everything from facial expressions to line delivery to drama, and really brings joy to the movie as a whole with his performance. The backstory (featuring Marlon Brandon as Jor-El) is well done and brings more depth to the character than ever before. Finally, I have to praise John Williams' iconic score, which still remains the definitive theme for Superman to this very day.The only really bad thing I can say apart from some of the sillier aspects is that it doesn't quite match up to its superior sequel.",Superman
385,Templar-5,"Forget it, Nic.",8,20 November 1998,"My third favourite film of all time behind 'Star Wars' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Christopher Reeve brings across an unforgettable portrayal of Superman, as well as Clark Kent. Donner had the vision and Williams the music, to put together the best comic book adaptation film of all time. Ignore the sideburns and the long winded opening scenes - this is an epic adventure that you will enjoy - along with its companion piece, 'Superman II'.",Superman
386,N.E,Film captures the spirit of Superman,10,14 October 1999,"Although the film may not be a direct adaption of any of the comics, it is still a great film.   It is impossible and hard to adapt a storyline from the comic books because there are so many characters and personal history involved.  Instead a good film maker will try to replicate the themes and characters of the comic book, and this will only produce a story that is faithful to the character which is what everyone wants.",Superman
387,mrslimm,"Superlative action adventure. Even 25 years on, this is the greatest superhero movie ever made and, yes, you will believe a man can fly.",10,21 November 2005,"This is a very fast moving film with an often amusing and witty script with still impressive special effects (especially a helicopter atop a skyscraper scene and a horribly claustrophobic earthquake / burying alive sequence) and flawless performances from all the lead actors.Gene Hackman is suitably assured and memorably hiss-able as the bad guy Lex Luthor while Marlon Brando provides a fittingly masterful and natural performance as Superman's biological father, Jor-El. Margot Kidder makes an unusual heroine who is a little more self-assured than the stereotypical female lead in adventure movies. She probably has the best scream of any damsel in distress but is not as physically beautiful as many other Hollywood actresses of the time. Christopher Reeve is, without doubt, the best Superman ever, blending his invulnerable macho charisma with the almost inept and wimpish Clark Kent to brilliant and humorous effect. He IS Superman. Christopher Reeve actually looks as well as acts different while playing his alter egos and makes the entire outlandish premise just that little bit more believable.The turmoil Superman feels within is expressed neatly during the film and we see that, even if it looks like we have everything (perfection in Superman's case but it could just as easily be money or anything) we will still want what is free to all of us, love and affection from someone dear to us.Special effects range from very good to brilliant and simply add to the film. Some clever moments include Superman rescuing Lois from a helicopter disaster atop a skyscraper, Superman dissuading a thief from making his escape, a scene where Superman flies off and, apparently without a cut, walks back in the door as Clark Kent and a frighteningly realistic and claustrophobic earthquake scene.The music score is another memorable and stirring piece of music from master movie composer John Williams. The music is also completely fitting and is the final piece in the jigsaw.Credit must also go to the director, Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon"" Series, ""Maverick (1994)"" who manages to maintain a relentless pace throughout, piling on the action and humour right through to the memorable climax. Astonishingly, when this movie became successful, he was fired from completing Superman II (partially filmed at the same time as this first movie until financial support dried up). Director Richard Lester (""The Three Musketeers (1973)"") was brought in to complete the filming of the second part of the Superman story. However, in Lester's hands the series went from perfect (this film) to acceptable (Superman II) to dreadful (Superman III).",Superman

389,TomCat502,The granddaddy of the superhero flicks,10,10 November 2004,"With the recent passing of both Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve, I thought I'd offer up my comments for one of my favorite movies.This movie brings back tons of memories for me. I remember waiting for it to open when I was a kid of 13. As a devoted comics fan, I really wanted to believe the hype (""This Friday, you will believe a man can fly""). My Dad took my brother and me on the opening weekend to see Superman, and we weren't disappointed.Yes, there are some outdated effects, over-the-top acting and plot holes in this film, but that's not the point. Just like the superhero movies that are being made today, this film was created with real affection for the title hero. Sure, everyone knew it would make a fortune, and the merchandising was there like it is now, but the characters were handled in a manner that didn't betray their comics heritage.Marlon Brando is fine for a role that he clearly took for the money. He is Brando, and just his presence and reading give a certain nobility to his character of Jor-El. Although not the first woman you'd consider as Lois Lane, Margot Kidder makes the role her own with her combination of 70s break out feminism and damsel in distress reactions. Gene Hackman, fresh from some of the best work in American cinema (The French Connection films and The Conversation, and even the Poseidon Adventure) is a hammy but sociopathic Lex Luther.But mostly, there is Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman. An unknown who physically matches the comic appearance, he brings a nice everyman bumble to Clark and a hero in training to Superman. Nice performance that he will always be remembered for.This movie is long but well-paced, and chronologically follows little Kal-El/Superman from Krypton's destruction through his maturation into the Man of Steel. The scene showing young Clark preparing to leave his adoptive mother in America's heartland is breathtaking.John Williams' score merely set the bar for music in movies. It's exhilarating.Whether you see Superman as an immigrant in the new country, as so many were when he was first spawned, or in a religious light, sent from the stars by his father to help humanity, you have to admit, they don't make many like Superman.",Superman
390,richardzmoore,One of the All-Time Greats!,10,9 June 2014,"This movie rules! I first saw ""Superman: The Movie"" in a packed theater in San Antonio, Texas in December of 1978. I was 13 and a self-proclaimed science fiction nerd (and proud of it!). My life revolved around science fiction books and movies, as well as comic books. I had read about the upcoming ""Superman"" movie for over a year and I was worried that the film makers would either make a mockery of the source material or just mess it up in some way. My fears were quickly put to rest on that December evening in '78. I was so hoping that it would be a quality film and not some Hanna-Barbera styled cheese-fest. I sat through the brilliant opening on Krypton and was immediately impressed. Clark's back-story more than held my interest. His first day at the Daily Planet introduced some terrific characters, and then it happened... Lois' helicopter accident and Clark's first transformation into Superman. The tagline was ""You'll believe a man can fly"", and I did. I was captivated.From that point on, ""Superman"" was an action-filled good time. I left the theater that night with a huge smile on my face. I could not believe what a wonderful job Donner had done on the movie and what a PERFECT Superman that Christopher Reeve was. He was the total embodiment of the character. He played Clark Kent perfectly as well. All of the actors were perfect for their roles. Margot Kidder played Lois Lane so perfectly and so believably. Gene Hackman, as always, was amazing as Lex Luthor. There have been many superhero films since, but this remains my second favorite (right behind its sequel, ""Superman II""). This remains one of the special movies of my life. A huge thank you to everyone involved in its creation!",Superman
391,dcmarkham,The greatest superhero movie of all time.,10,3 November 2000,"The first half-hour of this movie is some of the most magical, noble and moving storytelling ever put onto film.  It's almost a shame that once the story hits the Metropolis part things get corny -- but it's almost a commentary in itself -- a noble, powerful alien must wear a mask of naivete and goofiness to fit into today's world, but let his actions as his true self inspire this world.Still the best superhero movie, and probably can't be beat in the years to come.",Superman
392,tercelt,A classic movie.,10,3 January 2001,"I consider this film to be an all time classic. Richard Donner made an absolutely fantastic film, he was making this and Superman II at the same time, but for reasons that are too long to go into here his vision of the second film never came too light, which is a travesty. Anyway back to Superman: The Movie, first of all the story is wonderfully told, the destruction of Krpton, the baby Superman being sent to Earth, his upbringing in Smallville, and him finding out his true self, and going to work in Metropolis as Clark Kent and falling in love with Louis Lane. Every actor in this film give superb performances, but special mention to Reeves as Superman/Clark Kent, Hackman as Luthor and Kidder as Lane, those three are fantastic in this. I just wish Superman II ended up the film it was meant to be and not changed by the powers that be, don't get me wrong it is still a good film but it could have been even better. Forget about III and IV of the Series though, they are pale shadows of this film. I would love to see a Special Edition of this film, like Lucas did with the Star Wars series, but I believe a DVD is on the way, I can't wait.",Superman
393,nathan_franklin2006,Christopher Reeve's first appearance as the caped wonder,9,26 May 2008,"You'd probably be considered an alien from Krypton yourself if you didn't know about Christopher Reeve's Superman films. For many, he truly WAS Superman and Superman fans are currently having a hard time accepting newcomer Brandon Routh into the tights. I must admit I thought Routh was alright, but I digress.Superman: The Movie begins with Jor-El (Marlon Brando) putting his infant son Kal-El into a spaceship and sending him off to Earth as, seeing as he's a cunning scientist, he has estimated that his home planet Krypton is going to blow up pretty soon. Sadly, the Kryptonian Council disagree with Jor-El's theory and refuse to evacuate everyone off the planet, therefore Jor-El sees sending off his son to another planet as the only way to preserve the Kryptonian race. Kal-El eventually reaches Earth after three years and is found by a kind farmer and his wife who adopt him and name him 'Clark Kent'. From then on, the infant will grow up to become the unstoppable superhero Superman (Christopher Reeve) after he eventually learns of his Kryptonian heritage.Good points? Firstly, Christopher Reeve manages to take on the role of both mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent and his heroic persona Superman extremely well. Reeve deliberately made Kent goofier and made him lose the S curl in his hair in order to stop anyone sussing out he and Superman are one and the same. On the other hand, Reeve made Clark's alter-ego Superman have that great S-Curl and of course, he loses the large glasses, displaying his handsome features more clearly. The differences between Clark and Superman are brilliant - its almost convincing. If I didn't know that Superman was actually Clark Kent, I reckon I'd be fooled.Secondly, the visual effects are great and are quite advanced for a film which was created in the seventies. It's hard to shake off the thrills as Superman flies about and the tension as the natural disasters occur late in the film (which is no spoiler I can tell you; trust me, there are more exciting things I could spoil you on in this movie, but I won't :)).Thirdly, Marlon Brando's scenes are brilliant and you get a real sense of a God-Jesus relationship between Kal-El and Jor-El (which is what the Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewicz wanted). Whilst most of the credit should be directed towards the script, some should be given to Brando who says his lines in such a wise, posh manner as he declares to his son that ""you will never be alone, even in the face of our death"" and other great lines.One thing that bugs me with this film is the fact that it contains no real 'action' as such. During the film, a few robbers try to hit Superman with a crowbar which, of course, results in ""bad vibrations"" and Superman races through the earth's core effortlessly but there isn't much action. Don't get me wrong, I love character relationships as much as the next guy, but the Superman moments were dreadfully wasted. I'm not saying that there should've been a large kickass villain - Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) was great; instead of just chucking Supes into a swimming pool, perhaps he should've kicked the crap out of him a la Superman Returns? It would've provided much more action at least! In conclusion, Superman: The Movie satisfies as a great superhero flick that taught many the lesson of how a superhero movie should be made. The love relationship between Superman and Lois is gripping as is Superman's rivalry with criminal mastermind Lex Luthor. One of my favourite parts of the movie is Clark Kent's relationship with Lois; he never fails to make me laugh! So should you watch this film or shouldn't you? If you're someone who appreciates a good film no matter what era it was made then go ahead. If you're someone who has been brainwashed already with mind-blowing CGI, then steer clear - want some modern day Superman action? Try Superman Returns featuring the talented Brandon Routh instead!",Superman
394,a_forbes,The greatest superhero film of all time,10,5 August 2004,"With this brilliant film, Richard Donner proves that he is a director of tremendous skill and imagination. The entire production is handled with such care, and it is obvious in every frame. Every element of this film comes together to create a genuine classic. Superhero films are generally considered to be lesser products, aimed at a mass audience and devoid of much creativity. This is, of course, a terribly misguided generalization and if any film proves it, Superman does. The film takes its source material seriously, treating it (very rightly) as a grand modern myth. It is one of those rare ""B-films"" (like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Star Wars) that dares to aim for A-film status, and it succeeds marvelously. John Williams' music is timeless. The groundbreaking special effects may be dated, but they impress to this day. The cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth is stunning. Superman is so richly infused with movie magic (an elusive, subjective term if ever there was one) that willing viewers cannot help but be swept up in its spell.

I think that he is even more of a Superman than ever before.  To go through such a tragidy and come out smiling.  He did a superb job portraying two totally different personalities he is Clark Kent and Superman. Now to talk of the other characters, Margot Kidder did a great job as Lois Lane.

399,Dohsoda,The Superhero film that changed Everything,9,12 March 2016,"1978's Superman is a wonderful film in every aspect. It is funny, romantic and dramatic. It's a combination of 1970's Disaster films like The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1974) and the Towering Inferno (1974). It has elements of science-fiction films of that decade such as Logan's Run (1976) and Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). I would also make the connection it is similar to the Sean Connery and Roger Moore James Bond films of that era as well. Much like those adventure films, there is a undercurrent amount of humor that goes along with the straightforward take on the character. The humor and heart of the film tonally give the audience a variety of emotions to feel as they embark on watching this huge production. Much like with Batman (1989), this film proved comic book films can be taken seriously and given the block-buster treatment. Also, like Batman (1989), this film remains a modern classic. In someways the film moves along like a check list of epic objectives for Superman to perform in a film. For example, Krypton, Smallville, Daily Planet characters,falling in love with Lois Lane and meeting Lex Luther.I won't go into acting and directing as everyone who worked on this film did a top notch job. Richard Donner, Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder etc. do a wonders for this film. My final thoughts on this film are that it is an experience film. I have many memories of renting this from the video store in the early 2000's and remember having excitement when I finally got the DVD for Christmas in 2006, 10 years ago. While the special effects may look dated and the characterizations are no longer considered modern, this film was a game changer for Warner Bros. and on the whole world. This film is definitively one of the greatest films to come out of the 1970's and a classic film essential for anyone who loves superhero's or Superman.",Superman
400,markbishop-38294,In My Top Five Movies of Any Kind,10,15 May 2021,I can go to this well over and over and always feel like they nailed the spirit of Superman. Hollywood (and pop culture in general) is too jaded to ever make this movie again. It's a good thing we got it when we did. The closest might be Marvel's first Captain America movie.Fantastic John Williams score... Chris Reeves and Margot Kidder performances are spot on. It's easy to make a cynical superhero movie nowadays. This ain't that.Big budget blockbuster that treated the source material with utmost respect. We all left the theatre believing a man could fly. Promise delivered!,Superman
401,KalEl-5,"""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!""",9,15 July 1999,"The Ultimate comic book character in the ultimate comic book film.  This is the classic story of the lone survivor of the planet Krypton.  Orphaned at an early age, young Kal-EL comes to Earth and realizes that he is different.All of the acting in this film is wonderful.  I especially liked Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Christopher Reeve was also a perfect choice for Superman.This movie perfectly tells all of the story of the Superman from start to finish.  The Krypton scenes are terrific.  Marlon Brando plays Jor-El, the respected scientist and father of Superman, very well.  When Superman arrives on Earth we see a very lonely teenager, who feels (for good reason) that he does not fit.  Superman (or Clark Kent, his alias) journeys to the North Pole and creates the ""Fortress of Solitude.""  There he talks to the image of his father, and emerges twelve years later as the ""Man of Steel.""Unfortunately many Superman fans have never seen the unedited version of this film, which runs about 3 hours, and five minutes.  This version with 40 minutes of extra footage was shown on TV in the early 80's.  It shows more of the scenes from Krypton, along with several others.  Many of the cuts that were made to this film, I agree with, although there are a few that I believe should have been left in.  At the begining, there are several cut scenes from Krypton with Jor-El.  At one point the council sends a guard to stop Jor-El from sending his son off Krypton.  This is very interesting, and should have been left in, but when Krypton explodes there are several shots that I agree with being cut.  The extended version shows many of the Kryptonians dying in the explosions, which becomes a little long and drawn out.Also two scenes that are a little too long and drawn out in the extended version are when the Smallville kids are driving, and when the cops are following Otis.  A scene that I really believe should have been left in, is when Lex Luthor tests Superman.  He shots, burns, and freezes him, unsuccessfully.  My favorite scene from the extended version comes at the very end.  Luthor, while playing the piano, tries to kill Ms. Teschmacher. He tries to feed her to the babies, who are introduced earlier in the extended version.  Although this is a very good scene, it contradicts Superman II, when Ms. Teschmacher saves Lex from prison.  Although I agree with most of the cuts, the extended version is a very entertaining film. We see the movie as director Richard Donner saw it.  Superman the Movie is a great film, whether you are watching the original or the extended version.",Superman
402,Gambit8234,A Truly Wonderful Film,9,26 May 2001,"I thought this film would be a little too campy for me before watching the special edition DVD. To my surprise this film completely blew me away. IT has such wonderful cinematography, and really great acting. As a fan of comics I can say this, along with Batman, is the best adaption to film of any character. If you doubt this movie, give it a try, chances are you will love it. The DVD is highly recommended!!",Superman

404,Optimus_Prime_is_OP,The birth of something Wonderful,10,13 February 2014,"I just watched Superman: The movie for the first time ever. And let me get this out the way first: This is not just a movie. This is an experience. Let me explain.The first shot in this movie is a kid reading a comic book explaining about the daily planet. From there, the camera zooms out into space, where the opening credits begin. We see Marlon Brando's name, then Gene Hackman's, and then the Superman logo appears. This is accompanied by John William's epic Superman theme that has become such an iconic theme for the character. From here, the movie only gets better.The story begins on the planet of Krypton, where Jor-El (played by the late Marlon Brando) is sentencing General Zod and his comrades to the Phantom Zone, where they will spend their remaining days in prison. Jor-El believes that the planet will be destroyed in only a matter of days, only the Krypton elders don't believe him. Afraid that they will be destroyed, Jor-El sends his son, Kal-El to the Planet Earth, where he will grow up and show the people of earth the way to the light.On earth, Kal-El (now called Clark Kent) spends his time being a normal person and attending college. He comes home one day and decides to race his Dad (played by Glenn Ford) to their home, who then collapses and dies due to a weak heart. Clark then decides there must be a reason that he is here for, so he searches for it, which leads him to the fortress of solitude in the arctic. There, a hologram of his dead space father tells him about him and his amazing powers that he will soon get and master. Returning after 12 years, Clark then decides to become Earth's first and most powerful Superhero.First off, Christopher Reeve is flawless as Superman. He is flawless as Clark Kent as well. He plays Clark as a bumbling reporter, and Superman as a heroic boyscout. EXACTLY how Superman should be. He also looks the part, and is the only actor in the entire world who suits the Superman costume in spandex. Lois Lane is played by Margot Kidder, and she is really good as Lois Lane. Can't really pick a fault with her. Gene Hackman plays Lex Luthor, who is different from the comic book Luthor, but still puts on a great performance. Everyone else also performs their parts exceptionally well.The script is also very fresh and has some really good lines as well. Lines such as ""Easy miss, I've got you"" ""You've got me, who's got you?"", which is also the line that the comics have adopted as the first things that Superman and Lois say to each other.As far as i am aware, this movie does follow the comics extremely closely. Things like how kryptonite affects Superman, Lois interviewing Superman, Superman's personality, they are all taken directly from the comics as far as i am aware. Krypton's fate is also from the comics, but the look of Krypton is entirely new and original, but i like it, as it is an original way to show Superman's home world.As with every movie, though, it does have some bad points. For example, the pacing is a bit wired, and makes the film feel a bit too long, and as a result, some scenes feel like they could be better being shorter.Overall, Superman: The movie is something special. It was the first time that comics were taken seriously, and is an awesome movie by itself as well. It's just a shame that Christopher Reeve is no longer alive today. He will be missed.9.5/10",Superman
405,malcomforbes,"Neat Effects, Good movie too",8,29 December 2005,"I'm John Butler, special effects technician. I watched Superman for the effects, thinking about it's creation in 1978. I was impressed. The models near the end of the Hoover Dam as it breaks were good, some of the model houses lacked good visual agreement with the mandatorily full scale water. The flying was alright considering the new for the movie techniques used. The running was really neat, despite being so simple. The helicopter scene was incredible. Aside from it looking amazing on the fantasy side, there were real things you never would have guessed were fake in that scene. Ah, but the opening credits. What a breakthrough. Their amazing dynamics were achieved with CGI. The Krypton models were okay, composite shots with Krypton was good, glowing suits and rings were neat, F.O.S. was good,Spaceship was alright, G.G. Bridge was good, explosions great, teleportation neat, Phantom Zone Amazing, and the list goes on. The movie was good too.",Superman
406,SecularTheocrat,A great take on Superman,8,26 August 2018,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?This movie is great, and while Superman isn't my favourite comic book character, this is one of my favourite comic book movies.In my opinion it has the right tone for the character of Superman, lighthearted and a little goofy while still being able to have serious moments that don't feel out of place. The casting in this movie is good, to this day I still associate Superman with Christoper Reeve (No disrespect to Henry Cavil), I extend this praise to Margot Kidder, Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman. I personally liked this movies portrayal of Lex Luthor despite the fact that it deviates from the Industrial Magnate super-genius that i am more familiar with I felt that this direction worked more with the tone of this movie. Lex Luthor is still the classic evil genius but it is done in a comedic way and at times it can be hard to take him seriously despite the fact that he is literally planning on destroying the American west coast. While this movie is 3 hours long I never felt board or got the impression that it was bloated, it had a lot of s**t to cover.",Superman
407,Max_VI,"A Human movie, totally perfect.",10,26 May 2001,"Childhood is when I first saw this film. And from that time on I have really loved this film. John Williams uplifting and beautiful music score truly inspires and makes this film more than anything. It is so unbelieveably beautiful, but that is what John Williams is famous for. Sometimes, through hard work, a movie can come together absolutely perfectly, this is one of those times. The depth in the movie is wonderful, we get to see what Kal-el is taught by his real father about human beings and the earth, to me a very beautiful and poignant couple of minutes on the movie screen. Superman is who Kal-el becomes. It's also got many exciting moments, the kind you'll possibly never see in movies ever again. Superman decides to use his powers to save the lives of people, and some tasks that are not so necessary. Superman, although having such wonderful powers, discovers he is powerless in many sad and unhappy situations. These are beautiful, human moments. Superman may be from the planet krypton, but he is the most human character. He is almost an ideal person, almost because he is not immune to emotions, he falls victim to his weaknesses. Despite this, Chris Reeve IS Superman. He truly is in many, many ways. After this movie ends, I guarantee you will feel warmed, happy and leave the TV set with a smile on your face and possibly some tears in your eyes if you love the magic of this movie as much as I.",Superman
408,EarlFlynn,I Still Believe A Man Can Fly,10,1 April 2000,"An absolutely magical film, from beginning to end. Christopher Reeve is perfect as Clark Kent and Superman; he has just the right mixture of nobility and vulnerability. Hackman's Luthor is an acerbic delight - the perfect foil for the Man of Steel.John Williams' heart-pounding score is one of my favourites - and hooray, at last a definitive edition is now available!The special effects still hold up today, but more imporantly, the essential decency of Superman - both the character and the film - serves as a beacon of truth, justice, and hope in an increasingly cynical age. Whenever I'm feeling down, I can sit down and lose myself in this film...reminding myself that somewhere, a man can fly, and he uses his incredible abilities not for personal gain, but to work for the betterment of humanity.
Thanks to everyone involved in this movie for creating a such an uplifting film. I'm sure I'm not the only person whose soul has been enriched for your efforts.",Superman
409,xxdisintegrationxx,Unbelievable...,8,1 July 2006,"Having recently seen the huge disappointment: Superman Returns, I felt an obligation to watch this version to see how it measured up. I couldn't believe my eyes, and ears! 'My God!' I thought, 'Characters that actually interact with one another!'. That is one of the key elements Superman Returns was missing: dialogue. This movie had so much fun with the story, and the characters, that despite its lack of modern effects, it was still immensely enjoyable to watch. There was real character development, real humor (particularly the scenes between Lex and Otis, which I found hysterical) and a palpable chemistry between Lois and Clark/Superman. From the very beginning, this movie grabs you tightly and keeps you interested. It has an enlivening effect on you, where you feel genuinely happy after watching it, which, to my understanding, is what the movies are all about. Gene Hackman had great one-liners, for instance,""Otis, do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and I? Because it's your weight, and my IQ"", and the entire cast sat right. The roles fit, the effects (for their time) were great, and the script was wonderful. It's amazing to me, that movies like this can still hold up against movies that are made with the gross national product of a small country. If you want Superman in all his glory, ignore 'Returns', and pick up this one; you won't be disappointed. ""Otis, do you want to see a very, very long arm?"" ""Oh no, Mr. Luthor!""",Superman
410,paolosany,everything is flying,10,30 June 2006,"Following the Omen Richard Donner was inexplicably offered a very different film. In recent interviews he has revealed how badly strained the relations were with the production company which result din him being fired from Superman 2. Even more strain than the stuntman who was injured from falling off the glass plate used to simulate Superman's flying. In age when Hollywood was being swallowed up by witless poor scripts and bad plotting to produce undemanding fair that would receive large audiences, they produced this masterpiece which recalls plotting and script heralding back to an earlier age. The script proceeds at a steady pace to tell an involving story instead of rushing through it to the next fight scene as do modern Hollywood films. The psychological analysis is convincing and sensitive whereas later Hollywood blockbusters bolt on a histrionic piece of self awareness in an attempt to give there characters more than one dimension. The acting is superb. Reeves is a mixture of Gary Cooper and Cary Grant in his portrayal of Kent and Gene Hackman has been described as the greatest American actor it will be interesting to see how Kevin Spacey holds that character in the new Superman",Superman
411,selimkuris,The movie that made me feel like I could really fly...,9,6 September 2005,"I remember it was a Sunday morning and they told me that Superman will be on TV a week ago so I planned my escape from the math test of high school with a funny excuse (I can't remember now). Everything was prepared; toasts, lots of milk, a ready to be recorded Beta tape etc. And then the movie started... So was my interest to the movie themes and Hollywood entertainment. I was 8 at that time and I can still remember how I watched the 2 hour movie without a blink of an eye. That whole week I don't know how many times I used that tape rewinder to watch the movie over and over again. I'm still amazed by the storytelling, the visual effects and of course the tremendous score from the ""master"" John Williams. After seeing this one (which is his best work for me) I became a Williams fan and watched all of his movies and he truly is the best music guy in Hollywood history. Richard Donner really made a great job after his masterpiece ""The Omen"". Also the story by Mario Puzo is impressive. But most of all the acting by Christopher Reeve (may he rest in peace) made us all remember Superman with his face. In the movie, Reeves' character is an outcast and a shy guy like Peter Parker, but as a hero he is the one everybody admired (like happens in all heroic movies). The villains are quite good specially Gene Hackman (as Lex Luthor) and Ned Beatty (as Otis). Marlon Brando has showed us another talent of his as playing Superman's father and even he plays for 10 minutes of the movie, he's impressive. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and absolutely the best in comic based movies. 10/10",Superman
412,superman_l79,You'll believe...,10,22 July 2008,"This is my favorite movie of all time...I had to start by saying that. I am a huge Superman fan and to have a movie like this representing my favorite superhero is astounding.This is a great movie because of the great mix of fantasy, drama, action and the care taken in presenting this classic story with what Richard Donner called Verisimilitude--the appearance of being true or real; likeness or resemblance of the truth. Even though this is a fictional story they treat it with a sense of reality and truth. They respect this American Icon that has been a part of our culture for many years and will continue to endure.As a kid I was astounded at seeing my hero flying freely through the air--catching Lois Lane as she falls from the helicopter, watching him rescue Air Force One from crashing, chasing rockets, saving California from falling into the ocean and even taking the time to do the little things like rescuing a cat from a tree. I remember the excitement as Clark Kent first appeared as Superman, running across the street and ripping open his shirt to reveal that famous ""S"". It was my comic book fantasy brought to life.When I got older, I still feel those things but I noticed so much more. Chris Reeve totally embodies this character with such grace and charisma that I don't see an actor in a blue suit and red cape, I see Superman and Clark Kent. The way he portrays both characters is totally distinct. Watch the scene after Superman drops Lois Lane off at her balcony and then Clark Kent arrives to take her out. When he takes off his glasses and almost reveals himself to her as the dashing superhero you can see the change take place and believe why no one can penetrate his disguise. Look at the reactions of people as they see Superman in action, the awe he inspires. Chris made that believable--he is Superman.The movie itself is a masterpiece; the script is well written and conceived. Richard Donner brings us movie that sparks the imagination and makes you enjoy the ride from start to finish. Mario Puzo gave him a great script to work with and Tom Mankiewicz added the final touches to make it the best it could be. All the actors brought their characters to life in a way that makes you care and believe. Great care was taken in each of the 3 acts of this movie from Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis. Each world has a unique look and feel of their own and help to bring the story to life and build Kal-El into Clark Kent and finally to Superman. The world of Krypton is beautiful and majestic, we get a great yet brief look into the home world of the Man of Steel and learn of the destruction that brought him to Earth. In Smallville we see where Clark's humanity and compassion come from in the form of Jonathan and Martha Kent, his adoptive parents and where Clark learns that his destiny begins to call him to something greater. After his journey to the frozen north and his tutelage in the Fortress of Solitude from Jor-El he learns to embrace his destiny and become the greatest hero the world has ever known. Then we hit Metropolis, BAM, comic book come to life. From there we follow the adventures of Clark and his new found alter ego as he brings his amazing powers to the aid of the people of Earth.Marlon Brando was a perfect choice for Jor-El. He fit the role like a glove and had a very commanding presence without being overpowering. He was a great father figure and role model for Kal-El. He instilled the qualities that would allow Kal-El to embrace his heritage and become the symbol of hope for Earth, the ""light to show the way."" Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford were terrific as Clark's adoptive parents. They gave him humanity and always made him feel loved and accepted no matter how different their son felt. They didn't care where he came from they loved him and knew that he would be a great influence on his adopted home world.Margot Kidder was brilliant as Lois. She captured the tenacity and toughness of the character as well as the googly-eyed, love struck girl she becomes around Superman so well. She was tough and smart and took charge. Around Clark she is very confident and a bit constructively critical. Around Superman she loses all of that and becomes a lovesick little kid who dreams of the shining knight in a red cape. Plus, she has the absolutely brilliant knack of getting into situations that only Superman can pull her out of.Lex Luthor, brought to life in the most astounding way by Gene Hackman. Brilliant, menacing, criminal genius bent on committing the biggest real estate scam on Earth and not caring who he hurts along the way. He is menacing without being scary, he's confidant yet bored with the ease he can outwit and outdo anyone he comes across. Then comes Superman, the adversary he's been waiting for. It's not an obstacle for him, it's a challenge.As far as musical scores go, you can't get any better than John Williams. His theme for Superman still gives me chills as I hear it during the main titles or while Superman is in action. It fits the character perfectly and gives the greatest hero his greatest theme that is exciting and inspiring.Visually, emotionally, and fantasy fulfilling this movie has it all. It's a magical, cinematic journey for young and old alike and will endure the test of time. It's inspirational, it helps us to believe that Superman is out there in some fashion to help us. As the tagline says...You Will Believe a Man Can Fly. Superman the Movie will always fly high.",Superman
413,miunkown,Superfilm,10,23 March 2009,"I think this is brilliant, the only thing lacking in this movie was the era in which it was made, unfortunately back in the 70's they didn't have the masterful movie techniques and great technology existent these days, apart from that sad fact the story was excellent, it leads viewers deeper into the film with it's fascinating story which unravels from beginning to end, Marlon Brando shines in what i believe to be one of his most brilliant roles even if his screen time doesn't exceed 15 minutes. Christopher Reeves also delivers an excellent performance, he's portrayal of the caped crusader almost makes you believe Clark Kent and superman are two different people, Gene Hackman and Margot kidder also deliver great performances, great film i truly hope they remake this masterpiece one day with the consideration of this first true installment of Superman.",Superman
414,westerlund-147-949472,Entertaining about a superhero icon.,7,25 July 2012,"Nowadays, superhero movies are everywhere. You can barely turn your head without having a new Marvel or DC Comics-production slapping your face. Back in 1978 however, a full-length, big budget production with one of the most iconic superheroes of all time was a really big deal. It does feels nice to take a break from the CGI-laden world of modern movies and watch some good old physical props and light-shows, as well as some good acting and likable characters.This movie tells the origin of Superman. We begin on the planet Krypton where the scientist Jor-el, Supermans father played by Marlon Brando, is trying to convince the planets council that Krypton is doomed and that the planet should be evacuated. They do not listen however, and the planets inevitable destruction brings an end to the Kryptonians. At least almost, because Jor-el and his wife (whose name escapes me) manages to send their son, Kal-el, away in an escape pod headed to earth. When he arrives he is being taken care of by foster parents and we get to follow him trough his younger years, his self-discovery, and his employment with Daily Planet as well as how he first establishes his superhero fame.This movie takes its time to tell the story, and it comes off very well. You really get attached to the main character and receives a full understanding of what Superman is about. The movie balances action and comedy, never taking itself too seriously, which is a nice break from modern cinema were everything have to be dark and serious. The movie can be corny sometimes, but in a likable way, a way that makes you smile rather than roll your eyes. That doesn't mean that it's all silly, there is some genuine emotion in it as well. Christopher Reeves is great in the leading role, pulling off both the awkwardness of Clark Kent and the heroic posture of Superman perfectly. His act as Clark Kent is so quirky and clumsy that you actually believe that no one suspects him for being Superman, despite that his only disguise is a pair of glasses! Another great performance is Margot Kidder as Louis Lane. She could easily have been turned into another damsel in distress, but they took the time to actually make her a character. She's witty, quick and in her own way a bit awkward. She is very charismatic and easy too like. Her relationship with Superman feels natural and have real chemistry.One thing that I feel missing though is some real challenge for Superman. Lex Luthor, the villain in the movie, feels a bit to goofy for me. I know that many like Gene Hackman in this movie, but I never saw a genuine, dangerous threat to the protagonist from Lex. He's just goofy, and feels like he belongs in the 1960:s Batman series. Overall the movie could need a bit more serious action to bring more excitement to it, and that is exactly what they would bring to the next movie.Overall, if you're into superheroes, this movie is a classic that I highly recommend. It's a great example of an early superhero movie and simply a very enjoyable piece of film.",Superman
415,noijiruga,Representative of a classic super hero movie that is Superman...,8,11 July 2018,"It was technically sound for its time and credible story-telling for its day i believe. Not sure whether the crew got any assistance from the guys at ILM back then but the effects were passable. Of course, not up to today's standards but okay-ish nonetheless. I really liked how the actors act naturally and did not look forced as if no cameras around or conscious of it. I guess the ratings gap seen in the reviews for this movie can be seen as a generation gap as well. I would guess that the ones that gave high ratings were born before 1985 and low ratings were born after. Well, it is understandable. Anyway, it is still an enjoyable movie, nice pacing with drama and action mixed well. Not perfect but still a good one, 8 out of 10 for me.",Superman

It also serves as origin story for superman,10,3 April 2016,For all involved this a great movie across the board and sets the standard for all superhero movies we see today. The movie has spectacular special effects that for the most part still hold up even today. Gene Hackmen is funny yet threatening as the best Lex Luthor to date. Christopher Reeve is heroic as superman and funny as Clark Kent. Marlon Brando does good with his part and gives the movie a real depth with his award winning presence. The rest also do very well in their parts Richard Donner direction is very good and the writing is clever and Epic.

Of an alien that looks just like any regular human being except for his incredible powers to saves the world. A perfect plot line, and a perfect movie. Christopher Reeves did a job well done playing clark kent, superman, Kal-El. In this story it was a remarkable movie that a farm boy can save the world and still be home by dinner. This movie was one of those ""Superhero"" movies, great for a kid and for an adult. For anyone person that enjoys watching movies.

418,Darren-Hutton,gone but not forgotten,9,21 March 2006,"This film is without a doubt one of the most magical films ever made period.When you think this was released in 1978 before we had technology as we know it,the tag line says it all ""you'll believe a man can fly"" Their are so many points of brilliance in this film from the opening score that is synonymous with a legend, the special effects, the direction of the film, the cast that make this film with one particular shining light in this movie Christopher Reeve.Regardless of his third billing which whilst i understand i have never agreed with,this movie is all about Christopher Reeve's portrayal of an institution that will never die,a man who fought for truth and justice yet at the same time had to keep his identity secret from all including the woman he loves Lois Lane played to perfection in this movie by Margot Kidder.This film i truly believe brings out the inner child in all of us and for me this film has a place in my heart because to me Reeve is and always will be SUPERMAN something that no actor,no disrespect to Brandon Routh or any actor before or after him that will play this character Christopher Reeve once said to Sean Connery that he was worried about being typecast to which Sean Connery replied you have to be that good to be remembered to be typecast to which he may of have a point, but he has cemented his place in film history as an icon, for the legend that he portrayed.In closing to prove my point, shut your eyes hum or listen to the superman theme and then tell me who do you see? 9 out of 10 Christopher Reeve R.I.P",Superman
419,ralemeh,Awesome!!!!,10,30 July 2006,"I rented it on DVD and was blown away!!! Christopher Reeve did such a great job as Clark Kent and Superman. His Clark Kent is hilarious, clumsy and geeky. His Superman is handsome, vulnerable by fillings like human and show off. I love the parts of movie where Superman is smiling and at the same time showing off. I must compare it to Superman Returns. When I saw Superman Returns I didn't know how to feel. I didn't feel anything, like it was lifeless. No humor at all, Brandon Routh looks like a kid and computer animation was so obvious that I thought I was watching video game. Superman The Movie looks much more realistic without gloomy effects.

On the contrary, it is movie magic. Despite the plot holes, the romantic element of the film draws the audience in for an exciting ride. It is the sheer fact that the film is bold enough to rely on Superman/Clark Kent's humanity, that makes this movie a wonder to watch. It ranks with ET as the kind of movie that makes you feel like a kid again.",Superman
421,Chris W.,25 Years Later and I still believe a man can fly,10,29 October 2003,"I first saw Superman when I was about 3 or 4 years old on video. I was in love with this incredible movie back then and watched the tape so much it was worn out after about a year. I made sure I watched it whenever it was on TV and always watched the sequels due to my love of the original.
For a while, I hadn't sat and watched it. I caught a couple of clips on TV every now and then, but didn't sit and be mesmerized like I was years ago. Finally, I got a DVD player and was looking for some movies to rent. And I suddenly got the urge to rent Superman. It's amazing how much I remembered, and how much I picked up on things I didn't get back when I was young. Sometimes I'd get bored with the slower moving parts, but found them to be wonderfully filmed. The movie was once again my favorite without any question.Christopher Reeve IS Superman. He's so intimidating and so genuinely sincere as the Man of Steel, as he does what he's here to do, fight for truth, justice and the American way. Margot Kidder was also very good as Lois Lane, a very hungry and determined ace reporter. Hackman, while a bit campy, was excellent as Lex Luthor, and the way he delivered the line ""No, by CAUSING the deaths of innocent people"" brings great menace to Superman's greatest enemy. The rest of the supporting actors are great, and Brando's small role was well done as Jor-El.There will be better movies that come out, bigger movies, but Superman will always be my favorite movie. A classic movie, and still the greatest comic book movie of all time.",Superman
422,blairb15,Great Movie,8,4 November 2000,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 1970s. The acting is marvelous, the special effects are very good for this time period, and the story is well-crafted. This is easily the best superhero movie EVER! Most superhero movies just contain pointless action sequence after pointless action sequence after pointless action sequence. This movie is built around characters so we care what happens to them when it happens. Christopher Reeve is great as the Man of Steel. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Ned Beatty as Otis, and Valerie Perrine as Miss Tessmacher make one of the best villain teams you could ask for. Margot Kidder is terrific as Lois Lane. Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford are almost magic in their great but brief roles as both of Superman's fathers. As good as this movie is, what makes it so memorable is the very beautiful opening credit sequence and John William's brilliant musical score. Great Movie.***1/2 out of ****",Superman
423,jerryzegier,The Godfather of Superhero Movies,10,22 June 2006,"This movie is by far the most legendary and superior of superhero films. Not just because of the scope of the production and the groundbreaking film-making techniques of its time but because of the absolutely incredible recreation of the Superman character and bringing a comic book to life in the form of a motion picture like it had never been done before. Its success paved the way for those comic book superhero films to follow but none of them had simultaneously accomplished capturing so many elements to make such a believable movie experience. So many kids today are unfortunately unaware of how this movie is the first and the best of its kind. Despite some of the dated optical effects, its magic and brilliance and timelessness cannot be duplicated. The two most notable keys to this film's amazing success was Richard Donner and the late great Christopher Reeve. Hands down there may never be another perfect actor to bring Superman to life so beautifully the way he did. As for Richard Donner, as the director he made the magic seem so real that it sent chills through you! You saw a man flying though the air like you were really seeing it for the first time. That is something that had never been seen before and was literally historic. That's one of the million reasons this movie will remain so beloved and unsurpassable.",Superman
424,jfinch-91383,Superman review,6,3 December 2020,I understand that this is a classic movie. I do like it. I don't think it's the most amazing thing out there. First of all there are no fight scenes in this whole two hour movie. Now in any other movie I'll be fine with that but in a superhero movie I expect action. I never even read a Superman comic that didn't have a fight scene in it somewhere. Also the run time is way too long. They could've trimmed a half hour off of this movie and it would've turned out fine. The long running time wouldn't be a problem if there was some action to balance out the drama. But no there is no balance. Also The ending is just plain stupid. Superman Flying around the earth so fast that he goes back in time just doesn't make any sense. But I do like this movie so let me explain the positives. The acting is amazing. The effects are also amazing. But the negatives outweigh the positives. 6/10,Superman

426,DavBiwan,The Best Super Hero Movie so Far !,10,21 September 2008,"How can this tremendous movie can have a rate so low ?? This is the first and best super hero movie of all time. This is pure magic, the movie released 30 years ago and it is still working. The first hour of the film doesn't show Superman but Clark Kent trying to find his destiny and all i can say is everything is so perfect, the cinematography, the fabulous and melancholic music of John Williams, the actors, sometimes the film is just poetry. You have to see it again to remind you how good this movie is, i think you forgot !!And when we got to see Superman in the suit, oh boy !! We finally see the magic and the talent of Christopher Reeve who will make you believe a man can fly. Even the special effects are still working. This is pure entertainments but with all the depth we need to call it as a masterpiece. The end is very emotional and allow us to understand a sad vision about human nature. But enough talking, go see it again now if you want to dream during 2 hours !!",Superman
427,drexlermcstyles,As Cheeseball as they get,4,4 June 2007,"I hadn't seen this film in a great many years and thought it would be fun to watch it again. The version I watched was the Expanded Edition. I had no problem with the effects being outdated as I usually prefer bluescreen to the one dimensional CGI crap they use now. However this movie was ridiculous, the writing, the acting (Ned Beatty) were geared at the mindless. This version is way too long and by the time things actually get rolling the film is three quarters of the way through. Maybe children around the ages of 5-9 might be able to enjoy this but anyone else should steer clear. Also, Margot Kidders teeth gave me nightmares.",Superman
428,theaz_man,Timeless comic-book classic,9,17 January 2005,"After all these years, Superman the Movie is still better than most superhero films, nay films altogether.The story revolves around Clark Kent, and his transition into the American hero 'Superman', and of course his budding romance with reporter Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is superb as the cocky villain Lex Luthor, and Marlon Brando makes an appearance as Superman's father.What I like about this film is the 'epic' quality it has to it, mainly due to the design of Krpton and Brando's performance. This is then extended by the late Christopher Reeve, who played his alter-ego's separately, and along with the genius of Donner et all, really made us believe a man could fly! A timeless classic.",Superman
429,zanriel,One of my all-time favorite movies.,9,2 February 2015,"What can I say? This is a beautiful movie, and still one of the best superhero movies of all time. It's only superseded by the sequel, Superman II, although I realize I'm a minority opinion on this.It starts with Christopher Reeve, the perfect person to play Superman in the 70's. Then there's the costume, a faithful recreation of the comic book version, bright colors, red shorts, and all. Finally, the music; not only is the main theme one of the most iconic and recognizable in all of movie history, but the incidental music is also fantastic. Just listen to the soundtrack and be swept away.The picturesque shots, the depiction of Krypton, the humor, the romance, this movie is truly a thing of beauty. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is the overall plot. It's a bit corny, the conflict and how it's resolved. People still make fun of it to this day. That's why I think Superman II is honestly a better movie. But hey, still, this is how superhero movies should be done.",Superman
430,wollco,Great,10,28 October 1998,This film shows that the director Richard Donner really believed in the myth of Superman in that he never laughed at him - only at the situations. The Supie films which followed never caught this attitude.The film is great entertainment.,Superman
431,GARGOYLE-3,A TRUE COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION ON THE BIG SCREEN...,10,5 November 1998,"A lot of people think that the first, true, adaptation of a comic book on the big screen was the first ""Batman"" by Tim Burton. I think instead, that the real and absolutely faithful comics nature was first totally respected in Richard Donner's ""Superman the Movie"", an absolutely MUST SEE, by every movie and comics fan. A brilliant screenplay, superb performances and a WONDERFUL score... Tim Burton has done a very good job on ""Batman"" but Donner come first... Thanks to him!!!!",Superman
432,SR_Hadden,The Magic of Modern Myth,10,12 July 2003,"The first mistake you can make when trying to make a Superman fan is simple: try to make him seem like one of us. You can't - because he isn't.That's what Richard Donner saw, and followed through on in the first, and still best, superhero film. If there was a true opposite to the nerd-in-love story of Spider-Man, it wouldn't be Tim Burton's gothic nightmare, it would be Richard Donner's translation of *the* modern American myth.From the Valhalla of Krypton, to the serenity and idyllic Kansas prairie, to the sterling Metropolis, Donner follows our protagonist at a perfect distance. We never get too close, we merely experience his history. Do we ever get to truly know Clark Kent? No, no we don't - but that's fine. It's one of the few films where this is acceptable. If we truly got to know this extraordinary being, this alien, it would ruin the gloss, the myth. We don't watch Superman fly with envy (""I wish that was me""), but instead with awe. Here is a being so beyond us physically, mentally, and morally, that we can do nothing but gape - certainly not relate.And that is truly the film's strength - when tragedy befalls the woman he loves, we see that glint of humanity - that spark that connects this God to us, and that makes the whole thing work. Here's a man we thought was beyond that kind of outburst, and that kind of pain, and the fact that he experiences it, makes the viewing that much more powerful. This myth builds to this tragedy, and Donner does the impossible - makes us empathize with an abstraction.This is not to say, however, that this is the only way to translate the character. Recent writers (and screenwriters) have been attempting to breathe humanity into Superman - and I look forward to the results. But until they prove that we can relate to such a being, this will forever be the quintessential superhero film.",Superman
433,ladycordelia18,I'd forgotten...,10,5 April 2006,"Oh my God, I'd forgotten so much between the time I saw this movie five years ago and when I saw it again recently! I was twelve at the time, and the movie mystified me all over again.I'd forgotten all of Superman's witty comments to people on his first night of saving people in Metropolis (""Hi there. Something wrong with the elevator?"" and ""Bad vibrations?"") I had to laugh at those, and to think, yeah, I'd probably faint too if I'd nearly fallen to my death from the top of a tall building after being spun around in a malfunctioning helicopter only to have a really strong, handsome man who flies miraculously save my life the way it all happened to Lois Lane! I'd forgotten the awesome flight-with-Lois scene--and now I appreciate the romance in it all the better. It's become one of my favorite romance scene of all time. (Excellent lovers' chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, by the way.) I'd forgotten how Lex Luthor had been an excellent bad guy--so many lines believable in real life (""Why? You ask why? Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub?"", etc.) His scenes with Otis and Miss Tessmacher were interesting, from Otis being followed to the challenge-of-the-century speech to the library ladder scene to ""Otisburg."" (last part of that scene that's funny before things start to get really bad for the good guys) Like I'm sure many a viewer did, Ihad to fight to hold back tears when Superman found out he was too late to save Lois from being buried alive and was crushed over her death. (With such pain as grief, who needs Kryptonite?) So he goes back in time to save her--and will critics please stop complaining about the going-back-in-time scene? Overall, I would give this movie a well-deserved 10 out of 10.",Superman
434,James J Choi,The greatest comic book adaptation of all time,10,11 September 2001,"This film is possibly the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. The superb casting of an unknown, Christopher Reeve amongst screen legends in a screenplay of mythological proportions was a cinematic feat the likes of which I doubt can ever be repeated. Add to that the brilliant score of John Williams and you truly will convince yourself that a man can fly. This film could not have succeeded to the proportions it did had it not been for Richard Donner and Chris Reeve who both broke away from the trend and took the task of adapting a comic book totally seriously for a change and with verisimilitude.

435,samxsteal,Greatt movie Go see this as soon as you can,9,17 June 2013,"This Movie was amazing Pacing - The pacing was very good. The story flowed from beat to beat there was plenty of action is is something i have been hoping to see in a live action Superman movie for a very long time. Action - There is a lot of action here, which is fine by me, I have been waiting for a good action packed superman A kin to that of one of the animated shows or movies, where you actually get to see the power of superman.Cinematography - This movie has very stunning visuals. Breath taking shots of earth from space sun rises sun sets, in all the action the camera seem apart of it all. There were bits of shaky cam shots but it never seems to hinder anything for me personally. Production - The production on this movie was epic Seen of Krypton, space you Name it. all done with amazing effects the CGI was Out standing, CGI isn't perfect and i don't think that it ever really will be but this is pretty close here. - The smallville portions felt very closed to home this is the standard American town and you relate to this location. - The Metropolis was very well shot this is the city Super protects and lives - Visually this doers seem to be a edgier Feel compared to other Superman movies, I have Heard in other views there was a lack of comedy. While i admit there no slap stick humor there a beats of comedy the lend to the story with out drawing you out. But yes this is a more serious movie with a more serious tone - Zach Snyder is a great director is style is seen here and its great - Costumes, they were great The kryptonian Style is different from previous movie it a much more visceral look. These people are a noble and advanced race of beings and look it. Zod and his minions have heavier armor being the warrior sect and look beefed up. Superman's suit look outstanding i love how this isn't something he made it from his home world and its one connection he has left to it. Music - Score throughout the film awesome this movie kept me pump throughout the entire movie and set the pace for action and was very immersiveEmotions -This movie had a lot of Emotion i feel that I haven't felt in a super hero movie some thought provoking stuff, that makes you think about this movie long after you have seen it. Characters - Henry Cavill as Kal-El was Fantastic He is Superman in this movie you feel it. - Amy Adams As Lois lane Was fantastic and the chemistry between her and Cavill worked well in my opinion. -Diane Lane as Martha Kent Was great you feel her passions for her son there a great mother and son relationship with her and Cavill -Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent is the protective loving father. And there is a very good relationship with the Whole Kent family that you can relate with. -Russell Crowe as Jor-El is amazing I love the version of him. -Ayelet Zurer as Lara Lor-Van Aka Kal-El's mom was also great -Michael Shannon as General Zod was Amazing a different take on this character yet still familiar. Brooding Bad guy with slightly good intentions. He makes Himself known in all his scenes, as a stand out. -Antje Traue As Faora-Ul Steals it though she a badass fighter and Solder, and really steals all the scenes she in her fight scene are epic and she's ruthless Directing - Personally I understand he gets some flak from fans of superman who don't like him but Honestly there is no reason behind it He does an amazing job and has created one of the best superman Movies to date. - His visual style is great I personally love it.9.5 Overall it was a Great movie, with everything you could expect from a Superman or Comic book movie it's like watching and epic interpretation of the comic on screen with lots of action and great dramatic and comedic beats throughout. I suggest this movie to Anyone, Especially for fans of the comic and those who are stuck on the Christopher Reeves go in to this with an open mind this isn't a remake of the reeves Movies it is different, but I personally feel this is on par if not better then the reeves Version, As I do love the original Reeves series of movies Even the later more campy ones, I fine this much closer to the action pack version I'm used to seeing in comic and on TV now and days",Superman
436,ekhartnow,just an average movie.(or below average?),1,5 June 2012,superman 1978 is just an average movie. or i can even say it as below average. i understand why this movie has lots of fan base. the reasons are 1.it is the first high budget superman movie. 2.due to special effects(for that time). 3)music by john Williams(only great thing in this movie). i agree this movie is a classic but its definitely not great movie. definitely not. the only ones who support this movie are fans from the 70s and some brainwashed people who were made to believe this movie was great. i can safely say and i dare superman returns is lot more and in every way better than this. 1978 movie has some merits of its own. but not that much so as to get qualified as a great movie. i at moments got bored by this movie. and the ending of the movie is ridiculous(spinning earth) and logic less. this movie does not deserve the rating it has got.at least not in this present generation. this movie served as a prototype for superman returns and that's one of the good purpose this movie served.,Superman
437,jcruz729,One of the best,7,19 May 2005,"This is a great movie, however I do have some problems to address with this movie. If you are a comic book fan you'll probably agree with me. First of all they killed off an essential character in Supermans life, which is his adoptive father. Superman would not be who he was if it wasn't for the constant advise given to him by Jonathan Kent. We are left to assume that he was just born with a moral compass, thats just a tiny quirk I have with the movie. The thing that does upset me is that they don't give Superman a power level, he just seems all powerful, which he is not. What the movie does is show us how Superman is more human that the rest of us by constantly trying to do good. The movie is well written and directed, the only people who'll find some things annoying are those who actually read the comic, but those who don't will love it.",Superman
438,farrellmcknightk9,overrated to the bone,4,18 March 2014,"I'm not blaming the faults of this movie for the bad effects, because it was decades ago. The faults of this movie were the acting, silly plot, the God-awful cinematography; this movie, and the sequels, were a mess. The only good thing I can even call good from this franchise is Gene Hackman as the villain. Sure it's over the top, and whacky, but it's the kind I was looking for. His douchey attitude, puns, and smugness really made him a good villain. It'd be better as a James Bond villain though. To give Man of Steel some credit, at least the mountains of faults in that movie were still not as monumentally stupid as the faults in this movie. 4 out of 10.

439,fuad1138,You Will Believe...,10,15 February 2005,"During a time when comic book material transcribed to the big screen tended to look like a gutted turkey, this wonderful Richard Donner film stands out and still shines. Unlike the Hollywood norm at the time, where the subject of comic book superheroes were dealt out by people with little to no knowledge of what made them beloved to many, Donner's interpretation manages to capture the magic, love and emotions that every Superman fan understood.Richard Donner creates the feeling of both awe and familiarity with the audience. Awe, with the scenes on Krypton, looking over the vast landscape and alien culture that birthed Superman, and familiarity, with Clark Kent's trials and tribulations of a young teen in small town America. With this range, Donner manages to infuse scenes with enough raw emotion to capture the interest of non-comic-book fans and not descend into camp so much as to loose the interest of those devoted readers of the comic. The mythos he presents is genuine; he understands the material. As a boy living in rural Iowa, i could believe in th character of Superman living in a town very much like my own, as Donner presents.Likewise, the casting in this movie is impressive. Brando's Jor-El (Superman's father) is very impressive, stoic and true, giving the first part of the movie a resonating voice of reason and despair.Christopher Reeve *is* Superman. His portrayal is one of a mortal man with incredible powers, is also true and genuine... and despite how easily it could have been, it never gets campy. It never insults it's audience.The first hour of the movie is some of the best cinema devoted to comic books the screen will ever see (only rivaled today by Raimi's Spider-Man).The remainder of the movie deals with the plots of Lex Luther, and it is only then that the story starts to gain any sort of ""camp"" momentum. It is almost as if Donner was concerned those viewing the movie may expect the silliness of the 1960's BATMAN t.v. series wouldn't get the reverence the first part of the film presents, so he injects a little camp. For me, this is the only part of the film that lags for me... otherwise i love the entire movie.Share this movie with your children. Show them why Superman is considered an American icon, and they too will believe that a man can fly.",Superman
440,house_elf_cutie,Superman is a super movie!,10,11 July 2006,"No one can ask for a movie that shows better heroic display than Superman. I've always been a fan ever since I watched this movie. The story is mainly about how a hero starts out. The movie shows who Superman is which is a hero who has abilities that succeeds above human beings. I think that means a person doesn't have to be (even from this planet) or anywhere in order to save lives. Christopher Reeve as the man behind the super man in blue tights and his alter ego Clark Kent, who's geeky and wears glasses so he can't look like Superman, and works for the Daily Planet, is great for this role. Margot Kidder displays a spunky leading woman, Lois Lane, who also works at the Daily Planet. Finally, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor a.k.a. Superman's nemesis. He gives us a view of what a coward, rich, and funny Lex really is. If you are a fan of the comic or you're just a sucker for action adventure/comedy/a bit of romance movies then you HAVE to watch this. I rate this movie 10/10. I would rate it even more if they'll let me!",Superman
441,stanheckjrr,This is a Review of the 3 Hour Edition,10,23 June 2017,"As many of you are aware there is several versions of this ""Superman"" film. This review is for the Longest Edition. This is called the RESTORED INTERNATIONAL CUT. I was not a huge ""Superman"" fan when I saw this film. I herd this was a good movie. I never seen a cartoon or television show on ""Superman"" so U had no idea who Lois Lane was. However I think that served me well. I was taken on an ""E TICKET RIDE"" that I never forgot. Even to this day this is still one of my favorite movie going experiences. In fact I loved this more than I did ""Star Wars"". Most of you know the story of ""Superman"". This film starts off with a bang however I am not a fan of the pro-longed opening credit sequence. To me that is still pretty to watch but it BORING. Thank god for the fast forward buttons.Academy Award-winners Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman head an all- star cast in the fantastic, action-packed film that made Christopher Reeve an international star playing the greatest superhero of all time. From the doomed planet of Krypton, two parents launch a spaceship carrying their infant son to earth. Here he grows up to become Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Metropolis Daily Planet. But with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men, he battles for truth and justice as Superman.Now the 3 hour Plus edition is worth watching however there is not much in the way of new scenes but more like SCENES BEING EXTENDED. The only NEW SCENE that comes to mind that should have been left in the original theatrical edition is when""Superman"" talks to his father after he has revealed himself for the first time. It is a great scene and this is about the only SCENE that Richard Donner added back into the film for its DVD debut. I do however enjoy seeing the extension of Lois talking to the Indian Chief. It adds more information about why the Indians were selling their land. This film is still the best comic book movie ever made. Every film that has been based on a comic is compared to this 1978 Film. Nothing has come close to have the magic that this film captured. Richard Donner created a classic that still Under-appreciated. Today's comic book movies are garbage. They have no heart and are cast with the likes of Jessica Alba and other terrible actors. This is a first class production. The actors are all great in the roles they have. Can't say that about any ""Batman"" movies.",Superman
442,jonkellymacintyre,Super,8,5 July 2006,"Well, this movie is great. No other way to put it. Reeve's portrayal of Clark Kent is what really makes this film. Even though the movie is called Superman any square jawed man could pull that role off. But what Christopher Reeve gives to the Clark side of the man of steal is what makes his performance amazing. He is dorky in all the right ways. It looks like there is no acting going on. It is so flawless that you would really think that Reeve was like this in person. Hackman does such a great job of being Lex Luthor that I hated him in other films because he played such a good villain to my child hood hero. Kidder adds the right amount of spunk to Lois Lane. The entire cast really nails their role. Even Brando, who in 1978, was probably on the down slide of his career. The only reason I gave this movie an 8 was the special effects. I know it was 1978, but Star Wars achieved Special Effects that seemed more realistic. But other than that this movie is perfect for family or comic book lover.",Superman

Margot Kidder did an excellent job as Lois Lane, and I like how they portrayed her character.

445,Greg-190,Richard Donner's epic spans a vast array of genres and has gone unnoticed in film history.,10,27 July 1999,"I am practically a grown man, and so its a little shocking for people when, during cinema-type conversations, I profess that ""Superman"" is my favorite movie.  Most uninformed people regard it as either a) a children's movie or b) a useless entry in a growing list of superhero fantasies.
That ""Superman"" has the gall to take its viewer on a vivid journey through space and time into the core of imagination and science-fiction (the planet Krypton), then propel us into the Midwest for a poignant coming-of-age story, then lead us on a mission with young Clark Kent to the North Pole to physically and figuratively discover his identity, and then yank us back into a Metropolis comic-book story, only serves to underscore the underestimated brilliance of writer Mario Puzo (and a score of other writers) and director Donner.  ""Superman"" is an amazing and daring feat, much like a miracle the Man of Steel would perform himself.  It would be a severe oversight to say it's a good flick with some moments of brilliance - the whole film is a moment of brilliance.""Superman"" has had its followers, an almost cult-like group growing over the two decades since its blockbuster release; one might say Tim Burton was a follower, which lead to his equally successful and more notorious ""Batman.""But ""Superman"" has so much more going for it, including an indeliable, tongue-in-cheek look at the comic book hero, an underlying sense of all that is great about America, and some incredible talent (especially Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the amazing Christopher Reeve in his breakthrough dual role).Released in the late 70's, its no doubt that Donner's epic saga spoke to its haggard generation - a slew of Americans picking up the pieces from Vietnam and the fiasco of Watergate.  How fitting that audiences could turn to a fantasy film to find a new hero and leader.  For the late 70's, an American audience could watch Reeve fly over the earth and give a wink and smile to us below - a hero not without his faults, but striving to do what is noble and right in a chaotic, yet thriving world (quite the boost Americans needed after the Nixon administration).Somewhere, perhaps in the far reaches of our minds, we can find Superman soaring above the heavens, fetching cats from trees, rescuing Lois Lane from a helicopter accident, placing criminals in prisons, righting our wrongs and protecting us in the best way he can.  Somewhere, in our minds, we follow Superman on this journey of humanity and life.  This is what ""Superman"" can evoke...this and so much more.",Superman
446,runawayman71,Most overrated movie of all time,2,14 September 2006,"""Superman: The Movie"" has, by far, the worst plot ever put on film. No movie ever made has a plot that depends so much on stupidity as the plot of Superman. Not even movies about stupidity (e.g., Dumber And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd) can top it in that category.But let's take a look at the plot: Lex Luthor buys cheap mid-western real state with the intention of sending a nuclear missile to San Andreas fault, thus sinking the whole west coast, which would cause his cheap real state to become the new west coast, thus making him rich. Never mind the fact that the plan is neither physically possible nor economically viable, those are the least of this movie's problems. The problems start when, luckily for Luthor, the US Army, who are depicted as the most incompetent group of buffoons in the history of cinema, decide to launch 2 nuclear missiles within US territory, with enough fuel to reach both coasts and no failsafes whatsoever. They literally just plan to hurl the missiles up into the air and hope for the best because if anything goes wrong, they're screwed. The missiles are going to be transported from the base where they are stored to the launching base (where no one will ever check if anything went wrong) by a group of soldiers so dumb and horny they'll leave their post in unison at the sight of a scantily-clad woman lying in the pavement ahead of them.It's bad enough that the only real difference between Luthor's plan to hijack the missiles and a Coyote's plan to capture the Road Runner is the number of empty Acme boxes lying around afterwards. It's bad enough that the plan actually works, thanks to the spectacular incompetence of the US Army. It's bad enough that Otis (Luthor's henchman) demonstrates that he is the stupidest living being ever put on film by screwing up a task a 6-year-old child would've done correctly. But what makes this sequence completely unbearable is the fact that Otis' screw up is going to play such an important part in the plot later on. Quite literally, Otis' braindead screw up is the one and only reason Superman manages to defeat Luthor.Then Luthor realizes that Superman could still foil his plans so he decides to get rid of him, and using reasoning that Uwe Boll would've been ashamed to put on film, he ""deduces"", out of the blue, the existence and effects of Kryptonite. Then he lures Superman into his lair (in the sewers) so he can kill him. At this point, Superman is completely clueless regarding the missiles and Luthor's plan. If Luthor has kept his mouth shut, he would've won. But just to prove that this movie is nothing but a bad James Bond movie written by Ed Wood, and that Luthor is nothing more than a poor man's Goldfinger, he tells Superman everything about his plan, including how to stop it if he desires to do so. Then he puts the Kryptonite necklace on Superman, pushes him into a pool, and continues his James Bond-villain impersonation by conveniently walking away for no readily apparent reason, hoping that Superman is nice enough to die unsupervised and stupid enough not no realize that all he has to do is to bend over and let the necklace slip from his neck. All Luthor had to do was to wait two minutes for Superman to drown. If he was in a hurry, he could've helped him. But no, he walks away.So Superman is in the pool, a Kryptonite necklace slowly draining away his powers and even his very life. This is the first time in the whole movie that Superman cannot simply muscle his way out of a problem. So what does he do? Does he demonstrate that being a hero is about the heart, not the muscles? Does he demonstrate that a hero might be down, but he's never out? Does he demonstrate that a true hero will always find a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat no matter what the odds are? No, that would be SuperGIRL. What Superman demonstrates is that he's absolutely worthless without his muscles. So how does he get out of there? Well, it turns out that Otis' screw up in programming the missile has conveniently sent it to the town where the grandparents of Luthor's henchwoman live. And she saves Superman so he can save her grandparents, in what is effectively the worst ""plot twist"" in the history of cinema.And when you thought things couldn't get any stupider, they do. Superman stops the first missile, but not the second one, which strikes San Andreas fault and causes a huge earthquake. Several really crappy FX scenes later (including one where Superman lifts a whole mountain range which, incredibly enough, stops the earthquake instead of causing a bigger one) Lois Lane dies. So (and prepare your brain cells for this one) Superman flies around the Earth, reversing Earth's rotation, and thus reversing time, magically undoing all the stuff that had just happened. He literally just hits the ""undo"" button and makes all the bad things go away.If a lesser superhero, let alone a female one, had tried to get away with this kind of garbage it would've instantly won a Razzie for worst screenplay of the century.",Superman
447,Mr-CCS-06,A prominent Superhero in a still prominent movie,10,9 September 2020,"Throughout the history of the United States, Superman has always remained a huge member of pop culture. Whether you're talking about the new DCEU version of it or the animated cartoons, Superman is always a true icon when it comes to entertainment. And that is shown specifically throughout this interpretation. While I prefer Henry Cavill's version of Superman, Christopher Reeve always sticks in people's minds when it comes to the movies. He always will be the first cinematic hero of the 70s. Other characters in this movie include Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, and Gene Hackmann as Lex Luthor. They are great in there own ways and really bring out the characters I always imagined from the comics. The visuals(for a 1978 movie) still look very pretty and looks like something made in the 2000s. The action(whilst not much of it) makes you feel like you are reading a comic book. Are there any negatives to this movie? No. It is a classic that will remain in our minds and our hearts for years to come. 10/10",Superman

Much like true lies, where the main good guy doesnt meet the villian, or find out his plan till the end. Although it doesnt live  up to the mother of all supperhero movies, Batman, it is an easy second. The spectacular score and action is awesome. Christopher Reeve- unbelievable. He and lois's chemistry is so real you would think they were actual lovers. as gene hackman, well....... Lois is perfectly portrayed. She may not look to much liek Lois, she is perfect. he movies does go on a little long for the time it takes clark to get sent to Earth, and go to metropolis.Lex luthor's plan is great.It actuly makes sense. but here is some advice to Brett Ratner and the maker of this confirmed/unconfirmed superman v with anthony hopkins as Jor -el, dont make the costume look so cheap, or so tight. There are some guys there and dont want to see superman's private parts sticking out of his costume. spoiler Maybe the dam scene was just added for special effects. end. overall, this movie is El Bombo. the best. infinite out of .00000000001",Superman
450,chiz95,Classic,7,16 November 2002,"I think the real success of this film could be attributed equally as to what Richard Donner and the team of writers didn't do as much as what they did do in the finished product.  I doubt the Salkinds (producers) really had as brilliant a vision for 'Superman the Movie' and took it more than anything as an opportunity to make themselves some guaranteed money out of what had become a comic book hero, I'm sure of that.  The fact that several re-writes were done to make the script into something more credible, less laughable and more what Donner envisioned this film could be justifies this. The film could have been very camp and most definitely hard to believe in.  for a start nobody had ever flown on screen in a credible fashion and from the start you're lumbered with that rather amusing Superman outfit you just had to believe in, or else.  There were many traps to fall into.   They could have got a huge superstar to play the part of Superman but that was just one of the traps Donner avoided.  the unknown they found, one Christopher Reeve is absolutely believable, loveable and brilliant in this dual role of the charming, confident and courageous Kal-El/Superman and his disguise as the nervy, shy Clark Kent.  Maybe its unfair to say that he was born to play the role but you really get that impression.  He is totally believable and his unknown quality attributed to the fact that there really was no doubt in your mind, this WAS indeed Superman. The plot for the first hour or so really does and has to move at the speed of light, covering Superman's first thirty years, from the explosion of his home planet, to his growing up on Earth and his transformation into Superman.  And this is a little uncomfortable as a viewer, though it was probably paced as well as it could have been.   This leads to the real highlight of the movie which is the mid-section where Clark arrives in Metropolis and we discover Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and Superman making his first dramatic public appearances.  The direction, scripting and acting in these 30 minutes or so is delightful and really gets you drawn into this fantastical plot.  Luthor is played brilliantly by Gene Hackman and with his assistant Otis it is a villainous double act as good and enjoyable to watch as anyone could have imagined. The only real disappointment must be that the finale of the film is a slight let down by the rest of the film's high standards.  It is a almost too big a challenge - Superman chasing 2 Nuclear missiles and dealing with the mayhem that ensues.  It did feel like it was a slight anti-climax. But on the other hand the idea of killing Lois and then having Superman turn back the world to save her I thought was surprising and exciting But the most brilliant aspect of this movie is undoubtedly the wonderful John William's score.  To my mind he wrote the greatest piece of theme music to a film ever with this film.  The opening credits go on so long it almost feels as if they have done it just to give us more of the amazing Superman theme.  In this, he created a piece of music even grander than the entire Superman character and myth itself.  And his entire score really makes a fine film into a wonderful film.  when i say the opening and closing credits of this film are highlights I really mean it (and not in a sadistic sense) the biggest success of the film overall I think is that you either believe in these characters and that what you're seeing could be true, or that even more so that you would want to believe in it.  and for a plot so daft that is really a miraculous thing.  Only the unimaginative or uptight or those with no sense of humour or humanity would not enjoy this film.  and even thought it has indeed dated (the effects are not quite so believable anymore) it is a true classic of its time and a truly fun adventure. there really aren't enough films like this made anymore. 8/10",Superman

John Williams score is one of the best ever, and so is the theme. Cristopher Reeve is the perfect person to play Superman. Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) and Ned Beatty (Lex's assistant, Otis) are killer funny. Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) is OK, and so is Jackie Cooper (Perry White). Marlon Brando ( Supermans father, jor-el) is great. It has superb special effects. This was released 5 years after the first trailer, and it was well worth the wait.

453,eddtedd,It wasn't a SUPER film!,5,12 December 2003,"This film, like so many others, is way way way over hyped. It's a good film ONCE IT GETS GOING, but thats like after an hour and by that time you've either fallen asleep or noticed that your shoes could do with a clean. The whole planet thing blowing up, baby goes to earth, Clark learning his powers blah blah blah I DON'T CARE is way to long. I mean it takes other films only a couple of scenes to tell the background of the hero. This film took 14 scenes for f**ks sake! Even after that, it was still annoying, but only a few scenes, however. The whole 'can you read my mind?' thing. BORING!! I nearly fell asleep for the seventh time and had realised that my shoes really did need a clean. Has anyone noticed as well, when Superman spins the earth around to go back in time, what happens to the seas and moon's gravity? (A tedious point but one I felt had nothing to with this review. Just like jam!) The casting was good (finally a positive comment) and everyone suited their roles.Gene Hackman as Lex was brilliant and the guy who played superman was... zzzz. Whhhaaa? Oh sorry, just thinking about this film made me fall asleep. Look, if you've got a couple of spare hours and like self torture, watch this film. If you don't, don't watch it.

454,drakesylvan,"A great Super Hero Movie, However it's not perfect",7,29 February 2012,"While still being one of the best superhero movies of all time, Superman the movie has some major flaws that no one seems to address.Brando is at his finest in the role of Superman's father, and I'm very sad they couldn't put more of him in this movie. I'm a huge Brando fan.Reeves does a great job as both Clark Kent and Superman, but he is dragged down by the terrible acting of his co-star as Lois Lane. Most of the time she just screams, and badly at that. Plus, she's not all together a very attractive choice for the Lane character, but she doesn't completely destroy the role, after all she is the woman who never knew Clark was Superman for something like 20 years.The worst part is the time travel ending. Now, for those of you who don't like to talk about time travel, physics, and paradoxes, you might want to stop reading here.What really gets me about this is that when superman goes into the past to save Lois Lane there is no mention of the other Superman who has yet to go into the past and save her. Plus, there would be no need for him to go into the past if Lois was safe. So, at best there are two Supermen now running around the world. At worst there is a paradox that leads to nothingness.Now, even if you believe that people become one person when they go into the past and that the other goes away (poof) there still would be no need for Superman to go into the past because superman stopped the event that triggered the effect.Thus temporal mechanics cannot explain this situation to my liking.Overall, the movie is fine, but its a bit too campy to be called the best superhero movie.",Superman
455,edwin-peters,Chris Reeve is the MAN!,9,29 March 2012,"Although this movie is from the 70's, it is still THE best superhero movie of all time. And I agree this movie has been forgotten and underrated. It's a classic not to be missed. Christopher Reeve is to Superman as Sean Connery is to James Bond. The only problem I really had with this was Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, the rest of the movie was fine, and flawless. I don't care how much in style they'll go on ""Superman Lives,"" it will not match up to this classic in any ways. Richard Donner did a superb job directing this movie as well. It also had the humorous twisted Lex Luthor, who Gene Hackman played magnificently, as well as Ned Beatty who was his idiot henchman Otis. Who could ask for a better story? There have been lots of Marvel superhero movies coming down the pike of late. Yawwwwwnnnn. This movie is the one that started it all.",Superman

I thought about 9/10, but as the movie or at least one of two movies that were parts of my childhood (the other one was Star Trek 1). Those movie series were broad casted in former Yugoslavia at the beginning of the 80's as special movies shown on New Year's, one year some of Superman movies and next year some of Star Trek movies. I was about 10 or something...So, Superman has stayed as part of my memories about movies, and through time when I saw it again and again, it didn't look old. OK, special effects are not too cool like in Spiderman, but they look better every time.Today, in this inflation of superhero movies that you forget when you exit the cinema and/or that you wish you didn't see, Superman stays as the the movie of this kind.",Superman
457,LookingforJulia,Best opening title sequence... ever!,8,22 October 2004,"We all have unique reasons for loving a film. That's what makes cinema so magical. It's personal. You can love the meat of the movie, or you can love the trimmings. There's a bunch of good stuff here. Most people my age will refer to ""Superman"" as THE definitive superhero film. None will ever take it's place. A position no doubt dictated by the age we were when first viewing it. As with films like ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", WHEN you experience them is just as important as HOW you experience them. As we age, youth's eyes fade. Cynicism creeps in. Experience leads us to see the many injustices this life offers and we become more critical... less likely to accept that which we would rather believe. After all, an adult who clings to the youthful ideals of wonder is simply naive... right?To this day, the opening title sequence for ""Superman"" fills me with the same magical joy it did over twenty years ago. Never was a score so perfectly crafted around a film. John Williams and Richard Donner created such an indelible experience that over 25 yrs later, Bryan Synger will use the same music and theme to bring the magic to a new generation of wondrous eyes. As for me though, this will always remain the best.",Superman

John Williams as usual created a scored that fits the film perfectly giving us the epic feeling of Superman and Krptyon, the sentimentally of the loving scenes and the mystery of Kal-el's destiny. The only sour point of the movie is the Lex Luthor scenes which were a bit too camp for my liking, but all in all it is a timeless film that i will be watching forever and forever.

The beginning of the movie leads you to believe, that the movie takes place during the Depression, but actually is the time Krypton is about to be destroyed.Marlon Brando wears a crazy white jumpsuit on the planet Krypton, which must have black lights everywhere, because he seems to glow (like the god he is).He can't convince the ""Guardians"" (the leaders of Krypton) to abandon Krypton, despite his knowledge of a coming apocalypse. He promises that he and his wife will not leave, so he sends his newborn son to the stars.OK, yeah, like mentioned above, everybody knows this story. What I can't stand is that SUPERMAN can fly around the world to turn back time. I know I should suspend my disbelief, but it's such a lousy ending for the movie. Can't he do something else, better to defeat Lex Luthor and save Lois Lane? And if he can fly fast enough to turn back time, why couldn't he just have caught both nuclear warheads?Other than that, it's a pretty good interpretation of the Superman story, with Mario Puzo as screenwriter.

It's a wonderful film, full of strong characters, great special effects (well great as long as you remember it was made in the late 70's) and a surprisingly good script.It's also a very human story, and is as much a coming of age tale as it is a superhero flick. Superman is also free of the modern curse of self awareness suffered by more recent superhero movies like batman.

The film plays what it truly is and that is ""An Assembly Cut"". This is a great film to watch if your a fan of the original.

And yet, sitting down this weekend with nothing much to do, I decided to re-live that moment... once again. I've not written a film review up to this point, but this is one I just had to comment on. 28 years on, it still looks and feels fresh. The opening credits have got to be the most exhilarating of any I have ever seen. The moment the screen goes blank, and you are faced with the electric blue letters of MARLON BRANDO zooming in across the screen, - together with the sublime and almost minimalist score of Williams - you know you're in for a cracker.Superman, like most superhero films I've seen, could so easily have fallen foul of its subject matter - it is fantasy. And somehow, I am willing to believe it for two hours. I go along with the themes, I am entranced by some of the performances, and I still revel in a great deal of the special effects (that really ought to have dated badly, but somehow manage to stand up.) But the film works most of all because, though it is fantasy, it is for the most part played seriously. That is not to say that there is not comedy, or comic moments - there are many. When I watch the film, I really get the sense that the director/cast/all those involved wanted to create something quite special. I think the casting itself was inspired. Reeves is perfect in both his respective roles. I would single out Margot Kidder though, - not sure the general feel of the production would hold as well without her.

Why doesn't Lois's car get sucked into the ground the second time around? It just doesn't make any sense. And then he just drops Lex Luthor off in a prison but in reality they would just have to let him go because they would have no reason to hold him. Superman doesn't even explain what Lex has done.

But nothing comes close to Superman. Batman Begins and Spiderman are really great, don't get me wrong. They are both truly excellent movies in MANY respects. I don't review movies SOLELY based on special effects, acting, cinematography, or the action/adrenaline factor, or anything like that. I view movies largely from a more emotional/spiritual sense, with characters, ideas/morals/philosophies, etc. and the storyline dominating my thoughts.Superman is a story of love, honor, sacrifice, decision-making and moral courage. Superman has a noble, compassionate, kind, righteous character, but he isn't perfect. He makes mistakes, just as we do. THIS is why we emulate him, not because he is big, strong, and can fly, etc. Christopher Reeve said it best when he said that Superman wasn't great because he had super powers. He was great because of HOW he used his powers.That is the REAL power of fiction and fantasy, for you realists out there. Of course we fantasy lovers love imaginativeness and magic and things that are hard to believe. It may be make-believe and not real, but the subject matter is very, very real. There is a very real spiritual war going on between good and evil in the world, and that war is going on inside of every one of us, be it ever so subtle, and we have to decide every day, every moment, whether or not we will be ""super men"" or ""super women"".This is why I love Superman.

Despite growing up in the CGI-laden age of cinema, I found myself captivated by this utterly breathtaking movie that quite frankly was 'fantastic' in every sense of the word. What attracted me to the movie was the realism director Richard Donner managed to create for the audience, giving the sense of hope that someone as 'out of this world' as Superman could exist. For its time, the special effects used in 'Superman: The Movie' were cutting-edge, having never been attempted before, and as such, succeeded in capturing the imaginations of the world's movie-goers, making you believe that a man really could fly.Casting was also a crucial factor in its appeal. With one of the most influential figures in cinema history and one of the greatest actors, Marlon Brando was a stroke of genius in the role of Jor-El. Likewise, Gene Hackman was an enlightened choice for Lex Luthor. But it was the perfect casting of the unknown Christopher Reeve as Superman that brought the movie to life. He was brilliant as both Clark Kent and The Man of Steel, capturing both character's aspects and personal traits flawlessly.I firmly believe that 'Superman: The movie' still retains the charm and epic proportions first experienced in 1978 and I myself feel that it embodies the true super-hero movie and one which is still used as a comparative for movies of the same genre even today. With the release of 'Superman Returns' and the revival of the franchise, hopefully a new generation of movie-goers will able to experience the thrills and excitement the Man of Steel first gave me!",Superman

Even though the special effects aren't as impressive as movies are today, this movie stands out more for the story of Clark Kent.

He didn't camp up the role at all which must have been a great temptation in those tights. He made the man of steel someone who you could admire because of his caring nature.

Just think who else other than untouchable Marlon Brando could honestly have have played Jor-El? And we all know Gene Hackman/Lex Luthor is the same person (yes, that good).

476,pauldavidwilson,Superman - timeless classic,9,27 June 2006,"Superman: The Movie is one of those films from the late 70s, early 80s that saved Hollywood. In that period of time there were a few dozen films that appropriately were tagged as Blockbuster. Superman was certainly apart of this. The acting was fantastic as well. Marlon Brando as Jor-El was simply larger than life but at the same time his character was contemplative as he considered his son's future. Gene Hackman looked like he thoroughly enjoyed playing Lex Luthor and created the character with a fair balance between criminal and comedian. The late Chris Reeve was often under appreciated but when you compare how he portrayed the duality of Superman & Clark Kent you are really made to believe there are two actors. I especially enjoyed the body language differences. When playing Clark he manages a goofy slouching kind of character. Even the voice changes. When donning the blue suit a confidence takes over and it is clear that Chris Reeve IS Superman. I watched this film again recently and it holds up well even after 20 plus years. Except for some hair and clothing styles I forget I'm watching an old film.",Superman

In high school, Clark was very sure of himself and wasn't that clutsy. What, did he think that donning that blue suit made him think he had to act that differently? Couldn't he just act the same way he did back then? Like on Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Suprman... Yeah, there's a personality change between Superman and Clark, but Dean Cain's Clark doesn't hold himself back like Chris Reeves' Clark did. I don't know, it's not a huge deal. I just think it's kinda funny that the personality change is so drastic, you know, between Clark and Superman. He's not even that different in the comic books... What do you think?",Superman

It was an unforgettable experience. I grew up with the story of Superman. After so many movies and series, it was hard to imagine what possibly could come next. Superman Returns took it to a higher level. There was recognition of many of the tragedies the world has endured in recent times and the past. The words unsaid were not difficult to imagine.

He has a great charisma, a good sense of humor and for me he is the best actor that has interpreted this character.

Truly he was the best superman ever. A natural. I loved the opening titles as well as the music. The helicopter mishap that introduces superman to the world was just awesome. Gene Hackman did a great job as a demented scientist. The cast was spectacular. I especially enjoyed the romance between Superman and Lois Lane. Marlon Brando was just superb as Jor El. Though the movie is over 2 hours one tend to enjoy each and every fraction of a second of it. Superman II ... especially the Niagara falls and related scenes is nice as well.

484,deowen-2,"Deserves more credit, one of the best sci-fi pictures alongside 2001 and Star Trek II",10,26 March 2014,"I really owe a lot to Superman. It was the first movie that really made me think about character development. I've seen it before in other movies and games I played before at the time, but this is the movie that made me notice it. For the first half of Superman, all it does it develop Superman from a young child to a confused teenager, to Clark Kent. And that is what separates Superman from every other movie I've seen. We feel like we've grown up with Clark as if we were one of his own brothers. This is a quality Superman II and Man of Steel didn't have. We feel for Clark and we like and cheer for him as we watch him go up against Lex Luthor. And that brings me to my next half of the review. A lot of people don't like the change between adolescent Clark and him then going to Metropolis and becoming Superman for the first time. I thought the second and third act were just as good as act one. Clark is forced to juggle his Clark life at the Daily Planet and his crime-fighting alter ego life as Superman. Richard Donner creates in my opinion, one of the best, if not THE best comic movie ever made, and it's quality wouldn't be matched until The Dark Knight in 2008. Superman was a masterpiece and it is not a big dumb action fest everyone makes it out to be. It goes alongside Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Star Trek II as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. You'll believe a man can fly. 10/10",Superman
485,jamesvincent400,I Beleived a Man Could Fly!!,10,20 July 2003,"Superman just simply kicks ass as the best Superhero film ever to be made! There is something to me that just sets it out from the rest, including the more modern films like Siperman or Hulk. The film itself sits true to the comic, but also has metaphors you wouldn't really think of. For instance, Jor-El sending baby Cal-El to Earth is a clear metaphor of God sending Jesus to Earth. Not that the film holds any religious meaning, it is just a metaphor. Obviously, the effects in the film were the up to date stuff of it's day, some created there and then especially for the film! No matter what anybody says though, Chris Reeve can fly. It's more than just him on wires sticking his arms out, he flew! I think it was Christopher Reeve on his own that sold that effect, and indeed the whole film. Fare enough big Hollywood names like Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman drew the audiences, but that same audience on the way out of the cinema most likely only remember Reeve!. Everyone that still watches Superman, only seeing it for the first time, could assume it was Reeve who was the well known actor on the film, because of his ability to bring life to the big blue bird. He is Superman, and to me always will be. The film from stat to finish holds on your concerntration. From growing up in Smallville, to working or flying round Metropolis. For anyone who hasn't seen it, I urge you do. The effects, the story, the atmosphere it gives will uplift you. Superman Rules, and always will.",Superman

All others pale by comparison, this is the gold standard. This was filmed not as a simple adventure movie, but as an epic tale, oozing the heart, passion, character, and genuine emotion that Batman, Punisher, and X-men have never attained. Filmed in 1977 for a then unheard of $35 million dollars, the special effects still rival anything seen in the CGI era. The all star cast was amazing; Hackman brings humor, Brando drama. Kidder, Perrine, Beatty, Cooper, all wonderful. Seeing Reeve, so young, handsome and strong, makes you remember how he was Superman, both before and after his accident. One of the great movies of the 1970s. In the time we live in, a time of star driven vanity vehicles which you forget on the ride home from the theater, a film like this reminds of how movies were once great, and could be again.

487,PixelRift,Looking Back on the Big Blue Boy-Scout.,7,27 September 2013,"Richard Donner's film adaptation of the Man of Steel does an excellent job at establishing the good-natured soul of orphaned Kryptonian. Superman: The Movie (1978) is a landmark for bringing big budget superhero films to the big screen; and while this film holds a special place in my heart, it is not without its problems. The movie begins on Spoiler the doomed planet of Krypton where Jor-El (Marlon Brando) along with the rest of the Kryptonian counsel are sentencing General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his two accomplishes to an eternity in the Phantom Zone. All before reveling the struggle Jor-El is having with his fellow counsel men about the fate of their planet. He argues that the planet should be evacuated but is denied. He agrees that he and his wife will not attempt to leave the planet, but cleverly excludes his newborn son. Jor-El soon sends his only son to Earth moments before Krypton itself explodes, saving him and gifting Earth with a new savior.The film does a good job at staying fairly true to its source material, which had been around for fifty years at that point. Christopher Reeves dual performance as Superman and Clark Kent is executed perfectly and without this the movie would lose most of its charm. The movie is gifted with having years of material to draw from but it makes the mistake of assuming Spoiler people will understand why Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is hiding underground without giving any sort of explanation for this.The film also suffers for poor pacing. It is roughly an hour into the film before we see the classic red cape and blue tights. The film also waits until the final forty minutes to ramp up the pacing while also explain the central threat that Superman is going to face. It is in the movie's final minutes where fans of the source material are cursed with an argument that will be used against them for years to come. Not going into what the action is, but it goes to fuel the argument that Superman is over powered.Even with poor pacing and some slapstick humor that is misplaced at times, the movie is still cherished by fans of the genre. The movies greatest strength is the writing for the Man of Steel and its immaculate depiction by Reeves. The film should be seen by anyone who is a fan of super hero genre.",Superman

Forget Daredevil - this was where it all started. Richard Donner, who had directed The Omen previously, turns his attention to making a man fly for this movie, and he certainly came up trumps leaving the audience guessing as to exactly how he did it.  Donner did well in choosing Christopher Reeve as his Man of Steel, as not many actors around at that time could have pulled off portraying two characters in one.  Reeve portrays the hero with an archetypal stolid countenance that made him famous over night, and emphasized the geek in Clark Kent like no other could have done.This is a film that delivers from many aspects, there is romance, there is danger and a lot of retribution.

I have to admit as a kid this was the Superman film I LEAST watched...simply due to the fact that this is the most adult Superman film of the Christopher Reeve 4, Superman III was always my favourite as a kid as it was the first Superman film I had seen. However since getting the Special Edition DVD back in 2001 when I was 21 I fell in love with the film ever since & am VERY please that the new Superman Returns not only pays homage to this classic - but uses it as part of its history too. Reeve to me will ALWAYS be Superman, the idea of using glasses as a disguise is purely Comic-book...but at least Reeve put in the effort to separate the 2 characters & believe it or not at times I was convinced. Margot Kidder was just as strong as Reeve & its obvious she was chosen due to the on-screen chemistry between her & Reeve...it just worked so damn well. Hackman received some criticism over his portrayal of Lex...but c'mon this guy was STILL brutal - willing to kill innocent people just for his own land ??? 1 of them being his sidekicks mother ??? He was excellent & I hope Kevin Spacey builds on this in the new film to show us a warped Lex after serving years in jail. Rest of the cast did absolutely great & helped the film work well. My only slight niggle is the time-travel ending...but even that does not bother me as much as it used to as I just assume he repaired the earthquake before it reached Lois, its only when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen it before that it bothers me as I know I'm gonna get questions fired at me in regards to what he actually did - many fail to realise that it was his ""Love for Lois"" aspect that he disobeyed his father, it wasn't just a case of he did it just to prove he could do it A thoroughly deserved 10/10",Superman

Spiderman II was good with the villains and working out the CGI, but Superman I (and II) have it all; excellent wire work. Excellent camera angles that make you think Superman actually is flying off into the night. Acting? Excellent! Christopher Reeves' transformation from Clark Kent to Superman is believable; you cannot look at Clark and think anything other than ""nice guy...but a nerd"". DC revamped the character to make Clark an ex-athlete etc. and I always thought that was a cop-out. To make the ""disguise"" work, Clark has to be the opposite of Superman, and Reeves pulls this off to a T. Margot Kidder as Lois is what you want; not some flashy ""Hottie"" that cannot act; instead she's good looking but fiercely independent.Effects; what can be said? This film was shot in 1970's, so you don't have too much other than wire work and models; but what they have to work with they used to the utmost. The scene where Superman first appears...classic! He turns into Superman (love the glancing at the ""new"" phonebooth...remember those?...without the doors) and flies up the side of the Daily Planet and catches Lois (""Don't worry, I've got you."" says Supes...Lois-""You've got me? Who's got you?"") and then catches a helicopter...all with news reporters below (""I can't believe it...he caught her."") as if it really happened.

Zack Snyder is in the same boat. He onto a loser straight away with the mainstream Superman fans. His previous work leaves a lot to be desired and his decision to ditch the John Williams score which is an integral part of the Superman franchise is ludicrous. Like Indy or Star Wars without their themes..! Regarding the original Superman, there really isn't much left to be said about how good this film is. Despite being over 30 years old, it still holds up and is a film I can watch tirelessly. It has personality, charisma, great acting from all leads and some superb set-pieces. Who can ever forget the first time Clark Kent changes into Superman in a revolving door to catch Loius Lane and the helicopter. That has to be one of the most iconic moments in movie history.The film is full of little surprises and nice touches all the way through. There are the odd let downs. Making Clark Kent a bit too much of a tool is one and the time paradox at the end (even though it is a good ending) is another but they are seriously small niggles to an almost flawless comic book adaption.

When I saw it for the first time when it premiered in 1978, I was blown away. But I didn't have the wit or skill at the time to write how I felt about the film. I do now. And while I will keep this short and sweet, I'm can say that what I felt then I still feel now. Without question. For the truth is eternal! SUPERMAN (1978) is a unique movie in many respects and not just as an exceptional superhero flick. It is, of course, the first epic superhero movie with amazing special effects and action sequences. But it may be the ultimate movie about goodness--especially about doing goodness. For the protagonist is more than just an hero or superhero. He is someone totally dedicated to doing goodness and making the world a better place for everyone. Hand in hand with this is his purpose to battle and defeat evil and defend and enact justice. But mainly, his life and his whole purpose for living is to do goodness. And this is what the whole persona of Superman was and is. I think Richard Donner the director pulled it off splendidly and kept true to the original story and persona of Superman. Add to all this a magnificent musical score, an unbelievable cast of A-1 actors and well-acted roles, and superb dialog and an amazing story (amazing screenplay, really!), you have what is now and will be always considered a classic of its kind. There may be a few superhero movies better in any one or two of these categories of film and storytelling. But no other superhero movie is superior overall or in more than two categories, in my opinion. The movie also has the perfect mix of drama, pathos, sadness, humor, action, romance, and inspiration. It should have won movie of the year at the Oscars, and several other awards. The movie is iconoclastic and inimitable. It makes you feel good inside to experience it and watch it. It inspires people not only to feel good but to do good. And this makes it a work of art and of everlasting redeeming value. Like the persona of its titled hero, it made and makes the world a better place. So this superhero movie is still the most super of them all!",Superman

Krypton explodes in a fireball with its only survivor headed for his new home. The ship crashes in 1950's Kansas,where the Kents,a elderly couple,discover the baby and bring him up as Clark Kent. The second part has Clark during his high-school days discovering his awesome powers like super-speed,when he races a speeding train,and strength, when he kicks a football into outer space. When his earth dad passes on, he gets a green crystal from his ship hidden in the barn and makes a trek to the North Pole. He throws the crystal into a snowbank,where it becomes the Fortress of Solitude.Inside the fortress, crystals with his father's image inform him of his Kryptonian past and his powers.

Superman goes underground to plug up the fault,then races around saving people from certain doom. But he doesn't save that special someone in time, as Lois Lane gets killed in a rockslide. Heartbroken,he flies into outer space, defying his father Jor-El's order not to interfere with human events.

I recently bought it on DVD and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it and how well it has stood the test of time. Special effects and cinematography age much better when viewed in the wide-screen format.One unusual thing that I think adds to the success of the movie is that it is aimed more at adults than children. I remember as a boy of twelve being frustrated by how long the story takes to develop. After all Superman in his costume is not shown until more than fifty minutes into the movie and then only for a brief moment. It takes another fifteen minutes introducing Clark Kent to The Daily Planet before we get a full scene of Superman fighting for Truth, Justice and The American Way. Then the story becomes a romance between Lois and Superman. As Eric mentioned, only the parts dealing with Lex Luthor are truly aimed at children. All of these things, along with the great supporting cast and a truly remarkable, career-making performance by Christopher Reeve, elevate it above the superhero genre to the level of classic movie.Whereas as a child I waited impatiently for Superman to fly through the air, now I enjoy the beginning hour of the movie more. The background on Krypton dealing with his father Jor-El (Marlon Brando always seemed like he was from another planet anyway), and the section where his Earth parents adopt him, and his frustrating teenage years are interesting and well done.The modern day story of Superman in the Big Apple doesn't disappoint either.

Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder. Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter. Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard. Marc McClure, Terence Stamp. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty. which was released on December 15, 1978. The film starts with a long boring prequel about Jor-El attempting to convince the Ruling Council that Krypton is due to explode, seeing that he fails. he leaves to his home and sends Kal-El to Earth from Krypton as it explodes, ensuring the baby's survival. the infant Kal-El lands three years later in Smallville, Kansas. where he is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, they take Kal-El back to their home and rename him Clark Kent. flaunting his powers, he beats Lana and the guys who bully him to the punch and arrives before them (to where, I don't know. nor do I care). as Jonathan watches on, shortly after on, Clark's dad suffers a heart attack and dies in the most ridiculous way ever. Clark receives a psychic call and goes to the farm, where he finds a green glowing crystal. and decides to leave for the Arctic, where he throws the crystal into the distance and watches as it builds the Fortress of Solitude. after 12 years of education, Kal-El leaves the Fortress with his powers fully developed. and this is where the stupidity starts, as he is hired at the Daily Planet while meeting Lois Lane. Clark develops romantic feelings for her, but Lois sees him as awkward and unsophisticated. Clark makes his public debut as Superman while saving Lane from a helicopter accident, he later performs several more rescues (such as saving Air Force One from crashing) and thwarting a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building with suction cups. intervening in a police chase where most of the robbers escape through a cabin cruiser, and rescues a little girl's cat from a tree. making Kal-El a celebrity known as the caped wonder, he then visits Lois at her home and takes her for a flight. and lets Lois interview him, after-which she names him Superman. In the mean-time, self dubbed criminal mastermind Lex Luthor has developed a stupid plan to earn a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert lands, also diverting nuclear missile test flight to the San Andreas Fault. which will cause California to sink and have an earth-quake happen, while leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast of the United States. which will greatly increase it's value. Otis accidentally redirects the the first missile to the wrong destination, which forces Lex and Eve Teschmacher to delay a second missile. unfortunately, the stupid plan works (second time's a charm) and Eve manages to change the course of the second missile while the military proves they are idiots as they are distracted by Luthor's roadblocks. Superman is lured to Lex's underground lair and is exposed to a Kryptonite ""necklace"", which is placed upon Kal-El's neck (Clark, are you an idiot?) and he is left to drown. Luthor taunts him, knowing that even Superman can't stop two missiles and reveals the second one is heading to Hackensack, New Jeresey. which horrifies Eve Teschmacher, as her mother lives there. prompting Lex's assistant to save Superman, knowing he will try his best to save her mother and deal with the New Jeresey missile first. but the first one arrives to it's destination and the San Andreas Fault, which makes it start collapsing. he is able to mitigate the effects of the nuclear explosion, ""unfortunately"" Lois's car falls into a crevice. it quickly fills with dirt and debris, causing her to suffocate to death. Superman arrives only to find out Lois is dead, angry at his failure. he does the most idiotic thing he can do, he reverses time. saving Lois and altering history, preventing her car from getting caught in the aftershock. as if it will prevent the second missile from causing the San Andreas Fault to collapse again, and surprise surprise. it does. He delivers Luthor and Otis to prison before flying off into space in search of more adventures. So this is Superman: The Movie, and to be frank. it's completely terrible, it's bad. Christopher Reeve is completely miscast in the main role, forcing Brando to carry most of the movie on his shoulders. and the effects are horrible, even for 1978. the score is bad and pretentious. Simply put, I can't understand why people praise and love this horrible movie. it gets one star.",Superman
499,rpeisher2,I can watch this movie over and over,10,18 September 2007,"I was 10 years old when this movie was released and was fortunate enough to have parents that would take me to the movies on a regular basis. Superman the Movie is was a great movie going experience. There are very few things that stand out in my childhood as much as going to the movies. Superman was one of them... Christopher Reeves was the cherry on the top of such a well acted and directed movie. Richard Donner's direction was absolutely brilliant. The tag line ""You can believe a man can fly"" is perfect. It would have been great to see a movie like this made today with all the same actor in place at the same age. I hope then new Superman movie (Sequal)can do justice to a once proud movie series.",Superman

501,godsprincess-62619,Watched it again,8,8 October 2015,"I recently just watched Superman again for a class and I must say, IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MAN OF STEEL! I thought the characters were more memorable, the story line was better and it was just better overall. Of course the special effects weren't as good as the newest one, but that's pretty obvious, what with all the technology we have now. However, when I watched Man of Steel, I remember being bored through a lot of it. When I watched Superman I wasn't. It didn't matter how cheesy it seems now, it was still a good story and it was wonderfully entertaining. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially people interested in classics.",Superman
502,joshuaraymond-20315,What a good choice!,10,8 October 2015,"Sent to earth from the planet Krypton, Kal-El was sent from his parents in order to survive the destruction of their planet. Renamed Clark Kent, he grows up always feeling different due to the magnificent abilities he had, flying, x-ray vision, super speed, and incredible strength. Once a man Clark finds a layer from his dad to discover his history, gaining the confidence to protect the people of earth from danger. Clark while wearing the suit from his home planet is called Superman to hide his identity to keep him and his loved ones safe. With Superman's love for Lois Lane being his only weakness other than kryptonite (only found on his planet that was destroyed), he has to keep his identity sacred in order to protect her. With crime rates rising and the need for Superman's help becomes needed, Superman must choose between saving the world, and saving his love. Considering the release date i give Superman a 10/10. The movie is filled with a good story line as well as believable acting and impressive special effects. Superman holds a lot of good morals such as the importance of helping others when you have the opportunity, and doing the right thing. Something the movie could have done better was to put the credits at the end of the movie, during the beginning it get's a little too long waiting for the movie to start.",Superman
503,jacatl,A must see in today's comic book movie maturation and popularity.,9,9 February 2021,"I saw this in a theater in 1978. I loved it. It didn't take itself too seriously yet was still engaging and emotional. You must see this, this is where comic book movies proved that they could succeed. Side note, to this day the best opening credits ever. And they have done a lot of good ones since 1978.",Superman
504,nicaemberv,A Timeless Superhero Classic,10,3 April 2016,"In the past, I've asked some of my friends, simply out of curiosity, if they preferred Superman or Man of Steel. Now, coming from a group of teenagers, their response was unanimous - Man of Steel seemed to be the better film adaptation. When I heard their response, I was in shock. How could they choose Man of Steel over a timeless superhero classic that spawned the trend of superhero films? When I asked why they chose Man of Steel over Superman, their response was simple: Man of Steel was more modern. One of my friends, who I'll just call ""Mark"", said that although Superman's effects were good for it's time period, Man of Steel's effects are a lot more better. Okay, I guess I could kind of understand. But the thing I couldn't quite fully comprehend was when when I asked the question, ""is Christopher Reeve the better Superman? Or is Henry Cavill the better Superman?"" My friends' answers were mixed. One chose Reeve, while my other two friends chose Cavill. Why? Because Cavill portrayed the modern version of Superman. In my opinion, ""modern"" doesn't matter in a film. All that really matters is the content that is in a film. I mean, I could watch a 2016 reboot of Back to the Future (which is a very scary thought) and still choose the original film over that one. Why? Because the original Back to the Future simply had better content. Same with Superman. I like it not so much because of the effects, or how modern it was, but rather, because of the lighthearted humor, the dreamy romance between Superman and Lois, and the life lessons that the film taught. Christopher Reeve showed an incredible amount of charisma and bravery while portraying Superman, which was one of the many ways Superman became a popular film. I mean, Henry Cavill didn't do too bad, for I admire the seriousness he presented to superhero role, but I feel like Reeve had that special charm than wins me over. Sure Man of Steel had the flashy modern effects and so forth, but Superman had the heartwarming theme. Remember, it's not the outside that counts. It's the inside that makes all the difference.",Superman
505,lorddarthhiltu,one and only good superhero movie what is ever make.,10,16 September 2005,"this movie had fantastic cast,and most of all they found great actor how can do two different types of acting Clark/superman ""Christopher reeve"" and he also looked so real as superman like he just jumped out of the comics. But most awful superman actors in my opinion is George reeve and kirk alyn, they never catch what reeve did, reeve was handsome, alyn and reeves both guys so dame ugly they never be cast in superman the movie, if them as same age what was reeve in 1978. God pless this movie and real superhero and real life hero Christopher reeve, may his soul rest in peace. And the end i must say i want see his son will someday acting superman, then they will be able filming real SUPERMAN RETURNS.",Superman
506,dreamerme,Superman the Movie is Superman the Great,10,5 December 2005,"I have seen all four movies with Christopher Reeves more than I can count. And even though I am a big fan of the comic book hero and the movies made of him, I am more a fan of good and great movies. And I must say that Superman the Movie is one of the greatest movies ever made. I am commenting about the original release which was released on DVD. The movie's story was complete and whole. The story was much of the reason to see it as was the characters. And not many movies have done that when it comes to comic book or book adaptations. I get the same feeling that I did the first time I saw every time I do. I look and listen for new things every time I see it. Movies that spark your imagination are the ones worth cherishing. There will never be another Christopher Reeves, which even with Brandon Routhe casted, Christopher is still the greatest Superman ever.",Superman

508,emtwarrior,The greatest superhero with the most epic origin story gets a suitably epic treatment.,10,31 December 2005,"Richard Donner gives us virtually a three act story of how the last son of the dying planet Krypton became the Earth's greatest hero. The late Christopher Reeve was the first to actually flesh out and play the double Clark Kent/Superman role as two separate personas, one a clumsy nerd the other a stalwart hero. Thrown in a truly great ensemble cast including Marlon Brando,Gene Hackman,Glen Ford,Jackie Cooper and Ned Beatty.And the visual effects that were truly groundbreaking at the time still hold up well to this very day. This movie is definitely worth your time. Watch this movie and see the great American myth transformed into a classic film. You will believe a man can fly!",Superman

510,sadafhrx,best superhero movie of all time.,10,29 September 2020,"The movie that represented a superhero perfectly. It is able to understand every characters. Best superhero casting choice ever. Every artists had done their job perfectly. Beginning from Marlon Brando as Jor-el and Susannah York as Lara-el to the kent family was fantastic, gene hackman played the character Lex Luthor was absolutely brilliant (he is a true legend as an actor). Vfx, editing was fantastic (still looks like so real) in the movie. Music composer who's music compose was like the music speaks the story the best superhero music ever I can say the background score which makes me feel goosebumps. Director Richard Donner proved that the greatest director ever. Writer Mario Puzo and his team in screenplay made the story and script was like they reborn this superman character and his origin story after Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Superman was the biggest blockbuster film of that year. It was the movie that made a highest business of warner. Superman 1978 is the best superhero movie of all time.",Superman
