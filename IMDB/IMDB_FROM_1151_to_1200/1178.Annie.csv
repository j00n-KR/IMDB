0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the most underrated movie musicals!,9,5 February 2009,"The criticisms for Annie have been unfair I feel, then again maybe there's some bias as it was one of my absolute favourites as a kid and still is. There have been worse musicals before and since, as well as better admittedly(Wizard of Oz, Singin' in the Rain, West Side Story), High School Musical movies anyone, as well as The Wiz, Mame and A Chorus Line for examples? As for Aileen Quinn, she isn't ginger! She was wearing a wig, plus Annie has red hair! And she was about 10 years old, when she did this movie, and in my opinion she had a fantastic singing voice for her age, and she is an appealing and spunky actress. Albert Finney is just wonderful as Daddy Warbucks, with his gruff voice, and his slow transformation from stern to heartfelt.. it was totally believable. The locket scene was very moving. Broadway diva Ann Reinking was a lovely Grace Farrell(just look at her dancing in ""We Got Annie""), and I liked her voice very much. Sometimes though, it was hidden over the highest voices especially in ""I'm think i'm Gonna Like It Here"". But to be fair, the arrangements are always done to the abilities of the singers. Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry had a little less to do, but they were excellent in their villainous roles, and their rendition of ""Easy Street"" was wonderful. Carol Burnett was fantastic in this movie, making Miss Hannigan as nasty as humanly possible, and performance-wise steals the film. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted throughout and Burnett has the best lines, she sings and acts the heck out of ""Little Girls"". The servants did well too, though I don't know any of their names, though Geoffrey Holder was a delight as Punjab. The orphans are delightful, especially Toni Ann Gisondi as Molly, she was so cute, who put rare energy into ""Hard Knock Life"", and ""Without a smile."" I was really impressed with the performances. The songs are just marvellous, even the ones added to the movie(especially ""Sign""), except for ""Dumb Dog"", very forgettable and pointless. I have seen the stage play,(my sister Kathryn played Molly) and enjoyed it as well, though the movie should stand on its own and that's what people seem to not take into account. The 1999 film was good if too short and sugary sweet, but while this may seem like blasphemy I've always considered this the better film, more faithful doesn't always mean better you know. The wonderful title song ""Tommorow!"" played over the title credits, and there was a reprise in the white house, which is one of my favourite scenes. But it showed in her face that Aileen Quinn preferred ""Maybe."" ""Let's Go to the movies"" surprisingly worked on its own merits. It looked lovely with some nice movie star references, and the production values in the entire film are fabulous, glitzy and evocative. But the best element of the movie along with Burnett and the songs was the choreography by the immensely talented Arlene Phillips. I disagree that it was overblown, as a matter of fact it worked amazingly well. The only real criticisms I have with Annie, is that I agree that John Huston was the wrong director, I felt his heart wasn't really in it and his inexperience in the musical genre did show somewhat and while nail-biting the climax was a little contrived, but the performances, songs and choreography completely overshadowed them. Fantastic. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Annie
1,bkoganbing,The oldest orphan in the world,6,7 January 2016,"Little Orphan Annie as a comic strip ran for 86 years from 1924 to 2010 until 1968 under its original creator Harold Gray. Quite a bit is left out when you read a list of Annie's adventures in that period. But the film Annie captures the essence of what she was about. One thing though she never grew up staying a plucky and resourceful orphan with her benefactor Daddy Warbucks the Howard Hughes of the funny papers who had endless money. Young Aileen Quinn is our Annie and Daddy Warbucks is Albert Finney. The film is an adaption of the Broadway Musical that ran for six years and 2377 performances. It hadn't even finished it's Broadway run when the film came out. The film plot concerns Daddy Warbucks inviting a selected orphan out to the fabulous Warbucks estate and Annie gets to be the lucky girl. She gets to him with her innocent charm and plucky attitude.But the mean woman who runs the orphanage who is played with delicious panache by Carol Burnett wants to exploit the situation to her own advantage. Burnett enlists her conman brother Tim Curry and his wife Bernadette Peters. What they do and how Annie triumphs over all is for you to see the film.I'm not sure John Huston was the right choice to direct this, but Busby Berkeley was not available. Probably with a musical or two under his belt Huston might have made a classic. As it is it's not a bad film, just not a great one.In fact this adaption of a cartoon was really perfected by Warren Beatty when he created his Dick Tracy film. That's how you adapt a cartoon as a cartoon to film with live actors.Still Annie got a couple of Oscar nominations for adapted musical score and Art&Set Direction. I wish Burnett had been given recognition when she's on the film really takes off.A good musical with a good adaption for family viewing.",Annie
2,Leofwine_draca,Not a bad musical...,6,10 August 2015,"The songs in this are good, in any case, and that's the important thing about a musical. This is the definitive version of the classic novel in which a young orphan girl is adopted by a wealthy industrialist and forced to learn airs and graces which don't exactly come naturally to her.It's just a pity that so much of the running time consists of Aileen Quinn's histrionic acting as the screeching Annie. This kid can't say a word but instead has to shout everything in that god-awful voice of hers, and I cringed my way through all of her dialogue scenes. Still, as I said, the musical set-pieces are better, having real heart to them, so it's not all bad, and she's a much better singer than she is a speaker.Cast-wise, there's an exemplary turn from the unrecognisable Albert Finney as Warbucks, the benevolent benefactor, alongside stock villainous performances from the likes of Carol Burnett and Tim Curry. Watch out for LIVE AND LET DIE's Geoffrey Holder as the manservant, Punjab.",Annie
3,SnoopyStyle,try-hard Broadway musical,6,9 April 2016,"In the Great Depression, Annie (Aileen Quinn) is a precocious red-haired girl living in a girls' orphanage run by the cruel drunk Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Annie rescues a dog and names him Sandy. Billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Albert Finney) invites an orphan to stay for a week to improve his image. His secretary Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking) picks out Annie. It's a giant mansion with lots of servants. Warbucks is not happy with the orphan not being a boy and the wet dog but he relents. Hannigan's no-good brother Rooster Hannigan (Tim Curry) gets out of jail early and bring over thieving girlfriend Lily St. Regis (Bernadette Peters). Annie wins over the tough Warbucks.There are a couple of really memorable songs. This is a try-hard musical. Outside of those catchy songs, this is a rather flat movie. All the girls are acting big like in a Broadway play. In fact, there is a lot of Broadway acting all around. John Huston's directions are rather old fashion. This is a functional transfer from the stage. I'm not a big fan of this type of acting especially for a two hour movie but little Aileen Quinn doesn't deserve a Razzie. That's a douche move.",Annie
4,Hitchcoc,A Good Version of a Decent Musical,8,30 November 2016,"A good adaptation of a Broadway hit. It features quite good performances by the likes of Albert Finley and Carol Burnett. There are the obligatory production numbers. The two I enjoyed the most were ""It's a Hard Knock LIfe"" and ""I'm Gonna LIke It Here."" Burnett' s Miss Hanagan is a boozing woman who has no moral sense, caring little if her little girls live or die. That's what is at issue in this musical. When Annie, a chronic runaway, somehow gets chosen to be the guest of Oliver Warbucks, it sets things in motion. Just like ""Oliver Twist,"" some see it as an opportunity and some see it as a dog-in-the -manger moment to prevent her from getting her due. Bernadette Peters and the irrepressible Tim Curry are the heavies. In the Broadway musical, the conclusion is not nearly as violent. It keeps our interest and Aileen Quinn is a pretty good Annie, perky and full of optimism.",Annie
5,mark.waltz,The sun will come out when they remake this for television.,5,2 November 2012,"The comic strip little girl finally got eyeballs when a smash hit Broadway musical took the cynics by surprise. But in the hands of a tough men's movie director (John Houston), the results were a lavish spectacular that stole the heart which had made the stage production so memorable. Having just seen the latest NYC production, I confirmed what I recalled of an earlier stage production and multiple viewings of this (three when it was first released) to reflect on what flawed this version. The basic Broadway structure remains with characters from the comic strip thrown in unnecessarily. In the title role, Aileen Quinn is thrown so violently in the viewer's face that it seemed unfair to the young actress. She gives her all in the role, so the fault lies in Houston's hands. Let's sum it up in just saying that even back in the 1930's, Little Orphan Annie was NOT Shirley Temple which is how Quinn is directed to play it.Carol Burnett basically plays Eunice's grandmother here, so the humor is there if not the originality. As Miss Hannigan, she has all the right ingredients, and rips ""Little Girls"" to shreds. But can TV's do-it-all miracle worker do anything wrong? Albert Finney takes on the role of Daddy Warbucks as if it were steak, devouring the role, bone and all. As the sweet Grace Farrell, Ann Reinking seems miscast, and gets to perform the movie's most awkward new song ""We've Got Annie"". In the villain roles, Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters seem slumming, although Curry (who the very same year played Bill Sikes in the very similar ""Oliver Twist"") appropriately plays the role tongue in cheek. Peters' inclusion as the floozie Lily St. Regis just indicates the attempt to make this almost a 2 plus hour long Carol Burnett Show sketch where lots of big name stars are thrown in for something really unworthy of their extensive talents.Burnett, Curry and Peters perform the show-stopping ""Easy Street"" which is filmed so awkwardly (with the camera right on the three as they stare right into it as well as cartoonish visual gags for Burnett) that it lands with a thud. Like the stage production, the other orphans don't come off as overly cute so that is one compensation. The cutting of several prominent songs (most notably ""NYC"") for new ones is another flaw. ""Let's Go to the Movies"" may seem lavish, but unlike ""NYC"", it really serves no other purpose than to remind the viewer that this was a Hollywood project rather than a Broadway one.Changes from the original Broadway production were many, which included the addition of several characters from the comic strip who didn't appear in the original stage version. This included Geoffrey Holder's casting as ""the Asp"" (Daddy Warbuck's chauffeur) whose performance is more cutesy than character driven. He was serviced better in the soda commercials he was doing around this time than the obnoxiously coy material he was given here. The big ""I Think I'm Going to Like It Here!"" seems like something out of Disney's big musicals, so filled with moments that might make adults cringe. Finney, having already proved that he could handle a musical with ""Scrooge"", is excellent as Daddy Warbucks. He's an obvious lovable old curmudgeon who needs something to remind him that he's alive, but unfortunately, Quinn's Annie is too plucky and in your face to really make Warbuck's affections for her realistic.Better as a made for T.V. remake which was just as lavish but far more likable overall, ""Annie"" suffers from striving too hard to be as far from its original Broadway source as it could be. This shows a lack of faith from the creator's part to gage what Hollywood audiences would want in a big movie musical in 1982. Hopefully with a third movie version of this classic having coming out and bombed, the third time will be an end to try and do this again. There are a lot of things to like here, but minor elements of inconsequential details make it a bit of a mess. That, and the film's altered ending for Miss Hannigan's fate, presented rather unbelievably after a badly included sequence with Annie in the hands of the villains where the entire Broadway plot was sent out the window.",Annie
6,gavin6942,A Cartoon Come to Life,6,8 February 2017,"A young orphan girl's adventures in finding a family that will take her.I shouldn't be too harsh on this film. It is something of a modern classic. More people know this film than any other version of it or the comic strip. And the songs ""Tomorrow"" and ""Hard Knock Life"", love them or hate them, are part of popular culture.But there are things that could be improved upon. Tim Curry's character, for example, arrives much too late. An increased presence from him and his mischief-making would be welcome. There is also some question about the character of ""Punjab"". I'm afraid to say anything about him, other than to note that there's no way this character can't be seen as offensive on some level. I mean, what the heck?",Annie
7,lee_eisenberg,"Remember when that woman watched it in ""Serial Mom""?",3,26 April 2006,"What the hell? John Huston was known for classics like ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and ""Moby Dick"". So why this? I probably last saw ""Annie"" when I was six, and now that I know that Carol Burnett, Albert Finney and Tim Curry all starred, maybe that does change things. But a really neat way that they used this movie was in John Waters's suburban satire ""Serial Mom"": in one scene, a woman watches it before...well, just watch the movie. It's sort of like when the title characters in ""Gremlins"" watched ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".All in all, maybe this passes as a cultural reference, but let's not treat it as a masterpiece.",Annie
8,jboothmillard,Annie,5,26 November 2007,"I am really glad I have this movie a second chance, the first time I watched it, I judged it too harshly, yes John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King) was perhaps the wrong director to take on the movie adaptation of the Broadway musical, based on the popular comic strip, but it doesn't matter. Basically, set during the Great Depression, Annie (introducing twice Golden Globe nominated, and Razzie winning and nominated Aileen Quinn) is one of the many orphans looked after by the stressed and hateful Miss Hannigan (Golden Globe nominated Carol Burnett). After Annie gets back from another attempted escape, Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking), who works for billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney), is hoping to find a child to come and live in his mansion for a week, to improve his public image. Annie is the chosen child, but after arriving she is not a favourite with the grouchy master, but she has quickly charmed the hearts of all the staff, and after a while, she eventually connects with Warbucks. But Annie doesn't want to be adopted by Warbucks, because, before leaving her, her parents made a promise to return. So to make Annie happy, Warbucks offers a reward to the people who can come and prove their identity as her parents. This becomes a clever scheme by Hannigan, her brother Rooster (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend Lily St. Regis (Bernadette Peters) pose as her parents to claim the reward for themselves. But the children at the orphanage overheard their plan, including the fact that Miss Hannigan mentioned that she knows Annie's parents are dead, Warbucks and the others find out and go to rescue her. In the end, after the kidnap attempt, Rooster and Regis are arrested for their treachery, Hannigan becomes a reformed woman, and Annie lives happily with her newfound family that she always wanted. Also starring Live and Let Die's Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. Quinn is appealing as the little red-head title character, first time I watched admittedly she got on my nerves, thank goodness she grew on me, Burnett is suited perfectly to the role of the zesty head of the orphanage, and Finney does alright as the bald rich guy that is charmed by the moppet. ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" (which I also enjoy with Jay-Z or Dr. Evil rapping over it) and ""Tomorrow"" are the most memorable songs, the song and dance numbers are all choreographed well, and the costumes and beackgrounds bring the 1930s period to life. It did get mixed reviews and negative award nominations I thought were deserved, the first time I watched, I'm relieved to say I enjoyed it much more the second time, a reasonable and fun musical film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Music for Ralph Burns, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Song for ""Tomorrow"", and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Worth watching!",Annie
9,ccthemovieman-1,"The Good And Bad Of ""Annie""",7,31 March 2006,"This updated version of the famous comic character, ""Li'l Orphan Annie,"" was pretty good and was very good at balancing all three aspects of music, comedy and drama.THE GOOD - Most of the songs are good because Aileen Quinn, as ""Annie,"" is so good. She has the best voice of a girl this young I've heard on film; she's cute and she can act. She is a legitimate Shirley Temple clone.Albert Finney also is enjoyable as ""Daddy Warbucks,"" although he does get a bit too loud at times. The little girls in the orphanage are talented: good singers and dancers. Their song-and-dance numbers are more entertaining than the adult's. Some of the latter's could have been left out, although there is a great Busby Berkeley-type number when the adults and kids all go to the movies. The period - around 1932 - is pretty to view with nice sets. This is a big budget film and it shows....and the ending is nice.THE BAD - Carol Burnett is really annoying to watch, not because she plays the villain but because of her abrasive voice and her pronounced ""G-d"" exclamations. Speaking of the latter, Tim Curry yells out a ""GD"" which has no place in a family film like this. Interesting also to note that, unlike the Temple movies, the only religion given credence here is Buddhism as Geoffrey Holder plays a Buddhist with supernatural powers. Give me a break! This is so typical of today's films. And another with that theme, of course, Democrat Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor are portrayed as extremely caring, wonderful people while Finney is the gruff Republican.OVERALL - Quinn and Finney are so good that they far outweigh Burnett's negative traits and make this a good film to own.",Annie
10,moonspinner55,"""Why any kid would want to be an orphan is beyond me...""",4,26 March 2010,"Depression-era youngster, a red-headed, freckle-faced tot who rules the roost at a New York orphanage for girls, is the lucky child picked to spend a week in the mansion of billionaire Oliver Warbucks; tippling Miss Hannigan, the child-hating headmistress of the orphanage, schemes to get even. Based on the long-running, Tony-winning Broadway musical, inspired by the popular comic strip ""Little Orphan Annie"", this rambunctious family film is a bit too self-conscious to be much fun: everyone has one eye on the camera, all the while singing and gesturing to the back rows. Newcomer Aileen Quinn is overly-inspired in the lead; she has a sincere little face, but nothing Quinn does--not even running down the street to get away from a policeman--feels natural. Her reactions (like those of her dog, Sandy) seem prompted from somebody just out of camera range. Quinn is hardly an orphaned girl of the Depression...she's more like an orphaned kid from a TV sitcom (you almost expect her to pop up in a poker game). Several of the grown-ups fare much better than the poorly-cast children, with Carol Burnett single-handedly making the picture tolerable as the boozy, man-hungry Hannigan. Otherwise, the choreography is messy, the script unsurprising and unfunny, and John Huston's direction is sadly lethargic. ** from ****",Annie
11,sunwarrior13,Annie Succeeds In Providing Entertainment And Enjoyment,8,3 November 2016,"In 1982,a film adaptation from the Broadway musical ""Annie"" by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan was released on the movie screen.It was based on the 1924 comic strip Little Orphan Annie.It stars Albert Finney,Carol Burnett,Bernadette Peters,Ann Reinking,Tim Curry,Geoffrey Holder,Edward Herrmann and the young Aileen Quinn as Annie.This tells the story of a young orphan that was taken by the richest man in America,the billionaire Oliver Warbucks.Set during The Great Depression,an orphan named Annie is the voice of hope among the other orphans who live under the supervision of the drunken Miss Hannigan.She always believe that her parents are going to come back for her one day.Then,the orphanage was visited by Grace Farrell,the personal secretary of the conservative politician Oliver Warbucks.To help Mr Warbucks' image among the people,Annie was brought by Grace to the Warbucks estate for a weeklong visit.The orphan's positive attitude towards life wins the hearts of the people in the estate from the servants and politicians alike.She eventually finds herself singing the song of hope ""Tomorrow"" to President Roosevelt.A search for her parents was conducted which created an opportunity for a few people - Miss Hannigan,Rooster and Lily - to scam some money that placed Annie in great danger.Well,Annie isn't really one perfect movie.But nevertheless,it was fun,enjoyable and entertaining.The songs like ""Tomorrow"" was definitely fun to listen to.The dance numbers were pleasant as well. This is one family movie that a lot of people will enjoy.No question about it if only they will look over the particulars which would lessen their enjoyment like an unrealistic story especially with Annie's adventures inside the Warbucks estate and the lack of explanation of her extremely positive attitude in life despite growing up in an orphanage with the hope of seeing her parents.But overall,it truly succeeds if its objective is to allow viewers to enjoy.Definitely, Aileen Quinn as little Annie shines for she is definitely charming!!!!",Annie
12,Doylenf,Overblown musical lacks a dazzling score...,6,17 October 2006,"ANNIE is about the world's most famous comic strip orphan, who finds herself in Miss Hannigan's (CAROL BURNETT) Hudson Street orphanage where the gin-soaked headmistress is full of one-liners like ""Why any kid would want to be an orphan, I don't know!"" And Carol is just what this musical, directed by John Huston, needs. She brightens every moment with her winning presence in a sometimes hilarious role. As her cohorts, BERNADETTE PETERS and TIM CURRY are not far behind.Annie is rescued from the clutches of Miss Hannigan by Daddy Warbucks (a bald-headed ALBERT FINNEY), who, unfortunately, has some of the show's weakest songs. It's while Annie's at the orphanage that she and the kids bust out in the show's best number, ""The Hard Knocks Life"". But the trouble is none of the other songs are substantial enough to give the musical elements the lift they need.John Huston is a curious choice as director, but he does get good performances from his entire cast, including AILEEN QUINN as the moppet with the big voice whose tremulous rendition of ""Tomorrow"" becomes almost an anthem when she sings it at the White House for F.D.R.Summing up: Overblown, overlong stage musical turned into a less than spectacular success on screen.",Annie
13,CinemaSerf,"A bit too long, but easily the best screen adaptation of the Strouse/Charnin musical.",7,30 March 2020,"Carol Burnett is wonderful as the conniving, neglectful manager of the orphanage (""Miss Hannigan"") who cares not a jot for her charges and treats them like skivvies whilst she drinks//smokes and generally misbehaves her way through life. One day, multi-gazillionaire ""Oliver 'Daddy' Warbucks"" (Albert Finney) decides to allow an orphan to spend some time with him at his mansion and ""Annie"" (Aileen Quinn) is the winner of this golden ticket. Quickly, she charms the pants off them all - including the hard-hearted industrialist. When he decides to help her find her long lost parents by offering a reward ""Hannigan"" scents an opportunity and gets her equally dodgy brother ""Rooster"" (Tim Curry) and his delinquent girlfriend to fake parenthood, claim the reward - and kidnap the girl! The story is a bit strained at times, but it does have some fun dance routines; ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow"" & ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" and also a superbly statuesque Geoffrey Holder as ""Warbucks"" Indian equivalent of ""Oddjob"" to help it over the odd bumps of tedium. Messrs. Finney & Curry very much enter into the spirit of it all and Quinn captures the vulnerability/feistiness of the title character charmingly.",Annie
14,evanston_dad,Did John Huston Lose a Bet?,1,29 January 2008,"What possessed John Huston to make a film version of the popular stage musical in the first place is beyond me, but if he was going to bother to make it, what possessed him to make such a gormless, clunky mess of it is inexplicable.""Annie"" is simply dreadful. It has none of the movement and flow a musical should have, much of the score has been altered for the worse, and it's completely lacking in charm. A talented cast led by Carol Burnett and Albert Finney(!) do what they can, which is very little with Huston fighting them every step of the way.Grade: F",Annie
15,Aaron1375,"I hope the sun doesn't come out tomorrow, I hope it will be cloudy with rain.",2,27 February 2010,"I do not like musicals, I have always made a point to say this before any review I do on musicals. This one though is very annoying as it is performed by some of the worst voiced singers you will ever hear. After watching this one has to wonder, ""do they audition any of the people they hire for these movies""? I only give this movie a two because I somewhat enjoyed Carol Burnette's over the top character and Albert Finney does a somewhat good job as Daddy Warbucks at the start of the film, his performance gets a bit to sappy near the end. The story has a girl who is taken in by a rich man, well not really by him so much as his secretary. A girl that can beat up the boys, because for some reason girls can always beat up boys in the movies, yet in real life us guys have to do all the heavy lifting at work, go figure. Plenty of awful musical scenes await us as she is welcomed into this new home by the staff and soon melts the heart of Warbucks who must have fallen in love at first site with that horrible hair our little Annie has. Then the film turns into a search for her real parents and a sinister plot by a couple of people who think they can turn a buck when Warbucks offers a reward for finding Annie's real parents. I sat through this movie once as a child and it will be the only time I sit through this overly sappy horribly sung movie.",Annie
16,cricketbat,Annie is endlessly endearing.,8,30 June 2021,"Annie is endlessly endearing. Aileen Quinn is spunky & adorable as the title character while Carol Burnett is an unforgettably hilarious mess as Miss Hannigan.

17,Bored_Dragon,I was sure it was Disney,8,23 February 2018,"I was honestly surprised to learn that ""Annie"" is not a Disney movie. So I watched it again after many years and again I was under the impression that I was watching Disney. Anyway, this is a movie adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, which is based on the comic book ""Little Orphan Annie"" from 1924. Critics weren't nice to it and ratings on movie sites are quite offensive, but it had two Oscar nominations and was 10th highest grossing movie of 1982.Annie is ten-year-old orphan girl, with good heart and smile in spite of cruel circumstances she lives in, who gets a chance to spend a week in the home of billionaire. Good acting, great songs and dancing and exciting adventures, under the baton of John Houston. Rarely cheerful and positive movie, to which I can not give less than<3 8/10 <3",Annie
18,ironhorse_iv,"Leapin Lizards! This movie was pretty OK. I hope the sun will come out, tomorrow and give us a better version. It's a Hard Knock Life for us.",6,8 November 2013,"Annie is a pretty good movie, I have to say. Still, it's not as good as the Broadway musical, by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan which in turn, is based on Little Orphan Annie, the 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray which in turn, was originally a poem by James Whitcomb Riley. The reasons for this was a few changes. The film add a lot of new songs, and replace others. While, at the same time, adding more comical campy elements to the film that musical lovers didn't like. Such as adding a few outlandish characters from the comic strip back in the musical version like Punjab and the Asp. The comic strip was more adventure series, while the musical is a bit too political with the commentary, that kinda stray from the story of Annie and more about how depressing the Great Depression was. So I kinda like this film version as it mixed both of them. The film is about the story of Annie (Aileen Quinn) who is a mischievous orphan from New York City who is taken in for the weekend by America's richest billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) who is trying to improve his image. At first, Mr. Warbucks didn't want the child, wanting a boy, but she grew on him to the point, that he wanted to adopt the child from the cruel alcoholic orphanage's supervisor Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Instead, Miss Hannigan wasn't going to do that, seeking fortune. She plan out to trick Warbucks, by having her con-brother, Rooster (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend, Lily (Bernadette Peters) pose as Annie's parents to get the reward money. All the actors did great in their roles. I know a lot of people were getting anger at Aileen Quinn as Annie for being too cute, but I thought she did pretty OK. At less, she wasn't as annoying as the 'Oh my Goodness' girl. Drew Barrymore almost got the role, and I can see her maybe pulling it off, but her suppose co-star, Jack Nicolson as Daddy Warbucks. No, I don't see him in the role at all. I have to say, Albert Finney fits the role despite not being a good singer. I'm just glad, he barely sung in the movie. I don't see him, pulling off 'Something is missing' song. Thank goodness, that song was cut from the film. 'Sign' is so far the worst song in the movie as it's seem like Warbucks knew about Miss Hannigan's cruelty to the girls, but just blackmail her to give Annie up. I always found that scene, disturbing. I thought, if he knew that abuse was going on. He should had call the police on her. In my opinion, Carol Burnett and Tim Curry make the movie, watchable. ""East Street' and 'Little Girls"" were great villain songs. Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell was OK, but most of her songs were pretty mediocre. I didn't like 'We got Annie' one bit and 'I think I would like it here' is cheesy. It did show her dancing skills, but it was just not needed. I have to say for the film to replace the 'NYC"" song with ""Let's go to the Movies' was a bad mistake. ''NYC"" help set the settling of the story so well, while 'Let's go to the movies' just doesn't fit in with the movie. The movie wasted scenes of them watching another movie. It was so annoying. By far, the worst thing, the movie did is move the 'tomorrow' song later in the film to a scene that should had been cut from the film when they visit the president at the White House. Honestly, did we really need to see the president? I didn't like how the film turn the song from Annie's hope for a better future, into a political statement. I know the original musical had ""We'd like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover"" and 'New Deal for Christmas', but I thought it was good idea to cut those songs from the film. I really don't think people would like to hear songs about how poor, people are, and see Annie getting spoil by a rich war drumming millionaire. It would make Daddy Warbucks seem unlikable to the common people watching the film. The scene where 'tomorrow' was supposed to play was replace with mean-spirited songs about a dog. I really didn't think Sandy the dog needed a song. Thank Goodness, they cut the songs 'You wouldn't be an orphan too long'. I really don't see a song about J. Edgar helping the story much. I did like how the film, reprised 'Maybe' throughout the film. It really set the mood of the story and plot. By far, my favorite songs are 'it's a hard knock life' and 'we've never fully dress without a smile'. Both are the extreme ends of each other, while 'Tomorrow' seem to be the balance to the film. While, 1999's Annie was a little bit better, I think director John Huston gave us a pretty okay movie. At less, it's better than Annie: A Royal Adventure! (1995). Yes, there were some major differences between the stage musical and this film version by John Huston, but overall: no matter, if it's Christmas or Fourth of July, rich or poor, watching Annie is a joy!",Annie

20,didi-5,sparky musical for kids,4,18 December 2004,"'Annie' sees flame-haired Aileen Quinn play the title role, a cute Shirley Temple type who brings joy into the hearts of all she meets; eventually thawing the heart of the cold capitalist millionaire 'Daddy' Warbucks (Albert Finney in one of his best roles).As a musical though it is only good in fits and starts - there's the overblown 'Let's Go The The Movies' production number, with suited attendants at Radio City Music Hall and finishing with a quick précis showing of Garbo's 'Camille'. There's the joyous 'We Got Annie', led by Ann Reinking singing and dancing as Grace and involving all the servants. There the standard orphanage song (this time 'It's A Hard Knock Life' rather than Oliver's 'Food Glorious Food'). And of course there is little Annie's best-known tune, 'The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow'. But there's also a lot of syrupy sweetness which soon becomes hard to swallow.Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, and the gloriously OTT Carol Burnett (as orphanage matron Miss Hannigan)are the villains of the piece, and are OK in a pantomime way. And the little girls are pretty good.'Annie' is a second-string musical which now looks tired and runs for far too long.",Annie
21,matthewssilverhammer,The Good Annie,8,9 August 2017,"The original Annie film is a giant pile of sentimental crap...and I love every second of it. Unlike the 2014 remake (No, Cameron Diaz! No!), it captures the Broadway show by letting the scenes play out naturally, on a big scale, with lots of cast members and tons of fun choreography. And it's all just plain fun; funny (getting rid of bomb), well-toned (Burnett is wonderfully awful), bubbly (singing with President), and affecting (I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!).",Annie
22,lisafordeay,An enjoyable childhood classic,6,20 February 2019,"Annie is a 1982 musical starring Aileen Quinn and the late Albert Finney and tells the story of a young orphan named Annie played by Aileen Quinn who lives at the orphanage owned by Miss Hannigan. But when a woman is looking for an orphan to bring to see Mr Warbucks played by Albert Finney,Annie is chosen and spends a week with Mr Warbucks. But will Annie melt Mr Warbucks heart?
Overall this is a great film and I was surprised that it won a Razzie for worst actor and nominated for worst film. Sure the songs are great and some are forgettable but I still liked this film.Also stars Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as Rooster and his girlfriend who pretend to be Annie's parents by conning Mr Warbucks (even though Annie's parents died years ago).6/10

23,weezeralfalfa,"""Leapin' Lizards"": It's Shirley Temple all over again: sort of.",8,13 July 2020,"There are various obvious similarities between Annie, as here characterized, and a typical Shirley Temple, in her juvenile films, as well as a few differences. Not that the S.T. films were necessarily a model for constructing the screen play for ""Annie"". Most of the main characters for ""Annie"" were taken from the ""Little Orphan Annie"" comic strip, which began in the mid-20s, whereas S.T. films didn't begin until the mid-30s. Thus, we might wonder if the typical screen play of S.T. films wasn't lifted from the Annie comics or the 1932 film ""Little Orphan Annie""!..........The first difference we notice between ""Annie"" and S. T. films is that the latter were filmed in B&W vs. the color of ""Annie"". Of course, most S.T. films have since been released in a colorized form, reducing the significance of this difference. While both are cute, and have strongly curly hair, Annie's is appropriately red(actually orange), whereas Shirley's is brown, when colorized. ........Shirley's juvenile films were all released in the 1930s. Likewise, ""Annie"" was also clearly set in the '30s, increasing the impression that ""Annie"" was modeled after the S.T. films. In most Shirley films, she has little or nothing to do with other kids, at least, for most of the film. While Annie interacts with the orphans in the first part of the film, thereafter she pretty much only interacts with adults. Shirley usually had a bossy or grumpy older adult to interact with, as least, for part of the time. Likewise Annie had to endure bossy, demented, Miss Hannigan(Carol Burnett) while at the orphanage. Shirley usually made friends with, and sometimes was adopted by, an older man or sometimes couple. Likewise, Annie made friends with old Mr. Warbucks(Albert Finney), who adopted her, as well as with his private secretary(and lover?) Grace Farrell(Ann Reinking).........Both girls at least sometimes sang and/or danced, although not in all S.T. films, and Annie sang much more than Shirley, as, unlike S.T. films, ""Annie"" was billed as a musical, with Annie doing most of the singing and some of the dancing. Annie even did a bit of tapdancing, which was Shirley's forte..........Yes, Annie and Shirley had lots of things in common. But the film ""Annie"", was , in various ways, more elaborate, as well as 30min. longer than the typical S.T. film. It cost a good deal more to make than S.T. films, and barely turned a profit the first year.......... While Shirley was younger than 10 in most of her films, Annie was 10, and thus had a better singing voice, if still clearly 'girly'. ............I found the first part of ""Annie"", where Annie interacts with the other orphans, more interesting than the remainder of the film......... Shirley never encountered someone as demented as Miss Hannagan. I'm sure viewer reactions to Miss Hannigan vary from amusement to disdain. My reaction similarly varied across this spectrum.............Why couldn't they find a real East Indian to play Punjab? It was obvious that Punjab was being played by an African American!",Annie
24,GOWBTW,Fun for the whole family!,10,9 November 2006,"I'm very familiar with the Broadway hit ""Annie"". And I'm also familiar with the songs in it as well. When I first saw this movie, it was wonderful. Set back in the 1930's New York, here you have an orphanage for girls and Annie(Aileen Quinn) is sent there when her parents come to get her later. The girls are full of high spirits despite being in the position they are in. And there's that lovable pooch Sandy. Annie's closest companion. I liked the scene where some boys bother the dog, and Annie is not to be messed with. I liked the part where one boy pushed her, and Annie gives him a mean right, then she says, ""All right, who's next?"" The taller one gets pummeled into the trash can which I think is hilarious. I know the boys should known better than to mess with Sandy and Annie. Then when Annie gets to be in a mansion, she knows she won't have a problem fitting in. Knowing that her parents will get her, unknowing that they have perished in a fire. Annie is later suckered by Miss Hannigan(Carol Burnett) and her brother Rooster(Tim Curry) and Lily(Bernadette Peters). If Miss Hannigan went along with the plan, she'd be in hot water herself. I didn't blame her for clocking Rooster. All the stars made the movie magic come true, and it's very heart warming as well. This is a definite for Broadway buffs. You can sing along to it if you like. 5 stars!",Annie
25,ianlouisiana,Peculiar goings - on at an Orphanage.,2,29 September 2006,"""Little Orphan Annie"" as a newspaper cartoon was a peculiarly American institution.Set in the Depression era and featuring a precocious child with blank eyes and wire - wool hair,it failed to travel the Atlantic successfully,rather like ""Mandrake the magician"" which I used to read in the American comics that got handed round at school in the 50s and that mystifies me to this day.It could have been written in blank verse for all the sense it made. ""Little Orphan Annie"" was another glimpse into an alien culture - albeit one that touched base with life as we understood it from time to time.We had men like Daddy Warbucks,although most of them had been elevated to the peerage.Annie's speech bubbles were often too cryptic for readers who had been brought up on ""Rupert "" and ""Teddy Tail"". The concept of cartoons for adults was yet to catch on. Thus it is fair to say that here in Britain the news that a musical version was about to be made did not quicken too many pulses. As an admirer of John Huston I was half curious and half apprehensive at the thought of him tackling a subject that half a dozen musical hacks could have made a competent job of. I'm afraid the Old Man bit off more than he could chew.The result was lifeless and drab,almost as if he'd been tired of the movie before he'd even started it. Some fairly dire songs are performed perfunctorily,everyone remembers their lines and the stunning Anne Reinking rises above the general apathy with a performance that rivals the one she gave in ""All that Jazz"",but clearly the $9million they paid for the movie rights weighed heavily on the shoulders of the production team.To me it didn't look like money well spent. Albert Finney can neither sing nor dance by any meaningful definition of those terms but he does both in ""Annie"".His lack of any discernible musical talent does not seem out of place where mediocrity rules.",Annie
26,gcd70,Enjoyably Light-Hearted Musical,6,26 February 2008,"Enjoyably light hearted musical about orphan ""Annie's"" dream of escaping the squalor of her all girls orphanage to find her parents and become a regular little girl.Albert Finney is a delight as hard hearted business man Daddy Warbucks, as is young Aileen Quinn as the precocious, confident little girl who wins his heart. Good support is offered by Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Ann Reinking and Geoffrey Holden. Definitely the show stealer though is Carol Burnett as the dipsomaniacal Madame of the orphanage, Miss Hannigan.It's the Broadway musical numbers (adapted by Ralph Burns from the original music - Charles Strouse - and lyrics - Martin Charnin) that give the film its real highlights however. Catchy tunes such as ""It's a Hard Life"" and ""Tomorrow"" are sure to stay with you for some time. Arlen Phillips' choreography is inventive and lively, though occasionally - yet certainly forgivably - overly so.Director John Huston brings the Broadway hit to the screen, pulling the show together well. Drama, comedy and musical numbers are all on an even keel, while Huston cleverly plays on the cutesiness of all the tiny rug rats. And really, who can blame him for that.Thanks to some great tunes and sprightly comedy (screenplay from Carol Sobieski), this ""Annie"" is good fun. That's saying something for me, not normally a musical fan. Great one for the kids.Friday, October 6, 1995 - Video",Annie
27,Steffi_P,"""She's like the shine on your shoes""",9,23 February 2011,"Of all the love-it-or-hate-it movies, Annie is perhaps the one which causes the sharpest divide between those it delights and those it disgusts. It's a musical for a start, and musicals are the big love-or-hate genre that people get really worked up over. To complicate things further Annie is a musical aimed at children and starring kids, and for a certain generation (now in its late 20s and early 30s) it was the most popular and ubiquitous of all children's musicals. To many of us, it was either a wonderful part of childhood, or a silly, soppy embarrassment. But there is a lot more to it than some basic and trivial appeal to youngsters.Let's begin with the songs, since after all this is what musicals are about. Martin Charnin's lyrics are witty and playful, in a way reminiscent of the great 1930s lyricists like Al Dubin and Lorenz Hart. Charnin comes up with some lovely ideas, (""Your clothes may be Beau Brummely""), rhyming two short words with one longer one (""Three or four bucks/She gets Warbucks"") and putting rhymes in the middle of lines, like ""Empty belly life/Rotten smelly life"". The cheekiness of these words has a really bittersweet edge, since these girls are singing about deprivation and abuse. Charles Strouse's melodies too can turn from the fun to the rousing to the poignant, often all within the same song. In particular ""Tomorrow"", ""Maybe"" and ""It's the Hard-Knock Life"" conjure up that mix of sadness and hope with which the movie is shot through.Now let's look at the cast. By the time this was made acting performances were most often valued for their realism and sensitivity, but the requirements of Annie mean that the players here can just go all-out with hamminess and caricature. Best of the bunch is surely Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, putting on a drunk act that is comically over-the-top, like something from a '30s romcom, but is also quite believable in its little mannerisms. It's a sad truth that Burnett's father was an alcoholic and her own childhood was far from rosy, facts which no doubt fuelled her performance. Albert Finney has fun with the role of Daddy Warbucks, but also shows great skill in bringing out the heart of the character without quite losing his gruff, stern exterior. Tim Curry (Rooster) is creepy in a slightly pervy way, which is far more terrifying than someone who shouts and makes threats. In the title role, Aileen Quinn is not the best child actress, but at least she is not irritating.Then there is the director John Huston. Huston may seem an odd choice, as he is best known among film buffs for his cynical and often violent film noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But Huston had always been a very rhythmic director, and one who could handle an ensemble well. He shows a real aptitude for staging musical numbers, making even camera and props part of an elaborate choreography. For example, at the beginning of ""It's the Hard Knock Life"", a girl kicks the wall in time to the song, a pail tumbles down the stairs, and the camera follows it to rest on Annie as she begins singing. Huston displays his cunning use of foreground and background in making set-ups and jokes that kids will understand. For example, while Miss Hannigan is admonishing Lily St Clair for stealing in the background, Rooster is in the foreground going through Miss Hannigan's purse.The story of Annie will appeal to any child who yearns for the unity of family. But there is also a meaningfulness in there that goes a little deeper than what children will get from it. It's full of nostalgia for the era in which it is set, for example the dance number in ""Let's go to the Movies"" being a faithful homage to Busby Berkely musicals like 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933. But its recreation of 1930s America is touched by the realities of the time too. The fact that these ragtag orphans are living through the worst years of the depression is repeatedly hinted at. ""This is no time to be out of work"" Grace warns Miss Hannigan. It's unusual to have such politics in a picture aimed at kids, but the economic background gives a sense of urgency to Annie's plight, and the moment where FDR commands Warbucks to join in with the singing chimes in beautifully with the feelings of unity and overcoming the pain of the past, and Annie is all the more moving for it. Whether you loved it or hated it as a child, watching it again as an adult could be a pleasantly surprising experience.",Annie
28,invisibleunicornninja,Boring.,3,8 April 2018,"One time I was on a bus. That bus was with a summer camp and we were going to an aquarium. The distance from where the camp was located (it was at some college) to the aquarium was several hours long. This is one of the movies that played on the little TVs on the bus. Hanging out at the aquarium was more entertaining than the experience of watching this movie.This movie is dull with bad acting, an overlong and boring story, and a hint of something interesting. I don't want to watch this again, recommend it to anyone, or even talk about it. All you need to know is that this movie is really dumb and I didn't like it.",Annie
29,Christmas-Reviewer,So-So Adaption,7,28 January 2006,"Columbia Pictures paid $9,000,000 for the movie rights of the hit Broadway Show. They should of hired the director of the play as well. John Houston was the wrong choice for this. His heavy hand was not the right touch for this film. Beware that there is major changes from the play. This film changes the last 1/3 of the play! Instead of ending on Christmas it ends on July 4th. The star (Aileen Quinn)in this sings ""Okay"" & the plays signature song (Tomorrow) as hardly sung at all in this.This film starts off great but once Annie gets to Daddy Warbucks house the movie falls apart and audience boredom sets in fast. The lack of energy in the final act drags the film down to the point that the film seems endless.If your a fan of the play beware that not all the Songs from the Play make it into this version. If you want to see a better version of ""Annie"" please get the 1999 version! This movie almost killed the musicals. It was not the big hit Hollywood thought it would be. The film only made money after all revenue streams came in (Theatrical,Cable,Video)Randal Klieser the film director of ""Grease"" was offered ""Annie"". had he been hired to direct and produce he would of cast John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John. I don't know why that did not hire him. It was either money or creative differences or maybe both? To bad that deal did not happen. Had he directed and produced there is a huge chance that we would of had a better film.",Annie
30,mike48128,The best filmed version,9,3 June 2012,"My girls wore out a VHS copy of this film. Claustrophobic as heads and people are ""cut-off"" in both the old full-screen version and new widescreen DVD. I find that even in widescreen it is framed too tight, as it ""squeezes"" people into far corners of the picture. The cinematography's composure is just too cluttered and ""busy"".That being said, this was one of my kid's all-time favorites when they were growing up. The only other VHS tapes they wore out were Disney animated features such as ""Little Mermaid."" (You have to view a tape almost 75 times, generally, for it to show major wear.) Great performances by all, especially Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and the others. Aileen Quinn is great as Annie, although some said she is a bit boisterous and too old for the role? Untrue! They had to teach her to punch as she had never done it before! Several dance numbers are fantastic, especially ""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here"", ""Let's Go to the Movies"", and ""You'll Never Fully Dressed Without Your Smile"". The streets of New York look amazingly authentic. The story is vastly changed for the ""movie"" version and I suppose it was to make it more exciting and action-packed? The song ""NYC"" is missing and so is song about ""Hoover"". Also, it's not Christmastime! In defense, Punjab's helicopter rescue and The Big Apple Circus are nice touches! FDR and Eleanor are perfectly portrayed.Film Faults: Although ""money doesn't buy happiness"" is the reason for the clip of ""Camille"" used in the ""Movies"" sequence, that ""Camille"" film clip is a real downer and I could have done without it. However my main ""beef"" is the finales' photography: 1.You can barely see and enjoy ""The Big Apple Circus."" 2.Even in widescreen, the elephant has no legs! 3.The finale seems ""rushed"" and incomplete. I think there should have been a longer scene with the orphan girls, Miss Hannigan, and Annie. Instead, Annie appears to totally ignore everybody and only ""sees"" Daddy Warbucks; as they watch the oh-so-fake fireworks (badly matted in) that aren't really there at all. Still the best filmed version out there as the Disney remake and ""Jamie Fox version"" are both not worth your time.",Annie
31,LeonardKniffel,It's Not Carol Burnett's Fault,9,1 May 2020,"Try as she does, Carol Burnett simply cannot get us to dislike her enough as the nasty Miss Hannigan, in this adaptation of a wildly popular Broadway musical based on the comic strip ""Little Orphan Annie."" No matter, this musical is beautifully made, with a first-rate cast that also includes Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, and Bernadette Peters-and (spoiler alert) Hannigan has a heart of gold anyway.

32,shakercoola,Sluggish adaptation but a winsome Shirley Temple turn,6,17 November 2018,"A depression era musical with a pre-New Deal pessimism subtext before a bright new future. ""Annie"" is a big budget, staged production with a couple of memorable musical hits, ""Tomorrow"" and ""It's the hard knock life"". It's full of colour, dance and music, sound and fury.
On performances, Aileen Quinn easily embodies the hope and cheer of the winsome, curly-haired orphan ""Annie""; Albert Finney fulfils the bombast of a tetchy billionaire politician, Oliver 'Daddy' Warbucks.
The film reinterprets the depression era and loses some of the story's original soul. It also feels directionless and some of the dancing set pieces are a little disconnected and hammy.
Overall, though, it's watchable if you don't look too closely, and appealing to young children especially. Quinn's solo to President Roosevelt is a touching moment.",Annie
33,MartianOctocretr5,Annie's red hair turned green when she saw this,3,26 December 2009,"Ambitious effort which falls short. The film makers opened their wallets to compile an ensemble cast with marquee names. Each of them wasted. Somebody forgot to give the cast anything interesting to work with. Aileen McQuinn makes a spirited effort to fill some big shoes, in replacing the stage's Andrea McArdle. To no avail. It's doubtful even McArdle (had she still been young enough for the role) could have saved this, since the writing never taps the potential of the source material. This adaptation isn't engaging in any way, and misses the point completely. The characters are Annie and Daddy Warbucks in name only; any other similarity to the comic strip is non-existent. The Broadway version worked, thanks to McArdle; also, a stage atmosphere fits for these songs. ""Tomorrow"" is wonderful on a stage; it gives you a migraine anywhere else. This film is a painful example of the aforementioned ""anywhere else."". The excruciating shrill voices will imprint an after burn in your brain that may require psychiatric care. The convoluted script runs amok with an ugly kidnapping plot, and there's a battalion of unadopted orphan girls running around trailing the action--to what end nobody knows. The director has actors endlessly mugging in a sinister manner in close-up shots. It's a mess that quickly leaves kids mumbling in confused despair, and dismayed adults bolting for the exits to escape the torture.If it shows up on TV, beware. Shut it off. Quickly.",Annie

The Juniper Berry bottle cracked me up; I love gin and tonics. Tim Curry his usual creepy self (as Rooster; earlier as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""). I always adore Bernadette Peters. Geoffrey Holder as the turbaned guy could save anyone's life. He should have beaten up Miss Hannigan, lol. Putting Annie in the bottom of the laundry cart was an excellent idea, for her escape. Warbucks' secretary was just lovely. Loved the scene with the guys wearing the knee pads shining the floor.

36,johnstonjames,The Movie Gets A Nine. Carol Burnett Gets A Ten.,9,27 June 2011,"as a film musical, the original 'Annie' is hard to top. i don't know why Disney bothered to remake this. i usually like Disney TV musicals but their version of 'Annie' was done with very little feel for the old all American, right wing, newspaper comic strip heroine. i mean the Disney people portrayed Annie without her trademark curly red afro. what a stupid way to interpret this character. another reminder that even Disney can really blow it sometimes.for one thing, the original 1980's fun musical has a much better cast. you can't really beat a cast that showcases the amazing Carol Burnett, Tim Curry, and the delightfully cute Bernadette Peters. as far as a comparison of Kathy Bates to Carol Burnett, there is none. Burnett owns the role of miss Hannigan. i'm not sure they should have forgiven miss Hannigan at the end here, but hey, it's Carol Burnett after all.Carol Burnett is a American classic (oooo. that sounds sort of rude)and one of the very best female comics ever. People forget that Burnett, like Lucille Ball, forged the way for female comedians in a time when they were mostly men. Carol Burnett can do no wrong as a performer. even when she does drama, she is outstanding. 'Annie' is a reminder that she should have done more broad comedy for theatrical films. Miss Hannigan is definitely very broad comedy (ha! broad. no pun intended). if it wasn't for the likes of Carol Burnett, there might be no Margaret Cho. Burnett is so priceless here screaming ""kill! Kill! Kill!"" and lamenting the company of ""little girls"". hilarious.the rest of the cast is superb. beyond first rate. real classy. Aileen Quinn is a marvelous Annie and it's a lot of fun to see curry and Peters ham it up. one of the most under acknowledged performances here is definitely Ann Reinking. for adults, Reinking almost steals the show away from Burnett. but not quite. her role is too soft and sweet to allow anything too intense, but she does it with such classic style and a personable graciousness that is so endearing you just can't get enough of her in this film.i only have one question here. not a complaint. just a question. did Edward Herrmann make a whole career playing FDR? on TV, stage and the movies? he does a nice job, but FDR is my favorite President and Herrman looks nothing like him. the glasses and the make up only help somewhat.this movie also has a really great line. the original comic was very right wing and capitalistic, and this movie definitely touts the glories of free enterprise, but it does have one very deeply profound catch line. Reinking asks Finney, ""do you really only love money, business and capitalism? you know those things will never love you back"". whoa. deep. cool.look. whoever may read this, and if you really like this movie, i know times are tough right now. sometimes i think they are ALWAYS tough for some of us. i can't tell you for sure if ""the sun will come out tomorrow"". for all i know tomorrow you may be dead. but not all problems can be solved and life can't always be perfect. maybe it never can. but you should have some hope and try to look to the things you enjoy and what gets you through until the next day. this movie works well enough for me.

Albert Finney is superb as Daddy Warbucks and Geoffrey Holder shines as Punjab. It's difficult to compare the film with the Broadway version, so I won't even try. There have been so many young girls playing Annie on Broadway, and some have definitely been better than others. Aileen Quinn as this version of Annie does a great job in this film.

40,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Aileen Quinn!!!,7,29 April 2012,"""Why a kid would want to be an orphan,"" barks the villainous Miss Hannigan, ""is beyond me."" Well who can blame the bitter lush: No matter how bad these poor little tykes are treated in that rundown dilapidated orphanage, they're having loads of fun singing and dancing like there's no tomorrow! Although this big budget extravaganza's loaded with great actors like Albert Finney as bald billionaire Daddy Warbucks, Tim Curry as a con artist and Carol Burnett as the bearer of the quote above, it's Aileen Quinn's ANNIE that steals the show.Displaying an everygirl persona mixed with a dynamic musical talent, Quinn displays the essential energy for the titular redhead without lacking pathos and vulnerability. Even when given a dream-week to stay with Daddy Warbucks for his publicity, her true aim is having a real family. Determined to find her original parents, Warbucks makes a radio campaign with a hefty reward – perking ears of the wrong people. And while Annie slowly warms the heart of the steely industrialist, songs break out in just about every-other scene.The tunes are catchy, showcased with incredible dance numbers. The time-period sets look and feel authentic; from poverty stricken streets and alleyways to the plush Warbucks mansion, veteran auteur John Huston takes us to a polarizing time of haves and have-nots in the 1930's depression era with vibrant reality. Although one particular scene as Warbucks (constantly reestablished as a greedy Capitalist) is talked into the New Deal by President Roosevelt seems distracting from Annie's personal adventure, we sporadically return to the orphanage where Miss Hannigan's plot to recover the reward along with her nefarious brother provides the audience – especially the younger ones – a constantly suspenseful edge.Making this much more than just a kid's movie but the type of old school entertainment that always works. And while there could have been a few less distractions (some songs and characters are more important than others) and even more of Aileen Quinn's Annie... perhaps the studio realized all the talent involved and wanted to make an equal game of it... she's the one we ultimately root for: and this reviewer cannot imagine anyone else in the title role!

One day a lady comes to the orphanage and takes Annie for 1 week to live in a huge mansion with a billionaire... he is only allowing this for his image as it makes everyone think he cares.Now as you can expect from any musical (except Sweeney Todd), the acting was not that good. Especially by Annie. But the bad acting didn't ruin the movie. The songs were very catchy and there were obviously a couple of very famous songs too.The cast was quite impressive...Albert Finney was quite funny in the movie playing the billionaire, Oliver Warbucks. I also thought that Carol Burnett was very funny as the evil woman running the orphanage. The best role though has to go to Tim Curry. He plays a great character and as always does a fantastic job. The surprise appearance was from Geoffrey Holder... I mainly know him from Live and Let Die (One of my favourite Bond films) where he plays Baron Samedi... in Annie he plays Punjab. Not his best role, but still quite good.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Even though the acting was not up to scratch, i can still see why this film is locked into a lot of peoples hearts. Very entertaining.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Annie
42,theknownames,The best Annie,10,15 December 2018,"A memorable adaption of the Broadway play. Hands Down, the best Annie. The set designs are classic, the casting is impeccable, the costumes, the talent! There is at least one additional song that fits in seamlessly. Aileen Quinn as Annie is iconic. An inspirational timeless and, so far, unsurpassable production. Annie '82' is perfect",Annie
43,ozthegreatat42330,Amazing comic strip character brought to celluloid-Wonderful!,10,23 April 2007,"Once again John Huston works his movie magic, bringing the popular stage musical, based on a beloved comic strip character to the big screen. The cast is just first rate. You could not ask for better. The pick of young Aileen Quinn for the role of Annie was inspired, and all of the children in this film stand out. Albert Finney is at his outrageous best as Oliver ""Daddy"" Warbucks, who is so rich he buys the Mona Lisa for his bathroom. After seeing this version I can envision no one but Carol Burnette in her second great musical role. (The first was Mary Roger's ""Once Upon a Mattress."")Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters are also excellent as Rooster and Liliy (I'll let you figure out which was which.) Ann Reinking plays a lovely Grace Farrell to Finny's Warbucks. Geoffrey Holder is grand as the mystic bodyguard Punjab. Finally, reprising a character he has played a number of times in different movies Edward Hermann is Franklin D. Roosevelt. With a good script, excellent music, fine choreography and excellent actors what more could there be. With wonderful songs like ""A Hard Knock Life,"" ""Little Girls,"" ""Easy Street,"" ""We've got Annie"" and of course ""Tomorrow.""",Annie
44,mnpollio,Curiously maligned musical adaptation is a delight,8,15 May 2017,"Any movie buff alive in 1982 will probably remember the critical lambasting directed at the big screen adaptation of the popular Tony-winning Broadway musical Annie. But watching it with an unjaundiced eye, it is difficult to understand the hatred then or now.Based on the long-running Little Orphan Annie comics and the acclaimed Broadway hit, Annie keeps the same narrative beats as its predecessors. Curly-haired carrot top Annie is a 10-year-old orphan in Depression-era New York City, whose upbeat attitude and refusal to be cowed by the obstacles thrown at her makes her a thorn in the side of boozy dictatorial orphanage matron Miss Hannigan. By luck, Annie is offered the chance to temporarily reside at the palatial estate of billionaire Oliver Warbucks, and she proceeds to melt the heart of Warbucks and his staff, while Miss Hannigan, her devious brother Rooster and his floozy Lily hatch a scheme to cash in.It is hard to see where all the carping comes from. The film retains all of the favorite songs and numbers from the stage hit, while getting rid of dead wood like ""Hooverville"" and adding a few of new songs that fit right in (i.e., Sandy, Dumb Dog, etc.). Director John Huston opens up the film so that it never feels like a filmed stage play, which is usually the main complaint of people in Broadway to film translations. He nicely captures the tone and spirit of the Depression-era NYC. If the number celebrating ""NYC"" is missing, it is more than made up for with ""Let's Go to the Movies"", where Annie experiences her first movie-going experience at the lavish Radio City Music Hall where period-garbed Rockettes kick with abandon. I would say that the clips of Garbo's Camille could have been cut in this segment, although it would defeat the last sight gag. Ironically, everyone had the knives out early on for Huston, claiming he was an inappropriate choice for director. I would argue that Huston is infinitely more successful here in crafting joyous musical interludes as opposed to the dead air that ""acclaimed"" director Clint Eastwood perpetrated in Jersey Boys.I would also venture to say that Huston's use of his lavish budget is present everywhere and used to great effect, particularly in the film's second half, which concludes with an exciting rescue that avoids the ho-hum effect that impacted the stage version's problematic second act. And while the visit with FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt, with everyone singing on ""Tomorrow"" may seem hokey, it was no more so than in the show, and there are many highlights to counteract that saccharine bit. ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" featuring the orphans is a lovely bit and both ""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here"", ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" and ""Little Girls"" are all showstoppers.Aileen Quinn nicely anchors everything as an appealing Annie (although I daresay some of the other orphan girls give her a run for her money in the talent department). Carol Burnett hams it up with abandon in a scene-stealing turn as the chronically inebriated Miss Hannigan. Albert Finney walks the tightrope between stern and warm as Daddy Warbucks. Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters are a memorable Rooster and Lily (their Easy Street is also a highlight), while Ann Reinking is a delight as Warbucks' secretary Grace Farrell.Ironically, for a film declared a misfire by so many critics, I have not come across any musical fan or child who does not get caught up in its effervescent joy. Definitely a film to watch to chase away the blues and instill some hope. Steer clear of the woebegone modern remake with Jamie Foxx, whose sole saving grace was watching the same critics who trashed this film suddenly develop amnesia by pretending they originally liked it and the remake was so bad.",Annie
45,stormhawk2021,One of my favorite musical films,7,11 July 2017,"""Annie"" is the epitome of a family film in every way. From it's very catchy musical numbers to it's strong heart shown by it's talented cast, this film will make your heart sing even if you are in a bad mood. This film has some obvious faults, as it does not need to be two hours long and some plot devices seem to be thrown in to push the story along, but all-in-all, I had a blast watching it. For the type of film that it is, it's dialogue and lyrics are all well-written and it is very well-produced. ""Annie"" is the type of kid that you wish you could have been friends with growing up, due to her sheer likability. ""Annie"" is one of the most enjoyable musicals I have seen. For anyone ho has not seen it, it definitely earns a recommendation from me.",Annie
46,dimplet,It could have been a lot worse; it could have been a bit better,7,14 January 2012,"Under John Huston's direction, Annie cannot be accused of manipulating your heartstrings. But when you consider the storyline, you feel like it should. Instead, it is a bit understated; some people are moved by it, and others (who perhaps don't like musicals in the first place) are left cold. My response was in the middle: Annie is entertaining, but not moving. What's right: All of the acting is excellent, especially Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, who accomplishes the difficult feat of recreating an ancient cartoon character. If judged by its retaining the character of the old Little Orphan Annie newspaper cartoon strip, the movie succeeds. It is generally difficult to bring a modern Broadway musical to the screen, but Vincent Canby, in his New York Times review, says he didn't much like the stage version, and the movie is better. The producer, Ray Stark, didn't like the Broadway version, either. I think Aileen Quinn gets it right, not too polished to seem implausible, but delivers the lovable perkiness the role calls for. Carol Burnett rises above her television persona to do some real acting -- sort of. None of these roles calls for naturalistic acting, although Ann Reinking's performance comes the closest. These are roles that have their roots in a cartoon strip, not a great novel. As presented, this works fine in a musical, in part because Huston doesn't overdo it; With a less subtle director, this could have been a very expensive flop. And there are some genuinely funny scenes,particularly from Burnette, and the radio show. The limiting factors are the story and the music, which are good but not great, a point made by Roger Ebert, with whom I often disagree, but this time his review gets it right: Despite these limitations, the movie is still pleasantly entertaining.The movie Annie inevitably gets compared to is Oliver! In some ways Annie works better as a musical, precisely because it is so rooted in pure fantasy. You can't help feeling something is lost in Oliver! by moving the gritty realism of the original Charles Dickens into a cotton candy fantasy musical. If Annie is cotton candy, well, what else was the cartoon strip? But in both Oliver! and Annie, the depth of emotion the stories suggest is missing. The message of Annie is surprisingly contemporary to America, 30 years later, of Annie opening the heart of Daddy Warbucks, of FDR drafting him to organize his New Deal jobs programs. Spoiler alert:As to the ending, I really wish the Carol Burnett character had been fired or led off in handcuffs. But I guess Annie, herself, was not mean- spirited, so forgiveness was more appropriate. We could learn a lot from Annie, which, I suppose, is the whole point of the story. I recommend watching Annie, not only because it is enjoyable, but also for cultural literacy because there are so many references to it in other movies. And don't miss the legendary Ray Bolger as the radio sound effects man tap dancing with his hands!",Annie
47,alfiefamily,A horrible failure that should have been a big hit!!!,3,25 March 2004,"I really thought that this was going to be a can't miss, super box office hit that would revitalize the movie musical.However, this movie falls under the category of ""What Were They Thinking?"" I can't speak for anyone else, but when I here the words, ""Light hearted, musical comedy"", I never think of John Huston.  This was by far the biggest mistake of this movie.  Huston had no idea of how to film this movie.Carol Sobieski took Thomas Meehan's funny, charming musical and gutted it. Someone should have told her that when you're writing a musical comedy, it's important to have some comedy in the script.Casting - I was disappointed in Carol Burnett. Perhaps it was the writing, or the direction, but I felt as though I were watching an exaggeration of one of her characters from her show, instead of something new and interesting. Albert Finney was fine, although, he's no singer.  Ann Reinking is a lovely dancer, but terribly bland in this part. I will not comment on Aileen Quinn, other than to say I think they could have done better than her.  In general, there is no chemistry between any of the actors in this movie.Overall, this movie is awful.  The shorter TV version with Kathy Bates and Victor Garber is far better than this mess.2 out of 10",Annie
48,MK_movie_reviews,How about other orphans future?,4,23 August 2021,"I've watched ""Annie"" for the first time. I know the song ""Tomorrow"" and I used to sing the song so I pick this up on Disney Plus tonight.This movie is about orphans. And luckily, Annie was adopted by a billionaire. And he has a connection with the FBI and the US president so he tried to find her biological parents. She wanna see her real parents so badly.While I watching this movie, I felt that the billionaire guy is a pedophile. He is touching her body and he said: ""I love you. I don't want anything but you..."". It was really strange.And one thing that other girls are forgotten. They were told to be adopted each one of them and invited Christmas party but I felt strange...How about other girls' future?",Annie

Sheesh! If I had to hear that song one more time, I was going to kick her dog Sandy right in the butt.John Huston's attempt at a movie musical was over-blown to say the least. They sure spent a lot ($50 million) and they sure didn't make much on the film ($35 million), but the show was lively and big and splashy and all that.Unfortunately, there is virtually no warmth in this movie. It's all glam and confetti. Albert Finney walks through it, Carol Burnett is nothing less than perfect as 'Miss Hannigan', and Bernadette Peters has luscious boobs.Recommended as fluffy escapism (....""tomorrow"", when I'm not around. Thanks).",Annie
50,Mike-DD,First musical I've watched,8,22 August 2000,"This is the first musical I've ever watched, and I must say that I compare all musical productions with this one from then on. I've never seen the original play, but I feel that the production was pretty splendid, and the casting of the girls were quite good. Though young, they all seem to be able to sing in tune and beautifully, and I just love the way Burnett acts as Miss Hannigan - a kind and non-violent kind of 'eveilness'. Overall, this is a superb production with an excellent musical score - I seldom buy movie soundtracks, but this was one where I enjoyed every single song, and can even sing some of them today despite having last watched the movie on video many years ago.",Annie
51,Nate-48,Stands the test of time,9,3 July 2020,"I used to watch this movie as a kid in the 80's when I went over my cousins and was dazzled by all of the different things going on here - the sets, the sequences, the songs, the story.Looking at it three decades later - it all holds up - maybe even better.Nearly all of the characters are up to the tasks and are believable. Carol Burnett is even better than I remember - maybe the only minor criticism I have is that a few of the scenes between Burnett and the orphans are a little campy.Aileen Quinn hits all the right notes as Annie.Albert Finney is gold, Ann Reinking steals the show in a way I almost forgot, Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters are key cogs.Great scene with Edward Hermann as FDR. Seinfeld fans will recognize Larry Hankin as the dog pound guy (he played the pilot character Kramer).Geoffrey Holder as Punjab is almost straight out of the Cesar Romero character in the Shirley Temple film ""The Princess"" - I would bet money on it.This is one of John Huston's last directorial efforts and I don't think anybody could have done it better.",Annie
52,Dog-River,Highly Recommend,10,18 May 2021,"This is my all time favourite musical adaptation. It's a movie that I never get tired of watching. The writing, the set design and the characters are all outstanding. I love Annie's spunkiness and the music is unforgettable.

She was a mediocre dancer at best. Her voice was shrill, and I just don't think she looked right for the part.That's all just my opinion. I think I could have rated this 10/10 if there had been a different actress in the role of Annie.",Annie
54,hcalderon1,Broadway at its best,9,15 February 2005,"This movie series was real great. This movie begins as an orphan named Annie who is 11yrs. old and lives in New York City. This movie was filmed during Christmas holidays. This movie begins with Annie trying to get out so she can find her parents which Ms. Hannigan(Carol Burnett) makes it hard to make possible. It gets better when Oliver Warbucks(Albert Finney) decides to help Annie's dreams of having a daddy possible come true. Annie goes to Mr. Warbucks as planned for one week, but what happens next she never thought that this man would do what it takes to make Annie's dream become reality. To Ms. Hannigan she didn't want Annie's dream to happen so she tries everything possible to make thing impossible. Do you think Daddy Warbucks can rescue Annie from becoming a victim of the horrible Ms. Hannigan. Wait to you see you'll see what happens.",Annie
55,gerry-russell-139,Annie: One of the last great musicals,9,7 October 1999,"This musical is a near perfect ten! One of the last great musicals (""A Chorus Line"" was the very last--at least thus far), ""Annie"" lost nothing of it's Broadway production in the transition from the Great White Way to the Silver Screen. Albert Finney is the ideal ""Daddy"" Warbucks, Carol Burnett is the only actress to play Miss Hannigan, Burnadette Peters is perfect as Lilly St. Regis (""named for the hotel"") and dance genius Ann Reinking is radiant as Grace Farrell. And let's not forget Aileen Quinn as Annie. She was the perfect age when she got the part (10 yrs. old) but she had had only a small amount of acting experience. She won the part (as I've been told) on account of her tremendously talented singing voice, sweet smile and spunky wit. I last saw her in ""The Frog Prince"" about 8 years ago on the Disney Channel. She still had a great smile but no one who has seen ""Annie"" can really see her as anything else (at least not outside of any musical productions). To summarize, the movie is great, the songs are delightful (esp. ""Tomorrow"", ""Easy Street"" and ""I Don't Need Anything But You"") and the acting and choreography are right up there with ""West Side Story"", and ""An American in Paris"".",Annie
56,petersj-2,A delight,8,24 September 2009,"Critics attacked the movie often saying it is over blown but the more I watch Annie the more I like it. The great thing is that it never becomes stage bound yet at the same time still manages to keep he charm of the live theatre production.The final scenes are actually very exciting and this could never be done on stage so director John Huston opened the story up to include the darker moments of the show. Although I would love to have seen Dorothy Loudon do the Hannigan role Carole Burnett does as creditable job as does Albert Finney. The glorious Bernadette Peters generously underplays as does Tim Curry and they are both fabulous, Easy Street is a real winner. What a pity we never saw more of Anne Reinkin as Grace. This elegant lady nearly steals the film and boosts what could be an annoying role into one of pure charm. The kids are great and Aileen Quinn is a lovely Annie. She does battle in the lower notes as a singer but who cares. Sandy the dog is a real trooper and does indeed get close to stealing the movie but for me Geoffrey Holder as Punjub steals the movie in a small role. A fine movie with the most wonderful songs.",Annie
57,MisterSisterFister,Impressively Irritating,1,11 December 2018,"This movie is awful. No one can sing and all the songs sound exactly the same.

There is absolutely nothing to like about this trash.",Annie
58,Snoopy1,I still love it!,10,5 January 2003,"I just recently watched this movie, for the first time in my adult life. It's even better as an adult, because you catch all of these little things like, ""Mr. Warbucks, you're really handsome, for a Republican.""  Some people bash it for being different than the Broadway show, but so what, they did a good job.  It's a fun movie for people of all ages.  It's hilarious, musical, and touching.",Annie
59,Sparrow_in_flight,Methinks I'm in the minority,8,21 October 2003,"Because I didn't care much for the TV version. I like this version much better.

It's not the greatest of musicals, but the storyline is good, and the music is definitely fun to hear and sing.",Annie
60,RJV,Contributed to the Death of Film Musicals,3,13 August 2002,"The original Broadway show was a popular hit because it conveyed innocence and warmth.  The film version didn't do well at the box office because it lacks these important qualities.Part of the problem is John Huston's direction.  It is obvious the veteran director's heart was not in this film.  He sabotages musical numbers by handling them in a cold, plodding manner.  For instance, one doesn't feel for the orphans' plight when they sing ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" because Huston has them doing acrobatics that detract from the lyrics.
Then there is the mishandling of the songs.  As a previous commentator has noted, some wonderful tunes like ""We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"" and ""N.Y.C."" have been scrapped in favor of dreary tunes like ""Dumb Dog"" and ""Let's Go to the Movies.""  These new songs contribute nothing to the scenario. The remaining original Broadway songs are hampered by inferior renditions and Huston's misdirection.The scenario is unnecessarily coarsened.  The nasty orphanage head Agatha Hannigan (Carol Burnett) is transformed from the blustery harridan of Broadway to an alcoholic vamp. This type of character has no place in a family musical. Neither do orphans and maids who flash their underwear during musical numbers.As the orphaned title character, Aileen Quinn tries hard but her acting is artificial, so one cannot feel for her.  Albert Finney as Oliver Warbucks seems gruff and uptight even when expressing love toward Annie. Ann Reinking seems too cool to convey maternal warmth as Warbucks's secretary Grace Farrell and her husky singing voice is completely inappropriate.  Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as the villains Rooster Hannigan and Lily St. Regis and Geoffrey Holder as Punjab are largely wasted.No wonder Disney decided to make their own TV version of ANNIE in 1999. Anyone who doesn't have the opportunity to see a stage production should watch the Disney version, which is truncated but captures the original show's charm and simplicity.  In the meantime, it is an injustice that Columbia has decided to put the misbegotten film version on DVD while ignoring its real treasures like TWENTIETH CENTURY.",Annie
61,bellabanana93,The Best Songs,7,10 October 2017,Annie is a family favourite for a good reason. The songs are catchy and memorable. You and your family will be singing and humming them everywhere you go. The entire movie is well done but it gets the most interesting at the ending. The character development of Annie's adopted dad is heartwarming.,Annie
62,elevenangrymen,A Rather Harmless Musical,6,27 January 2013,"Little Orphan Annie is a spunky redhead living under the ruthless rule of Ms. Hannigan, who runs the orphanage she lives in. She and the other orphans are forced to toil endlessly under their drunk headmistress. One day, Annie escapes from the orphanage in a laundry basket and meets Sandy, a dog. She and Sandy are caught by the police and returned to the orphanage, where Ms. Hannigan locks them in a closet.Then, Ms. Farrell shows up on the orphanage doorsteps. She is the billionaire Oliver Warbucks's personal secretary, and they are looking for an orphan to take care of for a week, as a publicity stunt. She sees Annie and is immediately smitten and manages to wrestle her from Ms. Hannigan's control. She brings her to Warbucks's mansion, where the staff falls in love with her. When Warbucks arrives, he isn't too pleased, but he lets her stay. Then when Annie and Sandy stop an assassination attempt on Warbucks, he begins to slowly give in to her charm.If what I've written above seems to be gushing with cuteness, imagine it with singing. Yep, this film is very, very cute. But it can get very, very annoying. There is a scene where Annie and Franklin Roosevelt sing to each other. I'm not kidding, that actually happens. To be fair, it could have worked, but only with a director who actually cared about the film. Huston did not. A cute children's musical was the exact opposite of the kind of film's Huston enjoyed to make.Despite the lively musical numbers, only one song is catchy enough to be memorable, ""Tommorow"". The rest are rather forgettable, for example there is a song called ""You're Not Fully Dressed Without a Smile."" Yep, I'm not kidding. As a musical, the film seems slightly half baked. The dance numbers are well choreographed, but that's about it.As ""Daddy"" Warbucks, Albert Finney is pretty good and bald. It's really disconcerting. His head looks like an egg shell. As for his performance, it is a caricature, as most of the performances are. He is good, but it isn't his fault, the character is written like that. Carol Burnett goes way over the top, in a performance that is probably the best in the film. She even has a few funny moments, but a lot of the time her lonely Ms. Hannigan comes off as really creepy, or as a pathetic alcoholic.Ann Reinking is okay as Ms. Farrell, but her character is rather one note. She does have a good voice though. Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as a pair of bumbling con men are good, but not great as they too are rather one note. Finally, Aileen Quinn as Annie is very spunky, and lovable, but she overdoes it sometimes, especially when saying ""grown up"" dialog.The screenplay isn't that bad, but it does feel rather wooden. It could have been done much better, as most of the musical could have been. When you have a story this well-worn, it helps to spice it up a little, maybe with interesting direction or a different approach. As it is, the cinematographer shoots it in a rather boring, uninteresting way. It feels very stagy, it comes off as rather boring. To be fair, it can be quite enjoyable at times, but at other times it can be too much, or too little.The film seems to rely on Annie's charm and cuteness in order to make you root for her. To be fair, she is cute, but it can be overbearing at times. The scenes in the orphanage are not bad, but some of the other orphan's can be really annoying. There is one actress who kept saying ""oh my goodness"" in such an annoying way, it made me burst out laughing each time. The film also goes on for way too long, but it could have been worse I guess.Huston's direction is not that good, you can tell it was a money job. His camera seems uninterested, and it drifts through the scenes as if it didn't really want to be there. I have often accused Huston of being laid back, but here he could have been sleeping and it wouldn't make the film worse. To be fair, Huston did have emphysema and would die within five years, but he still could have done a better job.Overall, the film isn't that bad. It can be enjoyable at times, but it could have been much better. If you are looking for a childish musical, this will do. But still, you could do better.Annie, 1982, Starring: Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney and Carol Burnett, Directed by John Huston, 6/10 (C-)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

I'm not surprised she went on to do absolutely nothing else. I have always liked Albert Finney and he manages to turn in the only good performance in the entire movie. It's no surprise that this awful crapfest flopped at the box office, and that the leading ""actress"" was deservedly nominated for a Razzie award. Skip this horrid, badly acted garbage and watch the vastly superior ""Oliver!"" instead. No wonder musicals had died out if this was the best they could come up with.

I'm one of the ones who loved it ... and so did my kids in 1982 when it was released. One reviewer says Carol Burnett grated on his nerves; I thought she deserved an academy award. One calls Aileen Quinn an ugly little kid; I thought she was perfect for the part including her real and natural looks. Certainly her talent was unquestionable. And several reviewers trash not only the movie but John Huston's direction; I feel this energetic, magical, ""alive"" film ranks right up there with the energy in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."" My only negative comment is what in the hell was Columbia thinking when they recently released a ""Special Anniversary Edition"" of this wide screen extravaganza in a Full Screen Format only? What idiot was responsible? Equally disturbing is the fact that it doesn't seem to have been remastered or restored. And to add insult to injury the sound is pretty pathetic including the ""DTS"" audio track. Whoever is responsible for this DVD should be fired and driven from the film industry in tar and feathers.",Annie
65,loueysmith,Love this classic!,9,19 June 2018,"I showed this to my 2 year old today and she absolutely loved it, was so engrossed! I think it's lovely that even with all the new flicks that are way more updated these days, a child of this day and age can still love an old classic like this...I just shows you how wonderful a movie it is.
I don't think there's one member of the cast I didn't think was great in this, they all play a fantastic part. I have watched part of the Jamie Foxx (couldn't make it through the whole thing) one and and all of the Victor Garber version and they're not a patch on this one. The Victor Garber one was watchable, but it felt rushed and in parts out of place...for instance, they have the song ""yesterday was plain awful"" in it, yet have cut out the action scene where Rooster tries to hurt Annie...so it makes no sense to still have the song! There are a few other scenes that also seem a bit off as well. The acting for all parts in that one seem good, with the exception of Miss Hannigan, she was meant to be a raving alcoholic man eater and she actually tried to save Annie at the end...much better this way. Kathy Bates was a disappointment. I liked both Graces, however prefer the one in this version as she has far more charm and a fine singer and dancer! I also love that ""we got Annie"" is in this one. 
So, to sum up...1999 version is watchable but 1982 is outstanding!! The other is just plain crap.
I knocked off one star, for the fact in this version, Miss Hannigan ends up at the party, I know she tried to save Annie at the end...BUT, she'd been a crap to all the kids throughout, not exactly caring or nurturing (just cared about getting drunk and men) and she was part of the scheme of tricking Annie. So seemed a bit weird she was not only let off with all that, but made a part of the celebration at the end!",Annie

Nonetheless, it's simply a testament as to how wonderful this film is. While it may have it's faults and stage purists may not enjoy it, I call it a wonderful movie for the whole family.",Annie
67,ghoule-582-207091,Most of the reviewers miss the point,4,17 February 2013,"In itself, Annie sounds a lot like other films, be they musicals or not. You can love them or hate them, depending on your expectations.Most of the reviewers miss the point : the main problem with Annie is the plot... some orphan girl gets lucky and draws attention from a republican billionaire, melting his heart and getting adopted.Why her? Why not the other orphans? The man she loves has made a fortune on the back of millions of Americans and other citizens of the World, and she just gets to benefit from what he ""legally"" stole from others.Annie is cuddled from start to finish by dozens of ""servants"", adults working to take care of her and of the man who adopted her.When she decides she wants to find her parents, hundreds of couples swarm towards the manor to reclaim her... and the 50,000$ cash reward. The movie ends with the billionaire and his armada going after the orphanage's manager, her brother and her brother's lover, which fraudulently cashed in the reward and kidnapped Annie.And what if these people had the chance to live decent lives and earn a decent salary? They would not have had to pose as her parents to make a living.Shame on Hollywood for using children as a shield to defend capitalism and rich people crushing their fellow citizens, transforming poor people into thieves struck down by the money-fuelled few.The worst part : when some dumb Bolshevik tries to kill the billionaire by throwing a bomb into the manor, and the rich man's servants send him back the bomb before crushing the poor bearded guy without the rich bald man really noticing anything.What an insulting ""savage capitalist"" farce.",Annie
68,tammyshadowkilljoy,We got Annie!,9,2 July 2010,"I hate it when people slate this film. When you actually watch it, it's very entertaining with some brilliant locations and believable characters, reflecting the issue of being an orphan and being very sweet, too. It makes fans go through many emotions, including happiness, terror, and sympathy for the poor little orphan girl. So don't diss it until you try it. Really, i think it's a beautiful film with very sweet characters and the evil orphanage woman (i know, technical term, that) makes this a film to watch again and again. So where can i get a copy?!! Jokes. I already have it. So watch it and try your best to not fall in love with the sweetest, funniest little red headed orphan of all time-Annie!",Annie
69,toni-cooke18,An all time favourite,9,28 February 2014,"I cannot count how many times I have watched this film. As a child I would watch it almost daily and as an adult I watch it whenever it comes on the television. That was until my daughter came along and discovered the beauty that is Annie... so we have watched it time and time together, so much so I had to buy a new DVD copy as we wore ours out!Regardless of this being an old film, it does not disappoint, it can be enjoyed by all ages and it will be timeless.These days the story brings me to tears. The music and the songs are fantastic, as are the child actors. The singing, the dancing, the story line have the ability to stir up so many different emotions. And as Daddy Warbucks can vouch, Annie has the ability to win over even the most unavailable hearts.As a viewer you will not be disappointed with this film, if you haven't already, watch it.",Annie
70,David Igra,A good family movie,7,4 May 2005,"I'm David's ex-girlfriend - Sofia - and I saw this movie when I was a kid living in the States. I think actually met Annie the character when I was at a Christmas party at the White House for foreigners around 1985. She was as cute as in the movie! Then, I knew all the songs by heart. Funny since they have now made a rap song out of part of the theme song - ""Its a hard luck life"". When I think about the story now I realize it contains all the aspects that a good story should contain, despair, hope, action and a happy ending. Just like the good, some times scary old tales that you read to your children. I guess you can compare Annie to Pretty Woman - just a different age target. (Finding an older man with money! ) However the move is without nasty jokes so totally OK to see with your kids!Watching it reminds me just how much I miss being with David and how stupid it was to break up with him. //Sofia",Annie
71,elainehowie,Very enjoyable and sweet musical,9,14 June 2018,"I really like this film! The songs are great and extremely catchy and the main character Annie is very likeable and you instantly root for her. Most of the characters are memorable and likeable, including the villains. The film really gets you involved, and sometimes you can't help but sing along. The only part I wasn't so fond of was near the end of the film when Rooster was chasing Annie up the bridge. The scene went on for a while and just seemed a bit weird and out of place. But this part does not detract from the overall great film.",Annie

73,Jodelle,"Musical captivates the kiddies, leaves adults a little bored",6,9 December 2000,"I was just the right age to fall in love with the movie Annie when it was released.  At 10 years old I wanted to be a singing, dancing, movie star just like Aileen Quinn!The film is a great little girls film, maybe even little boys. There are big name adult stars in the film (Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, Albert Finney, and Tim Curry) and though their performances are good the plot isn't terrifically delivered. Be forewarned:  cute but not totally captivating.I gave it a 6 out of 10.",Annie
74,Brutalfan,One of my all time favorites,10,21 May 2002,"Aileen Quinn as Annie has everyone beat.  With that darling face, that beautiful voice, she did a fabulous job creating the character.  Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks was wonderful!  He had that stern 'businesslike' attitude which grew into heartfelt love for this little red-headed orphan girl.  Carol Burnett was awesome as the lady who ran the orphanage.  She started out gruff and tumble (and drunk) but as it turns out, she really has a love for these orphans.There is NO comparison to the newest version.  I can't see anyone else playing these parts better than Quinn, Burnett and Finney.  It just isn't the same.  If you want a beautiful musical with fun loving attributes, please see this movie!!!   Your children will love you for it.
Highly Recommended",Annie
75,ken98465,They butchered a classic musical,1,22 April 2000,"This movie is an abomination.  It captures none of the charm and grace of the stage show, and Disney's 1999 version (with Kathy Bates) is far superior for those who have have not been lucky enough to see the play.  Every deviation from the original is a failure, with the worst offenses being the trash with which Tim Curry and Carol Burnett had to work.  I've never been more disappointed or angry with a movie.",Annie
76,laraliu10,How did this beautiful classic get such a low rating???,10,2 May 2011,"I find it appalling and ridiculous that the Disney movie got a higher rating than this and that this movie got a 6! that is just plain stupid. ""Annie"" is a classic, inspirational story. It still is one of my favorite movies, and one of my favorites as a child (well, when I was younger, I'm 14 now). Aileen Quinney (sp.) did an amazing job, she has a beautiful voice and brings such a prescense to the songs she sings. Hannigan and Rooster and his wife whose name I can't remember right now had me cracking up that entire song, they bring a hilarious scene, where Hannigan is clearly drunk, and bring the screen to life with a song that's supposed to be sinister (you will find that I am referring to ""Easy Street"" but I don't want to give too much away). Hannigan was also my main problem with the Disney version, Kathy bates was too strange, Burnett did a much better job, bates was just too strict and serious, while Burnett was more out there and brought some charisma to the part. Oh and I loved Daddy Warbucks, he was a great addition to this movie as well as Grace.All in all, Annie is beautiful movie that is worth a watch. Please, do not listen to these idiots who tell you it sucked and Quinney can't sing, because she can. Just enjoy the movie, it's great and I promise will become a family classic.",Annie
77,CoolLeather,One of the all time great 80s movies!,10,23 January 2001,"Annie (the one and only original 1982 version)represents for me something special in movie cinema.  Growing up with Annie was special.  It used to come on HBO every right around the holidays and recently I owned the wide screen version on DVD (I wouldn't dream of that 19 years ago).  This movie was such a spectacle...one of the greatest 80s movies that the new generation (to my big surprise) don't appreciate, the great music...the rich storyline...a favorite for everyone that I know and in my big family.  To have that glory taken away with such a low rating makes me wonder what people's values are??",Annie
78,ez_magdales,TOMORROW'S THE BEST,9,10 March 2021,"It was so good to watch this classic musical nowadays. As a tennager, I was raised with the 2014 version and I can say that something lacks from that movie. To watch the original is such a dream since nothing can impersonate this beautiful movie. I hope kids can still relate and love the movie since it also has a good lesson. With soundtracks as TOMORROW and IT'S A HARD-KNOCK LIFE, you can totally raise from your couch and sing with the effervescent song! Do yourself a favor and watch this original musical over and over again!",Annie
79,3s2m,Better than its reputation,10,19 February 2003,"Though this film of the musical ""Annie"" has often been criticized for a number of  reasons, it is hardly the worst screen adaptation of a stage musical (the utterly  grotesque 1974 film of ""Mame"" takes that dishonor). This film is not nearly as bad  as people have said. Though not necessarily a great film, it is a good film with a  number of strengths. The film's strongest asset is definitely its cast, the highlight of which being Carol  Burnett, a treat to watch as Miss Hannigan. Newcomer Aileen Quinn plays a charming Annie, Albert Finney makes a wholly convincing Daddy Warbucks, and Ann  Reinking gives a winning performance as his assistant, Grace Farrell. At the film's core is a heartwarming, if somewhat sentimental, story set in the  Depression, backed by most of Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin's unforgettable  score. Six of the play's songs are dropped, and five new ones have been written.  The best of them is the humorous `Sign,' between Burnett and Finney. The large-scale, Busby Berkeley-esque `Let's Go to the Movies,' though it's a nice  song and a spectacular number, it threatens to slow down the picture, and is thus  a bit of a weak spot. It is a forgivable one, though. A song called `Dumb Dog,' whose melody is taken from the one-night wonder ""A Broadway Musical,"" replaces `Tomorrow' in its proper place in the story, which is a  loss. The reprise of the song, `Sandy' works better. The fifth new song, a swinger called `We Got Annie,' is a highly listenable reworking of a song cut from the stage play. Director John Huston, a choice that confounded many in Hollywood, directs the film  with competence, though it's not a personal film for him. Most of the credit for  putting the production together goes to producer Ray Stark. He assembles a production crew that works together to create a visually splendid film with beautiful period sets. The film's production is indeed extravagant, even by Hollywood standards, but only once or twice does it go over the top (as in the end  of the picture). The film as a whole is an engagingly old-fashioned musical spectacle with enough  wit, charm and genuine warmth to offset its core sentimentality and occasional  excess. Though it doesn't follow the stage version to the letter, it still works  pretty well. Score: 7/10",Annie
80,RechRo,A Heartwarming Classic for the Whole Family,10,19 August 2013,"I've had the pleasure of catching this on Starz Kids channel a couple of times recently, and could not help crying every time. Aileen Quinn as Annie is simply adorable. Tim Curry and Carol Burnett make a wonderfully funny and evil team, along with Bernadette Peters as Curry's sultry love interest. Albert Finney makes a fine lovable grouch and Ann Reinking rounds out the principal cast as the warm, lovely mother figure. I can't believe the reviews I've seen knocking John Huston's only musical effort. The songs are great, the chemistry between the actors seems natural, and the film is wholesome. An ideal choice for a family movie night. Huston was legendary for bringing out the best in his actors with minimal interference, and I think it shows once again in this film. The creator of the Razzies, John J.B. Wilson, should have been gelded for allowing sweet little Quinn to receive a nomination for this performance, let alone a win. Shame on you, Wilson!",Annie
81,rowdybuschfan,"A Timeless Classic, but with a few issues",7,26 January 2018,"I recently sat down this week and watched this film for the very first time, It's exactly as everyone has described...a very charming and sweet film that any age would enjoy. It has many broadway style songs in the film to make it even more fun. While it's a great film it does come with some issues and these are just my opinion alone so let's get into it..Pros:
Casting for Orphan Annie was a perfect fit, Aileen Quinn played the part beautifully and Albert Finney as Oliver Warbucks was spot on.Carol Burnett had all the funny lines and nailed them (Personally was the best part of the movie)Great writingHad a few good songs but there were actually a couple I didn't think were necessary and I'll get into that in a bitCons:
As I was saying before, While the movie had some good songs there were like two musicals numbers I didn't think were necessary like ""We got Annie"" and ""Easy Street""Bernadette Peters character just absolutely looked bored and wasn't really interesting enough(Spoiler) The chase ending, Look I think this part could have avoided having Annie hanging off a bridge and just have Punjab rescue her from the top of the bridge and knocking Rooster down would have made more sense. But I'm not the director
Overall, It's a great film but with a few little nitpicks I have",Annie

But then again, the Sound of Music has a low rating too while half the movies in the IMDB top 200 shouldn't be there.Many great scenes: Annie beating up the boys and finding Sandy, Hard knock life, I'm going to like it here. But my favorite is the climax which is dark and filled with tension between Rooster and Annie climbing a bridge with Punjab coming to the rescue. The sets are terrific, the period looks real, the music numbers are all terrific and memorable.A movie that stays with you after you are done seeing it, unlike the movies of today that lack soul.10/10",Annie

85,boydmichael-91,Cute and wonderful,9,29 September 2019,"It's stunningly beautiful and a truly great musical for feel-goodness inside, the orphans are cute and adoring much like the same to the protagonist. Annie's personality is charming,bubbly,cheerful,friendly and sweet (mostly) as everyone knows. You just want to learn them lyrics and musical numbers as they are sung out to you on your screen. What I thought of Hannigan's appearance was like Madame Thernadier from Les Miserables as she has that sort of same behaviour ""now looky here the little madam herself"". I would probably recommend to watch this again.",Annie

And every time I have cried at the bit where Rooster, Lily and Miss Hannigan kidnap her from Daddy Warbucks.Carol Burnett, Tim Curry and Albert Finney are all excellent. As is Aileen Quinn as little orphan Annie. In fact the entire cast are brilliant. Annie is by far one of the best films I have ever seen. One of my favourite parts is the bit where they come in from the movies and Grace and Daddy Warbucks put Annie to bed while she's sleeping. And another fave is when all the kids from the orphanage go looking for Daddy Warbucks' house because they know what Rooster, Lily and Miss Hannigan are up to. Absolute brilliance. One thing I have to say is never, never, never, never watch the sequel. It is complete rubbish!!",Annie
87,laura-hall-schordje,I Wanted to Love This Movie,6,18 November 2017,"I really wanted to love this movie. I have the original cast recording and have known every song by heart for years. It was a good musical, there is a phenomenally talented cast, but it just doesn't work that well on the screen. I am not sure who to blame--director? producers?--but it seems over-produced and underwhelming at the same time. I am watching the end of the film as I write this, and in the last few minutes I have seen helicopters and elephants and fireworks. There is a hugeness to this production that sometimes overwhelms the characters and story. In an effort to make the musical less stagy on the screen, the musical has lost its sense of being a musical. Just before this final scene is extended chase drama that does nothing to heighten tension but simply serves to drag out the inevitable happy ending. Sometimes less is more. At the same time, there is an underproduction to the musical numbers that hurts it as well. For example, when the orphans dance and sing the choreography seems sloppy, like it has not been rehearsed enough or at all. While the effort may be to look natural, it comes off as poorly done. Musicals are NOT natural. They require we suspend our disbelief enough to accept that people break out into song and dance. That the singing and dancing are sloppy looking doesn't make it easier to suspend disbelief. It simply disappoints. Ann Reinking is amazing among a very talented group of actors I have admired in other productions. They do their best here. But the production is not worthy of the talent gathered here. You may enjoy it, but it is sad when Annie is watching a scene at the movies and those (long, long) clips of a film within the film make you care more about THAT movie than the one you are watching.",Annie

89,rdetjen,They are cruel to those kids,1,23 October 2007,"I was shocked to see this movie after at least 15 years. I guess I must have liked it okay before so I bought it so that my kids could see it. I'm just glad I previewed it before they watched it. I have several complaints about this movie, but the two that bother me the absolute most are: 1. Miss Hannigan is drunk the whole movie. Maybe that in itself isn't a reason to hate the movie, but I was appalled about that and the fact that she tried to jump every man that walked into the building. I didn't think that was fitting for a children's movie at all.2. She is abusive to those kids. Hearing her name calling, watching her shove them, forcing them to work to the degree that she does- it all makes my blood run cold. I am shocked and appalled that nobody has complained about how abusive this movie is.I guess my kids won't be watching this one, my husband agrees and I didn't even bother watching the end of it. For a society that has come as far as it has I can't believe that this movie doesn't bother anybody else. I realize they were trying to make a point across, and made her like that on purpose, but it bothers me.",Annie

This is a movie that you should at least know about. The songs are cute, and the performance excellent. I have never seen so young children dance and sing like that. Unbelievable. My favorite scene is ""A Hard Knock Life"". The dancing and the singing is absolutely perfect. But when you have seen the movie once, you can definitely wait some years to see it again. The songs though are worth listening to, and if you listen to them a lot, you may be able to sing along in the bathtub!",Annie
91,thehotttrock,"Really great, and I'm a cold-heart film cynic",7,23 May 2004,"I loved this film as a child and will always hold fond nostalgia for it. You definitely have to watch this from the point of view as a child (with so many ""family"" films out today, I know this might be hard, when their goal has been to entertain everyone).  I loved all the performances in it from Albert Finney to Carol Burnett and Tim Curry.  My most favorite Huston film is The Misfits, but don't expect that from this film, which I think alot of people are doing.  As most directors age, they tend to get ""soft"" in their filmmaking as their hunger is replaced with complacency, but this film isn't as bad as some people describe it. It's a musical, it was made in the 80's, and it's primarily for kids. Compared to other movies made in that time period, this one is actually quite good.  And although I've only seen parts of the newer one made by Disney, this one seems alot more mature and crafted, and not so candy-coated.",Annie

Carol was good but the rest of the movie looked like it was done by someone who had never done a movie or for that matter seen one! I went home and put on Citizen Kane and then watched on the waterfront, finally I was assured there really were good movies out there. I cannot see how this was a classic Broadway play if it was anything like the movie. I suspect that it was not. I enjoy a good musical like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and several others, at least they try to make it look realistic even up to the point of the signing. I did think the Carol was the best part and she can not carry a whole movie by herself when she is not the main star. A major re write and new cast might have made it a better movie. A plot not out of the comic strip would help as well. Avoid this one at all costs. You'll be glad you did!",Annie

Both the adult and child cast really make this movie shine and its amazing how all of the cast can sing! Even little Molly who is only about 6 years old hits her notes. Sure it gets scary at the end but that's how the comics were always written. For Annie to always get into some serious trouble and gets rescued by Daddy Warbucks or one of his bodyguards. The songs were always delightful to listen to and even now I know the songs by heart and can follow along while the movie is playing. Is it as good as the Broadway production?

The plot is excellent and I love the last song, but I don't think that the person in charge of the orphanage should have rode the elephant - it ruins that she is supposed to be evil. I haven't watched the modern version. I think it would be good, but that it would ruin the effect of the last one. Annie is a lovely character and so is her dog.

110,birdie5222,I HATED IT!,1,6 July 2000,"I am surprised to see how many people actually enjoyed this horrible slice of cinema.  Now, I have not been an ""Annie"" fan for long-- I saw my first production of it in the summer of '99, and I was so thrilled with it, I rented the movie right away.  I was appalled almost right away.  Here are my top 10 reasons for hating this movie: 10. ""The Hard-Knock Life"" sequence-- it looked like they were on a playground, not in an orphanage. 9. Toni Ann Gisondi-- I hated her as Molly.  Just not cute enough. 8. The new arrangements of many of the songs.  I especially disliked ""I Don't Need Anything But You"" and ""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here."" 7. Ann Reinking-- Grace is supposed to be a soprano. Hello? 6. Punjab-- Okay, so he was a character in the comic strip, but there was absolutely no reason for him to be in this movie. 5. Carol Burnett-- What in the hell was that performance about?  I love her in everything I've ever seen her in, except this.  She was way too over the top, even for Miss Hannigan, and that's saying a lot considering it's already an over the top character. 4. The added songs.  Personally, I disliked all of them, but one in particular comes to mind-- ""Dumb Dog."" 3. Annie hanging off a drawbridge-- don't even get me started. 2. Aileen Quinn-- vocally, she was halfway decent I suppose, but had all the charm and charisma of a rock, and all the acting skills necessary for portraying a wooden board. 1. The omission of ""Tomorrow."" Sure, they sang it over the opening credits, and sang the White House version, but it never really was a crucial part to the storyline, as in the play.  ""Tomorrow"" is the best song of the whole show, and we, the audience, couldn't listen to it all because John Huston didn't like it. Personally, I preferred the Disney version of the film much better. Although it was shortened, it was much truer to the original story with a much more talented cast to tell that story.",Annie
111,koalacim,my childhood's movie,10,30 April 2006,"Annie is my childhood's movie. For years, i have watched Annie over and over again, after i watched the film, i re-winded it and watch it again. And sometimes i only watch my favorite parts and sing with it, in our beta-max video :) One of my favorite's is the sequence when Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking) dances and sings in front of the house, we've got Annie!!! :) And of course the song ""tomorrow"", it might be the first English song i have memorized fully... i really want to congratulate the whole crew of the film and i wish everybody, had seen Annie, even for once. now i will buy a DVD copy for my little niece and my future daughter/son :) we've got Annie :D",Annie
112,alison-cooke,All-time Favorite,10,22 May 2006,"I am now 27 years old and still LOVE Annie. I was only 4 when it came out and was completely obsessed with it. It's such a great movie... still my all-time favorite. I saw the play last night, which was also good. However, nothing compares to the movie and to Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan = PERFECTION! I love this movie!I read a terrible review of this movie on here and I just don't understand... How could anyone hate this movie so much? It is just a fun, feel good movie. Yes, no sex, no violence (well just a tiny bit). It's such a refreshing movie compared to the movies that are coming out today and that's while it will remain as my #1 on any list of top movies I make. I love it!",Annie
113,lisa_wade19,Amazing!,10,4 June 2006,"I love this film! Aileen Quinn has a spectacular voice. I can't take any other person seriously to play Annie because she plays her too well! Carol Burnett contributes with a fantastic performance as Miss Hannigan, again she is the real Miss Hannigan! The immortal line ""She's a drunk!"" will live on forever ! It's a great film and the actors that starred in it really set the standard. No other cast could pull off this fantastic musical film like they did! Shame Aileen Quinn never did a sequel, she could have been a huge actress in her own right. The other cast members have lept from strength to strength, Carol Burnett most recognisably, most recently appearing in Deperate Housewives. Albert Finney last appeared in My Uncle Silas, a flop TV show in the UK. Tim Curry has also been in many film after Annie , like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Charlies Angels.",Annie

115,teskridg,Carol Burnett vastly underrated in this film.,7,22 May 2009,"I have read numerous reviews of this film that were generally tepid. I think there is a strong tendency to be disappointed in film adaptations of popular works from other genres, especially Broadway musicals. I believe reviewers should try their utmost to review movies independently from previous iterations in order to give potential viewers the best chance to use their information. In particular in this film, the performance given by Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan was deserving of much better kudos from critics than the frequent panning she received, perhaps colored by the reviewers' experience with her predecessors on the stage. I have watched this film many times as my various children insisted on repeated viewings over the years; each time Carol slips out of her chair and catches her chin on the edge of the desk never fails to rip me up. I believe she's worth the price of rental.",Annie
116,oneteardrop-574-799894,Childhood,10,16 November 2009,"I've loved this movie as long as i can remember. While some are critical of the story and song arrangements it has always been my favorite version of this story ever. As I have grown up i have only grown to love the movie more. It is serious and playful at the same time, it is rare that we see a children's musical movie that is so down to earth, dealing with real life concerns, and at the same time still holding onto some fantastical elements. This movie is packed with famous actors/actresses, and you can't find a better ms. Hannigan!!!!!!!! A movie where children act like children....Please consider this movie for loved ones in your family.",Annie
117,truthfully1977,This should get more 5/10 votes! Come on!,10,24 December 2009,"I cant seem to remember the first time I saw this film but I never got tired of it ever since I laid eyes on this one. Every time I feel low this film makes me feel better. Im in my 30's now but this film never fails to make me smile. Aileen Quinn is by far the best Annie. This version is the best. The remake is out of the question. The production was amazing. John Huston did a fantastic job. The actors were perfect. I love Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks and Anne Reinking as the lovely Grace Farrell. Perfect Chemistry. Carol Burnette is hilarious and amazing as Miss Hannigan. Punjab and the amazing orphans. Just great cast! Favorite scenes: It's A Hard Knock Life, You're never fully dress without a smile. The scene where Warbucks finally notice Grace. All the Annie scenes. The saving of Annie by Punjab and Handing Annie to Daddy Warbucks and Grace. The finale was superb. The scene were Grace put Annie to bed with the help of Warbucks was endearing and funny. Ann Reinking is an amazing dancer. Watching the ending I was hoping for a sequel. I can dream can't I!",Annie
118,jkaler123,Some of the language caught me off guard,6,9 June 2021,"I'm not going to write a long review, not really much on it. I'm just going to point out that for a PG movie some of the language was very unnecessary. I had it on for my granddaughter and thankfully she'd lost interest by the time the scene I'm referring too. It's at the end when Annie escapes and they're running after her cursing. It use g- dammit at least 3 times in a row (by Tim Currie's character) I had to rewind it because I couldn't believe my ears. Anywhoo If you have objections to your children hearing that kind language, you may want to skip this one.",Annie
119,moccaprincess01,Wonderfull,10,1 April 2004,"Annie, is a wonderful story about a 10 year old girl in the depression Area of our Nation's history. Her one dream is to find the parents who left her on the doorstep of the orphanage and have a family. The orphans that play her friends are wonderful. As the movie goes on she is choosen to live with the billionare Oliver Warbucks for a week as a publicity tactic. Well, she grew on him and he sent out a search for her parents and couldn't find them because none of them knew about the broken locket that Annie had around her neck. It is a wondreful hartwarming story with great music and great acting it is a must to see if you have not already and if you have it is wonderful to see it agian and again.",Annie
120,Illiana-nilson,Annie Film Review,7,14 June 2012,"Based on a comic strip original written by Harold Gray.  Annie Soon became a sensation that turned into a Broadway musical. It was a huge hit  so Thomas Meehan had the idea to write a book on the musical and received the tony award for the Best Book of a Musical in 1977.  The play ran on Broadway for nearly six years opening in 1977.Annie was set in 1933 during the Great Depression. The Leading cast included Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as ""Daddy"" Oliver Warbucks, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Warbucks' assistant. Miss Hannigan, Played by Carol Burnett and her brother Rooster Hannigan, Tim Curry. Bernadette Peters  Played by Lily St. Regis, and Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. This movie is  considered  an adventure comedy because of Annie's search for her parents and the encounters that she faces throughout the movie.   Annie  is an eleven year old orphan during the 1930's. She is very adventurous and tries to escape many times from her orphanage, where she lives with the other orphan girls.Their caretaker Miss Hannigan, is very mean and treats the girls badly. One day while the girls are cleaning the house Annie hides in the laundry basket and is taken outside to The laundryman who take the sheets and dry cleans them. While Annie is out in the world she see a dog that some boys are picking so she goes and helps. While a  Policeman is watching her for a distance she is caught and brought back to the orphanage. Soon after Grace Farrell Warbucks assistance comes to the orphanage to take an orphan to stay with his for a week and she chooses Annie. Annie and Mr. Warbucks get along very well. Until Warbucks wants to adopt her and she shows him the locket and note her parents wrote to her saying that they would come back to get her. Warbucks decides that he will help her find her parents and reward the parents 50,000 dollars for coming and taking Annie home. But the people who show up and seem to be her parents turn everything upside down and and things take a crazy twist. (spoiler alert)  The costumes in the movie are good at telling the differences between social classes in the 1930's. The clothes of the poor at the time were dirty, old and ripped in some places. When you see Grace Farrell she is dressed very nice as she comes out of the car in front of the orphanage, and you are able to see the differences between how rich people dressed and how poor people were dressed.This shows you  how hard it was during the great depression.  For lower class people who had little or no money. The movie's costume designer does a good job creating images of the hardships that these people went through during the movie. You really feel connected to the movie through the characters clothes. The set design was very well done. It was very elaborate and had many details to show the life  of the characters. You were able to tell a lot about the kids from the orphanage,  where everything was very dirty and old. It wasn't kept in good conditions because they didn't that the time or money. You were able to tell that they did not have enough money and were very poor. Then you have Mr. Warbucks home. It was very big, beautiful, everything was new and kept very clean and tidy. The clothes were new and expensive and kept very well. you could tell that a lot of work was put into the set design so that the audience could get the full effect  of the movie. It helped them  feel the character's pain, happiness, sorrow and anger. My overall opinion of the film was good. I thought the quality of the film was well made. The singing and dancing was well rehearsed and you could tell they put a  lot of time into the choreography and practice. The acting was believable; when the characters faced a problem in the movie you felt it also. I recommend that people who have not seen the movie should see it because it is a classic movie that will make you laugh and cry.",Annie
121,bairbrem68,O please,10,24 November 2004,"Give it a break, what would Christmas be without it. The girl is annoying and it is a little scary to see a ginger afro, but how can you hold it against Annie, good songs and lots of memories, I love watching it..... I am a little corny though... The film isn't meant to be a master piece, they didn't expect to break records for Oscars. It is what it is, a Children's film. For children not for adults, you have to be in the mood, once you are it is really entertaining and the acting is good. As are the voices especially little blonde kid with one line...Rover, why not think it over. I think people are being unnecessarily hard on this one, I usually agree.",Annie
122,Pc_Geak,Expectations,8,9 February 2010,"There is a lot going for this movie; good acting, musical numbers, and overall energy. The main thing people have to realize is there is ""Annie"" the play and ""Annie"" the SCREENPLAY. Both are amazing in their own regard but if you go into either expecting the other be prepared for the differences. The movie holds true to the overall concept but is simply written as a movie aimed towards children. People have to understand that the movie is based on a play and the play on a comic. A lot of people go in expecting one thing and get the next. You have to have an open mind to such things, especially something 33 years old. Either way I completely enjoyed both the movie and the play. Everyone should experience Annie one way or the other.",Annie
123,Spenser71,"""Movie of Tomorrow"" will make you feel like a kid today!",10,20 December 2004,"In a world of stress and problems, it is a refreshing return trip to one's childhood to sit and watch the movie ""Annie"". It is filled with a musically talented ensemble including Hollywood household names like Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. The cast belts songs that each of us who have seen this work of art have, not only grown to love, but find ourselves humming the tunes while we are hard at work in our daily lives. Heading up this multi-talented cast in the lead role of Annie is Aileen Quinn, who sparkles and shines with great optimism throughout the feature and in turn leaves us with a lump in our throat in her tender moments on screen. A must have for any family, a must see again for anyone who wants to take a trip back to their childhood and to happier carefree days. Return to sing along, or watch to learn some unforgettable songs. It is a clean family movie for the kid in all of us.",Annie
124,amberismybaby,Annie is wonderful,10,6 June 2005,I grew up watching Annie and I must say the best song in all of it is little girls. As a mother of 5 girls I wonder why lol. One poster said he hated carol Burnetts part as Mrs Hannigan worst of all. I happen to love her's best of all she made the movie. All of my girls love Annie but this version only they don't care for the remakes. Annie is a classic movie that I am honored to share with my girls today! I have never loved a movie as much as this one. I went through 4 VHS tapes and now own the DVD of Annie. It has stood the test of time. I will not be surprised to see it last another 20 years. I do agree with the omission of Tomorrow it should have been a main part of the show. Albert Finney was great as Daddy Warbucks. I wonder what Grace Farrell is doing now. I tried looking for info on the kids especially Molly I thought she was adorable it seems like the kids aren't acting anymore. Aileen Quinn was the best choice for Annie in my opinion.,Annie
125,madblack_diary,Fun Musical,7,30 August 2013,"Annie was a fun musical. I remember watching it when my mom when I was little. The songs are catchy and Annie/the actress playing Annie was a very likable kid who was a lot of fun to watch and sing and dance along with. I watched it again just two days ago and it obviously doesn't look as cool now that it is so many years old, and it just wasn't as much fun watching as an adult, but this movie obviously isn't for adults so much as it is for kids or at least adults watching the movie with their kids. The songs are still catchy and I'd love for my little girl to end up watching and liking it as much as I did. Worth seeing for sure!",Annie
126,lorneross73,A good family movie,10,14 October 2013,This was the first movie I remember watching I cried I was 7 years old I saw this movie at the new Beverly cinema in Los Angeles California. My parents thought it would teach me to enjoy life I did learn a life lesson that everybody does not have a golden spoon. I wish I had a sister and maybe I might adopt a child someday. The music was very good and it sticks in my head all these years later.Take your kids to see it or rent it. The end of the movie is very scary for very young children. The movie is very different from the play it is more evolved. They should make a follow up as Annie grows up. I hope you enjoy watching the movie as much as I did from LORNE.,Annie
127,tylerzgirl13,Fabulous movie,10,25 February 2005,"I thought that this movie was a real spirit-lifter. It is a movie that I hope everyone who watches it has a change of attitude towards orphans and homeless children and adults. Sometimes I find myself turning my back on homeless people. Although I am ashamed to admit it, I do hope that others will look beyond money and appearance and see what really matters. This movie, once again, was wonderful. I hope that you keep up all of the good work and keep producing and directing movies such as this one. Enjoy all of your comments and all of your hard earned credit that you are receiving and take the time to really preview all of your scripts and watch the movie several times to praise all of your good work. Thank you very much and I will be watching the movies that you produce no matter how long, or short, they might be.",Annie
128,DGroce,What a great movie!,9,7 March 2005,"This movie was one of my first child's absolute favorites, and it became mine, too, as she wanted to watch it over and over again. The lead characters were wonderful, especially Aileen Quinn. She was the perfect little mischievous redhead, very believable. Albert Finney was unforgettable as Daddy Warbucks. Though his character was stern, warmth shone through his eyes when Annie worked her magic on him. Carol Burnett absolutely shone in this movie as Ms. Hannigan, who shamelessly threw herself at the rich Daddy Warbucks. You felt sorry for her, but delighted in her humiliations by the orphans as they played their tricks and tried to make life for her as difficult as she made it for them.It has been years since I've seen this movie, but I will remember it the rest of my life as one of my all-time favorite movies.",Annie
129,damico1482,Being a stickler for detail.,7,24 March 2005,"Not to be a stickler, but the review for this movie says Annie is 11 and runs away to find her parents. She is 10 and runs away all the time just for the heck of it. She stays close to the orphanage because she has high hopes of reuniting with her real parents through her broken locket. That's what paves the way for the kidnappers, it's why she goes to Washington to meet FDR while Grace interviews all the ""hopeful parents"". I have been watching this movie religiously since I was way little (it's as old as I am) and my 18 month old daughter watches it just about every day now too, so I can't help but know these ""little"" details. And the funny thing is, I can't stand Annie herself! LoL.",Annie
130,lisamorris-id,annie,10,4 March 2014,"I have chosen Annie because I like all the song of Annie. I like all characters in Annie and the dog. I know the songs and they are my favourite and I have seen it on the TV. At the beginning they live in an orphanage and Annie is awake and the other girls are asleep. Annie sings thought the film. She gets picked up by Grace in a car to take her to a mansion, Annie loves it she thinks she's a cleaner but she is a guest. Mr Warbucks wants a boy but he is happy with Annie. He decides to adopt her she wants to find her mam and dad. They can't find her real mam are dad so Mr Warbucks takes her away. I don't have any favourite songs because I like them all. The end bit is my favourite because Grace and Mr Warbucks fall in love and adopt Annie and give her a new locket. I like the fireworks in the sky when Annie's name comes up.",Annie
131,A_Scott78,"On ""Annie""",10,31 May 2005,"""Annie"" has always been my favorite movie from the first time I saw it. I grew even fonder of the movie after reaching high school. Where I got the nickname Annie because of my curly red hair and small physic. I was asked numerous times to sing Annie's theme song ""Tomorrow"". My favorite song is ""Hard Knock Life"" so I would tell them, ""ok I will sing tomorrow, I don't want to today!"" To this day if I see someone I went to school with, even if I don't know them, I hear, ""Hey Annie!"" I have been writing poetry since I was 17 and I use the pen name Annie Scott. Annie- from my nick name, and Scott- after my late Grandfather Tim Scott, you can look him up here too. Just type in Tim Scott in the search actor section and see for yourself.

132,Sunshinegirl819,I love It !!!!!,10,31 May 2005,"Ever since I was a small child, I have loved this movie. Even as a grown 24 yr old, this is my favorite movie of all time. It is truly a family film. Now that I have it on DVD, I'm not ruining VHS tapes by watching it so often. One of my Aunts fondest memories of me as a child happens to be me sitting in front of the TV, singing ""Tomorrow"" at the top of my lungs. My favorite scenes would have to be when they go to the movies, the look on the child's face, brings a smile to your own face, and the final scene as Punjab rescue's Annie from the bridge and sets her safely in Warbucks and Grace's arms. This is a movie that I hope one day when I have my own children they will cherish this movie as I have all my life.",Annie

134,carol-198-726369,A GREAT Musical which is a True CLASSIC,10,28 December 2014,"I recall seeing this WAY BACK WHEN in the theater and laughing and enjoying CAROL BURNETT as well as AILEEN QUINN and her OUTSTANDING VOICE and dancing. All that brought Shirley Temple back to me with the simplicity and joy of GOOD musicals. NO BRAIN POWER needed - no SERIOUS CONSIDERATION or heavy political issues. The other wonderful dancers, who we seldom find any longer except in quality theater productions, executed all so beautifully. I think it was really nicely done - FUN - HAPPY - excellent performances - QUALITY singing and more. The song 'TOMORROW' still makes me smile and I TRY to hit the perfection of the notes and sing along whenever I hear it. The song and movie brings me hope in the 2014's. A HAPPY and POSITIVE song for these times and it gives ME hope to TOMORROW. Anyone who has not seen THIS ORIGINAL movie on TV or on a DVD is really missing the BEST. I know a brand new version is being presented with a darling little black/African American girl as 'Annie' (I don't know what is considered POLITICALLY CORRECT to call the cute little gal) just in NOT the same thing. A CUTE movie - but remakes are USUALLY not as good as the original. I can think of DOZENS of movies which in their original release was 'WOW'. They were SO scary - or SO on point - or so outstandingly sad or beautiful or deep that ALL remakes are just CRUMMY in comparison. I am not a professional critic by any means, but I recall movies from 50+ years which really made a difference to me. Some of them influenced my LIFE.",Annie
135,laceejharris,Annie 1982,8,23 April 2016,"Annie is a fun, comical, family friendly musical movie, that was based off the 1977 Broadway production. The Broadway production was based off of the Little Orphan Annie comic strip that was started back in 1924, which unfortunately ended in 2010. It is obvious why many people love Annie. Everyone loved it so much that the comic strip lasted 86 years! It's a loving, inspiring, cheerful movie. It leaves you feeling happy as you sit back and cheer for Annie as she goes through life with an optimistic attitude as she sings ""The sun will come out tomorrow so you gotta hang on 'till tomorrow, come what may!
