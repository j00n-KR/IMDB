0,TheLittleSongbird,"(the one with the scene in the diner) A very funny, witty and charmimg romantic comedy",10,30 May 2010,"Words cannot describe how much I loved this film. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud(I'll have what she's having""), and other times when I was like ""Aww, that's really sweet"". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner(The Princess Bride, This is Spinal Tap and Stand By Me-the latter is a favourite of mine). The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is in one word beguiling. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece, the only scene I was familiar with prior to watching the film. And of course the acting is outstanding; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",When Harry Met Sally...
1,bkoganbing,It took long enough,6,20 August 2015,"Nora Ephron's original screenplay was the only Academy recognition for When Harry Met Sally received when it was nominated. I think it's a funny film, but I'm not as big a fan of it as some are.It's the story of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who take 12 years and 90 minutes plus of film footage to realize they are right for each other. I think the concept interesting but it is also good for maybe a 20 minute sketch as opposed to a feature film.Meg Ryan's faux orgasm scene at the restaurant is still the scene most remembered from the movie and she certainly carries it off with breathtaking style. Some bemused underplaying is done by friends Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher who keep wondering why these two just don't kanoodle and be done with it. My favorite scene is the contrasting split screen phone calls from Crystal to Kirby and from Ryan to Fisher describing the long awaited big event.It took long enough.",When Harry Met Sally...
2,SnoopyStyle,Iconic rom-com,9,24 September 2013,"Sally (Meg Ryan) gives Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more.Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer for modern rom-coms. This movie asks one big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner.",When Harry Met Sally...
3,mark.waltz,A classic romantic comedy with a semi modern twist.,7,3 April 2017,"Can men and women be friends without sexual tension? Well, let me rephrase. Can straight men and straight women be friends without sexual tension? That's what the screenplay of this modern classic asks, pre cell phone era, where relationships of the friendship and romantic kind depended on people having conversations without a gadget in their hand. People had to take the time to really get to know each other, and often, relationships of the romantic kind started off as relationships of the friendship kind. This is two old pros of romantic comedy at their best, although it is obvious that Billy Crystal is simply playing Billy Crystal, not that that's a bad thing.Meeting as travel partners, Crystal and Meg Ryan do not quite hit it off. Although their initial meeting is less than stellar, they don't soon forget each other. Five years go by before they see each other again, and then another few. The third meeting is the charm as what she initially saw him as a freak has turned into something more concrete. It's friendship, not romance however, and being inseparable, certain emotions take over, twisting their initial thoughts about each other into something completely different. As he insisted that women and men can't simply be just friends, will she be proved wrong, or will the romantic bug not bite?Charming and simple, this features some very funny moments and a fantastic supporting cast. Famous for the fake orgasm sequence featuring director Rob Reiner's mother Estelle, this has some allegedly real couples off the street describing their own romantic pasts. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby offer sage advice hysterically as the best friends, while Michelle Nicastro (the very first ""Les Miserables"") plays Ryan's pal involved in a non ending liplock with Crystal in the opening scene, followed by soap hunk Steven Ford missing Ryan at the beginning of Ryan and Crystal's second meeting. Harley Kozak, rising up from soap heroine to film actress, has a brief appearance as Crystal's ex-wife. (Between these three and soap vet Ryan, this had a bit of soap power in its often comic soapy storyline). While Ryan obviously is not a singer (quite rancid actually singing a showtune), she is funny, and next to Tom Hanks, Crystal is her best on screen partner.",When Harry Met Sally...
4,kosmasp,And again and again ...,9,28 June 2020,"Love at first sight or does the flame have to actually be set off over several times? There are different ways two individuals fall in love and we get some interviews here that highlight that. I have not researched if the people in this are actually together or if they just retell stories from actual couples. Whatever the case, the case here is you get a really good romantic comedy.And as far as I can tell it all came about the director having issues in his own love life. Now there is something (a lesson) to learn: even when you are down and don't feel good, you can make something productive. Also reassuring to those who may feel neglected or unsure if they'll ever find love.But this is not just a good comedy, it has one of the best known movie scenes. Just as people are aware of the ""Say hello to my little friend"" line, they are aware of the ""I'll have what she's having"" line. And it is uttered by none other than the mother of the director. Now either this was a therapy session or maybe they needed some after this - or they just have one of the loveliest mother-son relationships, that no Psych should question.Really good and ""real"" movie (the dialog may annoy you, some of you, but it is great and on the spot) that does not feel like it has aged. The director has proven he is good at what he does already ... and here's another example of just that",When Harry Met Sally...
5,classicsoncall,"""We are just going to be friends, OK?""",8,9 January 2015,"Anyone who's ever seen the movie will remember THAT scene, indelibly burned into one's memory banks like so few movie scenes ever wind up doing. Coming out of nowhere, Meg Ryan offers one of the best and funniest deliveries ever, with the ""I'm having what she's having"" follow up just the icing on the cake. Priceless.This is a pretty enjoyable movie; as a classic movie fan of the Thirties and Forties I could imagine Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan pulling off something like this if they were around in 1989. They're a pair that could rattle off the kind of snappy dialog you had here with Billy Crystal and Miss Ryan. The four way phone conversation for example called for incredible concentration and precise timing and along with Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, the principal players delivered big time. Also, before I get off the classic movie theme, the picture had a fair number of references to my all time favorite ""Casablanca"", so that was pretty cool too.But watching today there's also a moment of reflection provided in the scene when Harry (Crystal) and Sally (Ryan) first arrive in New York City, and you can plainly see the image of the Twin Towers silhouetted by an arch where Harry gets out of the car. It's a poignant reminder that we live in a different world and different era today. For a moment, that image changed the tone of the picture for me.But not to get too maudlin over things. ""Harry and Sally"" represents the quintessential 'chick flick' kind of film that gets made every now and then and winds up with a huge following. This one will be watched and enjoyed for a long time, and coming from a guy, I guess that's a pretty good recommendation.",When Harry Met Sally...
6,gavin6942,"Fun, But Too Much Like a Romantic Comedy",6,23 April 2015,"Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) have known each other for years, and are very good friends, but they fear sex would ruin the friendship.This film has become iconic, in part for the scene of Sally ""faking it"", and for its bigger question: can a man and a woman be strictly friends? The answer is one that is open to debate, but no movie is better known for tackling the subject than this one is.And does it answer the question? Well, you have to watch the movie. We cannot give that away. But, unfortunately, despite being a Rob Reiner comedy, it tends to get a bit too close to the ""romantic comedy"" (no doubt because of Nora Ephron's script). This may make it more divisive and less enjoyable a watch for men.",When Harry Met Sally...
7,lee_eisenberg,my orthodontist sat at the table where they met,8,20 August 2006,"I guess that most people can't think of ""When Harry Met Sally..."" without picturing the orgasm scene. Certainly that scene's a hoot, but there is more to the movie (including the line about a New York death). The one song by Louis Armstrong played during the first sequence (""tomato...to-mah-to"") really heightens the mood. Although I usually don't like Meg Ryan, she does a good job here, as does Billy Crystal. Above all, this reaffirms Rob Reiner as one of the best directors of our time. Also starring Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby (RIP).And yes, my orthodontist sat at the orgasm table. Maybe that's not what people usually call it, but that's what I call it.",When Harry Met Sally...
8,jboothmillard,When Harry Met Sally,10,23 September 2005,"From Golden Globe nominated director Rob Reiner (Stand by Me, Misery) and BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated writer Nora Ephron (who went on to direct Sleepless in Seattle) this is a fantastic comedy romance. Basically Harry (Golden Globe nominated Billy Crystal) met Sally (Golden Globe nominated Meg Ryan) after both of them graduated from college, and she gives him a lift top New York, it is in this journey he tries to come on, even when he has a girlfriend, and when she says to just be friends, he says ""Men and women can never be friends, because the sex part always gets in the way"". They don't see each other again for seven years until they are on the same plane, Harry is engaged, and Sally is dating, and he still has a nice chat. Another seven years pass, but this time they stick together as good friends for a long time, after both of them have ended their partnerships. Eventually though, when the opportunity comes, they finally kiss and sleep together, and both regret it after. Sally resorts to ignoring and hating him, and he tries to rekindle the friendship. In the end at a New Years Party though, they both find each other again (after midnight has struck), Harry admits his love for Sally, and she tells him in tears she hates him, before they get the great back together (for good) kiss. In amongst the film are couples being interviewed about how they met and fell in love, and obviously Harry and Sally are the final couple. Also starring Star Wars' Carrie Fisher as Marie and Bruno Kirby as Jess. The two memorable scenes for me are Harry and Sally both on the phone to Marie and Jess, and of course, the one everyone remembers, Sally having a fake orgasm in the café, and then the woman (Reiner's mother) saying the famous quote, number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""I'll have what she's having"". It was nominated the Oscar Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Meg Ryan was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, ""It Has To Be You"" was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 28 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

9,ccthemovieman-1,Pure Rob Reiner/Meg Ryan Garbage,1,13 September 2006,"The ""cute"" movie of the year? ""A wonderful, comic Valentine""? These are just two of the ludicrous ""reviews"" made by famous critics who mostly raved about this film which - and I know this is unpopular to say - was a disgusting, piece of crap.The whole film was nothing but sex talk. Hey, I don't mind some of that. It can very funny. But the whole movie, nothing but sex talk after sex talk? Come on!Well, two people that made this a very overrated film are director Rob Reiner and actress Meg Ryan. Reiner is a sleaze from way back, an extremist who has no clue what morals are, and I don't ever believe I have seen a good movie which starred Ryan. She has a beautiful face, but that's it. Her movies are consistent, I'll give her that - they all stink!",When Harry Met Sally...
10,moonspinner55,Acerbic insights and clever sound-bites,6,2 May 2009,"Nora Ephron's original screenplay for ""When Harry Met Sally..."" often doesn't feel original at all. Her acerbic insights are wrapped up in Woody Allen-isms, while director Rob Reiner lays on the autumnal romanticism of a dozen other movies. Still, it's an enjoyable picture, with at least one line (delivered by Reiner's real-life mother) that still brings down the house. Single man and woman (he the chauvinistic one, she both headstrong and insecure) are thrown together for a one-time car trip, which leads to numerous such meetings in which both characters constantly square off against the other for their respective sexes. Ephron's world isn't peopled with living, breathing human beings ; she's interested in clever sound-bites and lyrical humdingers--anything to get a smile out of the audience. Reiner handles stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan very well, and his chapter stops involving various married couples, done pseudo-documentary style, is cute in a winking, Hollywood way. Still, while the public was tickled and critics were entertained, nobody thought this was great filmmaking, resulting in one Oscar nomination for Ephron. **1/2 from ****",When Harry Met Sally...
11,sunwarrior13,Classic Romantic Comedy,10,21 September 2012,"When Harry Met Sally is a romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City. The film opens with the two strangers,Harry and Sally.Both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be ""just friends."" They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy.It is a touching and funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.And what makes this a classic despite the story's predictability, is the dialogue and the chemistry, which makes for a high-wire act.Most of all,it presents question and provokes thought to both men and women.",When Harry Met Sally...

13,Scarecrow-88,When Harry Met Sally,9,7 August 2013,"Wonderful romantic comedy (one of the best and most memorable from the 80s) focuses on two friends (Harry, a political consultant, Sally, a journalist) who find themselves struggling not to fall in love, attempting to date other people while secretly pining for each other, and soon no longer able to resist the urgings for more than just conversation over long walks and lunches discussing the love-making they could have together. Look, the conversations (with lots of clever and funny banter back and forth, mostly about sex and relationships, what men and women truly think and feel despite what they say and seem to convey) are a major asset between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, but the stars' chemistry (this really sets Ryan's career off) is impeccable. I love the quiet discomfort and inability to dismiss their first sexual encounter as a ""mistake"", and their New Years Eve confrontation, addressing how they truly feel for each other, was a nice way to close the film, the conclusion fitting and satisfying.With Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher perfectly cast as Crystal and Ryan's best buds, a ""fake orgasm"" in a deli (as Ryan (effectively) convinces Crystal that you can fool a man into believing he's successfully pleased his female partner, with the ""I'll have what she's having"" line an absolute classic), several early encounters between Ryan and Crystal that has them arguing about ""what men and women really want"" (Crystal often just aggravating Ryan, getting her emotionally all out of sorts because mostly what he says is true and she can't accept it), and those passing glances of aching and acknowledgment (I had forgotten just how good Crystal, in particular, was at that; Ryan has a character that tries hard to pass off as if nothing about break-ups and ""mistaken sex"" bothers her, but it all eventually spills out when she simply wants a real relationship, meaningful and of depth), as well as, excerpts from real older marrieds commenting on how they wound up together, helped make ""When Harry Met Sally"" such an enduring treasure. Include the New York setting as the obviously appropriate backdrop and the likability of the stars amidst it, and why wouldn't this film remain such a valued and cherished romantic comedy?",When Harry Met Sally...
14,writers_reign,Two Rode Together - Finally,9,3 December 2013,"Coming up to a quarter century and this still entertains. It does more than that, of course, it also leaves in its wake a warm glow. It's tempting to say that it could hardly be better written, directed, and acted. In reality there's a chance - slim, but still a chance - that all three departments could be improved but on the other hand, like the man said, if it ain't broke ... We are, of course, looking at yet one more take on Benedek and Beatrice but given the number we've already had, the majority being successful, so what. As if great writing, directing, and acting weren't enough, they also throw in a great score, plundering the Great American Songbook from half a century earlier, as if to emphasize the timelessness of the story.

15,grantss,Fantastic,10,19 April 2014,"Fantastic, funny, moving, feel-good romantic-comedy. Unlike many romantic-comedies, doesn't get overly bogged down in sentimentality. Despite the high emotional content, the movie glides along effortlessly.Well written. Good plot and the dialogue is intelligently funny and couldn't be more snappy. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfectly cast as Harry and Sally. The chemistry between them was spot-on and contributes enormously to the watchability of the movie. I'm generally not a fan of Meg Ryan, as she tends to act in vapid romantic dramas, but she is great here. Billy Crystal is very well known in comedy circles, but here he gets to shine in a more serious role.",When Harry Met Sally...
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A pretty good romantic comedy,7,6 January 2004,"I have never really liked romantic comedies, I think there's too much crying and sentimental sap. I mostly think of romantic comedies as the kind of movie single women sit down and watch, and cry their eyes out, which is a concept I've never understood. But this movie is definitely one of the better of the genre. I saw it again after having seen it a lot of years ago, and I remembered it as having one single good scene. This is, of course, the famous restaurant scene. But seeing it again, I laughed almost at the very beginning, and kept laughing throughout the next twenty minutes. After that, the hilarity of the characters faded, and it settled by being interesting and capturing. I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters. Unfortunately, it didn't last, and I lost interest for a few minutes, and then I saw a funny scene again, and regained interest. The same thing happened a few more times, I lost and regained interest with brief pauses. The movie is worth seeing if you like this sort of movie, or if you like debates about male/female friendship. I found the ongoing debate in the movie very interesting and thought-provoking, and most of the movie is pretty funny as well. Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny, and some of it is more like recognize-the-situation funny. If it had kept my interest a little better, I would have given it an 8, but as it is, I give it 7/10.",When Harry Met Sally...

Nora Ephron's dead-accurate screenplay and Rob Reiner's sentimentally funny direction make a valentine to falling in love and the war of the sexes answering the age-old question: Can a man and a woman still be friends without the sex thing getting in the way? Crystal and Ryan (both in their best roles) are a stormy couple of platonic friends for over a decade and meet up every so often until finally they face a crossroads in their close friendship with some hysterically funny moments. Ryan's orgasm scene in Katz' Deli is one for the time capsule.

18,anaconda-40658,When Billy Met Meg.,9,30 July 2015,"When Harry Met Sally (1989): Dir: Rob Reiner / Cast: Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Bruno Kirby, Carrie Fisher, Harley Jane Kozak: Sensitive romantic comedy suggesting a pivotal moment when two people meet and what spawns from it. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan become friends during college. Crystal is involved with her best friend but they end up sharing a long car ride home. Story jump ahead several years during the course of the film while they struggle with current relationships and confide in each other. Story is predictable but smart with director Rob Reiner avoiding the clichés and settling for clever conversation between people as oppose to props. Crystal tries to figure out what went wrong in his quest for happiness while Ryan pretends to have it all together but underneath she is fragile. They have superb comic chemistry even though we know where they are headed. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher appear as their friends who seem to have it all together but a double date takes their subplot in a different direction. Harley Jane Kozak appears briefly as Harry's ex-wife, which draws feelings of grief that are only subsided with Sally. Not one of Reiner's best films, which include This is Spinal Tap and The Princess Bride but it is entertaining and enlightening rising above road movie clichés. Intelligent film about how genders view each other. In the end we are glad Harry met Sally. Score: 9 / 10",When Harry Met Sally...
19,Mr-Fusion,Breath of fresh air,7,20 January 2016,"I'm convinced that everyone should see ""When Harry Met Sally"" just for the orgasm scene. I can assure you it's worth sitting through a romantic comedy for (on display here is meg Ryan's considerable charm and comedic talents), and it's a classic piece of cinema for a reason. And speaking of romantic comedies, here's one that defies the ridiculously formulaic nature of the genre as it's become in recent years; intelligent, accessible, and even though the relationship material has been mined by myriad sitcoms over the last twenty years, its voice still seems fresh. The dialogue's got wit, and it works well given this well-chosen cast.Even if this isn't doing it for you, settle in for a great Harry Connick Jr. soundtrack.7/10",When Harry Met Sally...

21,JamesHitchcock,The sex part always gets in the way,8,20 February 2010,"In 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright have just graduated from the University of Chicago and meet when both need someone to share the drive back to New York. During the journey they start discussing their ideas about relationships. Sally believes that it is possible for men and women to enjoy platonic friends without sexual or romantic attachments; Harry disagrees, claiming that ""Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way."" Harry and Sally do not stay in touch after arriving in New York, but they meet again by chance five years, and yet again five years after that. The film then traces the course of their relationship following this third meeting. There is also a subplot about a parallel romance between their respective best friends, Marie and Jess.The film is a romantic comedy with a difference. The plot of the traditional Hollywood rom-com tends to be centred upon some obstacle to the love of the young couple and tells the story of how that obstacle is removed or overcome. In ""When Harry Met Sally"" there is no obstacle to the love of Harry and Sally- except perhaps their refusal to admit that there is no obstacle. The plot, in fact, is a good deal less complicated than that of many romantic comedies, and we know that it is only a matter of time before Harry and Sally will fall for one another. This, of course, raises the question of which of them was right in their original disagreement. The obvious answer, of course, is that Harry was; he and Sally did not succeed in remaining ""just friends"" but ended up going to bed together. Yet in another way Sally was correct. Friendship and romantic love (which is about a lot more than mere sexual attraction) are not as distinct from one another as Harry assumed, and the first can be seen as a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of the second.What sets this film apart, however, from the hundreds of bog-standard rom-coms which Hollywood has churned out over the years is neither the plot nor the ideas discussed but the standards of the script and of the acting. Billy Crystal, another diminutive Jewish New Yorker who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has always struck me as a younger, better-looking version of Woody Allen, and his films often remind me of Allen's. ""Forget Paris"" had something in common with ""Broadway Danny Rose"", and ""When Harry Met Sally"" seems to have been influenced by ""Annie Hall"", another romance set in New York. Harry wisecracks his way though the film like Alvy Singer (and many other Woody incarnations), although he is more self-confident and less neurotic than most of Woody's characters, and Sally may owe something to Diane Keaton's Annie. Even the use of a split screen to show both main characters simultaneously when they are not together is derived from the earlier film.The script is officially credited to Nora Ephron, but in fact much of the dialogue appears to have been contributed by Crystal and the director Rob Reiner, a close friend of Crystal's, and some of the incidents were based on happenings in Reiner's t own life. The film's most famous scene is, of course, the one in the restaurant where Meg Ryan pretends to have an orgasm; the restaurant in question, Katz's Deli in Manhattan, is a real institution, and now marks with a commemorative sign the table where this scene was shot. There is also some very funny dialogue, much of it well up to Woody Allen standards. (""Harry, you might not believe this, but I never considered not sleeping with you a sacrifice"").Both the sparklingly witty Crystal and Ryan are brilliant as the main characters, so much so that one overlooks the age discrepancy between them. (Harry and Sally are supposed to be contemporaries, but in fact Crystal is thirteen years older than Ryan). It is strange to thing that Ryan was not the first choice for Sally; that was apparently Susan Dey, with Ryan several names further down Reiner's list. Although Meg had played the female lead in a few earlier films, such as ""The Presidio"", this was the one that really made her a star, and lead to her becoming one of Hollywood's two great romantic comedy queens of the nineties. (The other was Julia Roberts). Ryan was to work together with Ephron in two of her future rom-coms, """"Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail"". Here her Sally is an enchanting, angelic-looking girl, although one who has her own eccentricities. Besides her tendency to fake orgasms in inappropriate locations, she can be infuriatingly picky about her food, leading Harry to dub her a ""high-maintenance"" woman. (The film was, allegedly, responsible for popularising this particular usage, although here Harry is using the phrase to mean that Sally demands a lot of attention, not, as it is often used today, to mean that she demands that he spend a lot of money on her).I would not rate the film quite as highly as ""Annie Hall"", but then for me very few films can rank with Woody at his best. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is certainly one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties- indeed, it is probably my favourite except for ""Crocodile Dundee"". 8/10",When Harry Met Sally...
22,Smells_Like_Cheese,An ultimate classic that has the eternal question:,7,4 April 2006,"Can a guy and a girl just be friends? Never wondering what it's like to sleep together or have some kind of attraction? Now, I have heard it endlessly about the orgasm scene and I knew I had to see this movie. This actually is now one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's such a classic and is so touching. Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the finest directors of the 80's. He took a simple story and turned it into something incredible.The chemistry between Meg and Billy is so wonderful and you just keep rooting for their characters to get together because you know how perfect they are for each other.

23,MovieAddict2016,Sleepless in New York,9,27 June 2003,"""When Harry Met Sally..."" is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. In fact, this year's ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" is even a pun on it. At least the title, anyway.Many people will tell you the plot is weak, but the movie is good because of characters. Okay, well, I disagree. I think the plot, the characters and the script all work together to form an excellent romantic comedy. Whether it be the irony in the script, the characters' quirks or the smart, snappy, crisp dialogue thrown between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, ""When Harry Met Sally"" not only meets every expectation, but exceeds.The film opens up with Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) driving to New York. Sally is best friends with Harry's girlfriend, Amanda. As they drive along, Harry and Sally start getting into a heated debate over ""Casablanca."" This discussion ends in discussing something a bit more risque: If men and women can sleep together and still be friends in the morning. Harry's standpoint is a no. Sally says yes. Harry explains that ""no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive. He always wants to have sex with her."" Sally replies, ""So, you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive?"" Harry comes back with, ""No. You pretty much want to nail 'em too.""That's the kind of dialogue you get a lot in this movie. If you want to compare Crystal's character to another fictional one, it would be George from ""Seinfeld."" George has all these intricate theories worked out about everything, from double-dipping to violating the ""splash zone."" (If you've seen the episode I'm talking about you'll get it.) Harry Burns is the same way. Only his theories are all on sex, and/or the differences between men and women. You could call him pessimistic. He admits he has a dark side. Sally says, ""I have as much of a dark side as the next person."" Harry replies, ""When I get a new book, I read the last page first so I know what happens in case I die. That, my friend, is a dark side."" Funny, I do the same thing and I've never really thought about it.Writer Nora Ephron based her screenplay on none other than the director of the film - Rob Reiner - and his love life. She sat down with him and another person once, and listened intently to his stories. According to her, she then coughed up a screenplay, handed it to Rob, and they made the film.Rob Reiner is one of the most talented and dependable directors in Hollywood. He adds a certain innocence, a certain charm, and a certain chemistry to his films that is hard to miss. His last great (or very good) film was ""The American President,"" but everyone finds themself in a ditch after a while, and I think as far as directors go, Reiner was one of the most consistently dependable directors during the eighties and nineties. Check this out: ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Misery,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""The American President"": All very good - some great - motion pictures that have become as famous as I don't know what.Coming to the cast, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are an absolute comic and romantic pairing. Every line is real. Every inch of attraction doesn't seem artificial. I swear that the first fifteen minutes of this film has some of the most interesting, engaging and downright smart dialogue I have ever seen in a film. Crystal and Ryan - especially Crystal - really break down everything and kind of make rules out of everything. Like Harry's amendment in the beginning, or how they dissect everything later on in the film and analyze it. I like when characters in films are quirky and have theories on everything. To me, people that have theories on life might as well hold the meaning of life in their hands, because to them, they are.
""When Harry Met Sally"" is a keen observation on modern life, romance, men, women, friendship, and sex. And if you want something a bit tamer and more for the general audience, I recommend ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" which has just as much chemistry and observation going on as ""When Harry Met Sally"" does.
In a time of cheap teen romance films, artificial dialogue and downright uninteresting stories, rarely does a romantic comedy like this come along, and it's an honor to watch something as observational, true, sweet, engaging, humorous, and lovely as ""When Harry Met Sally.""4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",When Harry Met Sally...
24,KineticSeoul,Clever and witty romantic comedy,8,15 February 2011,"This really is a enjoyable witty romantic comedy, from the dialogue to the direction it's all very witty and fun to watch the characters exchange dialogue with each other. This movie starts off with a good amount of impact and for the most part it keeps the impact all the way through it. The relationship this time in this romantic comedy is about two friends one guy and one girl building a relationship by teaching each other about relationship. One from guy's point of view the other from a girl's point of view and it's mostly witty and entertaining to watch these two biker and argue in a mostly friendly manner. Harry Burns(Billy Crystal) just didn't seem like a good match with the beautiful Sally Albright(Meg Ryan) but the chemistry is believable and good to the point it's all mostly passable. Plus it just proves that it's not about all looks when it comes to women. Billy Crystal played the obnoxious and yet likable character really well. The comic relief is also clever and it's a breath of fresh air, it can be enjoyed by almost anyone and has aspects of it that can be discussed with friends after it's finished. Highly recommend this to almost anyone, especially for those that like romantic comedies.8.2/10",When Harry Met Sally...

26,ElMaruecan82,When Rob Met Nora ...,8,10 November 2011,"If it's romantic and funny, it's a good romantic comedy, plain and simple. On that level, Rob Reiner's ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a 10/10 but there wouldn't be much to say and the praise would be more disrespectful than the critic, because obviously, the film tries (and succeeds) to be more than a 'rom-com', it's a very interesting gender relationship study with an undeniable pedagogic value.And this probably is ""When Harry Met Sally"" unfortunate dilemma, it succeeds so much on the wit and romance department, that it sometimes undermines the realism of the 'social commentary' aspect. Yes, romantic comedies are not the most likely to depict reality with a documentary-like quality, but the Oscar-nominated script of Norah Ephron proves that sometimes, even intelligence can be incompatible with realism. When you have to conclude by a "" but then, there would have been no film"", you know something didn't work.But first, allow me to say that I really love the film, and this has a lot to do with the performances of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, who form one of the greatest romantic duos, if not the greatest. Harry is oddly appealing as the lunatic, part-anguished part-self-confident guy, with this poignant mix of macho attitude and vulnerability, while Sally shines as the adorable cute face, constantly smiling and optimistic free-spirited girl, the winning yin to Harry's annoying yang. Harry and Sally are as contradictory as moon and sun, Mars and Venus, both embodying the opposite poles that separate women from men. No wonder that in their first encounter in 1977, they have a problem of communication, especially on the touchiest subject: can a man and a woman be friends, without having sex ruining their friendship.This is the intellectual core that drives the relationship's evolution and since Harry doesn't believe in the non-interference of sex, and since she doesn't like him, both can never be friends. Then they meet again in 1982, where their 'qualities' are even more emphasized, the result is hilariously disastrous but we know it's just a matter of time so they finally get in the same wavelength. And after five crucial years, Harry and Sally's respective divorce and break-up finally relieve them from all their preconceived ideas. Life is build of dreams and experience on disillusions, so the Harry and Sally who meet again in 1987 are the real ones, who can start a nice and warm friendship, cleared from any sexual tension.But Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron aren't fooling anyone, Harry and Sally are passionate, romantic, they need love, not friendship, and the absence of sex plays as a paradox as it plants the seeds of a relationship that would ultimately need it. The significance of the film before the pivotal sex scene is to play as a 'Man and Women' cinematic ""How To"". It works as a more approachable version of Woody Allen's films, like a ""Annie Hall"" marketed for a wider and less sophisticated audience, allowing it to identify with Harry and Sally, so, as I pointed it out, in my ""Annie Hall""'s review, the most intellectually challenging stuff they discuss is the ending of ""Casablanca"".But the movie still works because the two leads are so adorable and funny together with the highlight of the film set in an ordinary Deli's restaurant. Many would criticize the unrealism of Sally's fake orgasm scene, but the timing of the scene, and the facial expressions of Crystal with the ""I'll have what she's having"" as the icing on the cake perfectly work. The problem of the film is elsewhere, after a while, we know they're made for each other, we're ahead of them, just like their respective friends played by Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, so we wait for sex to point its nose and then see how it will change the face of their relationship. And this is where the movie lost me. When I saw Sally's beatific smile contrasting with Harry's devastated eyes, I was disappointed because I expected a moment of ecstatic realization.I couldn't believe Harry would brutally leave Sally, more lovely and loving than she ever was, pretending thereafter that it was a mistake. I didn't buy it especially because I rooted for Harry and identified with his existential interrogations. The whole film was punctuated with delightful scenes where older people were telling the way they met, whether it was coincidences or loves at first sights, highlighting a romantic view that would foreshadow Harry and Sally's destiny. For me, having sex together should have been the counterargument not the confirmation of Harry's immature theory. This contradiction left me believing that Harry acted that way just because is was scripted so, and I couldn't get the reason of the mistake until I saw the 'Making Of'.Basically, the film was about Reiner's experience as a single man, translated by Nora's script, and her personal ideas about women and men. Whatever Harry and Sally said was what Rob and Nora believed in. This worked on an 'Allenian' level when they were friends but when they got over the sex barrier, the director and the writer should have left the characters speak for them instead of keeping on studying all the possibilities before Harry would finally declare his love, this was a needless 'suspense'. What follows, till the climax, works like a 'Rom-Com for Dummies' that only works because the actors play their part perfectly? So Harry finally realize that he can't live without Sally, he needed the separation to understand that he should keep this gem of a girl for him, before it's too late.Yes, sometimes, it takes one separation to understand the value of what or whom we're losing, and I'm speaking for my own experience. But the way it was done looked too prefabricated for me, when the realization should have realistically come from the sex scene, or never  but then there would have been no film",When Harry Met Sally...
27,paul2001sw-1,Sex in the city,8,24 October 2005,"Irritating, cynical, emotional Harry (played by Billy Crystal) and irritating, ditzy, repressed Sally (Meg Ryan) have a long term non-sexual relationship before finally living happily ever after. There might seem to be a lot to dislike about Rob Reiner's comedy before you start watching it, but a sparkling script by Nora Ephron ensures that in practice, you have to forgive it it's generic rom-com structure and give yourself up to the laughs. At the time when 'When Harry Met Sally' came out (and in fact, ever since), there was a lot of media comment about one of Harry's propositions, namely that men and women cannot enjoy platonic friendship. But the film doesn't answer its own question, and even where the movie is insightful, this insight seems very restricted to the peculiar world of New York's professional dating classes. Perhaps we should blame this film for 'Sex and the City'. But while it may not be deep, the simple fact is, it's funny, and almost impossible not to enjoy.",When Harry Met Sally...
28,ThomasDrufke,one of the best rom-com-drams,9,20 May 2014,"I think what makes this movie so special is that everyone can relate to this story. It tells that classic story of long time friends who cant seem to accept each other with other people but don't have the guts to make a move on each other. You can tell from the first scene that Harry and Sally both feel some romantic tension between them. Obviously at first they each want different things with a partner. This is shown by their disagreement with the end of Casablanca. I thought that was a clever way of setting up the ending. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have great chemistry throughout. Which is especially impressive because of how many different meetings they have together. Whats a good romance without a few tear jerker moments? Well this movie definitely has a few, as it most likely one of the top love stories in cinematic history.I really liked that they had their friends set up, and then ended up helping get them married. To me that shows the hope for Harry and Sally in the second half of the movie. For some reason Harry and Sally cant accept being together, even though in the first scene Harry states that men and women can never be friends. Rob Reiner directs each character with flaws so that we aren't finding ourselves only rooting for one side. They try to date other people but you can tell that each time, tension rises and all result in break ups.I think my only complaint for the movie would be that it seems like in movies when a fallout in a relationship happens, its always the man who gives in and ends up trying to resolve the situation. They portray the women to be the stubborn ones and wait until the man calls her. Even if thats what happens I would like to see a refreshing take on that. But in a romantic movie you want the ending to be emotionally moving, and this one delivers. Their final scene together is heartwarming and overall pleasing. You really feel you went on this ride with this couple for a few hours so when you get an ending that hits, its extra satisfying. +Billy Crystals rants on relationships+relatable for everyone+an ending that actually delivers-vague male stereotypes9.3/10",When Harry Met Sally...
29,gbill-74877,"Entertaining, but Woody Allen-lite",7,2 November 2021,"Certainly has its place in the romcom genre, but not quite as good as I remembered it. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play people trying to navigate the world of being single, as well as what it means to be friends with a member of the opposite sex. They start off as brief acquaintances who are mostly annoyed with one another, then run into each other after years have passed and develop a platonic friendship, even though he doesn't believe women and men can ever truly be friends because ""the sex part always gets in the way.""Crystal's character is rather smug and irritating, and even though he evolves over the movie, the film seems to take his view, which to me was simplistic and outmoded. He bins women into high maintenance and low maintenance, men talking to each other only about sports, and makes an incredibly offensive joke about the famine in Ethiopia which killed over a million people just a few years earlier. He quips about an Ethiopian restaurant, ""Hey I didn't know that they had food in Ethiopia. This will be a quick meal. I'll order two empty plates and we can leave."" Good lord.Offsetting this are some memorable moments, like Ryan faking an orgasm in a crowded restaurant (never mind that her strait-laced character would probably never do this), as well as some wonderful interviews with older couples talking about how they met (never mind that they were all actors). Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are pretty good in their supporting roles as well.The film trundles along to an ending we know is coming, which is fine, it's a romcom after all, but along the way it felt mostly like Woody Allen-lite. The soundtrack, Manhattan setting, dialogue dealing with death, various plot devices, etc ... it all seemed like Annie Hall, but not done as well.

31,lesleyharris30,"A Unique Romantic Comedy that Stays Fresh After All These Years,",10,4 July 2014,"When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant movie with a very well written plot and a talented comedic cast. The movie is a very unique romantic comedy, probably my favourite one because the characters' relationships are so realistic and they behave like real men and women instead of just a cliché romance film couple. The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is outstanding and certainly the best part of this movie, Crystal's character is nothing like any male character you've seen in a romcom before, he says things you'd never expect to hear in a movie. Meg Ryan's character is well developed and not just second best to Crystal's character, they wrote this movie so that both had equal importance and neither had more character development than the other.The movie certainly withstands the test of time and will for years to come because a relationship between a couple has always stayed the same and this is the most grounded towards that relationship. When Harry Met Sally is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy, in my opinion,it's the one best there is. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) first meet on a road trip to New York, they do not meet each other again until five years later, they keep running into each other and decide to become friends, although they fear they might be more there.

32,vincentlynch-moonoi,Pretty good -- but episodic -- love/hate/love story,7,21 August 2013,"I'm not sure why I never caught this move before...after all. it's been out there for 24 years. But, I'm glad I did. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's a very good movie.I know. Some of you are upset that I don't think it's great. I'm not totally into what I'll refer to as ""episodic movies"". I like a movie that flows. And this one really didn't. Various episodes were punctuated by old couples briefly telling how they met. I enjoyed those little vignettes between episodes...but I just don't like episodicness (and yes, I know that's not a word).Now, aside from that, it's a good movie. Boy meets girl. Boy and girl grate on each other. Boy and girl keep running into each other every few years. Eventually boy and girl fall in love, but not until they've annoyed the hell out of each other every once in a while. And every once in a while along the way, there's a heckuva funny line.There are really only 4 actors worth mentioning here. To begin with, Billy Crystal as the male lead. I'd forgotten he was once young; like back when he was on ""Soap"". But what I found interesting about his performance was that in terms of phrasing, he's still sorta the same. Meg Ryan...well, I've come to like her as an actress, but I never really noticed her until 4 years later in ""Sleepless In Seattle"". Here...well, she's an actress...but not quite Meg Ryan, yet. Here, I was not overly impressed with her as the female lead. Carrie Fisher is her best friend, and does nicely. She's pleasant enough, but not good enough to have maintained her star status from ""Star Wars"". Bruno Kirby was pretty good as the best friend's husband and pal to Crystal. He had a period of playing this sort of role rather well.It's interesting to watch this Rob Reiner film in what would have been his formative years.So for me, this film doesn't set the world on fire, but it's pretty good.",When Harry Met Sally...

38,TheMovieDiorama,When Harry Met Sally is a fresh modern take on the tired romantic comedy genre.,7,26 February 2018,"Suffice to say throughout the course of Hollywood, we have been faced with many romcoms with most ultimately failing. However, the late 80's and early 90's added many entries that reinvigorated the genre. In this sweet flick, sweet and sarcastic Harry meets sweet and beautiful Sally. Then the sweet couple meet again. And then again...and again. Oh, and again. Basic plot full of conveniences, but director Rob Reiner took the risk of removing a complex and captivating story to flesh out the characters. I can see why this is popular yet I do see issues that detract from my personal enjoyment with the film. Firstly, I adored the minimalistic approach that Reiner took. Just two friends communicating. That's all this film is. There is no plot device. Instead we experience the natural progression of two friends slowly falling in love as they spend more time together. Incredibly relatable and insufferably sweet. The only thing sweeter than this is a bowl of sugar. The narrative boasts an utterly witty screenplay that brings these characters to life. Perhaps slightly too focussed on the topic of sex. Billy Crystal's Harry is brimming with sarcasm and a dark intelligent sense of humour whereas Meg Ryan's Sally reeks of innocence and exhumes optimism. The juxtaposing personalities make for some compelling conversations including, but not limited to, an orgasm reenactment in the middle of a diner. Sally's got balls. Big balls. Meg Ryan's performance was solid however I felt Billy Crystal was too monotonous in an attempt to come across as sarcastic. Didn't really connect with him. The lack of substance within the plot does unfortunately prevent a thrilling story and I did occasionally find myself disconnected with the narrative. However this is just a personal preference. As a romcom, When Harry Met Sally is refreshingly innovative that can be enjoyed by all, just too sweet and thinly plotted for my liking.

They end up having mutual friends, they fall in love, they fall out of love, and you'll have to watch the rest of it.There is an all star cast, with an all star director, with I believe a great vibe to close out the 80's era.

40,matthewssilverhammer,Perfect,10,27 April 2019,"When Harry Met Sally... does something most rom-coms don't have the guts to do. Instead of presenting a couples meet-cute as the end-all, be-all of their relationship, it treats it merely as a wonderful anecdote. The truth of romance isn't the perfect, magical moments we tell at dinner parties, but is the endurance of the commitment and love. Reiner proves this through transcendently great characters and a unique series real-life vignettes of couples telling their own stories. That interest in familiar sincerity gives us a rom-com that's both honestly romantic and truly comedic, never sacrificing one for the other.
It's a ten-year journey of two people who hate each other, become friends, and inevitably but unintentionally fall in love; the kind of comedy Woody Allen could've made if he weren't so cynically self-obsessed. Ryan and Crystal get past their own professional limitations, stepping into their titular roles with endless likability. Their magnetic radiance helps sell every ever-changing aspect of their relationship.
But the script is the star here. The dialogue sweeps you up, having the bounce of old screwball-fare, but with a more naturalistic touch. Moments like ""I'll have what she's having"" have become so ubiquitous, we forget how perfect they really are.
Best of all, it manages to present the western stereotypes of men and women, while never defending them as absolute truth. Reiner and writer Nora Ephron use those stereotypes, certainly, but not as exact sciences so much as comedic tools, before upending them wherever possible.

42,jzappa,Among the Elect Posse of Exceptionally Valid Romantic Comedies,10,26 August 2009,"When Harry Met Sally... is among the elect posse of exceptionally valid romantic comedies, because each scene ends, in whatever way, significantly different from our expectations. Many girls, and guys, like my dad, which is strange, are drawn im perpetuum to films that have been made since that ride roughshod over nuance in favor of embellishing every emotional cue to the degree that we won't be surprised if leafhoppers just began feeding off of them. But only seldom has a modern romantic comedy with all the button-down ingredients---Manhattan yuppie life, New Years' Eve drama, man-to-man hoo-ha in the batting cage, humor drawn from a woman's uptightness---really worked on a sincere and disciplined level like this film, which even has the shrewdness to make a Harry Connick, Jr. soundtrack appealing.Minus the machismo complex, a chick flick is slang for a film designed to appeal to a female target audience. Including the macho dismissal would mean reference to films that are heavy with emotion or contain relationship-centered themes. Including the macho dismissal, this movie is not a chick flick. As for minus: If it's good, it doesn't matter. With a combination of imagination and realism, Nora Ephron's big breakthrough script raises the question ""Can men and women ever just be friends?"" and advances many notions about love that have become household concepts now, like the ""high-maintenance"" girlfriend and the ""transitional person.""Ephron never seems to have a problem with crafting very tight-knit self-contained plays from scene to scene, aligning broad comedy and seasoned pondering so that they spring from the same catalysts. Rob Reiner keenly gift-wraps it for us, with the thematic progress and humor reassured, but it is never disingenuous. Yes, that's Meg Ryan. Yes, that's Billy Crystal. But they come off just as real as Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher effortlessly do. The beats and timing, even when exaggerated, are unflappably natural. Caryn James said it was like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an awkward familiarity. In spite of my normal defensiveness of this film, not to mention any and every Woody Allen one, I think I can live with that assessment on the grounds it is succinct and indeed comparable.",When Harry Met Sally...

The film tells the tale of two people Harry and Sally(both played by Billy Crystal from Monsters Inc,and Meg Ryan who was in Sleepless In Seattle and of course Kate & Leopold). The story chronicles on these two people who were friends for years and over the course of the film the two start to like each other more than friends when they meet up a few years later,but they are now dating other people. So will they won't they get together?. Also the film shows segments of people who fell in love and talk about what attracted them to their potential partners in the first place.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie as I am a huge fan of Meg Ryan since I was a kid and its a pity she doesn't do movies anymore as she was very good at doing romantic comedies.The chemistry between her and Billy Crystal was very good and lets not forget the fake orgasm scene where she does it at a restaurant and everyone watches in shock. And of course the ending was predictable but hey that's romantic comedies for ya. Meg was very young back when she did this movie and she went on to star in some hit movies(Sleepless In Seattle,You've Got Mail,Anastasia) and some that just didn't do that great(Kate & Leopold and I liked that film A lot).Overall I say check it out. Its a feel good romantic comedy for all you hopeless romantics out there.Good",When Harry Met Sally...
44,mjneu59,hard to imagine a more pedestrian romance,5,14 January 2011,"It isn't exactly love at first sight: Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan share a car from Chicago to New York, and after a decade of chance encounters finally become close friends. But by mutual consent the two are determined not to sleep together, thinking that a commitment between lovers would somehow jeopardize the casual rapport they otherwise enjoy. Will they or won't they? It's a ridiculous argument at any rate: men and women can of course be just friends, but there's no reason for this couple to prove the point, since both are young, single, compatible, obviously attracted to each other, and have no luck with other partners. Nora Ephron's overwritten screenplay benefits from two stars with plenty of chemistry, playing characters with very little appeal: Harry is smug; Sally is cuddly; and neither is able to define him- or herself outside of a sexual relationship. Meg Ryan fakes a good orgasm, and the film in general does an even more convincing imitation of 'Annie Hall', to a point where it could easily suffer from charges of plagiarism.",When Harry Met Sally...

46,estebangonzalez10,I'll have what Reiner was directing in the 80's,10,15 September 2015,"""I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.""My favorite Rob Reiner film has always been When Harry Met Sally, a romantic comedy that I never expected to enjoy as much as I did. It's the best Woody Allen film not directed by Woody Allen. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's quirky chemistry in this movie is probably one of the best I've seen in any film. Reiner is a director that is hard to categorize since he has worked with different genres: thriller with Misery, fantasy/adventure with The Princess Bride, coming of age with Stand by Me, mockumentary with This is Spinal Tap, drama with A Few Good Men, and comedy with The Bucket List. He's made his share of bad films (his latest films are probably his weakest), but he seems to have excelled in every genre without establishing a common trademark. You could watch When Harry Met Sally back to back with Misery and you'd never guess it was directed by the same person. The secret to his success with this rom-com is that the relationship feels true to life as he first introduces these flawed characters that don't seem to care too much for each other, but over the years they begin bonding and establishing a strong friendship. These characters are so relatable and we can see ourselves or our friends in the film. It reminds us of that friend of the opposite sex we had and how easy it was to blur the line between friendship and love. It makes us think of that universal question: Can a man and a woman be best friends without falling in love with each other? A lot of credit must be given to Nora Ephron's Oscar nominated screenplay because the dialogue and debates between the main characters are authentic and sharp at the same time. There are so many memorable scenes, including the fake orgasm which turned Meg Ryan into such a star, but the final tear jerking scene is my favorite because Billy Crystal delivered his lines in such a perfect way. Even the scenes where old couples are being interviewed in documentary style works perfectly and serves a purpose other than simply serving as transitions taking place in the story. The honesty that comes through in each conversation between Harry and Sally and the incredible chemistry between them is what makes this one of my go to films when it comes to recommending a romantic movie.

Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan first meet in college and run into each other several times over the years, gradually forming a friendship and eventually a romance despite Ryan's assessment that a man and a woman ""can't be friends.""

51,gcd70,Romantic comedy with attitude a disappointment,4,17 February 2008,"Rob Reiner has presented us with the strong coming of age tale ""Stand by Me"", the frightening ""Misery"" (both penned by Stephen King) and the dramatically powerful ""A Few Good Men"". It seems a shame to have to group this somewhat contrived 'romantic comedy with attitude' in with such fine films. Alas this big disappointment from 1989 is also a Rob Reiner film.Billy Crystal's cynical eighties philosophies and morbid character make it hard for him to inspire the audience, and try as he might, he cannot manage to win anybody over for the entire film. Meg Ryan makes a pretty little damsel in confusion, but nothing else, while Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher just fill in the blanks.The final, and probably most crucial weakness in this picture is Nora Ephron's screenplay, which has several similarities to her more recent triumph ""Sleepless in Seattle"". Sure there are some very funny scenes and lines dotted throughout (especially the now famous restaurant scene), yet the comedy is largely inconsistent. For just 93 minutes, the movie really drags, and the whole destiny theme is too obvious, making it romantically predictable, like ""Sleepless"". Again the musical interludes just don't work, and so ""When Harry Met Sally"" ends up relying entirely on its wit and the two lead performances, leaving it obviously lacking in entertainment value.Also, this 'girl thing/guy thing' Nora does, which almost pits man against woman, may be accurate occasionally, but it's far too negative for me. Certainly no substitute for entertainment of the calibre of ""While You Were Sleeping"".Friday, July 14, 1995 - Video",When Harry Met Sally...

It may be the opinion of this critic, but the world would be a better place if all couples had the same kind of conversation that Harry and Sally have. Considered a favorite by many, When Harry met Sally is the story about how Harry met Sally. Throughout the movie, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan do not hold back their true feelings and opinion. The end result is a happy and realistic ending. Much of the conversation between the two are not only entertaining but far fetch. Many people hold back their truth feelings let along the truth.

There is a good pace and some very clever direction.It is very typically 80's, the hair more than anything, but it still works.I don't know if it's just because it's Meg Ryan, but it seems to bear some similarities to 'Sleepless In Seattle', perhaps it's the filming style or the Nora Ephron connection.Billy Crystal isn't your standard sexy male lead, but he is a character and that's something that a lot of films miss these days. The couples get together, because they're both beautiful and successful, but where are the films about the frumpy looking potatoes like me? We need hope that it's possible to find love too ya know?Carrie Fisher in her supporting role thrives in this sort of thing and without being sucked out in to space and using the force to survive too.Bruno Kirby does a good job as well, it's a shame to have lost him at such an early age.Overall, it's a charming film, with some good humour and cute romance.

Not that they've succeeded. But this movie that's often imitated, never duplicated is flawless from start to finish. Meg Ryan who I'm not a major fan of is adorable as Sally, sadly though I think this role may have ""typcast"" her a little. Billy Crystal is wonderful, I enjoyed this so much and it's one movie that can be watched over and over and never loses it's magical flavor.This is definitely up there as one of my favorite romantic comedies ever And it does something that is rare in these types of movies, it manages to be sweet, funny AND extremely deep with incredibly intelligent dialogue and unforgettable characters.I love the theme of the movie, and that it is interesting and thought provoking while still being fun and humorous-it looks at male/female relationships-can men and women just be friends? I really am not sure, in real life, the movie would have had the ending it did but hey you never know. So many people love this movie and have made comments, I'm not even gonna go on.

56,Spleen,When Harry Met Someone,9,16 December 1999,"This is Billy Crystal's show.  He has an understated, ordinary, humble screen presence.  It's not the case that every single line HAS to be funny in order for us to like him - with Crystal, a joke can fall flat and somehow it doesn't make him personally look bad.  But here every line IS funny, so he has charm to burn.I know people like Meg Ryan - I guess I do, too, in this particular film - and I know that there are people who find her `orgasm' scene amusing, but Sally is really just someone for Harry to meet and ultimately fall in love with.  She's completely clueless.  Most of the jokes are at her expense rather than his.  The genuine wit, the power of observation, the theoretical insight, all lie with Harry.  Is this a problem?  Not in the least.  Unlike most romantic comedies this is not some kind of duel - it's the more realistic study of many, many separate encounters.Also unlike most romantic comedies, this one is funny.  I think I mentioned that.The film benefits from its second rank support: good performances by Carrie Fischer and that guy whose name doesn't matter, locations someone actually went to some trouble to look for, and a song-score that is doesn't intrude and hit us repeatedly over the head.  Allegedly `When Harry Met Sally' has been imitated by later productions, but I can't think of a case where the imitation is accurate enough to even be recognisable.",When Harry Met Sally...

This story felt like choppy on some parts with all the supporting characters didn't have any adequate character development. But by maintaining the focus only on Harry and Sally, the movie kept the whole thing intact well enough. The movie also feels lacking in terms that it didn't really use the location to interact with. The comedy inserts are nicely done since they don't come often, but when they do they can really crack up laughs. The scene with Sally's fake orgasm is one of the classics indeed. The acting overall is nice. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan showed nice chemistry to make their roles come to life.

58,Galina_movie_fan,"""Where Harry met Sally... Hope you have what they had""",10,1 June 2010,"This is a movie that would make Woody Allen proud of - funny, touching, witty, sparkling as champagne, stylish, sunny and clever. It may not consist of the original situations but it looks at the familiar situations from some very special angle, which makes it romantic, sweet but not cloyingly saccharine-sentimental. This movie proves what a talented director Rob Reiner is or at least was back in the 80s-early 90s when he made This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Stand by Me (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), When Harry Met Sally...(1989), Misery (1990), and A Few Good Men (1992).
New York where Harry and Sally keep bumping to each other is beautiful as Paris and attractive, like a dream. Musical score goes directly to a viewer's (at least, this viewer's) heart. But the most interesting in the movie are the two main characters, Harry and Sally, complete opposites, friends for 12 years, the confidants and supporters in each other past relationships gone wrong and broken hearts these relationships cause. Harry and Sally are destined to be together, and the fates stubbornly drove them close until they finally realize that happiness is only a phone call away. Meg Ryan is extraordinarily sweet and cute in the movie, Billy Crystal - funny and charming. The film about them forever has the place in history as one of the best romantic comedies ever, and it deserves it status fully. Almost ten years before the famous television series Sex and the City, Rob Reiner, Nora Ephron (screenwriter), Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal along with Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby told a great story about the search for a kindred soul in the big city, for the unique half that makes us complete. Is ""just friendship"" possible between young and attractive heterosexual man and woman? Probably yes, but I am glad that this film's friendship gradually and naturally turns in true love, when you know your partner all too well with their pros and cons, and cons are just as dear as cons. 
Nora Ephron, who wrote the script that based the main characters on herself (Sally) and Rob Reiner (Harry), was nominated for writer's Oscar. Ephron wrote the scripts to and directed such popular films as Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, and Julie & Julia, but her masterpiece, in my opinion, is the screenplay about Harry and Sally in NYC back in the end of the 1980s. Interviews with the real couples, added to the film, perfectly complement and bring out the story of Harry and Sally. The scene in the restaurant is considered one of the funniest of all time, and very deservingly so. Bravo, Meg! Incidentally, an older woman at the next table, which tells the waiter, ""I'll have what she is having"", is the director's mother, Mrs. Estelle Reiner. The scene was filmed at the Katz's Delicatessens in Manhattan. At the table, where Sally and Harry sat, to this day there is a sign: ""Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had"".",When Harry Met Sally...
59,PredragReviews,'I'll have what she's having',8,6 April 2017,"It is a great love story and a great comedy, and the segments with old couples telling the story of how they met (based on the real life stories of the crew's families) are brilliant, and will have you look back on when you met your significant other. The movie world owes Rob Reiner a favour for the fact that his fine film is truly timeless. Part of this is due to the fact that it is set over a fifteen year period. Part of it is due to the fine easy listening score. Most of it is due to a very refined director extracting two brilliant performances from a flawless script and a perfectly cast couple of actors.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the titular two, and neither have ever been better. The observation of their relationship is utterly convincing and completely engrossing. Beyond this, there are subtleties that neither actor has ever shown before or since. There are moments early in the film where we can see Sally is falling for Harry (for example, her response to Harrty telling her he is pleased she is going on a date with another man) but these moments are never overplayed. The credit for this is due as much to Reiner as it is to Ryan, as it is his pacing of the film that really allows the actors to embrace their characters.The film is a perfect balance. Its story-line unfolds like real life without seeming thin or dissatisfying, and the viewer never loses interest. Both Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally are perfect; in 1989, the former was still funny, the latter was still charming, and both of them were still young. The chemistry between them is flawless. But this would be nothing without the dialogue. The film's razor-sharp, conversational dialogue is the true selling point. Witty, realistic and above all hilarious, it's what makes the film the classic it is. Making legitimate observations about relationships, combined with some laugh-out-loud moments (the white- man overbite, for example), the film draws you in, makes you laugh and then, at the risk of sounding clichéd, makes you think.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",When Harry Met Sally...
60,eric262003,The Performances Are Just Magical,9,24 February 2014,"Though I am not the biggest aficionado of romantic comedies, but there are two romantic comedies that that are absolutely spell-binding. The first one is Annie Hall and the other one is the classic 1989 movie When Harry Met Sally. What makes When Harry Met Sally standout is the glaring energetic integrity it has backed up by the equally compelling script by the late Nora Ephron which goes beyond the formulaic run-of-the-mill boy-meets-girl cliché that most romantic comedies suffer through.The emotional build-up has a lot coming for it from the beginning and never once does it ever go back. Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) have been meeting each several times since 1977. They first started off as total strangers as they drive together from Chicago to New York City as sexual intentions eventually keep them apart. Years later, they run into each other now both career-oriented (Harry is political consultant and Sally is a journalist). The charisma and the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan wants us to see their characters fall in love and get married. Sadly, they are still head-blocked by their previous relationships which put them at doubt of committing to getting into another relationship.The feisty performances of the two leading stars compliments nicely to the script that Ephron wrote. Even though Billy Crystal has a one-dimensional character, he still manages to pull off some sleaziness within the character of Harry Burns. Whereas Sally has a personality that changes in many different places. When we are first introduced to her she comes off as a vulnerable determined college graduate ready to take on all challenges that the world wishes to throw at us. But with all the trials and tribulations that manifest with the issues on relationships which gives her a newer more alert perspective of the world around her. Ryan goes through this transition so naturally, we never really see it coming.Ephron was a master in her own craft writing script filled with a cornucopia of hilarious perspective of human relationships throughout her career as a scriptwriter. Here in When Harry Met Sally, we look through both genders perspectives about relationships on an even field. Harry sees that men and women have sex does not have room just being friends. That applies to anyone who has been in a relationship before. Every scene has a reason, even the brief scene with the elderly couples also contributes the purpose of this movie.Over the years, director Rob Reiner has made mediocre as of late. But it is very pleasing that When Harry Met Sally was released we can reflect back to when he made quality films like these. His colorful direction and Ephron and her brilliant script make just as much of an effective couple as Harry and Sally were. The endearing couple are so likable we actually care if they get together no matter what direction in life they wish to pursue.",When Harry Met Sally...
61,lewiskendell,The most popular romantic comedy of the late 80's.,6,26 May 2010,"I figured it was about time that I worked my way through some of these older romantic comedies. I'm not the biggest lover of the genre, but I do like a good one, from time to time.  Besides, there are some movies that every movie fan needs to have seen. I've heard that When Harry Met Sally... is one of them, so I'm finally getting around to it. So, what did I think? It was OK. Quite funny in some parts. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan work well as a couple, and I like the way the movie flitted around their various meetings, before it settled down into the story. The random interviews of couples interspersed in the movie were really cool, too. It wasn't the best movie of this kind that I've seen, but it was good enough that I'm pleased to add it to the list of movies that I've seen. Fans of the genre will probably love it (tbough I'm sure 95% of those people have seen it already), while people like me won't feel like they're wasting their time while watching it.",When Harry Met Sally...
62,bkrauser-81-311064,The Golden Standard of Romantic Comedy,9,27 October 2013,"Now I'm not a fan of romantic comedies, at least not recent ones. Most movies already add in a love interest so the notion of making a small perfunctory part of a good movie the whole point of a single picture just seems trifling to me. It doesn't help that Hollywood no longer tries to make the genre appealing to all or even many; producers only make them desirable to middle-aged women and gullible tweens. Not knocking those demographics, its just not my thing. That being said, When Harry Met Sally (1989) is for all intents and purposes a romantic comedy yet it is a lot more than that.The story takes place within the space of twelve years. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet through a mutual friend. Sally agrees to take Harry with her to New York in her car and the two don't get along famously. Yes, there is banter, yes they eventually fall madly in love, yes every romantic comedy before and after When Harry Met Sally have followed the exact same pattern but here its different.The late, great Nora Ephron wisely took the romance as a starting point to truly delve into and study the notion of love. Harry and Sally's story is intertwined with interviews from elderly couples who briefly discuss how they first fell in love. Director Rob Reiner enhances the experience with poignant editing and a smart use of split screen for some humorous and enlightening set pieces along with some truly lovely views of New York City in all its glory.Twelve years is an awful long time to track two characters and its amazing to see how each time the story jumps to a certain time and place how they have changed yet remained the same. Harry starts out as a little self-absorbed yet always charming and funny in the only way Billy Crystal can be. Years later his character goes through a brutal divorce that humanizes Harry in both the eyes of the audience and Sally. Sally goes through a similar transition through the progression of time. She doesn't deal with her life altering breakup lying down even though her mannerisms betray her proactive attitude.Throughout the movie Harry and to a lesser extent Sally often explore the differences between men and women when it comes to sex and love. Again, this is a common theme in romantic comedies from Adam's Rib (1949) to The Ugly Truth (2009). Yet while reinforcing gender tropes in the collective minds of the audience, this writing trick serves a larger purpose in When Harry Met Sally. It fleshes out the characters we've grown to love. Take the famous scene at Katz Deli where Sally fakes an orgasm proving the point that men can't tell the difference. Funny? Yes. True? The jury's still out. Do we love her for it? Of course.My only real concern with When Harry Met Sally is this; they never seem to be working. Or talking about their work. Supporting characters Jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher) mention their work albeit casually. Harry and Sally on the other hand almost never do. In an interview with Rob Reiner, the director explained he didn't want to include their work life because A: its not the point of the movie; and B: no one likes to talk about their work outside of work. Fair enough to the first point but I find it hard to believe that no one in Rob Reiner's circle of friends talks about their work on a quasi-regular basis. I prefer explaining it away as a question of editing. Within a twelve year span, Harry and Sally talked about work, it just wasn't filmed.When Harry Met Sally is the golden standard for modern romantic comedy. A standard that many have attempted but few have achieved and fewer still have surpassed. It exhibits the talents of the brilliant Billy Crystal and the strikingly beautiful and exuberant Meg Ryan. It presents the work of director Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron at the top of their game and it showcases timeless love songs by virtuosos George Gershwin and Richard Rodgers. Truly, does anyone know anyone who doesn't enjoy it? If you do dump them from your life; they're too high-maintenance.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",When Harry Met Sally...

Meg Ryan is stunningly beautiful, so there's another big plus. But as far as the characters and the story go, it all feels very fabricated, even if there are some good points made in or between the lines. Also, I'm looking at Billy Crystal here as a comedian, but not a character made of flesh; this may be a personal thing, but, even though I think he's funny (with smart lines) a lot of the time (this doesn't just concern this film, but pretty much everything I've seen him in), there is a certain display of detachment - like he is a craftsman, but I don't believe he loves his job...That all being said, I can appreciate this film as just another romantic comedy that will kill (my) time quite easily, but has no great effect on me.

This term describes the situation that two people are made for each other and everyone sees that, except the two people in question.This sort of love - hate relationship was typical for the screwball comedy's of the '40s, and indeed ""When Harry met Sally"" is a sort of neo screwball. The screwball comedy needs sharp dialogue and that is just what screenwriter Nora Ephron provides. The direction is done by Rob Reiner and this makes the film a little bit more spicy than ""Sleepless in Seatlle"" (1993). ""Sleepless in Seatlle"" is also a film in which people doubt until the very end about their relation, but this time Nora Ephron did both the screenplay and the direction.A lot of people know some immortal scenes from ""When Harry met Sally"".

On meeting again in years time, they form a strong friendship.The romantic genre has gone through many changes over the last decade. From the obvious and clichéd Sleepless in Seattle and Love Actually to the heavily slapstick funny films such as Hitch and Just Friends among others. Sadly we aren't seeing enough romantic films that look at issues, opinions and life the way classics such as Rob Reiner's Oscar nominated picture did.This picture is a beautiful piece of film-making. From the funny protagonists to the simple powerful storyline, this is a fine romantic film.Far from a guy likes girl flick, this looks at the intricate ways men and women look at each other. Harry in particular brings up a valid point in that sex will always get in the way of a guy and a girl ever being friends. This concept, represented at a highly inconvenient moment, is incredibly funny and importantly relative.Crystal (The Princess Bride) and Ryan (You've got mail) deliver knockout performances with Ryan in particular very charming. Ryan has created that vulnerable but opinionated persona on screen that many viewers will relate to. And obviously not forgetting that infamous scene in the restaurant. I think we'd all like to have what she's having.The narrative, though always likely, is directed and told in a way that is enjoyable from start to finish. Most modern flicks use that slapstick humour or star quality to create that tension for the guy and the girl to get together but this is an intellectual and diverse approach that can not be faulted.A lot of romances don't know whether to be funny or dramatic but Reiner's picture is a finally balanced flick that gives us plenty of laughs and an equal dose of tension.The setting and music are chosen very well, justifying the moments in perfect sequence.This is a romantic film that betters most modern clichéd romances out there with a slick approach to the world of friendships and relationships.",When Harry Met Sally...
67,KnightsofNi11,What the Rom-Com genre should have always been,8,11 August 2010,"The romantic comedy genre gets a bad reputation and, lets face it, deservedly so. It isn't easy to find a good rom-com in this day and age but stumbling upon When Harry Met Sally was quite the treat. It's the story of two friends, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan). They are best friends, trying their hardest to keep sex out of the relationship so as not to complicate things. It's a charming story with fun characters and witty dialouge. The film is funny in its own subtle way without the use of stupid humor or sight gags. I had a great time watching this film and it kept me amused and interested the whole way through.I'm a huge Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, Stand by Me) fan. His style of subtle and intelligent humor is something that you just don't see anymore. When Harry Met Sally is a great example of his comedic style and it never loses its touch throughout the entire film. And while the wit and intelligence of the film remains the same all the way through, it changes its tone and pacing multiple times, making for an intriguing and diversified watch. The creative way in which the story progresses breaks away from the way thousands of other romantic comedies play out, and that makes for something so fresh and original that you can't help but love it.Major kudos also go out to the limited cast of this film. When Harry Met Sally really only comprises of two main characters (Crystal and Ryan) and two supporting characters (Kirby and Fisher). Bruno Kirby (Donnie Brasco, The Basketball Diaries) plays Harry's best guy friend and Carrie Fisher (Star Wars) plays Sally's best girl friend. The interactions between these four characters make some of the most memorable scenes in the film. With such a small group of central characters, each must serve a legitimate and relevant purpose, and they all four go above and beyond in this respect.When Harry Met Sally is a fantastic film that defines what all romantic comedies should be. Its intelligence and wit is something you don't see much anymore, making it a film that stands out among the thousands of others like it. It's a wonderfully directed, intelligently written, and superbly acted film. Definitely check this one out.",When Harry Met Sally...

Two long-standing acquaintances (Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan) wonder if it's possible for men and women to enjoy, friendship without sex.The film is a very talky, slightly cynical examination of that particular quandary - something like three-quarter strength of Woody Allen - though not without good lines and appealing performances.

When Harry met Sally will certainly entertain, although you'll probably not need to do too much in the thinking department. This film is a classic of it's genre and it has certainly inspired many other films since it's release. It's almost certainly true that Ryan and Crystal were forever typecast in roles similar to Harry and Sally.The story follows the slowly simmering relationship of Harry and Sally played out over a decade from an unpromising start during the pairs move from Chicago to New York.

It's a wonderful wonderful film which reminds all us single people, that there's always someone out there for us, even if it is our best female friend. Is it true that it's impossible to be friends without feeling attracted to her? No it's not impossible, but there's always a chance of it advancing to more. Anyway, going off on one again.

73,jpschapira,When everything changed...,7,18 August 2005,"Whenever I hear something about him, I wonder; what ever happened to Rob Reiner's career? What ever happen to that man that could direct any genre? The man who made us cry in ""Stand by me"" or made us scare to death in ""Misery"" is now out of the focus. I saw his last film, ""Alex & Emma"" (which I tried to tolerate because of the actors who starred in it) and it was shameful to see he was promoting it with and advertisement saying: ""from the director of"" The director of ""When Harry met Sally"", this movie, Reiner's most successful romantic comedy and film ever and by now probably a classic, because of Meg Ryan's famous scene and because of its general charm. Believe, everything is pink in this film, and the romantic story it proposes is something everyone has experienced. In some ways it reminded me to ""The mirror has to faces"", but that couple relationship was totally different.Here there are two guys in their 20's, travelling to New York for a better life, arguing about the things they think, do, and expect of their future, and so on. These scenes in the car driving to New York could be extremely boring, but writer Nora Ephron (who would write for Meg Ryan again in ""You've got mail"") makes them very interesting. ""How can't you be afraid of death?"", Sally tells Harry, and he answers: ""I'm just prepared, when I read a book I always read the ending first in case I die and I can't finish it"".Years later that trip is history, and they both have various encounters through the years. She pretends he doesn't recognize her, because she remembers him perfectly. She was actually captivated by him on that trip but never told him. On the other hand, he pretends to be casual, but hasn't erased her from his mind; after more than a decade! Soon they start hanging out, telling each other everything, and become best friends; but if you saw them on the street you wouldn't doubt to think they are a couple.Why don't they confess their feelings? You've got to see the film to figure it out; you've got to witness what happens, how it happens and most importantly why. In our original time, Rob Reiner did this picture more than a decade ago, and he directed it simply and honestly. Without knowing he also brought us one of the first climatic endings in a romantic comedy; those when the guy declares his love in the last minutes, in a powerful touching final speech, you know.But what he actually got right was the cast. Yes, he got together two actors that achieved a unique chemistry in a movie that needed it entirely. Billy Crystal, showing that way of speaking that is only his and a mark for any good comedian. Rob Reiner helped him to become the super comedic star he was already becoming. And Meg Ryan will be ever grateful to this opportunity that showed her unusual beauty, natural talent and all the other things that would make her the queen of the romantic comedy.",When Harry Met Sally...
74,manitobaman81,Good,7,19 August 2014,"When Harry Met Sally... a bunch of stuff happened. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting, mainly Billy Crystal's (it's fun seeing him as a hunky ladies' man). From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is not a great movie, but the cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship depicted between Harry and Sally.",When Harry Met Sally...
75,Darkside-Reviewer,Very relatable,8,21 June 2021,"I personally am not a huge fan of Romantic comedy's and I absolutely cannot stand Billy Crystal as an actor or as a comedian. But for some reason I just can't find it in myself to hate When Harry Met Sally.I only recently decided to give the movie a chance after having it recommended to me for years by friends and by every girlfriend I have ever had. I was honestly expecting this movie to be just another romantic comedy with an all too neat and happy ending. This is one of those rare instances where I'm actually glad I misjudged a movie because it led to me enjoying this movie more due to it's surprisingly clever written dialogue and relatable characters. I went into this movie expecting an unfunny romantic comedy about two people who hate each other but end up falling in love. Instead I found myself laughing and relating to the main characters in a unique way that actually made me want to see these two people end up together.This is easily Billy Crystal's best performance in his entire career and I say that as someone who hates Billy Crystal. Meg Ryan also gives a superb performance in this movie. The two work well together with Crystal's character being the more sarcastic and skeptical of the two. This works well with Meg Ryan's character who is much more upbeat and optimistic bringing some much needed balance to their characters ever evolving relationship.When Harry Met Sally is a film that was certainly ahead of it's time with it's cleverly written dialogue, relatable characters and sophisticated adult humour. I highly recommend giving this movie a chance if you have never seen it before you won't regret it.",When Harry Met Sally...

After seeing it the first time I thought it was good, but I have to say that I liked it even more on my second viewing. The film is absolutely wonderful! The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish.I literally couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that's a sign of a good movie, when you just can't believe that you're already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene.The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances, and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too, they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film, keep up the good work Rob.If you're into romantic comedies, then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren't really into the whole romantic part of it, the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film.I hope you like it.

78,oOoBarracuda,When Harry Met Sally,10,9 April 2017,"When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that I was in no way prepared for, which is my favorite kind of new favorite film to watch. Having never seen a Rob Reiner film, I wasn't sure of his style or technique or how he approached his subjects. I quickly learned through his 1989 feature that he provides a very real look at the lives of people in relationships. When Harry Met Sally tells the tale of a chance meeting between two strangers who then continue to reappear in each other's lives. The way in which Reiner exposes the truths of finding someone you can best tolerate in a partner, rather than the person that makes your heart turn to mush is a brilliant grasp of how to illustrate the human condition. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star in the titular roles and provide the brilliant illustration of everyday, flawed human beings often sensationalized for cinema.Sally (Meg Ryan) agrees to give her friend's boyfriend, Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York upon their graduation from the University of Chicago. After a long car ride of sharing all the quirky details that make up their existence, completely uninhibited since they are unavailable to each other. After the journey to New York is complete, the two part ways not thinking much of each other. Harry and Sally keep bumping into each other over the years as their lives intersect. They finally decide to maintain a friendship, and quickly become friends and confidants. As they see each other through each successive stage of their lives, it becomes increasingly more difficult to watch the other date. Neither of the two has ever shared such intimate details of their lives, their hopes, fears, and dreams with another person so it only makes sense that the two fall in love. Two people with such neuroses in some ways make a perfect match, but in other ways are their own biggest obstacles in love.A film that looks and feels this much like Annie Hall is obviously going to rank highly on my list. I had begun writing about the similarities this film shared with Annie Hall, but I soon gave up because there are just too many. The dialogue is fantastic and the entire film is so well-written. Even though the famous line ""I'll have what she's having."" has worked its way into the American lexicon, it loses nothing when it is spoken. Oftentimes, with a line so popular, the audience member has the ""roll-your-eyes-""oh"" moment when it's spoken; but that's not the case with When Harry Met Sally because the script is so perfect. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfect in their roles, with just enough chemistry to make their unconventional friendship work. Despite how great Meg Ryan was in the role, and also despite the fact that the fate of the universe wouldn't allow it, I couldn't help but think all throughout the film how perfect Gilda Radner (R.I.P.) would have been in the role opposite Crystal. Anyway, When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant look at the lives of real people, and an exceptional film that has already become a new favorite.",When Harry Met Sally...
79,braddugg,This movie has one of the best conversations ever.,8,20 September 2014,"This movie has one of the best conversations ever.The best part its like the icing on the cake and while the cake is just the temptation to have, we have a delicious taste of a fine icing. And all through it asks one pertinent question that can a man and a woman be friends without the sex coming in between.We all beautiful movies, romantic movies and we shall surely love this one coz it's both beautiful and romantic. It's romantic and it speaks for the most part about sex and then later on to the small things that we surely appreciate about the other person. It's the small things that make the big picture of life and those are shown beautifully like Sally ordering a dish at a restaurant. Also, this one has of the best embarrassing moments in cinema that is Sally faking an orgasm in a restaurant and situation of Harry. Immediately the woman on the other table tells ""I'll have what she's having"".Screenplay by Nora Ephron is just wonderful; the poignancy is maintained by bringing in elderly couples that have held on to each other for years and letting us know how they had met or got convinced to tie the knot.More than anything it simply works because of the chemistry between the two leads. Bill Crystal (Harry) and Meg Ryan (Sally) are wonderful in their roles. It's a treat to let them be the characters and giving them space and time to know each other, to understand and then realize what they truly need.It's 4/5 for a cinema that celebrates romance but it in a funny way.",When Harry Met Sally...
80,richieandsam,It was average at best,6,15 April 2013,"WHEN HARRY MET SALLYI was disappointed.This is supposed to be one of those classic films I guess I didn't get it.This was just a regular, average romantic comedy. I didn't hate it it just wasn't anything special.Everyone knows the famous scene in this movie when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm in a café.Yeah it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny.The film stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan who are 2 people who car share their journey after leaving college.They do not get along very well on the way.5 years later, they bump into each other and they still don't like each other.Another 5 years passes and they bump into each other again and they both have something in common they have both recently been dumped.So they cry on each others shoulders and become friends and the rest is what you can expect from any romantic comedy.The one thing that was different about this film was the dialogue. A lot of the movie was just Harry & Sally talking. Not a lot else happened through the movie, it was just their opinions on certain things and them talking to each other but I liked this. The dialogue was very good in this film. It was not boring and you actually wanted to hear their conversation. It was very well written.The acting was really good too. Billy and Meg both did a great job and Carrie Fisher was in it and she did a good job too.One of the things I did like about this movie was the feel of it. I love 80s movies and you can really tell this is an 80s film.They have a completely different feel to them than the more recent movies and I love them.In my mind, the 80s films are the best.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It was OK but I guess I had to watch it at the time to understand why it is so classic.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",When Harry Met Sally...

The dialogues between Harry and Sally are extremely funny and interesting, they're basically everything that I like to think and talk about with my best friend. Who is a guy, and not a girl, a thing that is perfectly explained in the movie by Billy Crystal. Except for the dark side thing his character is somebody I really relate to, we just think alike. Great acting, great music, great dialogues(especially by Crystal who, at moments looks like Jerry Seinfeld;I don't know if i's those white sneakers or the dialogues:) and a bunch of very funny jokes make this movie a must see for everyone. Oh and a nice touch with those scenes where old married couples explain the (sometimes almost unbelievable) circumstances in which they met.

83,lagudafuad,a movie to see always,8,4 September 2012,"There is this nostalgic feeling you get when you are done watching this classic. I felt like I have forgotten how it feels to watch a romantic movie and actually be happy for those involve when they get together.Everyone needs a regular dose of ""When Harry met Sally"" once in a while to make you smile with apparently no reason at all.Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. The movie itself is based on the very idea: can men and women be just platonic friends? Well to me from my experience the answer is NO! As long as there is constant communication, the man will want to sleep with her.The movie is known for its Deli scene where Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference between when a woman is having an orgasm or when she is faking it, and to prove her point, she vividly (but fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. Then the movie dropped its popular line, when a woman from the diner who had been watching Sally demonstrate the fake orgasm placed an order saying, ""I'll have what she's having."" The movie tells the story of two people Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) who met in 1977 in a car ride where they both discussed if it was possible for men and women to have a platonic friendship. Harry disagrees while Sally believed it was possible. They parted ways only to meet 5 years after in an airport. Harry asked Sally if they could be friends but Sally refused and then parted again to meet 5 years after that in a coffee shop.Then they became close friends helping each other out through the struggles and being there for each other.It all went well till the time came for them to answer the question, ""can a man and a woman be platonic friends without sex being involved?"" The thing about the movie that keeps you going is the funny lines Billy Crystal delivers at every scene, add this to his acting and the persona of his character you have a guy that is fun to be with and fun to watch. Meg Ryan on the other hand plays a more subtle character who is more of amazement in the way she sees thing, that in fact there is never a dull moment with both characters.Rob Reiner directing in this Romantic Comedy is top notch, he went on to make Sleepless In Seattle (1993) which was also one of the best romantic movies ever made and it also stars Meg Ryan, but nothing can stand up to ""When Harry met Sally"" This is my pick of best romantic movie I have seen till date.",When Harry Met Sally...

The chemistry between the two actors, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. Even the friends are well casted, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. It's such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you're involved as well.

85,josh_lambert1991,Great love story that I have admired for so long,8,15 April 2017,"Firstly I must say that I have been a fan of this film for such a long time. I saw it on Friday evening and I have been in love with it ever since. Everything about this film is perfect. But I have a few things that I think could be better.Firstly the title of the movie is a bit misleading as I think it can come across a bit sexist to say when Harry met Sally. I mean what year was this film made the 1930's? Are we not to think that Sally did in fact meet Harry Aswel?Might I suggest a new title for the movie. ""When Harry and Sally meet each other"" I think this gives a better indication of what the film is about and would make it a much more enjoyable film for people to watch. Actually I have had another thought the story of the film actually tells the story of Sally and Harry meeting on 3 occasions 5 years apart of each other (spoiler alert)Sorry I have just read that you should put the words ""spoiler alert"" before the spoiler so that you don't spoil the film for anyone. I want to apologise for my mistake that lead me to do it wrong.In light of my new thoughts on the story may I suggest the renaming of the film to ""When Harry and Sally meet each other on three different occasions""One of the many things I loved about this movie was Billy crystal. I just think he is amazing in the movie. At the beginning of the movie he is quite mean to Meg Ryan and I was thinking he could be called Bully Crystal.Then when he is in the restaurant if he had ordered a steak he could be called Grilly CrystalBut I love the way he's always making jokes throughout the movie and he should be renamed Silly Crystal.When it's Christmas time in the film and he and Meg Ryan go for a Christmas tree while it's snowing he looks cold and he could be called Chilly Crystal.At times in the movie he is being a bit of a Knob and he could be called Willy CrystalIf in the movie he decided to wear one of Meg Ryan's ruffled dresses he could be called Frilly Crystal.But non of this happened and I am getting sidetracked so I will apologise.I love the part in the movie when the ogre rescues the princess from the tower that's really powerful stuff.Sorry that was part of Shrek I watched it on the same evening and I keep getting a bit mixed up on what parts of the movie happened in which film.I think I will leave the review here.

86,TaylorYee94,Textbook of 'Friends to Lovers' trope,8,28 July 2021,"Many rom-coms (before and even after 'When Harry Met Sally') drag on their narratives with many 'accidental' mistakes and mismatched timings to express one's feelings. What's the point of all the extra amounts of useless trivia? Do the directors of romance movies think they will contribute to the climax? It does not work that way. Romance or rom-com moviegoers knowingly go into the theater that two protagonists will probably have a happy ending. What determines the success is the chemistry of a couple. 'When Harry Met Sally' has a straightforward plot. Two friends stay friends rather than expressing their love for each other because they do not want to ruin what they already have. Story, very simple and clear. However, their lines are just something. They show how much women and men approach the relationship, love, and sex differently in a very cute and charming way, exposes unique and lovely personalities of the characters, and build the chemistry by how they exchange those lines. It was just so cute to watch total opposite tone of the speech of Harry and Sally and how they complement each other.

87,roghache,"Wonderful romantic comedy, but with a disclaimer",7,20 March 2006,"This is a fabulously entertaining romantic comedy, one of my sister's favorite movies ever. (However, I personally have a 'difficulty' or two, and I suspect so might she.) Meg Ryan (Sally) is cute and fresh, and Billy Crystal (Harry) charming and funny. The movie asks that age old question...can two people of opposite gender remain just friends, or will sex intrude upon the friendship? The couple in question, Harry and Sally, meet right after college while sharing a car trip. During the drive, they bicker and take an immediate dislike to one another, concluding that they have nothing in common. Five years later when their paths again cross, Harry is engaged and Sally has a businessman boyfriend. After another five years, they meet again; Harry's wife has just left him, and Sally's boyfriend is out of the picture. The two become great friends, sharing witty barbs, ideas and opinions, confidences and support.Then one night, Harry and Sally sleep together. Will their friendship survive? Will it develop into a deeper relationship? Will he still respect her in the morning or will he bolt? The last part of the movie answers these questions, with a wonderful humdinger of a romantic New Years Eve ending. It's a really fun, amusing, witty, touching, feel good comedy romance. Wonderful endearing stars with great chemistry together, whether as enemies, friends, or eventually lovers. HOWEVER...Sadly, it reflects the morality of our times. No more friendship, love, marriage, and sex in that precise order. Now it's perceived as novel that Harry and Sally enjoy such a lengthy friendship before having sex. Well, I guess that's preferable to just rushing the newly acquainted couple straight to bed, as is the general case in modern cinema (and life). It's a cute story, but let's just not hold it up as the ideal. One reviewer noted that Harry and Sally had to sleep together before cementing a romantic relationship, in order to determine whether or not they were sexually compatible. I'll let that pass, other than to voice disagreement. Also, the legendary restaurant scene where Sally fakes a orgasm. Okay, yes, I suppose it might be considered (marginally) funny, but it simply made me wonder whether the screenplay writers had been watching too many shampoo commercials. Can two people of opposite sexes remain just friends? According to this movie, apparently not...but I'm not convinced.",When Harry Met Sally...

Rob Reiner is the best male director of Chickie movies!,10,10 March 1999,"From script to sound track this is a magnificent movie. It deals with: loss, male and female perspectives of: love, friendship, dating, being married, being married and then being single again, sex issues, anger, happiness, and jealousy.  The movie has great dialogue, a beautiful script,  the CD soundtracks do not get better than this with classic songs just to name a few: ""When and Where"", ""It Had to be You"", ""I Could Write a Book"", ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"".  The later recorded by Harry Connick Jr.  who is just outstanding!The acting is invisible, Billy Crystal does a great job and is very believable as Harry (City Slickers).  The guy who believes that men and women cannot be friends, and sometimes he is annoying but yet charming in his own way. Meg Ryan (You've Got Mail) is cute as the perfectionist Sally who has all her tapes alphabetized, can order food better anybody else, and admits to being too rigid and structured.  Marie, Sally's best friend (Carrie Fisher)  is always looking for a man for everybody including herself with her very own personal box of names and addresses; Bruno Kirby (City Slickers)  as Jess,  thinks that a woman who has a great personality cannot be pretty, is Harry's best friend. Between their conversations of Jesse and Harry there is a whole spectrum of the male perspective about feelings in relationships.Director Rob Reiner is the best!  (Mixed Nuts, The American President). I will see any movie that Reiner has anything to do with it and buy the video because there is always something to chew on after I have watched the movie once.The script is clever!  Nora Ephron (Mixed Nuts, Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail) just knows how to write a good script! She is brilliant!My favorite scenes: When Marie is trying her wedding dress on and Sally says: ""That is beautiful!""  I feel that she is reflects in her own situation. Those scenes with all  those old couples telling how they met and fell in love are precious scenes. Harry getting mad because he was singing in front of Ira!  The jealousy of Sally when Emily (Tracy Reiner)  comes into the picture, she is Aunt Emily the pie maker. I don't know how many people realize that Tracy is Rob Reiner's daughter. The ending is precious when Harry sees couples around while he window shops alone New Year's Eve, and starts running to tell Sally how he really feels! That is a tearing scene.

It doesn't aim for big laughs or big tears, favouring more realistic and relatable character development. Billy Crystal's sharp and fast dialogue is impressive and entertaining, but Meg Ryan's character is kind of a vanilla wafer that's only one fake orgasm away from having no real personality. Overall, it's a rather dry affair that hovers just above being boring, but it's jazzy score and perfect shots of New York through the seasons do offer some classic Hollywood sentimentality that's not without it's charms.",When Harry Met Sally...

94,willrams,Cute Fun Romantic Comedy,8,17 January 2004,"They had known eachother for years and were close friends, but they had to discover who they were and could they stay friends with or without sex. Harry, played by Billy Crystal, and Sally, played by Sally Kellerman, were both headstrong and willing to understand eachother.  Even their best friends played by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby were a real match, so Harry and Sally had to learn the hard way.  It took their best friends' marriage plus Harry's willingness to admit he really loved Sally --- and so he proposed marriage on New Year's Eve.  In other words, they were two of a kind.  This was a cute fine wonderful love story and so very unpretensive; enjoyable!  One of those ""feel good"" movies.  It reminded me of ""Sleeping in Seattle 1993"".  7/10",When Harry Met Sally...
95,faraaj-1,Great romantic comedy...,10,29 October 2006,"When Harry Met Sally... is one of the best rom-coms ever made. Nora Ephron wrote three scripts for Meg Ryan - When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. All three are romantic comedies. All of them are incurably romantic and reference B&W/old classics - Casablanca, An Affair to Remember and The Shop Around the Corner respectively. All three are very good, with When Harry leading the trio.Harry and Sally meet each other on a road trip from Chicago to New York where both are relocating. We see their initial two encounters turn to disaster but they eventually decide to become friends ten years after they first met. They also decide not to have sex so as not to destroy their friendship. Of course they are eventually going to develop feelings for each other and of course the hero always gets the girl in the end - no deviation from the standard script Hollywood has been rehashing for decades.What makes this particular re-working of a fairly standard plot is primarily the script. Very intelligent, with lots of wit and good dialogue. Then, there are classic scenes, the best of which is the ""I'll have what she's having..."" diner scene. The inter-cuts to actual old couples who've been together for decades discussing their relationship is brilliant.Romantic comedy is admittedly not a genre that pushes the boundaries of cinema. But, its very enjoyable and When Harry Met Sally is one of the enduring classics of the genre.",When Harry Met Sally...

97,MF210,One of the best Romantic Comedies out there,9,9 February 2004,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. If you have read my reviews that I have posted(I do not blame you if you have not, they are awful), you will know that I am not a huge fan of Romantic Comedies. I mostly avoid them at all costs. The only time I will watch one is if someone forces me or I am bored (or possibly near death). However, I had heard nothing but good things about When Harry Met Sally so not only decide to watch the film, I decided to buy the DVD. Buying the DVD was clearly not a mistake. Its hard to say why When Harry Met Sally works so well. It maybe because of the director. However, it may have more to do with the actors. Another possibility would be the script. It is all three of them put together. Today, the scripts in Romantic Comedies range from average to sub-par. It is usually the actors that make the difference in today's Romantic Comedies.
Rob Reiner was the perfect choice for directing the film. I cannot honestly say Rob Reiner was typecast as a director(he did do Misery and A Few Good Men)but this was the kind of film he did well. He was known for his more upbeat films. I am unable to say When Harry met Sally was hist best Film (I have not seen all his film and I slightly preferred The Princess Bride) but Reiner's work here is a reason the film works. Put this film in the hands of an unexperienced and untalented director, it is possible this film would not have been as successful. The acting is pretty damn close to perfect. This is without a doubt the best performance given by Billy Crystal. The same goes for Meg Ryan, who's last couple of performances(mainly Kate and Leopold and Proof of Life) have been quite dull. These two also exhibit a great deal of chemistry.
The supporting actors to get the most screentime are Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher(who are also a couple). Bruno Kirby does a solid job as Harry's best friend. Likewise for Carrie Fisher as Sally's Best Friend. These two do not have as much screentime but they work well together. The screenplay is written by Nora Ephron. She has a lot of experience with Romantic Comedies(she also wrote Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail). Her script is a huge reason the film works. Today, the characters in Romantic Comedies usually say some cliched dialogue, not so here. Ephron's dialogue is fresh and smart. There are a bunch of quotable lines. For the most part, her script does follow the formula but the characters and dialogue are so well-written that When Harry Met Sally seems different.
When Harry Met Sally represented a pinnacle for nearly everyone involved. Most of the cast had never been better(at least from what I have seen from them). Nora Ephron's You've Got Mail was enjoyable but paled to When Harry Met Sally(I did not see Sleepless in Seattle). Like I said, I do not feel this was Rob Reiner's best film but it does come close. I strongly recommend the film.",When Harry Met Sally...
98,Scaramouche2004,Arguably the best romantic comedy of recent years.,10,2 January 2007,"By the late eighties, the romantic comedy as a movie genre had been in a sort of disturbed sleep for twenty years with only an occasional and disappointing movie outing between snores.Yet when they released 'When Harry met Sally' in 1989, it signified to the world that the RomCom was not only out of bed but it was showered, shaved, dressed in a brand new suit and ready to take on the world once more with new found confidence.It's 1977 and Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) has just graduated from the University of Chicago and is moving to New York to start his career. He's a nice enough guy who's only flaw seems to be his apparent misogynistic and macabre outlook on life.Also New York bound is fellow graduate Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) who as a favour for a friend agrees to take Harry along. The two have never met before and almost immediately Sally takes a dislike to him. His brash and over flirtatious demeanour irritates her intensely and her quirky prissiness becomes a natural target for his humour. He even sexually propositions her, which she of course rejects outright.In view of all this coupled with Harry's somewhat blinkered idea that men and women can never be friends without sexual attraction becoming an issue, they reach New York and mutually call an abrupt halt to their 18 hour friendship, both convinced it has lasted 18 hours too long.Fast forward five years and Harry and Sally meet again at an airport and when he discovers they are on the same flight, he approaches her to rekindle their friendship and this time things are even worse.Despite both finding love and success in New York, the years have done nothing to kerb Harry's sexist and irritating views and Sally's abject disapproval of everything that he stands for seems even more pronounced. They part once again at journeys end, this time with Sally making it quite clear she wants nothing whatsoever to do with him again.Another five years pass and both Harry and Sally meet in a bookshop both having recently lost the loves referred to in the previous paragraph. Harry is divorcing his unfaithful wife and Sally has just dumped her long-term relationship as it was becoming clear to her that it was never going to end in an 'I Do'.This time however, possibly due to them both being humbled by recent events in their life, they find that they have empathy with each other and a friendship starts to build, a true platonic friendship to the extent where they finally become inseparable and reliant on each other almost on a brother and sister level.They partner each other at functions when neither have a date, they set each other up on blind dates and even take day trips together to the museum, and by using each other as an emotional crutch they finally learn to settle the demons of their previous relationships.It seems like Harry has finally realised and now thoroughly excepts that men and women CAN be friends without a sexual entanglement. In fact so secure are they in their beliefs that they are nothing more than just good friends, they seem completely oblivious to the fact that they have in fact fallen head of heals in love with each other.Billy Crystal is on fine form in one of his most memorable and hilarious performances and Meg Ryan 'Fakes' her way into movie history in that now famous restaurant scene. With great direction by Rob Reiner, a superb script by Nora Ephron and wonderful support from Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, 'When Harry Met Sally' is the Crème de la Crème of all the modern day RomComs.",When Harry Met Sally...

It covers a long time period and shows us a changing relationship. It's really about how weird human relationships are and how strange routes we can take to happiness. This theme is emphasized by the interviews with married couples that are interspersed into the movie.We also get to witness how people themselves change. When we meet the protagonists, they are young, confident and full of ideas. Some of those ideas go on to be dispelled by time, and some new ones take wing.

102,cosmorados,There are three things to remember in relationships,8,21 June 2008,"1) Men are always idiots before they hit thirty (And usually after) 2) Most men have no taste and 3) and the one that never gets mentioned is that even when women are wrong they will never admit to it.And for me this is the key thing that separates this movie from others as I have seen countless romantic comedies where the bloke makes mistakes and gets things wrong, but there very few movies where the female lead is as flawed and f***ed up as the man (Only 2 spring to mind).This is the story of Harry and Sally, two people who meet on the journey to a new life in New york. In the road trip there we learn 2 things, 1) Harry is a jerk and 2) Sally has still not been opened up sexually. These are clear from the conversations that take place, and the two leads play these roles to perfection.We leap frog 5 years and then another 5 years to see both characters coming to the end of long-term relationships and both suffering in different ways, Harry by seeking refuge in one night stands and Sally by being in denial, however as their friendship blossoms they both start to begin the healing process and as the movie moves further through their lives to it's inevitable conclusion we find out a hell of a lot about relationships and life in general as we go through one of the most enjoyable 90 minutes that the movies have produced over the last 20 years.The two leads are played with charm, vulnerability and honesty by Crystal and Ryan as the discuss anything and everything, from young girl's lack of understanding of ""Casablanca"" to the difference between women's and men's sex dreams. Whilst Nora Ephron's script is superb, what marks this out from later efforts are 2 things. Billy Crystal's superb comic skill, which can take something that's nothing and make it fantastic, and the direction of Rob Reiner, which avoids some of the later Ephron efforts of being too over the top or over-long due to her desire, like most writers, to get every word from the page onto the screen, which often doesn't work.This is one of the best films of the eighties, but like many great films of this era ""Tootsie"", ""Bill and Ted"" and ""Ghostbusters"" it is regarded as being, well, not as good as it is due to being made in the eighties.Fashion changes, class remains and this is classNuff said.Em.",When Harry Met Sally...
103,Jakemcclake,Right Up There As One Of The Best,9,1 October 2009,"Spoilers In the category of Romantic Comedy, most movies do not get to an average above 5 stars. However, this one hit 7.7 stars and that represents the highest rated Romantic Comedy I ever seen here on IMDb. I read the negative reviews and many relate to typical comments regarding the Genre - Romantic Comedy - Predictable, Unreal. I think the Genre of Romantic Comedy will always disappoint some moviegoers. I go into a romantic comedy knowing we will not see a surprise ending and/or a documentary. Also the movie drags at many points because they show all the conflicts that kept Harry and Sally single.That said, I rate this very highly. There are numerous comparisons in this forum to Sleepless in Seattle, but this movie's climax is far stronger then that movie's climax. This movie had a perfect climax, which showcased a crescendo of sound timed with the climax to a story. The constant interview of Harry alone and Sally maybe keeps some guessing about the outcome, but you know you are gonna get the standard Rom-Com climax, anyway. That said, it still was a good thing when it came and the way it came about.",When Harry Met Sally...

106,neenahhh,Best romantic-comedy movie of all time,10,3 January 2011,"I hadn't even hit the first time-skip before realizing that the movie that I was watching was absolutely amazing and was possibly the best movie in the romance genre that I have ever watched. I fear that the next romance movies that I watch, won't live up to the standards that ""When Harry Met Sally"" set for me.I think what appealed to me most about this movie was the slow, but steady friendship that Harry and Sally had and nurtured. The time-skips made the movie seem more realistic. Instead of those crappy teenage romance films we have now (where the characters fall in love with each other as soon as they meet), in this film, we're greeted with a refreshing change of pace, where nothing is rushed. It is a beautifully done movie.I fell in love the characters during the first 10 minutes of the film. Harry and Sally drove to New York City and became acquaintances. Their conversations mostly led to arguments caused mostly by Harry who was played by Bill Crystal. Bill had the best lines. He was the funniest character in the movie.My favorite part of the movie was the time when they were best friends. They'd talk to each other before they went to bed. They had daily lunches out. One particular scene that I remember the most during the peak of their friendship, was when Harry began talking in a robotic tone and encouraged Sally to join him. That part was adorable. It didn't seem forced. They were just having sweet, innocent fun.The script was amazing. It was filled with so much wit. The dialogue also flowed very well. It was just so natural. The last lines of the movie were great and very, very romantic.Harry: I came here tonight because when you realize that you wanna spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.This movie is definitely a classic. I can't believe I didn't watch this one sooner. If you like romance flicks or if you feel like watching a heartwarming movie, be sure not to miss this gem. And even if you don't fit in in either categories, the comedy in this movie will be sure to keep you entertained.",When Harry Met Sally...
107,Snowgo,A Sad Statement on Relationship,4,30 April 2014,"I thought this movie was terrible. I watched it once, many years ago, on cable, but this time, I only lasted up until the scene where they were walking in the park and she evidently was allowing him to become a part of her life. There was no character development in the movie. Who are these two people? What are their dreams, their history? Why are they together? It seems that neither of them have any solid identity. Maybe that is their greatest commonality.I did get the impression that Sally was somewhat enthusiastic about life. What, in the world, did she see in him? I was trying to look at Harry psychologically, but could not come up with any specific pathology, but some warped blend of anhedonia and delusions of grandeur. Crystal sounding like he is reading all his lines does not help things, and this gives the movie a droning tempo. The fact that his character expects his assuming, pompous and otherwise rude nature to earn him friends and lovers is bad enough: When relatively-normal but easily-influenced Sally started actually accepting Harry's depressive confrontationalism, I could see where the movie was heading. I loved Billy Crystal in City Slickers and Meg Ryan was great in Addicted To Love, but When Harry Met Sally reminded me of The Mirror Has Two Faces, in that it inadvertently explores the issue of women ""settling for less"" in a relationship and allowing themselves to be there-by abused. I am frankly offended by When Harry Met Sally, and can only imagine how the movie would have run if Meg Ryan's character had stood her ground and demanded more: More than Harry, as well as the putz she was with at the airport.",When Harry Met Sally...

109,Balthazar-5,The map of the human heart...,9,5 July 2007,"Love doesn't come in a minute, Sometimes it doesn't come at all I only know that when I'm in it It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all.These words, from Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs', seem to me to be a very accurate description of the theme of 'When Harry Met Sally'. This iconic romantic comedy, written by Nora Ephron, is, for me, one of the most insightful comments on the place of love in the post-60s world. It charts the way that acquaintance can turn into friendship and then into love.Harry (Billy Crystal) encounters Sally (Meg Ryan) on a long car journey during which they both seem to decide that the other is obnoxious in one way or another. Their path to love is funny, totally engaging and ultimately unforgettable.One of the greatest - no THE greatest - characteristic of the cinema is its ability to access our deepest emotions. How many times do we weep cathartically in our normal lives - most of us, not many. Yet there are dozens of films that induce just this kind of reaction. How many times do we laugh so much that we ache - very rarely outside a cinema, but often within. How many times are we so scared that we cannot move - almost never in life, but often in the cinema. And these emotions cannot be accessed in the same way through any other art.And there are laughs and tears galore in 'When Harry Met Sally'. Why? Because we really *care* for these kooky characters, and the love that they find has a kind of purity that our loves struggle to emulate. For some people (and I feel sorry for them) films that induce a warm feeling of pleasure are sentimental and worthless. They should avoid this film as it might undermine their sterile cynicism. But if you trust your emotions and regard them as your greatest asset, 'When Harry Met Sally' will be one of the most worthwhile films of the modern era.",When Harry Met Sally...

After their initial parting after the road trip, Harry and Sally ""meet cute"" a couple of times and become friends who see each other through jobs and other relationships. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher lend strong support as their best friends but the real star of this film is the outstanding screenplay by Nora Ephron. The rapid fire dialogue and funny exchanges between Crystal and Ryan seem to roll of their tongues with such ease and I'm sure director Rob Reiner and Crystal had input in what finally ended up on the screen, script wise.

Sadly, it did not win, but I have found WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...to be one of my favorites...it's part of my collection and I can watch it a million times.

And this is because the sex is in the picture. The statement may sound ridiculous but it is actually very good point. The director Rob Reiner digs in the subject brilliantly.Harry Burns and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) meet at the end of their graduation and they drive together 18 hours long trip to New York. Sally can't stand cocky Harry who is loose and funny but drives Sally mad with his look on life. Sally is a little bit neurotic and high maintenance girl but all-in-all very attractive and intriguing personality. After their trip the two meet at the airport few years later. Harry is getting married and Sally is in a relationship with handsome Joe who happens to be Harry's old pal. Another five years goes by and then accidentally Harry and Sally meet again. Then despite the fact that men and women can never be just friends Harry and Sally form a tight friendship. How can two very different people manage to be friends when the obvious attraction lies beneath? Do opposites attract or are they so different after all? The film includes one of the greatest scenes in the history of movie-making. When Sally pretends to have an orgasm in a restaurant is so funny. Billy Crystal is at the edge of his career and his portrayal of Harry is fantastic and funny. All-American sweetheart Meg Ryan is fresh and perky as Sally. Rob Reiner has found the essential features of relationships and difficulties within. That wouldn't be possible without amazing script of Nora ""Sleepless in Seattle"" Ephron. Together Reiner and Ephron have manage to make working combination in this movie.

117,Putzberger,When Clemenza met Princess Leia,7,13 March 2010,"Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher play the obligatory wisecracking, slightly less attractive best friends of the title characters, who make a thoroughly predictable journey from sniping to smooching in this formulaic romantic comedy. It's not without charm, of course -- writer Nora Ephron has a good ear for a one-liner and director Rob Reiner is a good, economical storyteller. But it's still just a cute date movie, since Epron's wit is more glib than deep (real people don't debate the meaning of ""Auld Lang Syne"") and Reiner is not above resorting to cliché (every plot point is punctuated by some Golden Oldie like ""It Had To Be You,"" just in case you're missing the point of the scene). There's also the title characters, two neurotic yuppies in New York. Harry is a whiny, self-absorbed, self-pitying schnook, but since he's played by Billy Crystal, he gets all the best lines. Sally is brittle and high-maintenance, but since she's played by Meg Ryan, she's also utterly adorable. There's too much sentiment, and at some point you're going to want to clobber Crystal with an aluminum baseball bat, but there are plenty of fun set pieces (the legendary restaurant scene, the interviews with happy old couples that have nothing to do with the rest of the movie) and really, in 2010 it's refreshing to watch a middlebrow romantic comedy since they don't seem to exist anymore.

Which would take a lot longer.)",When Harry Met Sally...
118,AlbertCinefilu,So beautiful it makes me feel the void inside me,9,16 February 2021,"Sometimes, when something is mournfully bad or tragic, a void creeps inside you. Probably sadness. Tragedy awakens it. But the truth is, it's the beauty of watching the growth of this friendship, this relationship between Harry and Sally, that triggers feelings of loneliness/melancholy/nostalgia in your soul. Depending on your outlook on life, those feelings will be rapidly forgotten or you'll spend some days - maybe weeks - ruminating about them. I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I'll tell my friends about it, stock it in my long-term memory and in several days I'll watch another great movie (I hope, if I'm lucky).In terms of story theme, ''When Harry Met Sally'' explores this idea of whether two people, a man and a woman, can remain friends, if they are not in a relationship, related, have a different sexual orientation/great age gap or two very distinct conditions. Billy Crystal's character, Harry, specifies from the beginning that is not possible on the long-run and SPOILERS - he ends up being right - but it's interesting to see HOW he ends up being right. Like, he's not right at the beginning and he's not right for most of the film. But as he develops a genuine friendship with Sally (played superbly by Meg Ryan), his feelings start to gradually change and is forced to overcome his anxieties/his past.To be honest, the movie made me seriously question the invisible border between friendship and romantic relationship. Nevertheless, I'm sure about one thing: the kernel of every successful, healthy relationship is a successful, healthy friendship.A 9,5 out of 10 from me.",When Harry Met Sally...

124,Nobody-27,"Contrived, boring and entirely forgettable.",3,31 December 2016,"As most people, I saw this film when it came out. Normally, I remember films very well, but except for the well known restaurant scene (""I'll have what she is having!""), I couldn't remember any of it. So I decided to watch it again. The film starts of relatively well - not your typical romcom style, and that's a good thing. But that's also where the list of good things about this film ends. What starts with him being cold and distant and her being ""structured"" as she puts it, ends with both of them being pretty much the same. (Occasional emotional outbursts do not a character arc make) I could not focus on the film and whatever story there was in it, because dialogues were mostly forced and unnecessarily long. I even stopped the film a few times just to see how it would play with a few sentences taken out here and there, and it played much better. Maybe this is poor writing, maybe poor editing, but in any case, it resulted in a film that is hard to watch and a story that reminds you that it is artificial, quite regularly. The illusion of a relationship between the main characters is the worst part: they are friends, and that only in the second half of the film. I never believed that they were for real; I was also annoyed with both of them too many times to care if they loved each other or died in a freak accident. In the end, the most important question about this film is - how did it get such a fanatical following? I remember that when it first came out, it was pushed and promoted all over the place. The ""I will have the same"" scene in the restaurant was daring for those times, and it certainly helped, but even that scene plays quite badly: structured characters do not just jump out of their structured world to entertain audiences - more was needed but it was never there. Maybe it was all that advertising and PR, or perhaps everyone wanted to see a (faked) orgasm on the big screen... In any case, the film was never that good to start with, and it really aged badly. If the editing and dialogues were a bit better focused, and if character development was a bit more realistic and deeper, I would consider this for an upgrade. As it is, it gets very generous 3 stars from me.",When Harry Met Sally...

127,donuthaters12,One Of The Greatest In It's Genre,10,10 December 2013,"At one point in everyone's life, they are able to show some sort of soft spot for films like these. When Harry Met Sally is the film that stand out against it's competitors and was able to stick with me with multiple viewings. I adore this film and the film was able to draw out certain emotions from me, which is rare in romantic comedies, that it blinds me from watching this film objectively. This is a prime example of a film that defines the genre it belongs to.Nora Ephron is regarded by some as the greatest writer for romantic-comedy/drama films. I have not seen all of her films but so far I hold When Harry Met Sally as her magnum opus. Ephron has written a story that explores the concept of friendship between man and woman, the role of sex in relationships, and the basic construct of a man and a woman. The film examines the role of fate in love, showing that people self sabotages or be in situations that destroys relationships in order to be with the love of their life at the end of the story. The choice of having New York was a great choice as it allowed the theme of fated love to be much more effective. Dialogue in this film is a stand out because it's what drives the characters in this film, because neither characters have any strong intentions to be with the other for the bulk of the film. The dialogue, and also the strength of the actors, deliver the comedy of the film and it gets me every time because it felt natural and was also able to come off as sweet and endearing.Rob Reiner, from his first feature film ""This is Spinal Tap"" and to ""A Few Good Men"", has made a string of very well made films and sometimes it's hard to choose which one is his best of the bunch. Reiner wanted the film to be very optimistic, which made it so accessible, and he has made something that is so natural and relatable. The film can appeal to people searching for love, allowing us to understand or think that there is a much larger work going on in finding it, or to people who have already found it. Reiner did not allow the film to really show the other people that Harry or Sally have dated and how these people are not for them, instead the director just has these characters talk to each other about it allowing the film to spend more time with these characters together. The film has the ability to have us be attached to these characters. I love that the film takes it's time with the characters', allowing them to grow and allow us to see the growth of the maturity of the relationship/friendship and the personal maturity of these characters. I was very glad that Reiner didn't congest the film in humor and allowed it to feel organic instead, like it could come out of our own mouths too. I also adore that the film's humor is driven more by the characters and the conversations that takes place rather than the story or the use of physical humor, aside from the diner scene. The film, even in multiple viewings, doesn't lose it's genuine touch which is why it is one of my favorite films of all time.Barry Sonnenfeld as the director of photography for the film was a good choice by Reiner. Sonnenfeld was able to connect with Reiner's vision for the film capturing the relationship between these characters through a long period of time with such accessibility and optimism. Sonnenfeld wants shots to be a bit stretched out in order to get the most out of the scene and allowing the actors to feel more natural and not just act in service to the story. Because the film is focused more on it's characters rather than the environment they are in, preventing the film from feeling like flashy and pretty though at times there are a few beautiful wide shots of New York like on the winter and autumn seasons.The film is soundtrack driven rather than a score driven film and I thought this was a great decision because Reiner chose songs that keep in tone with one another and the tone of the film. The songs are usually big band type of songs which was able to project a sort of class that other films lack. This though has made a big impact on future films/TV shows set in New York.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal demonstrated amazing chemistry as they both look and play roles that clearly show in paper that they are meant to be together. Both actors deliver their lines so naturally that certain moments can allow us to really relate to conversations and events in our own lives. Crystal's humor may not appeal to everyone but in my opinion it really worked here, he wasn't too over the top and instead of being the center of attention on screen, he was able to share it with Ryan which supports in making the film amazing. It's nice to see Carrie Fisher do something great instead of the Star Wars franchise. Fisher has amazing comedic timing and she doesn't try to distract us from the lead characters. This also applies to Bruno Kirby who has moments that just has you laughing.When Harry Met Sally is one of the greatest of it's genre and it contains such likable leads and played by actors that are able to drive the film forward. Ephron has written an accessible and relatable script and Reiner has crafted a brilliant film that enhances the themes that drives Ephron's script. This is a film that I would recommend to everyone due to it's universal themes.",When Harry Met Sally...
128,iamyuno2,One Of The Greatest Romantic Comedies Ever,10,28 December 2013,"Dearly departed screenwriter Nora Ephron's best - and that's saying a lot, because she was one of the best of her generation. BRILLIANT screenplay. So much wit to the dialog. So many pithy scenes. Billy Crystal's very best movie and Meg Ryan's too (although does she over-act on occasion, try too hard to be cute?; I forgive her - she's otherwise brilliant). The dialog and story are genius and, ultimately, very moving. The story is hugely relevant, too - the search for love in today's fractionalized society (especially in New York City). There are so many memorable scenes and lines in this movie, too - the sign of greatness - not to mention one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever (I won't tell you what it is but it's in a diner; after you've seen it for the first time, you'll be repeating the punch line for the rest of your life). This is also one of those movies you'll want to see over and over again - another sign of greatness. The late lamented Bruno Kirby also puts in a fabulous performance as Crystal's best friend. And while I'm not a huge Carrie Fisher fan, she puts in a commendable performance too, as Ryan's best friend and Kirby's wife. And if a lump doesn't come to your throat, or a tear to your eye, at the end, you're not a romantic. Any sentimental romantic will absolutely love this film - forever.",When Harry Met Sally...
129,Stephen-12,Quality,10,29 June 1999,"It now looks pretty old hat, simply because we've now suffered an overdose of romcoms, all cast in the same mould (actually, all cast with the same cast, come to think of it). But this is the first and best of its kind by miles.Marrying Ephron's script with Reiner's light direction is where the film scores over its imitators, along with having Crystal and Ryan appear fresh and untainted by later failures. Ephron clearly used up all her best jokes here and in the first half of Sleepless in Seattle. WHMS really does have a smart line every minute, and not all of them from Crystal (""You made a woman miaow?"").Whether the movie's assertion that men and women can't be friends is outside the scope of this criticism, though the ending suggests otherwise. And while using 'Auld Lang Syne' to underscore the climax stinks of imitation (Waterloo Bridge, anyone?) it still makes me cry every time.On the down side, this film has a lot to answer for. It gave rise to a stream of soppy joke-free 'comedies', all set in a large American city, with an easy listening soundtrack, a strong yet vulnerable male hero, a sassy yet vulnerable female hero, a couple of mad friends and a cameo from a well-known director (usually Reiner himself).

131,theskylabadventure,The perfect romantic comedy.,8,25 September 2007,"Perhaps the last truly great romantic comedy, 'When Harry Met Sally' has truly stood the test of time.Most movies made in 1989 are condemned (at least for now) to being little more than kitch memorabilia. The movie world owes Rob Reiner a favour for the fact that his fine film is truly timeless. Part of this is due to the fact that it is set over a fifteen year period. Part of it is due to the fine easy listening score. Most of it is due to a very refined director extracting two brilliant performances from a flawless script and a perfectly cast couple of actors.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the titular two, and neither have ever been better. The observation of their relationship is utterly convincing and completely engrossing. Beyond this, there are subtleties that neither actor has ever shown before or since. There are moments early in the film where we can see Sally is falling for Harry (for example, her response to Harrty telling her he is pleased she is going on a date with another man) but these moments are never overplayed. The credit for this is due as much to Reiner as it is to Ryan, as it is his pacing of the film that really allows the actors to embrace their characters.I feel it is worth pointing out here that Reiner's other movies of the time have equally outlasted much of Hollywood's output. 'Satnd By Me', 'This Is Spinal Tap', 'The Princess Bride' and 'Misery' - films that could scarcely be more different in style and tone - all remain bonafide classics. One has to wonder what went wrong...All things considered, it's hard to think of another film from this era of film-making as satisfying and consistently enjoyable as 'When Harry Met Sally'. The fact that this is a romantic comedy made at the tail end of the worst decade cinema has ever known, is all the more reason to commend it.",When Harry Met Sally...

Reiner did an amazing job of telling it like it is (at least in my opinion) and discussing how men and women can NOT be friends.  The movie mentions many things that we know to be true but either never realize or never discuss.  This was the first movie I ever bought on DVD and I still watch it to this day.  Mind you, I am a 30-year-old man and the ending still brings me to tears -- ""I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out, I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich, I love that you get this little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts, I love that after I spend the day with you I can still smell your perfume on my clothes and I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night... and it's NOT because I'm lonely and it's NOT because it's New Year's Eve.

And the supporting cast was excellent; I don't know if I've ever seen Bruno Kirby do a bad job as ""the best friend"", and Carrie Fisher shone.  The scene when the two of them got together was so funny that my husband and I had to pause the movie until we finished laughing.My only problem with the movie is that it is infused with the kind of Hollywood immorality that is in most movies these days.

135,ashi-lance,When harry Met Sally- Highly Recommended!!,9,7 February 2013,"Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies""When Harry Met Sally..."" is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like ""that's really sweet"". The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women.The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!!My Rating - 9/10",When Harry Met Sally...

141,Caledonia Twin #1,A modern masterpiece,8,30 January 2001,"""When Harry Met Sally"" is certainly the wittiest romantic comedy of all time.  It is also perhaps the most daring romantic-comedy ever produced, and I say this out of respect for its sheer honesty about the roles of physical attraction, sex, and friendship between men and women.  For a long time I accidentally avoided the film, though as a graduate of The University of Chicago (where Harry met Sally at the beginning of the film), I finally decided to rent the film, a decade after its original release.  As it turns out, all this time I have been missing one of modern cinema's greatest masterpieces.  Rob Reiner has brought to life a gem of a screenplay, and the inspired performances of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, as well as the supporting cast, create scenes that capture the true essence of people and relationships as they are in life; I never felt that either Harry or Sally were merely ""characters"".   The chemistry between them worked for me; though at times I did feel that Meg Ryan took Sally Allbright's wilful, almost wooden naivete a bit far.  (And to be honest, I fail to see how The University of Chicago could have ever produced a Sally Allbright, whereas Billy Crystal's Harry, with his skepticism, quirky humor, and his insight and questions on the subject of human nature, *would* feel right at home at the U of C. )  All the same, this is not the type of film that comes along every day; Rob Reiner's achievement with this film is of a quality that should stand the test of time.   I find it hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this film.  My rating: 10/10",When Harry Met Sally...
142,Diego_rjc,An excellent romantic comedy that's able to remain fresh and original even today,10,20 December 2010,"First of all, I'd like to say that I pretty much hate romantic comedies. I can't stand them at all. They're all the same, have the same plots, the same characters (in most cases) and even the same actors. The only thing that changes in these kinds of movies is the background in which the characters live. But of course there are exceptions, such as the Hepburn/Grant 1938 flick 'Bringing Up Baby', Woody Allen's Best Picture winner 'Annie Hall', and this movie. 'When Harry Met Sally...' is a romantic comedy that was able to be original in 1989 and remains fresh even nowadays, when most movies from this genre copy what it introduced back then.'When Harry Met Sally...' story focuses on the relationship of Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), covering 12 years of their lives, starting in 1977, when they met in a trip (hence the title), and ending in 1989, the year the movie was made. In these 12 years, Harry and Sally go through many phases. First they hated each other, then they became friends, until they finally realized they loved each other. The story may seem simple enough, but the script written by Nora Ephron - who even got an Oscar nomination for it - manages to tell it in a simple but yet complicated matter, a matter that holds the attention of the viewer during the whole movie. Throughout it, Ephron deals with many themes regarding love, and throws a lot of questions to the viewer, such as ""Can men and women be friends?"" and so on. The script also introduces us to concepts that were used in most of other romantic comedies to come, like the idea of both the main characters having close friends who also fall in love, the feelings that the main characters have for each other, going from hate to love during the movie, and so on. And speaking of the main characters, the character development here is nothing but marvelous, which reflects in Harry's case for example: a character that starts off as a ladies' man, and finishes the movie as guy in love for his then- friend. And it's just this change in the characters that makes the movie so great, and specially, believable. Add this to some fantastic well- written dialog, and you got yourself an excellent script.There's really not much to praise in what regards the acting here. Both the main actors do a pretty good job in portraying their characters, but it's not really that stand-off job. Surprisingly, the best member of the cast is Meg Ryan, in probably the best performance of her career. She manages to deliver a very strong performance and convince as that's Sally, appealing to both men and women - like the movie itself. And she did a hell of a job in the infamous fake orgasm scene, which has got to be one of the most funny scenes ever. Like Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal also does an amazing job. In this movie, he's the guy every man wants to be. Apart from the main duo, the other two important characters are jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher), who do an average job.'When Harry Met Sally...' is directed by the always-great Rob Reiner. I've watched most of his movies, and although this definitely ain't his best work, all can say that Mr. Reiner did a pretty good job directing this picture. Most of the shots don't have much to them, but there are a few scenes where you can watch and say ""Rob Reiner certainly shot that."" And the way he tells the story, interpolating Harry and Sally's story with real couples telling their love-story is a pretty good addiction to the script. I also thought the cinematography here was quite well-done, giving the feeling of New York to the viewer brilliantly.Overall, 'When Harry Met Sally...' is an excellent romantic comedy, that's able to appeal to both men and women. The best thing here is Nora Ephron's very well-written script. The acting is not so great, but it could be worst, though. Rob Reiner's directing made the movie what it is: a romantic comedy that was fresh and original back then and remains so nowadays, even with a lot of the movies from this genre copying many things from 'When Harry Met Sally...'9/10",When Harry Met Sally...

I believe the first half of 20th century some movies gave respect of reflecting the culture,whensleeping with your friend then love of your life was taboo, like in ""It Happened One night"" pushing moral envelope was ""An Affair To Remember"" and classicsimilar throwback fine romantic comedy ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Both receivedFAIR ratings ironically. My heartthrob Meg Ryan stars in it, is well becoming a classic actress as well comic/actor Tom Hanks. The moral issue once calledfornication, now is normal lifestyle for most, ""When Harry Mets Sally"" is a classic fairs with ""Annie Hall,"" should be in Top 250 IMDb List. My folks of 1920s stayed with moral traditional role as orthodox catholics, when choosing a lifelongpartner. Religion played significant role from dating to marriage, unlikeHollywood stars past lived like today's standards. Even though influential,Hollywood is not the blame for the moral culture changes, we baby boomersturned away from Orthodox to Reform (Rebellion). Moral issue aside, oneintensely memorable moments, was Sally (Meg Ryan) fake public orgasm in thediner as another patroness sitting by mesmerized,"" I want what she's having."" 11/10 for that segment.

Fine supporting cast played by Bruce""Bruno"" Kirby Jr. as Jess courting Carrie Fisher as Marie. Rob Reiner director, I believed was clever implemented a cute segue way to next segment of movie, using documentary couples givecute insights to their relationships ,in this case older married couples, small but funny part as Harry and Sally's relationship develop negative and positive. As story moves on, background narratives of Crystal and Ryan voices where's nodialog, their minds speaking adds a flare in my opinion, helps me be in Harry's shoes. Same applies if your a female to Sally's perspective. I know othersmentioned this part but worth repeating since it does not happen in ""real life,"" where Sally is dared by Harry in diner scene publicly faking orgasm, that'salmost the climax of movie no pun intended. Another patroness glued to looking at Sally replies to waiter, ""I'll have what she's having"" may not be verbatim sure was FUNNY. replayed that part over again so good.

147,yawael,Still One Of The Best Romantic Comedies,8,2 January 2019,"(When Harry Met Sally) discuss an important thing that many people are still arguing about it till this day: Men and Women can't be Friends. And for the rest of the film it discuss this issue and make it for sure that no man can ever be a friend to a woman due to the sex part between them.WHMS: is a brilliant comedy with brilliant direction and casting. Starring: Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, and directed by the fabulous Rob Reiner: most known for (Misery 1990 and Stand by me 1986).
Meg Ryan made a lot of comedies, but her best performance was in four films (including this one):
Sleepless In Seattle 1993When Harry Met Sally 1989Joe Versus the Volcano 1990You Have Got A Mail 1998She was really amazing here with hair funny facial expressions and her acting is the same style she uses in SIS, so if you love that film I highly recommend this one.As For Billy Crystal he was funny as usual, he is one of my favorite comedian star of all time, and I don't think that anyone else could portrayed this role as he did, her really was fabulous.At the end the film is powerful convincing source that both men and women can't be friends no matter of what they pretend, someone may disagree with it saying that he or she has a lot of friends from the opposite sex, but the film here is not discussing the normal friendship (which includes dining at the end of the week, or going to a bar and have a drink) it talks about the best friend : so it is impossible to find a best friend female to a guy that goes wherever he goes talks about the smallest details that guys talks about (And the same thing goes for women).Final Rate:

148,Aleona,Sweet,9,27 February 2000,"First of all, this is a great date movie, second of all, it is a wonderful comedy, and third of all, it is an overall an excellent picture.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal make a hilarious couple. The orgasm scene is irresistible. I still roll on the floor of laughter when I see it. Great lines, great music, great actors and a very sweet plot.
This movie warms my heart, it makes me believe in romance and that there is hope for obnoxious men. This movie made me attempt to believe that men can grow up. Of course, it is a movie and it could be an exception. The old couples talking was cute but not really necessary even though I understand that it was all building up to the last scene, the movie would not have suffered much without it. This movie is a classic, the Casablanca talk just ads to it's classiness. See it, if you haven't already.",When Harry Met Sally...

150,Brad2002,THE Romantic Comedy,8,14 February 2004,"Although romantic comedies were made before ""When Harry Met Sally..."", it was the movie that invented the phrase. The movie is about the long, over more than ten years ( though the movie focuses on the last two years ), relationship between Harry and Sally who first meet on their car pooling trip to New York after graduating from university. It explores the question ""Can men and women really be friends?"". It's a whole lot of fun to watch them find out the answer to that question as well as to illustrate a lot of the differences between men and women in terms of wants and needs in a relationship. If you like romantic comedies, you really have to see the modern one that started them all.",When Harry Met Sally...
151,Jodro2,Surprisingly boring,3,10 February 2021,"Because of Covid-19 we're watching far more movies than normal, and by this stage we're exploring old classics. This movie is supposed to be classic, but boy were we disappointed. There's only one truly funny in the entire movie, the famous restaurant scene, and there are a couple of smiles, but overall it just isn't particularly funny.One could perhaps accept the movie as a romantic drama, rather than a romantic comedy, except that there's also not a lot happening from a dramatic point of view. We found ourselves looking at the clock several times, and at one point looking at each other as in, 'shall we stop or continue?' The characters are not particularly interesting, and the story itself is plain boring. Boy-meets-girl and in first instance dislike each other but draw closer over the years? Come on, that's old and by now boring.A movie with a story like that needs an exceptionally witty or insightful script and great acting. The acting wasn't bad, but perhaps because of the 70s and 80s hair and clothes and the other trappings of that time, it felt like an alien country. Was it really normal for women to obsess like that about getting married as if it's the only thing of importance in their lives? It's difficult to really identify with the characters and root for them.In the end our reaction was a shrug of the shoulder. The movie is not truly dreadful, but still felt like a waste of our time. Surprising, because we're fans of some of Rob Reiner's other movies, most notably Spinal Tap.",When Harry Met Sally...

153,yashkadulkar,Unique. Well written. This is just what your heart wants when you are feeling light at hear.,8,20 April 2020,"The title gives you a very wrong impression that this movie is gonna be typical and annoying kind. I felt that too. But I'm gonna say that when I finished the movie I was in total disagreement with my previous self. I won't say this wasn't typical but it had some good laughs. Most importantly, Harry (Billy Crystal) was quite amusing and a charismatic character with whom I wanted to stick with throughout. He uncovers some fine secrets of life while he's being funny at the same time. I mean being subtle at its best. That was really lovely. Of course I won't talk about his performance, he felt like quite real to me. Sally (Meg Ryan), on the other hand, wasn't that appealing to me. Now some of you might contradict me and I totally agree with you too. What I really want to say is the character she plays is quite real too. You have many Sally's around you, you might have been in a relationship with her too, but performance wise I thought she was a little under-ethusiastic. She could've done better. Supporting cast and characters were good too.On a short note I liked the movie, the writing, direction, they might have missed some details but can be totally neglected. Watch it with your boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse or the best partner would be your OPPOSITE GENDER BEST FRIEND if you may.

154,joesiegel,A portrait of the problems of adult love relationships,8,13 February 2020,"Probably the question that approaches this film with the naked eye is can men and women be friends without a sexual attraction involved? However, this film addresses a couple of other questions that I have realized are going unnoticed in the reviews of most people, this movie also talks about the gap between love and friendship, how easy it is to pass from one point to another without knowing it, Harry and Sally probably knew that they were in love from the beginning but refused to accept it and here another interesting subplot opens that addresses another question, or rather the issue of unrequited love affairs.WHMS is an open book on problems of adult life related to love and portrays how women and men face it in different ways, this film, like most, states that men do not pay much attention to this and spend their days having forced relationships without any connection or compassion, just thinking about pleasure, while women cry and suffer thinking about loneliness, it is probably a real portrait, however when Harry discovers that he loves Sally he begins to face these problems more mature way and begins to imagine a life without Sally, Harry goes into shock and runs to look for Sally, this is the moment when Harry really matures, in an early scene Harry tells Jess that he is maturing because now he can having a friendship with a woman without sex in between, however, this is when he discovers that the true way to mature is to have a woman and love her without the sex in between, and this is exactly what he feels for Sally.This movie is a gallery of deep and well-written characters and each one with its well-detailed personality, occasionally Sally's character took a different direction from the original configuration of the script but these problems were only momentary so it practically does not spoil at all the experience and history that apart from talking about sexuality and adult romantic relationships presents other problems of age such as fear of loneliness and becomes the main cause of depression for many people.WHMS also presents a a different portrait of relationships and love, with an existentialist and depressing tone in the style of Woody Allen, full of interesting dialogues that also has many similarities with the epigramatic and sharp dialogues of Woody Allen that evoke extensive discussions on seemingly banal themes.",When Harry Met Sally...

Is it great movie-making?  Probably not.  But it does exactly what it sets out to do - make you laugh (a lot) and just enjoy the time you spend.  By the way, this movie has two added values.  One is when you watch it again, it is like visiting old friends.  Two, if you are doing something else where your eyes and hands are busy (cooking, cleaning, sewing), it is a wonderful movie to listen to.  I rated it a 10 because it succeeds in entertaining.

158,morfunkel,When he had sex and she had sex,4,25 February 2019,"When Harry Met Sally is a romance film about some people who were acquainted and meet each others throughout their lives in New York to make a new relationship. These characters fit very well together in this story and the actors work very well off one another the supporting actors in the film are also well in keeping the story going the entire 95 minute runtime. Which I believe is a perfect runtime of the story it did not need to be any long then it was as it only needed that time to reach the end.
I was fairly entertained throughout the entire film it was fun to watch the characters bounce off of one another to make a heart warming story for two people who didn't really know how to love. This film, directed Rob Reiner and written by Nora Ephron in 1989, worked really well as a fun relationship story but I thought it was alright overall. It is a good movie and put together very well but it is just not my cup of tea. The dialogue was fairly good, I however felt that the movie could have been sweeter and more heart warming if it didn't revolve around sex. There is not a conversation in this movie that doesn't talk about sex and I felt that the character's were kinda gross at the end as they threw themselves at everyone who walked by. Other than there being a large concentration of that topic the dialogue felt very real and natural.
This was my first time watching this film and it was not what I expected it and I thought it was a little refreshing to the other love stories I have seen, that all seem to have a Romeo and Juliet template. This was just two average joe people who who had similar problems, that they couldn't accept their pasts. It was fun to watch them work it out in their different ways, but both ways went back to having sex with random people again. It is fine to have in a movie but the movie was surrounding the sex life of the characters and the ""science about sex, for men and women"".
One of my favorite parts of this film that i thought was done very sweet and cute, was the phone calls between Billy and Meg. At this point in the film the characters have been very good friends and talked to each other about everything in their lives. You could tell that they both wanted a little it more from their relationship but neither one wanted to ruin it and admit that a Women and a Guy couldn't be friends. So they liked to call and talk with one another, to vent about their days and they did this while watching Casablanca on TV. I loved this scene so much because of how it was edited, making it seem as though the characters were sitting next to each watching the film together even though they were both alone at home in bed. Looking at them from behind, it looked like they were on a couch together. It was done very well.
One last thing that I noticed in the movie that is probably very common in movies from this time, but the background in this movie was very strange. The direction for the characters in the background was look busy, or at least that is what it looked like it was to me, they just stood there some times and looked confused or they were whispering as though they didn't want to talk over the main characters covently.
This movie was put together, acted, directed, shot and written fairly well but I just didn't get connected to the characters. I can see how this movie could be someone's favorite romance and be rated so well as sex sells but it was a little too much for me. So on a scale of one to 10 I'd give this a 6.5 out of 10. It was done technically well but I just didn't connect.",When Harry Met Sally...

Another possibility is the Before trilogy. I am sure there are many more.I also wonder if it was entirely scripted or if there was a fair amount of ad-libbing.If you haven't seen it before, it is definitely one for the watch list.",When Harry Met Sally...

162,cinna665,Romantic comedy with an attitude,9,11 January 2006,"When Harry met Sally... is a story of two different people, told with a warm heart. The story starts from Chicago where both Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet for the first time, Harry hitching a ride to New York from Sally. They have an interesting discussion on the ride from Chicago to New York, but in NY their roads go to different directions.After 5 years they meet again. Both have found their places in the Big Apple, Sally's got a boyfriend and Harry's getting married. It is a very brief encounter. It takes another five years until they meet again, this time in a totally different circumstances, which leads to making Harry and Sally finally friends.When Harry met Sally... is a beautiful and warm movie of two totally different people who finally find true love in their lives. For a romantic comedy, it has some more ""edge"", more attitude than romantic comedies usually have.This is Billy Crystal show. Crystal is just amazing as Harry. He is at the same time funny, but with a certain dark side. Once he is madly in love with his ex-wife, second later he is telling Sally how he was having sex with someone the other night.I have never been a big Meg Ryan fan, but she is doing decent in this movie. She is funny, but does not match Crystal brilliant performance.

I could never see the point of spending two hours of your time to watch a movie about two lovers being forced from each other and striving to reunite. I mean where's the interest in that? I'm not saying that I'm a dumb die-hard that needs action to be satisfied, but I do ask that I be given a valid reason to stick around for the touchy love story.So when I decided to rent 'When Harry Met Sally' you could tell that there was going to be some hesitation involved. It looked like any other majorly cliché chick flick that I had previously wasted hours of patience with. But after reading some of the reviews given to it by various critics I thought to myself ""You know what, maybe this going to be something different, something better"", and as it turns out, it was.When Harry Met Sally is a wonderful relief. I finally found a romantic comedy that I can feel comfortable watching. It's an amusing story about that old question; can men and women be friends? It features one of the best match ups ever assembled on screen and a socially hilarious script by Nora Ephron. It's easily the best romantic comedy ever. Meg Ryan is absolutely beautiful and Billy Crystal nails the role of the obnoxious male friend. Of course I can't forget Rob Reiner's brilliant direction, wait a go Rob. It's a shame he doesn't make more movies like this because it really suits him.

I notice how a lot of the romantic comedies of today have been influenced by this movie. The brief true couples part reminded me of the ending of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", as well as the brief twin interviews in ""Jack and Jill"". I love that; it makes the movie all the more interesting and funny, but mainly entertaining. This is another one of those movies I'm ashamed of not seeing earlier in my life; I just can't believe I put such a wonderful movie off for this long. Harry reminded me a little of myself when he explained his logical observations. It's hilarious because he comes across as obnoxious to people on the receiving end. Sally is genuinely high maintenance when it comes to ordering food (also like myself). But the chemistry the two have is perfect. You can tell they're meant for each other; especially when they hate each other. Most 21st century romantic comedies lack meaning (besides sex) and originality. They're out of ideas after all this time I guess. This is a truly brilliant film fun to watch again and again.",When Harry Met Sally...

There is no way to adequately express my feelings about this film, but still I can't help but try.  This film is one of the few in recent viewing that I can watch over and over again, it never tires me.  Both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan do a magnificent job of creating believable, accessible, and extremely memorable characters.  Throughout the course of roughly an hour and a half we are granted admission to the evolution of both Harry and Sally and their relationship.  Rob Reiner does an excellent job with an equally excellent script by Nora Ephron, and though he has proven his diversity through the myriad of memorable films he has made two constant and undeniable qualities flow through his body of work; truth and humanity. Love between two people is one of the hardest things to portray on screen, but Reiner and his crew do a seamless job of making it not only believable, but interesting and heart warming with out being overly sentimental.  Some of the greatest moments are also among the quietest and most subtle, allowing the viewer's appreciation to increase with each viewing.  Almost every frame of this film is a thing of beauty and reiterates something that has recently begun to permeate my thoughts and feelings about great films and that is this: while there may be an array of different qualities under the spectrum of great films one common bond that must always exist is passion.  You get the sense that this is a film which everyone working on it not only understood and believed in, but felt the film was so important that they were determined to make it the best they possibly could, and they certainly did.  The most vital quality a film must possess to be great is relevance to the human experience, in a word universality.  When Harry Met Sally possesses this and so much more and it will continue to be universal, accessible, and relevant far beyond its time.",When Harry Met Sally...

AFI 100 Songs.""When Harry Met Sally"" is easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. It is short in duration, it is extremely watchable, Nora Ephron's script is hilarious, and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan both give fantastic performances. There is very little to dislike about this movie if you are looking for entertainment. However, this is in no means an artsy film or a game-changer, but simply something that will definitely put you in a good mood.When Harry met Sally... they hated each other. Their actual meeting for the first time was nothing special at all: Harry's girlfriend at the start of the movie was a friend of Sally's, and Sally was simply driving Harry back to New York from college because she lived in New York as well. It only takes a couple of minutes into their journey to New York to make it apparent that the script will be full of philosophical discussion between the two of them (as well as other characters) just like most Richard Linklater films. It is an interesting notion that the main point of Harry's initial discussion with Sally is that the two of them can never be friends because the ""sex stuff"" always gets in the way of a man and a woman - yet 10 years after they meet, they become ""just friends"" (but do we really believe that?).There is a very creative scene in the movie about two thirds of the way through where a friend of Harry's and a friend of Sally's are now a couple, and they are each talking on the phone simultaneously with Harry and Sally respectively. Really interesting editing is applied here to get all four characters on the screen at once, each taking up about a fourth of the screen. It is three separate images, the first image being an image of the couple in bed, and the other two being superimposed images of Harry and Sally on opposite ends of the screen while they are each on the phone. It is one of the most creative scenes in Rob Reiner's filmography.Above everything else, ""When Harry Met Sally"" has a lot of heart, which comes in different forms. It has heart due to its sense of humor, it has heart by showing a lot of emotion between Harry and Sally later in the film, and every now and then, the movie cuts to different couples explaining how they met and when they knew they were meant to be together, putting a smile on the audience member's face. It is also a joy to watch Harry and Sally grow as people as they become friends (which is against Harry's initial beliefs) and as they realize their feelings for each other, even if they do not admit those feelings immediately. From the famous ""I'll have what she's having"" moment to the finale at midnight on New Year's Eve, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a triumph of a motion picture, capturing our hearts and holding on throughout.""When Harry Met Sally"" might not be a masterpiece in terms of technicality (it is pretty simply shot and edited aside from that creative scene mentioned above), but it is a film many should experience just for how enjoyable it is. It is a great love story and highly re-watchable.9/10",When Harry Met Sally...

It has some great dialogs and the acting is very nice as well. Especcially these dialogs make it more then worthwhile, something which cannot be said of most romantic comedies. A very strong point is, that the dialogs make you start thinking. At least, that's what I did when I just saw it. With that, the interaction of love between Crystal and Ryan is worked out very well. The idea that destiny is very important in true love is well worked out, maybe even philosophical idea.When Harry met Sally is simply a classic in its genre.A nice 9 out of ten!",When Harry Met Sally...

This is - luckily - no serious psychological analysis, this movie is still fresh and full of life after all these years. If there is one big moral behind it, then it is ""don't think about it"" and ""let things come by themselves"". I love this movie, it never gets boring and it has it place in my collection. It is a story about life and the turnarounds love sometimes does... before it goes back.

Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan meet on the last day of college for a road trip to New York. Their relationship from enemies to a couple over the next 12 years forms the rest of the story. This movie was plenty of fun to watch. The main characters are some of the most memorable characters you will ever see and the dialogue between them feels natural. Billy Crystal plays the smart alec Harry to perfection as the man who thinks he knows it all, but is also someone who seeks a true companion. Meg Ryan is brilliant as the high strung Sally who looks down on most of Harry's actions, but cannot do without him. And who can forget the line ""I'll have what she's having"" said by Rob Reiner's director. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby played great as supporting actors and formed a perfect foil to Harry and Sally. The screenplay keeps you laughing and smiling all the way till they finally get married. From the time they hated each other, to just being friends to becoming a couple, the film has you smiling all the way.After watching the movie, I started to ask myself if a man and woman can only be friends. I don't have the answer to that yet, but this movie has me wondering. Watch it when you get the chance. You will also start to think about whether a man and woman can just be friends.",When Harry Met Sally...

In the film, first, the hero and heroine meet at the first time, but they don't have a good impression about each other. Second, they meet again after a long time and become best friends. Finally, they have a quarrel, but thanks to it, they can get the answer about their doubt. I like the music which is used in the film since it is apropos and gives the film a good effect. Then, I like the theme of this film because it is interesting. Some people probably have a same doubt as the hero and heroine of this film. Therefore, I recommend such people watch this film to get the answer. I feel this film shows us the essence of a relationship of mutual trust between men and women.

180,royals794,Hands down the greatest romantic comedy of all time,10,23 June 2008,"Romantic comedies are perhaps the most formulaic movies around. Some are better than others (such as While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle) and some are weaker (such as License to Wed and others), but they all follow a rather familiar plot. Boy meets girl and after a series of improbable and funny situations, they ultimately fall in love. So how does ""When Harry Met Sally"" feel so original and fresh every time I watch it despite following this same basic premise? Two major reasons stand out which make this film a one of a kind: Firstly, the screenplay is undoubtedly one of the five funniest I've ever seen. It's similar to Juno (which people were divided on; I personally loved it) in terms of it's wittiness and while most people don't talk quite like this, it is a joy to hear the actors perfectly pull it off. Secondly, the actors are perfect. This is essentially a four person movie, and it is perfectly cast; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have the best chemistry that I've ever seen on screen and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher have some of the funniest lines as the best friends of Harry and Sally (""you made a woman meow?!) Each scene is a little gem, from Harry and Sally's first conversation about sex on their way to New York to their chance encounter in an airport to Sally's famous fake orgasm in a restaurant. The movie is also peppered with hilarious tidbits from random couples about how they met and fell in love (""At that moment I knew. I knew the way you know about a good melon."") I am not the kind of guy who hates all romantic comedies, branding them as chick flicks which bore me to tears. In general, they are not my favorite genre, but if done correctly, I enjoy them. ""When Harry Met Sally"" sets the bar for romantic comedies. It is sensational from start to finish and after over a dozen viewings of it, I love it more than ever. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a perfect movie. 10/10!",When Harry Met Sally...
181,belaidinazim-57060,one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time,10,18 September 2021,"When harry met sally is a romantic comedy movie directed by rob reiner starring billy crystal and meg ryan. This movie got nominated for original screenplay Oscar and is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest romcoms ever made if not the greatest.The story is about harry and sally meet each other when she gives him a ride to new York. But it didn't work out and then after 5 years they meet again and it didn't work out either, So after another 5 years they bump into each other, however this time he is married and she is related to someone, but they both find themselves single after days, so now they spend time with each other on one condition no physical connection what means no sex cause they are afraid that it will ruin the relationship. Weird isn't it from what I know sex is an essential part of the relationship between men and women some people even think that it's the most important part of the relationship. Well this movie teaches you the opposite of that. We see these two characters passing time and talking to each other, So the movie is just a lot of dialogue between these two. As a result of that the movie recline on the quality of the writing and the acting of course. The movie goes as they go. If they are bad I don't know if we have got a movie let alone a great movie. It reminds me of the before trilogy just two people walking and chatting nothing much of a story. But at this time they talk with each other on a different period of times for a year not for one day so here is the thing I prefer this movie than all of all of the three movies of the before trilogy. Cause in this case we have two incredible characters. Let me explain why they are great, both of them don't know if they need someone to be with in the first place, they aren't so sure in case they need a husband or a wife what should he look like. I am not talking about the look, I am talking about the character they both have different principles which they don't trust them sometimes to make them happy. Another thing they both like each other from the first meeting but somehow they don't want show it especially sally, they are both educated. As a result of that you never hear some cheap dialogue, its always good dialogue without being too much complex so its easy to understand, and the last thing they are very funny and weirdly complex in their emotions, of course all what I have said about the characters needs to be demonstrated by the actors and they performed very well in this regard. Last thing I want add is the editing, you can't believe how good it is. It shows you 6 months of time without feeling like it .plus the most important thing there is scenes where we see them on separate screens in different places, so this helps the comedy and the romance causes it shows how much close their characters are.As a conclusion I think when harry met sally is one of the greatest romantic comedy of all time I wont say it's the greatest cause there is a movie called annie hall which I don't expect any movie to top it anyway.",When Harry Met Sally...

Not only did I enjoy it for the umpteenth viewing, but she absolutely loved it. I mean, I came home from work tonight, and there she was, watching it - again - for the 5th or 6th time. She loves it because I am Harry and she is Sally. But, more importantly, she loves it - and I love it still - because it is a timeless classic. It's a great movie because Billy Crystal's deadpan delivery of every line hits every time, because Meg Ryan is in her prime as America's sweetheart and plays off Billy so well that it's hard to imagine anybody else in that role, ditto for the rest of the supporting cast, the direction by Reiner is well-paced and doesn't stagnate as many of these rom-coms tend to do, and the interview-style scenes with the random couples are funny and poignant.",When Harry Met Sally...

I guess its the sign of how good this movie is when you don't even realise your already half way through!The choice of cast for this film is just wonderful Billy Crystal's performance is probably one of if not his best ever. Meg Ryan looks just so beautiful. I will say its probably one of the roles people forget Carry fisher did, she might not have been lead but she does a good performance and its not Star Wars.

185,JR-92,toooo muuuch whinnning.,6,27 June 1999,"I see all the favorable reviews of this one, and when I first saw this in '89, I thought ""great"". And it is a leader in the romantic comedy genre. Billy Crystal has a way of pulling off these kinds of roles. He's good, great timing, funny almost anywhere. Meg Ryan plays a good part also; she is good in most of her comedy roles. Her serious roles leave little to be desired. Rob Reiner's direction is good but predictable. We see New York through a stereotypical camera. He makes us think everyone in NYC is Italian when they're young, and when they get old, they become Jewish. I suppose this is humorous to the populace.Well, I watched it again recently, and I have a question: Am I the only one who thinks these characters whine too much? Don't they have any better things to do with their energy than lament over the slightest trouble they confront? Yes, this is ""Seinfeld before Seinfeld"", and Seinfeld is funny, but I can't watch it for too long before feeling exhausted.The movie is about couples and their love troubles. Billy Crystal is charming, woman love this, it's his unintimidating, ""I'm fallible"" humor. Meg Ryan is made out to be a smart career woman who is stupid(big career woman can't drag a Christmas tree).Characters suffering from a neurosis for our entertainment is funny, but it's not romantic. Woody Allen invented neurotic, romantic comedies in the movies. That's enough.If you love the TV comedy ""Seinfeld"", you'll love this one. If you get tired of ""Seinfeld"", you know what to expect. It's entertaining but.............It gets a 6.",When Harry Met Sally...
186,eastie,the perfect modern take on a classic idea,9,20 September 1999,"Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour, When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy, very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenly-matched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another, but over the course of the film, this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed, the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON - he worldly-wise and cynical, she spoiled and certain of what's what. Neither of them, it turns out, is as right or as self-confidant as they believe. What's very modern about WHMS is its attitude to long-term relationships. It's no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what, or who, they're letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible (hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together). Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world, WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally, there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film, they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There's an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film's structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There's a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship - the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film, it comments on the action. The acting is superb, with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) all giving career-best comic performances. Without such fantastic performances, it's very possible that the film could have failed: these are essentially self-indulgent people, that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally, the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that, but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it's funny. The one-liners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing, and the set-pieces are beautifully realised (the orgasm scene is only the most famous - check out Harry's olympic sex-dream speech - ""Must have been the dismount"" - or the ""I'm through making a schmuck out of myself"" phone call). All this, and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? ""Nah, you pretty much want to nail them too.""",When Harry Met Sally...

Rob Reiner is an exceptionally good director as Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are exceptional actors, but either the script or the timing was terrible.  I laughed once at Rob Reiner's mother's line in the restaurant, and that was it.  I didn't even smile through the rest of the movie, not to mention I never felt the urge to weep.

""Divorce"" is not common in India as it is in US. But still ""Love"" always thrives over ""Marriage"". As you can't be happy with a person you are not in love with.

193,learningthelingo,Revisit a classic this Valentine's Day,10,10 February 2010,"I first saw When Harry Met Sally a few years ago. I liked it. I did not love it. It was one of the occasions where I have to unfortunately admit that I just didn't get it. The second time I saw the film, I understood it more. More recently, a few months ago, feeling solemn and down I watched the film, and it lifted my spirits up so high, that I felt like I'd seen it for the first time. So when I watched this film again for what must have been the forth or fifth time, it proved to have not lost its charm.The film starts with and is interspersed with elderly couples discussing how they met, which naturally foreshadows the most probably future for our main characters. The story begins in 1977 where Harry and Sally share a interstate road trip from Chicago University to New York City. They had not met before this time, and only knew each other through Harry's girlfriend whom is also Sally's friend. The car trip does not go well, and by the time they reach New York, they cannot wait to get away from each other. Another 5 years later, they meet again on a flight, and once again have a butting of heads meeting, but of less headstrong based naivety. And then finally, another 5 years later, they meet again and become best friends after both of their long term relationships fall apart, which naturally progresses to something more.What is quite the successful achievement via the actors is the character development from the Chicago University in 1977, to the current 1988/9 time setting that the majority of the film takes place in. And this is where we acknowledge our leading actors.Meg Ryan is irresistible. Her neuroses are so wonderfully put against such an innocent pretty appearance that figuratively shouldn't have anything at all to worry about, which just adds delightful humour to her character and her performance. And it is the chemistry between Ryan and Crystal is charming and adorable.Billy Crystal plays both the familiar comedic role that we are familiar with in his roles previous and following this film, and the much more down to earth, heartbroken and sensitive male. And yet somehow, through this melancholic display, his vulnerability, particularly after his divorce, is very charming.We can see When Harry Met Sally being a slightly updated Annie Hall, (especially if you look at the first image, where we see Ryan looking a lot like Keaton in the costuming) but very different and one that concludes in a more standard classical Hollywood ending. It has a linear storyline, and the couple do not break-up in the end. Despite this seemingly formulaic film, there is the genius of Nora Ephron (who I adore!) behind it's writing, who credits Ryan, Crystal and also director Rob Reiner for some of the idiosyncrasies of the film. Ryan is credited for coming up with the orgasm scene, which naturally, cannot go without notice, as it unfortunately sticks as the most memorable scene in the film. Also, with one of the most memorable lines in any film: ""I'll have what she's having"", being said by Reiner's mother. I say unfortunately as I see this film as the whole package; the ultimate rom-com as it's got something for both the guys and the gals.The film dissects the idea that popular culture tells us that ""Men are from Mars, and women are from Venus."" According to Harry, men and women cannot be friends without the sex getting in the way. In these conversations that continue to flow throughout the film, we see a predated Sex and the City lunch sex conversation. Our famous orgasm scene predates a storyline from Sex and the City by about 10 years in being just as on the mark with frank sexual discussion in the mainstream.Rob Reiner and his genius in the small details is seen where Harry is describing to his writer friend of when his wife left, and after each blow, the stand up and do the Mexican wave, adding comic relief to a very sad story. The phone call conversation between Harry and Jess and Marie and Sally skilfully shows off Reiner's comic timing and the scene is simply hilarious. Also very noteworthy is the New Year's Eve party when both Harry and Sally discover that they have an attraction is just heartbreakingly cute, as it is tragic, mainly, because it ends in just a peck on the mouth.But among all of the funny scenes, the one that sticks out with me the most is just after Harry and Sally have had sex for the first time. The different facial expressions on Harry and Sally is simply amazing. She is content and happy and his face reads ""What have I done?"" and also brings the audience back to the conversation that occurred in the first part of the film where they drive from Chicago to New York, where Harry tells Sally that he wonders how long he has to hold the girl before he can leave. From here, we know that part of their relationship is, if not doomed, then at least troubled.If I can pass on any advice, do yourself a favour and this Valentine's Day, do not go and see Valentine's Day in the cinema, but go rent or buy When Harry Met Sally.",When Harry Met Sally...

To make a whole film about two people meeting through various stages of their lives and and slowly, or should i say very slowly, starting a relationship is boring. I don't care. I don't want to know what will happen in the end. I just don't care.Secondly I did not find anything funny. Now comedy is a matter of taste and the people i watched this with laughed out loud.

Lots of analysis's are being made throughout the movie which are pretty accurate for both sides. Funny thing is that there really is no such thing like friendship after sex -or even after breaking up-. Meg Ryan and -especially- Billy Crystal are at the peak of their performances during the movie, and I must say Meg is a little overpowered by Billy's style and talent. Meg keeps a flat line of act but it would be wrong to say that she effected the film in a negative manner. Quite the contrary actually. And the lenses used during the shots, takes the movie one step higher than its competitors. The autumn shots actually shot me more than the movie itself.

Until that time, all I knew was the fake-orgasm scene, which I must admit, is my least favourite out of the whole movie.  Other than this, I think Ryan and Crystal work really well together, and the script is well written - enough so to allow the audience to really root for them.  It doesn't rely on big explosions or car chases to entertain the audience, and the inserts of the different elderly couples telling the stories of how they met is really sweet and a great idea.

It attacks an age old dilemma- Can friends become more than friends?  Before marriage, most people have friends that they are secretly, or not so secretly, in love with.  WHMS explores the idea of friends taking a relationship to the next level.With supporting roles from Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, and a soundtrack from Harry Connick, Jr. that could not be better, this is a movie ranks in the top 10 in the JB movie file, among films like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  Do not miss this picture.It is- all a once- a great comedy, a fantastic date movie, a terrific 'chick flick', a good movie to cry with and a great movie to laugh with.  This is one of the few films that has it all.  You will find yourself loving and hating and caring about all the characters.  There are scenes that rank among the best in film history- Meg Ryan's fake 'O' scene being the most famous. Adding to this, check the IMDB page and see who the woman is who delivers the line ""I'll have what she's having.""Don't miss this film.",When Harry Met Sally...
201,tedbtb,A classic,8,16 November 2019,"A film to cheer up the lull of a Monday afternoon. A classic Meg Ryan film. Harry met sally focuses on the push and pull of both sexes. The film achieves this through the use of comedy. Its clever and almost silly one liners are incredibly quotable and leave a smirk on the face no matter how many times of viewing. The transition of the protagonists in terms of growth is, for the most part, largely predictable, but hugely enjoyable. Relatable and memorable moments will create an everlasting archive of quotes and similarities that can be summoned occasion after occasion in later life.",When Harry Met Sally...

204,juliehigh,fantastic film,8,12 January 2004,The comedy in this has really lasted over time. I saw it when it first came out and then on TV the other night. It has so much subtle comedy.

205,gameplacereviews,A fun and sweet movie,9,6 March 2014,"When Harry Met Sally Director: Rob Reiner. Starring: Billy Crystal, Meg RyanI watch this movie every New Years Eve and, each time that I see this it is still clever and funny. This film dosen't have much of a plot. It is mainly about two people Harry(played hilariously by Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan). They meet on a trip to New York and they talk and it's so funny. Harry thinks that he knows everything and Sally is obsessive. And then the trip ends and they move on. Later in their lives they meet again and Harry is in a state of knowing nothing and Sally is happy. Then they meet again and this time they become friends and normal romantic comedy stuff happens. Yet this is better. Nora Ephron's writing is so great and clever that you are happy for the whole duration of the movie. There are some funny jokes in here and it really is great. Billy Crystal is the highlight of this film. He is the one with the dialog in the movie and it is so funny to hear his philosophies. He's down to earth and talks a lot. Meg Ryan well acts like Meg Ryan. If you don't know what I mean go watch every romantic comedy that came out in the 90's. This film acts like a chick flick. I mean come on there is a one thing that goes into chick flicks in the 90's. Meg Ryan. And this movie is a romantic comedy but the thing is it's not as fake and magic oriented as movies like the mediocre Sleepless in Seattle.I think what changes this film is mainly the dialog and the sense that the people are progressing through life. The way that time passes and how that changes the characters views makes the film seem real. And it gives you the feeling that these people know each other. Now the ending of this movie is kind of a romantic comedy ending but you don't care. You've had such a charming ride by the end of the film that you don't care if it ends so cheesy. Also as a slight addition there are married people explaining the way they got married scattered throughout the film. And they are nice to listen to. These could have been out of place but they're not. I actually enjoy this a lot. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",When Harry Met Sally...

It introduced the phrases ""High Maintenance"" and ""Low Maintenance"" into the cultural lexicon.It was a groundbreaking film with an incredible cast.

The film shows how, after a couple of false starts, they begin and develop a friendship, which stays constant throughout their turbulent romantic lives. However, the film raises the question, 'Can men and women ever be just friends?'.Personally, I loved this film. It's light-hearted and fun, the greatest laugh coming in the form of the famous 'orgasm scene' in a Manhattan deli. Crystal and Ryan both performed admirably, as did the supporting cast.

214,doctorklopek-1,When Harry Met Sally,7,7 June 2001,"This is an enjoyable film, but certainly not great. It is very much indebted to Woody Allen. The similarities to Annie Hall abound and there are similarities to other Allen films as well. While that in itself may or may not detract from the film's greatness, it simply does not compare to Allen's work. Annie Hall, for example, is much more witty and original, the writing is better, and it has greater depth. *WARNING, SPOILER in the next sentence: This is a basic Hollywood re-work, complete with the happy ending Annie Hall did not have...  Why spend so much time talking about Woody in a review of this film? A. Other people have already given enough synopsis of this film and B. it owes that much to his work...

The University of Chicago was familiar, as I had visited the place even myself, but after that there was only one scene which made me burst into laughter, i.e., the scene where Sally had an orgasm in a restaurant and another customer wanted to have the same (dish) as her.Sally was pretty to watch.

My favorite scene is at the end where Billy's character is telling Meg Ryan's character how much he loves her and why he came to her at someone else's New Year's party. It really is one of those things that you just can't stay mad at, but I really didn't like the diner scene where Med Ryan is faking an orgasm to prove a point to Crystal, it wasn't needed, and I fast forward threw it every time I watch ""When Harry Met Sally.""

Meg Ryan has never been better than she is in this and proves that she is a talented comedy actress. Support from Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher is also excellent.

220,kajmel,Great Comedy That Most People Can Relate To,10,22 May 2006,"This movie is easily one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time. I don't like giving spoilers so I'll just put out some points so you can decide whether or not to rent/buy this: If you like Billy Crystal as a comedian, then you will love this movie. He makes his signature subtle, pessimistic jokes throughout the movie.Meg Ryan is also great. Although her character develops from a snobby, sheltered young woman to a mature, open-minded woman, she maintains this innocence that makes this fun to watch because you get to kind of feel what she feels -- she speaks what comes to mind, and you see her emotions all over her face. It kind of reminds me of her role in Sleepless in Seattle and her other earlier roles.Together, Billy and Meg have this great chemistry on screen, and this makes the movie feel like you're watching a real story. The way the relationship develops is probably the most interesting thing, so even if you know what happens, you will enjoy watching it happen. If you don't know what happens, it's a perfect feel-good movie with a happy ending, but it's not easy to predict how it gets to the happy ending.Overall, this movie is a great choice if you're looking for something uplifting, romantic, and funny but also realistic and not too mushy.",When Harry Met Sally...

I'm stunned how many Allen trademarks were ""borrowed"" for this film (starting with neurotic Jewish male / flakey Shiksa princess romance all the way on down to the use of ""It Had To Be You"" -- ANNIE HALL's theme song).  I can just imagine the pitch meeting:  ""It's like ANNIE HALL, only re-imagined by Neil Simon as a sitcom pilot!""  I mean, it's a sweet movie, but I think its classic status is way overscaled.

227,lovedance215,"Amazingly charming, romantic, and funny.",10,2 January 2005,"I saw this movie for the first on New Years Day of 2005 (perfect day for this exact film) and thought it was absolutely fantastic. A great film with great actors and a great story to it. I've always heard people say this movie was a fantastic example of a great romantic comedy and have always wanted to, but never got around to seeing it. And I'm so glad I did.The performance from Meg Ryan is by far one of her best performances I've ever seen. She makes her character come to life and you feel like Sally is real. Same with Billy Crystal. This really was the best performance I've ever seen from him. His acting was extremely good. Ryan and Crystal's on screen chemistry is some of the best I've seen in the romantic film industry. And this whole movie will keep you dying to watch these two amazing people get together.This movie is brilliantly written and also provides some of the best one liners ever. ""All have what shes having."", ""Oh, but ""baby fish mouth"" is sweeping the nation? I hear them talking."" and even the practical theme of the film ""men and women can never be friends."" This movie is great for all people. First of all he humor is amazingly well written. And its also great for the hopeless romantics out there. I still after watching this movie about 10 times since New Years, tear up at the end when Harry says ""I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle in your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."" Possibly the best monologue I've ever heard in a movie. Its really amazing. Everything was well distributed between the comedy and romance so you everyone gets just what they need out of it.If that doesn't convince you than I don't know what will.

232,miguel bakunin,"depressingly realistic, but too much fuss about marriage",8,1 May 2001,"I loved this movie from the start, and even after the sixth time watching it's still great. The main theme of the movie, Harry's point that men and women can't possibly be friends, is bitter and really a problem. Harry and Sally, who at first are little attracted to each other, develop an intense platonic relationship, but when finally ""the sex part gets in the way"", all seems lost at first.There's one thing that I dislike much about this movie as well as about other stories that tackle the same topic: it's that marriage is depicted as the summit of love. The interludes with couples telling the stories of their relationships and how long they've been married already could be meant ironically since love doesn't always play a great role, but altogether the movie seems to hold that when two people love each other there's only one more thing to be done: get married; instead of just being happy to have found each other and to fit perfectly together.In a way the movie plot both supports Harry's theory and provides a way out: keep away from the other sex, or if you can't, marry the person of your interest. ouarg!But nevertheless: for all its absolutely great dialogues (Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal play their parts very well) it's really worth watching.",When Harry Met Sally...

236,michael-cone17,Loved the Christmas,6,10 February 2012,"Just think of all the conventions it gets in, and skewers: the one-track mind male (Harry); the ""sensitive"" and practical female, repulsed yet intrigued by said male (Sally); the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field (Carrie Fisher, who keeps an index card file of ""available"" men); the live-ins who can't ""commit"" (Sally and her ex-boyfriend); women's concern with middle age and their biological clock (""I'm gonna be 40,"" weeps Sally. ""When?"" asks Harry. ""Someday.""); the male's tendency to skip out after making love; the horror and unpredictability of blind dates; and, in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore, women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy, humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry - predictably, perhaps, as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still, seeing him in this after years of half-baked movies and fawning Oscar presentations, it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and *still* be likable. Yo, Billy, if you're listening out there: try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles; it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry, though, Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system. This role, deservedly, made her a star - but she has tried to go back to this particular well once too many times, and it's become way too familiar: you know, the adorable, bright-eyed bit - mentally disheveled, prissy around the edges with just a wisp of klutziness, all topped by that cute, mega-watt smile. It has become now the ""Meg Ryan"" character, but back when Sally came along it was still fresh, and it was tied to a particular personality. Ryan gives Sally a shy-cum-toughness as well as a moody, slightly cynical and self-deprecating wit that is just totally right. She and Crystal play off each other like two old pros, and they weave in and out of some charming and hilarious verbal music.",When Harry Met Sally...
237,info-540-718180,Near perfect romantic comedy,7,27 November 2012,"Near perfect romantic comedy about two friends who test the myth that men and women can never be ""just friends"". Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet when sharing a long hour car journey to New York after graduating college, spending the time bickering about relationships and life. They eventually agree that men and women can never be platonic friends as sex will always get in the way. They part company and their lives move on, but years later they encounter each other again and the same issue is raised. The real star of the film is Nora Ephron's sparkling script full of fantastic organic lines that flow through the characters and never feel forced. It's written and delivered so expertly it's at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the 'couple' delivering pitch perfect performances that don't overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likability into the characters. It's a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question ""Can men and women be friends?"" is around.",When Harry Met Sally...
238,tobiqq1,Lighthearted story about the build up of love between two old acquaintances,4,23 January 2014,"I watched the film because someone suggested me that film as a primary example for a lighthearted love film. In that respect it worked quite well for me. It had plenty of light but sincere dialogs that people discredit way to often. The acting is pretty calm and emotions are shown in a controllable manner. But that is pretty much the bottom line of the movie. The film completely rejects the difficult aspects of love since none of the two is ever really isolated, lonely or desperate. They have either each other or friends who cheer them up with smooth remarks. My guess is that this film appears better to people who shy away from spending to much time alone. As for me it did not really work as I prefer a satirical or poetical treatment of the misery of love to not really mentioning it at all. Of course I also saw the scene when Harry meets his ex-wife or when Sally learned about Joe's marriage. But those moments were lived though in company and Sally's was answered with sex. In a way it paved the way for the happy end. Of course the film is a piece of fiction but to me that is too simple to offer any reason for joy in the end. The love they have in the end is as light as the whole film. As a result it seems to be something that feels nice but dispensable. I thought it was an OK ending since it left out too many fancy objects and focused on the lovers. I prefer more complex movies but acknowledge that movies like this are important to make people feel good once in a while.",When Harry Met Sally...

Since then I have seen many other rom coms but never can they beat this classic. A perfect combination of humour and romance. The dialogue is memorable and the actor's have amazing chemistry.

240,Juli-4,"best answer to ""what's you favorite movie?""",10,13 February 2001,"I have seen ""When Harry Met Sally"" several times and every time I watch it, I like it more and more. It contains some of the best lines in the history of cinema, some funniest and most famous scenes and examples of brilliant acting. It's not only funny and entertaining, but it also tackles a question that concerns us all ""can men and women be friends"". The movie maintains that sex does always get in the way, but somehow, after following Harry and Sally's great story, we don't seem to mind it. And we just wish we met someone who would come to us ""because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."" Now when my friends ask me, ""what's your favorite movie?"", I know exactly what to say. A day before Valentine's, I hope that you will find the (wo)man you're supposed to marry before somebody else finds him/her, so that you won't have to spend the rest of your life thinking that somebody else is married to your husband/wife!",When Harry Met Sally...

Even some really good movies cannot withstand the close, merciless scrutiny of a third viewing.And then I find movies that I can watch hundreds of times, and every time, find something new to enjoy. This is one of those precious few movies which continues to seem amazing to me, even the eleventh time. It's about imperfect, neurotic people, and maybe that's why it's so easy to identify with and to love. It also has an original, hilarious and quotable script, and actors that play their parts so well, it becomes hard to disassociate them from their characters. (Carrie Fisher in Star Wars, as Princess Leia? No way.) If you've ever had a friend of the opposite sex, go and see this movie.",When Harry Met Sally...

However, Sally did not like him and even hated him. For such a relationship, or maybe no relationship built between them, you can't imagine they can became lover and eventually getting married. The story was very romantic. When they were friends, they talked everything, they shared, they accepted, understood and respected each other. I think it's very important for creating a harmonize relationship.

I know it is not the popular view, but the scene there the man is driving along, and is spitting grape-seeds out the window turned me off. What turned me off even more is that nothing happened! I would have loved to have shown that scene to a whole lot of young girls and asked ""Is this the kind of man you want to bring home and meet mum?"" It seems to me that Americans cannot do these kinds of movies without being slobs, displaying bad manners, or making a mess.

""After reading it, I realized that it would appeare at the end of the film. What really touched me was not how unexpected the two characters finally fell in love, but that they had experienced many joys and sorrows, weeping for others or crying for others after 12 years, but they still can't look back at the epiphany of true love. The ability to invest passionately and still love each other. It seems that the wear of experience and the erosion of years have turned into fertile soil to make feelings blossom. It shows that there is no set love, only two people who are in love are willing to love, and it is there. Falling in love is the hardest thing in the world, it can also be the simplest thing.",When Harry Met Sally...

If one ever looks for a manual on how to handle love-pains with humor, this movie is the ultimate guide. Humor lost and refound. Over the years I've viewed it many times and always I have had a tender but deep satisfaction seeing the story unfold. I don't doubt it was the fruit of countless hours of sharp-minded observation of the people around us. The girl next door. In truth words are unnecessary.

There maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch, and the cinematic are a little slipshod, the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it.

249,theoryofjack,You Say Either And I Say Either...,10,25 August 2009,"I first watched this when I was 22, the age of the characters in the movie. Then, throughout the years I would watch this movie once or twice a year always comparing my life to theirs as they ""aged"" in the movie. I've lived in Chicago and all over the United States and have in one way, shape or form lived each and every scene from this movie. Not intentionally and sometimes unfortunately, but I would always notice the lines or the movements within my own realm and sometimes laugh and sometimes not be very happy given that life can slap one across the face. What it comes down to is I love this movie as it will make one think, laugh and pause all at the same time without being overly clever and trying too hard as is with the current mix of ""romantic comedies"" today. But it is clever and that's the thing. I'm sure I'll be 94 one day and watching this movie and still thinking that I'll somehow bump into Meg Ryan at a bookstore and she'll fall in love with me. This movie set precedents for how to set up scenes in many different movies as I've noticed over the years. When Harry Met Sally is like a 1940's movie with a modern twist......Even 20 somethings of today I believe will appreciate this little gem. It's the small things in the movie that give it character.

The comedy genius of this movie is so great that you can't really appreciate all of the funny lines until you've seen the movie several times. I love the different hair-do's of Sally and all of the changes that she goes through, as well as Harry. My favorite scene is when Harry and Sally are in Sharper Image and they are singing on the karaoke machine. Hilarious doesn't describe that scene especially when Helen shows up with Ira and there's Sally's voice echoing ""HELEN"" across the store. If I could give this movie 20 stars, I would.

After watching the first ten minutes of the movie, I was hooked - like never before.The movie delivers a story about a friendship that through the years grows into something else. Sounds like your typical Rom Com - it isn't. The reason this movie rises above all others is simple. It has the full package. The cast is perfect, the dialogue is funny and razor sharp, the plot is engaging, smart and believable, and it just offers a fresh and endearing story of love.The dialogue is so sharp and the context of the conversations so engaging, it really gets your attention. The movie debates if men and women can have a friendship without any sexual attention from one side or the other. And it really makes you think about it, and that to me is one of the rare treats this film alone offers.When it comes to acting, it is superb. Meg Ryan is perfect as uptight yet endearing young woman and Billy Crystal is beyond words as a witty and cynical man that he in the movie is. He outshines your typical handsome male lead any day. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby are great in supporting roles.Over all this is the most enjoyable movie you ever come across, especially if romantic movies are your cup of coffee(I don't like tea). This movie is truly the king of it's genre. To me it will always be the movie to which I shall compare any romantic comedy I watch. Watch it.",When Harry Met Sally...

The clever script,Nora Ephron) and shrewdly not overdone stereotypes are thoroughly entertaining. The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is electric. A sparkling diamond of a movie, emotionally felt, and uplifting. The prototype for romantic comedy. Kudos to Rob Reiner for weaving this masterpiece. Stunningly touching, and uproariously funny. This film aligns itself with the very best of the Woody Allen oeuvre. Love discovered, lost, and regained, in the big city.

A light-hearted take on the question""Can a man and woman every be just friends?"". Casting proves to be one of the film's strengths. Rob Reiner's excellent instinct for jokes and punchlines paired with the obvious chemistry between Crystal and Ryan makes for an outstanding classic. What adds to the greatness of the movie is that it was not so much about Harry and Sally as it is about men and women in general. Reiner includes documentary-style interviews of couples who recall their first encounter which adds to the reality of the movie and makes this romantic comedy slightly different from the rest.

The cinematography (spelling?) is amazing: it's shot throughout NYC, all these beautiful places like the Museum of Natural History and of course, Central Park. It's about realistic people trying to find themselves, trying to find a connection. You get to watch the characters develop from 'young adults' to full blown adults, complete with hair and clothing changes as the times themselves changed. What's amazing about this film, is that although the characters are very ""normal"" they're still quirky. This was NOT the norm for films or TV shows of that time frame (they generally had only 1 quirky character). It's honest about sex and relationships. Funny and romantic.

268,vandyke9491,"""When Harry Met Sally"" - Stands the Test of Time",10,8 January 2006,"""When Harry Met Sally"" may not at first seem to be the kind of film that remains classic and timeless. In this very cute exploration of an age-old question: ""Can men and women truly just be friends?,"" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play the kind of characters we have come to love to see them play. No surprises there as they skillfully banter back and forth between adorable, hysterical and morose as the plot rolls on. But upon closer inspection, this film is actually full of nice surprises, including its durability. Watch carefully and you will find one of the best examples of the way an excellent script can propel the plot, character development and pacing of a film perfectly from start to finish. Many lines may seem to be merely entertaining one-liners, but they also serve these other purposes simultaneously. This is a well crafted and well acted script. Even the most dated aspect of the film, the intentional focus on clothing, hair and makeup styles as they change throughout the decades, has taken an unexpected poignancy now that the styles we may remember as current at the time have come to be old-fashioned themselves. The end result is that ""When Harry Met Sally"" speaks to us if we remember the times portrayed in the film or not. We're still asking questions about men and women and friendship, and films such as this still help us answer them.",When Harry Met Sally...

The script and characters harken back to the days when movies were so much more wordy and eccentric and both Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal create the perfect chemistry. When Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron got together to make this film their blend of talents really created something special.

It's the perfect essence of American comedies: I'm not perfect, my life is sometimes a real mess, but, hey!, there is still something out there to smile at. It's full of prejudices, it's politically incorrect (for instance, Sally acting an orgasm in a family dinner, and a woman asking for the same dish!), and, of course, the way destiny crashes right in the face of characters is plain hilarious, just perfect!. Cristal, Ryan and Hanks are the best ever in the genre! They should do something together sometime. Anyway, as I said, that ""barely perfect"" is just a hard thing to say, specially because the other ones are ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've got Mail"", and for some reason i'd rate them the same. It's just the way things seem not to match, you got the worst luck over the Earth and...

The friendship may have lapses, but they never forget about each other throughout the movie. This makes for a great film for a new couple to watch as well.

This film brings you to great laughing sieges, and hides within it wonderful lines that shall stick to your mind, and mix with your  way of talk forever (`You're right, you're right, I know you're right...'). It is directed with great emotional capacity, and written with an innovative sense, a look towards the future. The actors are wonderful, they have great chemistry. This is the best role either of them has ever had. Billy Crystal is a hilarious comedian, and Meg Ryan has a perfect sense of timing. Everybody agrees (for how can you not?) that the `orgasm scene' is boisterously entertaining (did you know it was not written in the script by Nora Ephron, but was Meg Ryan's idea?), and this movie has definitely contributed to the cinema industry. It's first half is brilliant, the conversation in the car on the way to New York is pure comedy  witty, intelligent and fun. The second half of the movie flirts dangerously with the realm of the `lovey-dovey' world, but it manages to escape just on time. Even though it might be less funny, it is essential for the well-being of the movie, and it makes it work.Anyone who has not seen this movie should rush and get it as we speak. This is a real classic  everyone should have it at home, for a rainy day...",When Harry Met Sally...
286,Natalia_2011,Fun Romantic Comedy!,8,17 June 2011,"When Harry Met Sally is a wonderfully entertaining comedy about love and relationships. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) are two very different people who disagree on one main subject: can men and women really just ""be friends"" without having sex? After their first meeting during a drive from Chicago to New York, they go their separate ways with no answer and no friendship. It takes them over a decade, after later encounters, failed relationships, a humorously horrifying blind date, and further complicated situations, before they have their answer and discover their destiny. By no means an empty ""chick flick"" or tear-jerker romance, When Harry Met Sally is full of witty dialogue, contains both serious and comical portrayals of life and love, and speaks to today's audience just as much as it did in 1989. Though When Harry Met Sally don't offer alternative possibilities to the question, ""Can men and women just be friends?"" it does show us that, while relationships are never easy and the road to love can be a long and complicated one, we will eventually find our way in the end.Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan give a good performance and seem like a natural couple, while Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher (Harry and Sally's friend-couple Jess and Marie), are great supporting actors whose inclusion contributes well to the story's overall theme. Besides Harry and Sally's arguments in the midst of their developing relationship, their interaction with Jess and Marie also show the different aspects of human relationships and male/female situations.The filming techniques were overall very well-done. Although many of the scenes use a simple quick cut, jumping from one scene to the other, this does not make the film appear choppy or incoherent. Most events flow naturally, and when the film goes back and forth between the lives of Harry and Sally and their conversations among friends, this faster cutting speed is done effectively and creates a more comical, lighthearted mood to deal with the theme. Occasionally throughout the film, a brief segment with an old couple suddenly appears, and the couple tells us a story of how they met. This adds a nice touch and ties in with the overall story. They are there to remind us how randomly relationships can begin and that Harry and Sally's relationship is such a story. Angles from the indirect-subjective point of view show us the different emotions that the main characters go through during the course of their relationship, and our natural focus is on them as we watch their facial expressions and conversations against a blurred background.In many ways, When Harry Met Sally can be considered a more modern Annie Hall when it comes to theme, style and presentation of the plot. Though different, we see a lot of similar techniques used, such as fast cuts between scenes, simultaneous scenes (Harry and Sally talking on the telephone to each other and watching the same film), and internal dialogue (when Harry and Sally are simultaneously thinking about how to tell each other that their making love was a mistake). Both films are witty presentations of the complexity of human relationships, though in my opinion, When Harry Met Sally produces more laughs and is less philosophical than Annie Hall. The couple in Annie Hall never does fully solve their relationship dilemma, but Harry and Sally do. However, it's not the end result, but the journey that makes this movie – and life – an interesting one full of entertainment.",When Harry Met Sally...

290,penngrl4eva,You can't turn this one off!,9,25 June 2005,"I first saw this movie at a sleepover with my friend at my house and we were flipping around to see what was on, and this was on one of the channels so she suggested we watch it before we go to bed. She fell asleep about halfway through it and although I, too, was tired I could not turn it off! I simply had to find out what happened to Harry and Sally.This is a beautifully sentimental movie that illustrates two people as they hate each other, then like each other, then love each other over the course of 12 years. There are many classic moments that are hard to forget.The performances in this movie are very good and were cast perfectly. I recommend this movie to everyone that is in the mood for a GREAT love story.",When Harry Met Sally...

There were some interesting/entertaining arguments, and unlike some other romance flicks there wasn't a lot of over the top, sappy moments. It felt real. Very well done.",When Harry Met Sally...
292,carlrousseau,easily the best romantic comedy of all time,9,11 December 2006,"I absolutely loved this film. It was witty, clever, subtle, and poignant...not to mention hilarious. The quality of the writing isn't something that we see very often nowadays. The performances given by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were absolutely astounding. Ryan's character was stubborn yet vulnerable, which she communicated quite well. Crystal's comedic timing was pure genius. Ryan and Crystal's on-screen chemistry is the stuff that romantic comedies are made of. This film sparked a series of romantic comedies that have a lasting quality in the late 80's and early 90's(i.e.- Sleepless in Seattle etc.). I recommend that anyone, who is interested in seeing a quality film with quality acting and writing, should see this movie.",When Harry Met Sally...

It's just a beautiful story through and through. So many great moments. I don't rewatch movies often, but this one has been on my screen for at least four times for sure. And every time it makes me feel as hopeful as the last. Truly, a film for hopeful romantics.",When Harry Met Sally...
294,nirumasa,The best dialog in romantic comedies!!,10,10 June 2005,"Don't look! Just listen. It'll work. Of course you can enjoy watching it as well. But if you think Billy Crystal is not handsome enough to play a leading role in romantic comedies, or if you think Meg Ryan is still so cute to make you feel sick, it'd be better for you to listen to the movie with your eyes closed. Because the dialog is the best part of the movie, which is witty, piercing and memorable. The cast did a wonderful job in the dialog. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal seemed to be mismatched together at first. But soon you'll find that they are not only making a miraculous harmony but also enhanced the quality of the dialog itself. Billy Crystal especially makes you giggle or laugh with his well-known sense of humor. The supporting cast is also appropriate. In their conversations you hardly find flowery words. They are always dry and blunt, and it makes this movie different from other mainstream sweet romantic comedies. And the screenplay is also good. ""Men and women can never be friends."" This topic keeps appealing to you throughout the dialog, which is really sensible and you can really identify yourself with the characters. Don't you think it's nice to have someone, who you believed was your best friend for a long time, turns out to be the one you really really love?",When Harry Met Sally...
295,austindani,Not Convinced,1,3 March 2015,"Is it a well written film? Funny? With a tickle me enchanted ending? Yes, yes, and awww, yes.Once Billy Crystal's twinkling eyes and Meg Ryan's hopeful smile fade from the screen, my elated happily-ever-after feelings felt a bit: wrong. Something was off with the story...but what? After thinking about it, I realized that Billy Crystal's character, Harry, never actually changed. In the beginning of the film Harry tries to cheat on his girlfriend with Sally. He asks Sally to sleep with him and she is disgusted at his bold lack of commitment. At the end of the film, after 12 years of friendship with him: Sally sleeps with Harry. Surprise, surprise, Harry doesn't want to commit to her. He nearly bolts out of the apartment after intimacy. He is emotionally distant. He is terrified of even having to physically be there, much less be there for her in any other sense.Afterward, he apologizes. He wants to keep the friendship he enjoyed, and decides, after a lonely New Years Eve, he is ready to marry her. So what? So what? He is still the same person after 12 years. He doesn't want to lose the relationship he enjoyed BUT, that doesn't necessarily mean he will be the committed, faithful, responsible man he has never been.I'd like to see their happily ever after.Maybe he would be true to form and cheat on her with her friend like he tried in the beginning.Maybe he would feel ""suffocated"" like he did immediately after sex and decide to divorce or ""go to get milk"" without return.Perhaps they would stay married all their lives and he would consistently display his lack of responsibility and intimacy. He wouldn't show up to Jimmie's ball games, he'd spend most of his time out with friends at bars or at the office. He'd be the first to grab travel assignments for a chance to get away from ""the ball and chain."" I don't put a lot of stock in a character that for 12 years consistently shows himself to abhor responsibility and then makes a snap decision to get married to a goody two shoes woman who sees rainbows in sewage puddles.This movie reads as deceptively bad advice to women. And gives a bad role model for men. After the happy ending, I think Harry and Sally are both due to be very miserable.",When Harry Met Sally...
296,g-64792,Missing Meg Ryan's romantic comedy,10,23 November 2015,"I give this movie a 10 not because I think it's as good as The God Father. My enjoyment is based on its simple plot, quotable dialogs, the progressive chemistry, and the one and only Meg Ryan. I can't ask more for a typical romantic comedy. When some 'successful' romantic comedies today are merely nothing but a accumulation of stars, it makes me miss Meg's top three movies even more, which are When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle, You've Got Mail. Then the reason why I regard this one as the best is its foreseeable ending but with touchingly unforgettable 'Harry style' lines, and now I can see that what Sally replies is just a good summary of their relationship, which I was unable to understand in this way at the first time I saw it.",When Harry Met Sally...
297,jackcochran,This movie is timeless...,10,7 August 2005,"I love this movie and have seen it more times than I care to admit. It is a movie that one could easily interchange Billy Crystal with Cary Grant and Meg Ryan with Kate Hepburn, change from color to black & white and it wouldn't skip a beat. And no, I don't think these modern actors compare with the past ones, it is the classiness, wit and dialogue of this movie that is the comparison. This movie just feels like home to me for some reason. Billy Crystal did a superb job in this flick as a chauvinistic jerk-love me I'm really funny type of guy and Meg Ryan did very well playing the naive-wait a minute I'll kick your butt with my girl power/or wait, I'm a scared little girl part. Meg did this film right at the perfect moment in not only her career, but the age she was when she did it.....I bring up age because she was right at that point of understanding the world, but still having a distinct sweetness in spite of it.....now she seems like an angry short guy with a really cute nose. Billy did this film right at the point when he understood how to act and hits his part perfect.....seems like an odd pairing these two, but it actually worked perfect. Rob Schneider was perfect directing this film in he put in his genius at the right places and let the actors be themselves in other parts.....Nora Ephron wrote this as well as ""Sleepless In Seattle"" & ""You've Got Mail"" which are both accommodating movies indeed, but When Harry Met Sally is ""The Matrix"" and the other two are .... you get what I mean. Anyhow, you do not have to be a fan of Meg or Billy or Schneider or Nora to even like this movie.....it's the kind of movie that taps you on the shoulder when you're in a daze thinking and makes you feel warm and fuzzy from the touch. Oh, and one other thing.....there are stories told by much older couples about how they met injected throughout the movie that are priceless little gems. Oh, and one more thing......watch for President Gerald Fords' son in the movie as just a side tidbit....hint: he used to be friends with Billys' character. Enjoy.",When Harry Met Sally...
298,TrevBroh,Simply dreadful,1,16 August 2005,"Sorry, but someone's got to say it ... this movie is dreadful! Perhaps I don't have the right to pass judgement since I only managed to sit through about half of it, but I can't stand seeing all these 5 star eulogies and no-one putting the case for the prosecution.Meg Ryan, probably the most irritating actress to have (dis-)graced the big screen, had already perfected her cutesy/dippy persona to such an extent that five minutes exposure was enough to send the less hardened of us gibbering from the room. Even fifteen years later, I'm finding it difficult to cope with the trauma of having been shut in a darkened cinema with 'that performance'.As for the 'memorable dialogue' - it's possible I've blanked it out to protect myself, but I certainly couldn't repeat any of it now. Or even a minute after I left the building. Apart, of course, from the 'hilariously' original orgasm scene. Aaaagh! To give you a little context, I generally don't much like Hollywood movies - but I don't slate them all. This really is poor.Oh! And by the way ... it's boring!!! Well, there it is. I'm glad to get that off my chest!",When Harry Met Sally...

301,valeriev323,Timeless Classic,10,3 December 2005,"When Harry Met Sally. One of the greatest movies of our time. True I was only a year when it came out but once I discovered it many a year later I can not stop watching. It is one of the most timeless and most relatable films. Everyone can find something to relate to in this movie as it attempts to answer the age old question: Can men and women be friends? Or does the sex thing always get in the way? From Sally's sweet naiveness to Harry's outspoken ways the characters always feel like old friends. The quotes are memorable from days of the week underpants: Sally: ""They don't make Sunday"" Harry:""Why not?"" Sally: ""Because of God"" to Answering Machine ramblings: Harry: ""The fact that you're not answering leads me to believe that (a) You're not home, (b) You're home but you don't want to talk to me, or (c) You're home, desperately want to talk to me, but you're trapped under something heavy. If it's either (a) or (c), please give me a call.""Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron could not have possibly written a better screenplay. It's witty. It's charming. It's simply wonderful and this review does absolutely no justice to the film. You just have to watch it and fall in love with it yourself because trust me you will.",When Harry Met Sally...
302,crfr,Great Timeless Classic,10,24 April 2010,"First off, my wife hates this movie and it's supposed to be a chick flick. Go figure.This is one of my all time favorite movies. The lines in this movie are sheer genius. ""Guys can't be friends with ugly girls either 'cause they pretty much want to nail 'em too."" One of the most powerful lines is the New Years party where Crystal's character realizes he's in love with Ryan's character. ""...when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."" I love the interaction between Crytal's and Ryan's character. ""You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance."" I am not a big Ryan fan but she is the most beautiful she has every been in this movie. The make up, lighting,whatever couldn't have been more perfect. She is BEAUTIFUL!

305,jackplum,Classic film that helped move along Seinfeld & every other romantic comedy after it.,10,16 March 2006,"What is most excellent about this movie are the actors......they were perfect for their roles and the writing is superb. What is sad is todays 20-somethings actually think the romantic comedies being made today are good and the irony that follows is you have to be ""in the time"" to really appreciate a movie.....HOWEVER, that notwithstanding if you have a brain in your skull and the ability to ""see"" humor then this movie is definitely for you. This is probably the best first date movie on the planet. It's not too ""schmoopie"" and doesn't have an ounce of intrigue....just straight forward angst and the ability to just make you feel all warm and fuzzy all over....Even if you're just a single, angry guy with nothing to do in the middle of the night this movie will give you hope. (hmm, I wonder how I know that). Anyhow, this movie will last forever....Sleepless In Seattle & You've Got Mail are by the same writer (nora ephron) and W.H.M.S. is the best of them easily.....Although if Sleepless was before WHMS I might say it the other way around....Although sleepless has the death plot in it so as a true romantic comedy it's not and WHMS is. Did all that make sense? I've probably had too much Frogs Leap. Happy film watching out there earthlings! By the way, MEN! As a second date where you cook her dinner at your place....rent out this movie and you'll be suckin' face by 10o'clock.",When Harry Met Sally...
