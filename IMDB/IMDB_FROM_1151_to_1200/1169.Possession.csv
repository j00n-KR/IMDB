0,Leofwine_draca,Bizarre and brilliant,10,12 October 2016,"One of the hands-down most bizarre movies you'll see in your entire life, Andrzej Zulawski's POSSESSION is a remarkable film that resists efforts to pigeonhole it into a genre. Is it a film about marriage breakdown, a la the great European art-house directors of old? Is it a slimy, slithery outer-space horror flick? Is it a crime flick, like the '70s Italian police movies, with private eyes, motorbike chases, and stunts? Or is it a character study of madness and self-hatred, a la Polanski's REPULSION? The answer is none of these and all of them. POSSESSION is a one of a film and a guaranteed love-it or hate-it experience.For what it's worth, I thought it was a really good film, even if it was once of those efforts that make you feel uncomfortable and, in a way, leave you wishing you'd never seen it (I felt the same about THE EXORCIST). Sometimes horror can be just too effective. The marriage disintegration scenes were the worst part of the film for me. Zulawski has his actors shout and scream their way through scene after scene, almost brawling in some instances, hitting and cutting each other and trashing their apartment. Don't expect subtlety here – characters have sudden mood swings and can transform from caring lovers to violent psychopaths in a split second. Isabelle Adjani carries the film, and I actually find her the most frightening thing on screen: her blank stare and icy demeanour give her an almost alien look. You end up really convinced that SHE is mad, so it may be one of the best performances out there.Sam Neill fares less role in a kind of up-and-down role, in the same year that he made his name in OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT. Is he the hero? Is he the villain? Again, he's both and neither, and while I do like this actor a lot, some of his overacting is a little embarrassing. For his worth, though, Zulawski has assembled a great supporting cast of bit players and weirdos, with the highlight being Heinz Bennent's bisexual druggie. This man should have had an Oscar for the creepy character he plays here! One of the main characters in the film is a rarely-seen monster, a weird tentacled squid man animated by great effects from technician Carlo Rombaldi. This is a fantastic creation, even better as we only see it in a handful of moments, and once again Rombaldi has surpassed himself, here at the very highlight of his career.Where to begin with the rest of the movie? Some of it is nasty, with Adjani committing bloody murders and detectives lurking around; it feels like a giallo, something Argento would make, perhaps. The ending throws in some superbly-shot action scenes which come as a nice pay-off for the slow build-up. The climax has an evil doppelganger that reminded me of the alien in PREY. Other parts are just unnecessary – the subway miscarriage is way overdone and completely icky. No wonder this film became a 'video nasty' in Britain for a little while. The film has lots of odd undercurrents and there are even some comic bits. Homosexuality is a running theme, as is parenthood. The ending, with its sounds of bombs dropping, leaves the reader to make their own mind up about just what on earth is going on. I can't define POSSESSION, and I can't begin to describe it, but it scared and disturbed me which meant it worked as a horror flick.",Possession
1,SnoopyStyle,great surrealistic horror,8,20 December 2015,"Mark (Sam Neill) returns home in Berlin from a business trip and his wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani) is falling apart. She leaves taking their son Bob. He finds a postcard from Heinrich to Anna. He refuses to see Bob and goes nuts when meeting Anna. After three weeks of isolation, he returns home to find a dirty and bruised Bob home alone. He meets Bob's teacher Helen (Isabelle Adjani) who looks exactly like Anna with blond hair.I really love the surreal minimalism. It's creepy and fits a horror quite well. The over-the-top acting takes a little time to get used to but that also fits this alternate universe. Heinrich is insane acting but he highlights the outlandish nature of these character. Every scene seems to be trying incite a response from the audience. As the movie progress, it becomes weirder and crazier. It's a descend into madness. It has a bit of Cronenberg, a lot of experimental, Adjani's sexual wildness and some of the craziest scenes including one in a girls' ballet class. There are some unforgettable images in this movie.",Possession
2,claudio_carvalho,A Huge Deception,4,19 April 2004,"Anna (Isabelle Adjani) leaves her house, her husband Mark (Sam Neil), her son and her lover, to live with a strange creature in an old building. What a huge deception this movie was for me! I have been trying to achieve it for many years and finally it was released on DVD in Brazil. However, the story is so weird, non-sense, confused, disgusting and bizarre, that I cannot understand how it can be a cult movie. The impressive performance of Isabelle Adjani is something spectacular, stunning, and outstanding. It is rare to see a beautiful actress like her in such a role. Sam Neil also has a great performance, in the very beginning of his career. Honestly, the film has a great direction, photography, actors and actresses. Technically it is wonderful. It recalls David Cronenberg and Peter Greenaway styles, and even David Lynch. But the problem is the confused plot about obsession, looking like a nightmare and not making much sense along 123 minutes. In the end, I was very bored and disappointed. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): `Possessão' (`Possession')",Possession
3,gavin6942,Kafka Horror? Or What?,8,9 November 2015,"A woman starts exhibiting increasingly disturbing behavior after asking her husband (Sam Neill) for a divorce. Suspicions of infidelity soon give way to something much more sinister.This is a very absurd film. It starts off normal, making you think it is a drama or romance gone wrong. But even early on we get something telling us there is something off. Maybe a little David Lynch, maybe a little Franz Kafka. But something not quite right. And then it starts to build. There are moments that almost seem right out of Lovecraft.This seems to be a horror film that needs to be seen, but may not be very well known in the mainstream. Based on how many people rated it on IMDb, it can't be extremely obscure, but still enough that it has to be overlooked. And it shouldn't be.",Possession
4,rmax304823,Rx: Aromatherapy.,6,24 April 2016,"I won't spoil the end because I couldn't make it all the way through. I can't even guess at what the end was like. Three-quarters into the story I was exhausted and felt like committing suicide by swallowing a string of lighted firecrackers. Somebody actually tried that once, according to Dr. Carl Menninger.So far as I can make out, the fundamentals of the story are pretty banal. Sam Neill's wife, Isabelle Adjani, has had an affair with another man, and she may be having an affair with still another at the moment. Why? The new guy is a better lover than Neill.Neill is supposed to be distraught because he loves her deeply and desperately needs her to come home and reestablish her place in her family, including not just Neill but their young boy.That's about it for the fundamentals. The way it's written, acted, and directed can only be described as freakish. Sam Neill, for instance, is usually a reasonable kind of guy, a bit of a wimp. But make up has darkened his hair and eyebrows and he looks far more threatening than the pastor who scratched his head until it bled in ""Cry In The Dark."" Anxiety is his strong point as an actor but here he delivers outrage. His voice is a sneer. He smashes furniture. He beats his wife until bright crimson blood drips in festoons from her battered mouth. When she leaves him, he rents a hotel room and goes on a three-day drunk, after which you can almost smell him.In fact there's blood all over the place. Neill confronts the other man and takes a swing at him, only to get decked himself. But if Neill is bizarre, Isabel Adjani is plain nuts. She chatters to herself, shrieks constantly, tries to cut off her head with an electric carving knife, beats a detective with a broken bottle until he bleeds to death. What must her thoughts be? She gives us a token. ""Fate can control chance, but chance can influence fate, so it it fate? Is it chance?"" There's a lot of metaphysical flotsam in the script if you can hear it through the screams.The director seems to think all this is a superlative idea, shouting, bashing, murdering, glowering. I didn't. I kept thinking that it made the end of MY marriage look, well, what they call ""amicable,"" despite the gymnastics and the silly reports in the newspapers at the time. It seemed to me that if Neill loved her so much, he wouldn't always be batting her around and throwing chairs at her. The only ""love"" on display was between Neill and his son, and that would better be called affection. The director also has people standing much too close to each other when they speak, as if they were Arabs. If one speakers moves away, the other follows, continually violating his personal space. Sometimes, for no reason, a speaker will slowly whirl around and carome off the walls. The developments towards the end, about when I tuned out, are impossible to fit into the rest of the story. There is some kind of slimy, blood-covered organism that looks like a squid. It writhes in a bath of gore on a bed. ""He's exhausted,"" explains Adjani. ""He spent the whole night making love to me."" It's difficult to accept this chimera as Adjani's hallucination because a detective sees it too.Well. Make of it what you will. It's like Roman Polanksi's ""Repulsion,"" a little, only on methamphetamines.",Possession
5,BA_Harrison,"Quite possibly the least enjoyable of all the 'nasties' (and boy, there are some bad films on that list).",1,5 August 2012,"The inclusion of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession on the official video nasties list during the 80s (thanks to a couple of scenes involving goop, blood, mucous, and Isabelle Adjani) has forever guaranteed that it will be of interest to avid horror fans; a shame, because if any of the 72 titles deemed unsuitable for public viewing by the BBFC actually deserved to be wiped from our collective memory, its this piece of highly pretentious, extremely irritating, and very tiresome art-house dreck.Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani play a married couple whose relationship is in tatters, Adjani having found herself a new lover or two, one of which is a slimy, many tentacled monster born of her id (or some such existential claptrap). Two hours of almost unbearable histrionics from the stars, interspersed by the occasional FX scene courtesy of Carlo 'ET' Rambaldi, this garbage is supposedly symbolic of the director's troubled state of mind as he struggled to work in the repressive environment of the Eastern Block while his own marriage fell apart. But while Possession may be a very personal piece for Zulawski, a cathartic movie that helped him to come to terms with his political and marital issues, I found it nothing but an utter bore from start to finish.",Possession
6,Quinoa1984,"""God is in me""",8,8 December 2011,"It's staggering to come up against a filmmaker who has a truly mad vision to put onto celluloid. If it's really believable and the maker isn't just putting on the audience it can take us into that madness. Possession is a film that is like it's title, taken with it's own sense of grandeur, starting off as a Scenes-from-a-Marriage-esque tale of downfall - with more ZAP and wildness in the fights the married couple have - but with something just not quite right. These scenes feel raw and uninhibited, by the actors and by the material, which goes to such extremes of how much they hurt one another that it becomes perversely funny.Why all the camera movement in this film, especially early on, where it turns into Vittorio Storaro Time with a Red Bull chaser? From the sensibility of the high emotions and hysteria on display, why not? If your material is going all out, then you might as well go all out with it. Isabelle Adjani really, REALLY goes to town here, forgetting that there's such a thing as 'chewing scenery' and just stampeding through it at times, with Sam Neill and the camera operator being breathless to keep up. It's a film that moves with real force and energy... sometimes maybe TOO much force and energy.For a film like possession, excess is not something that can be kept back, but what is so fascinating is that it's so intense at times, in the husband/wife interactions, the emotional violence springing out into physical abuse (at one point a slap is then encouraged into more, an uncomfortable scene done just right), that it's fascinating because it's going into such high volume. And as a horror film, a true horror film of the soul where it's laid bare and stripped out by a demon and f***ed with a spiky tail or something, it's bewildering, mind-boggling, and a dark pile of fun.A lot of it is the performances - Adjani worked her ass off to get that Cannes best actress win, and though there are times I can't understand her (not sure if it's the accent or the lines, like her 'fate and chance' monologue) and runs the gamut as a character who starts out flawed and damaged and gets so turned-inside-out she makes Linda Blair in the Exorcist look like a... girl. And Sam Neill has a kind of strange appeal here - at times he talks like he doesn't take these lines seriously, or is doing so SO much that it just becomes funny, and other times he is genuinely power-punching with his dramatic touch. In a scene like the restaurant fight he goes between both levels.But why I may, someday, after I can get over the experience, would return to Possession is that among the f***ing-insane style of films out there, there's nothing else quite like it. It revels in bringing the audience into its horror set-pieces, especially with that creature in the apartment as ambiguous a demon as the baby in Eraserhead, and the dread in every man going into that apartment harder to bear than the one before. And there is genuine pain, I think, in the filmmaking. I don't know the history behind the film's gestation but I'd wager the director had a bad marriage and expressed it, literally and metaphorically, with a tale of an unfaithful woman brought to madness by a demon... or maybe that's it.Possession doesn't spoon-feed at any point in time. On the contrary, and maybe this is a flaw I think, there's so little explanation of anything in the film that by the last fifteen minutes as Sam Neill's character goes ape-s**t and the husband/wife's child just gives up. It got to the point where I had my hands up in a 'what the hell!?' position sitting in my seat in the theater. Perhaps another viewing would solve some of my quandaries, or just make new ones. Whatever the case, the mood of this film is chilling and harrowing, and for those who like their dolly shots, this is a must-must-MUST see. Oh, and by the way, the creature effects - by the guy that did E.T.(!)",Possession
7,BandSAboutMovies,Woah...,8,22 September 2021,"So what the hell is going on here? Is Anna going insane? Is Mark (Sam Neill) unable to escape their breakup? Are they both dealing with things their own way, and by that, I mean Mark replacing his wife with a subservient drone of a woman (also Adjani) while Anna grows her own Mark in a jar? Is this all happening in a dream? Or are all the dead bodies, grocery throwing freakouts and electric knife mutual self-mutilation sessions really happening? Is it really about Zulawski divorcing himself from Poland? Or maybe as it was made in a still-divided Berlin, is it hopeful about the destruction and rebirth that will come from the tearing down of the Wall?Zulawski went into this movie wanting to kill himself, as his wife had left him (the scene where the child is left alone for hours and the husband comes home to discover his son naked and covered in jelly is autobiographical) while the strains that Adjani put herself through left her in the throes of massive depression and suicidal thoughts, which the director confirms that she acted upon but survived.Neill would later say, ""I call it the most extreme film I've ever made, in every possible respect, and he asked of us things I wouldn't and couldn't go to now. And I think I only just escaped that film with my sanity barely intact.""Mark is a spy home from the cold, yet he returns to a wife who no longer wants to be part of this relationship. She can't tell him why - it's not a new lover - but she doesn't want him any longer. He wants out of the espionage life, even if his handlers seemingly refuse to allow him that choice. Yet she does have a lover - Heinrich - who is not only cucking Mark but easily bests him in a punchup. He in turn attacks his soon-to-be ex-wife and then they take turns attacking one another and themselves with the aforementioned carving knife.Anna also has a second apartment and another life, a tentacled creature that lives with her, and a room full of destroyed body parts, which soon include the detective that Mark has hired to follow her and that detective's lover.Before long, the love that exists - or doesn't - between the married couple consumes everyone, sometimes in fire, sometimes in bullets, sometimes in knife wounds, sometimes just one another on the kitchen floor.That tentacle thing - credit goes to Carlo Rambaldi. You know, I just saw A Lizard In a Woman's Skin at a crowded drive-in and even horror-hardened viewers audibly gasped when his creation of still alive dogs torn apart flashed across the screen. Between that, Alien, Deep Red, A Bay of Blood and so many more, I find it rather life-affirming that the same man who created so many nightmarish visions also had a hand in creating E. T.At one point, Mark says, ""You know, when I'm away from you, I think of you as a monster or a woman possessed, and then I see you again and all this disappears."" This is the most real moment inside a film filled with a cavalcade of fantastic imagery. Tearing apart the life you once had for the promise of something new that may not be as good or may take a tremendous amount of emotional work is the most frightening thing I've ever done in my life. Possession gave me flashbacks to those moments where the world felt like it was ending every day, where I felt like a monster and when the only person you could confide in became the person you could never speak to again.Man, Possession is not an easy watch. Just warning anyone of that going in. But hey - movies should not be just wallpaper. They should attack you. They should change your consciousness. They should take your psyche like a rock tumbler and slam you against the walls over and over until you emerge better.",Possession
8,Coventry,Marriedwith Monstrosities!,3,24 August 2006,"This movie isahem a bit weird, maybe, and it's plain easy to see right away why it divides audiences into two extreme categories. ""Possession"" is a textbook example of the so-called ""love-it-or-hate-it film"" and there's really nothing in between! On the 1-10 weirdness scale, this movie easily gets a rating 20, as it is a non-stop series of bizarre events, demented characters and incomprehensible plot twists. If you add to that a whole lot of gore AND an attempt to stuff the film with symbolism, you get something that becomes incredibly hard to rate and ""masterpiece"" or ""turkey-trash"" purely lies in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I'm a big supporter of strange cinema (films like ""Sweet Movie"" or ""Santa Sangre"" are highly listed among my favorites), but even I thought that writer/director Adrzej Zulawski exaggerated with the constant adding of new and always odder elements. There's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and, eventually, the story lines and sub plots begin to contradict each other and the ambitious screenplay simply becomes one giant pseudo-artistic MESS! The entire story revolves on the troubled housewife Anna who abandons her husband Mark  upon his return from a very long business trip  as well as her eccentric lover Heinrich with no apparent motive. Both gentlemen don't handle this rejection very well, but they eventually discover that Anna left them for a piece of homemade fungus that has its own apartment in the center of the city! Yes, fungus! Not just any type of fungus, but fungus that feeds on private detectives and their gay lovers. Mark replaces his lost wife with her own doppelganger while Anna has a miscarriage in the subway and floods half of Berlin with blood and pus. Are we confused yet?? Well, in case you're not, there's a lot more weirdness where this came from, but I can't possibly bring myself to list it all. If you expect at least a minimum of logic when watching films, I strongly suggest you skip ""Possession"". It's either that or continuously asking yourself the question: ""Why is this happening""? Like Why are people cutting their own necks with an electric knife? Why does the self-acclaimed world sex-champion still live with his mother? What's up with the guy in pink socks? Why does it look like there are only 5 people living in the whole of Berlin? And about 10.000 other why-this & why-that situations, but you get the idea ""Possession"" often succeeds in being confusing and tedious at the same time (which really isn't a good combination) and the whole thing is very ugly to look at. It got labeled as a ""Video Nasty"" shortly after its release in Britain, due to some very explicit and sick gore (notably the aforementioned miscarriage sequence), but don't expect another ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Maniac"", as this is pretentious gore. Pfff Isabelle Adjani's monologues seem to go on forever and I'm not quite sure whether Sam Neill knew what he was doing half of the time. Don't worry, Sam It's not your fault.",Possession
9,Hey_Sweden,Probably better seen than described.,6,18 February 2016,"""Possession"" is a remarkably intense, offbeat, and surreal drama, a truly personal project for Polish writer / director Andrzej Zulawski. He used his divorce and treatment by the Polish government as the genesis for his vision. That vision is of the mind boggling deterioration of a marital relationship, with themes of obsession and psycho sexual problems. Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill play Anna and Mark, the couple in question. She now wants a divorce, and he's determined to find out WHY. It turns out, she does have a lover (Heinz Bennent), but that's not the only issue in her life. She becomes more unhinged, and Mark eventually discovers that she's got a pretty creepy secret that's come to murderous life.There's no question that this will be a hard slog for some viewers. Although trimmed of over 40 minutes for its American release, it runs over two hours in its uncut form, and it's NOT the horror film - at least, it's not JUST a horror film - that people might be led to believe it is. (Although it's gory and slimy enough to suit some tastes; Carlo Rambaldi did the creature effects.) It does take a dark and macabre turn in its second half, but it promises to be weird for the duration, early on.Zulawski obviously encouraged his actors to truly go for broke in their performances. Neill and especially Adjani tear into the scenery like they haven't done before or since, and again, the acting might prove to be a turn off for some in the audience. Bennent is good, and amusingly off kilter, in his supporting role, and Michael Hogben is an appealing child actor as Mark and Annas' boy Bob.There are interesting moments and conversations throughout, to be sure. The filmmaking is certainly slick. Zulawski managed to create here a unique, memorable entertainment that dips its toes into the waters of both art-house films and genre cinema, and does so with some style.Six out of 10.",Possession

11,FlashCallahan,You know what this is for........the lies......,8,22 May 2016,"To call the film an ordeal sounds like one of the most hackneyed criticisms you could give to a bad film, but in some instances, you could have a beautifully sinister film, which is an important piece of cinema unmissable, and much like Irreversible, a film which is heavily influenced by one particular scene in this, ordeal is just the right word to summarise how I felt after seeing this.Mark and Anna are already on the brink of divorce. Mark returns home after a mysterious trip, only to discover that in his absence Anna has been conducting an affair. Anna's friend Margie has been taking care of their son, Bob, but refuses to tell Mark the name or address of the other man. After several fights Mark eventually discovers that an obnoxious 'guru' named Heinrich is Anna's secret lover and the two have a confrontation. Mark is also astonished to discover that Bob's teacher, Helen, looks identical to his wife. Soon Anna disappears again and this time even Heinrich doesn't know where she's gone. Mark hires a detective to find her and the terrible truth is gradually revealed........It's understandable that the director was going through a personal crisis whilst he wrote the film, every last drop of resentment, anger, distress, pain, and denial is here on screen, and in some way, he could probably emulate himself in each character that is portrayed on screen.Divorce is the main context of the films narrative here, and divorce from the point of view of someone who has had the worst act a married person could commit to their spouse, adultery. Adultery here could be portrayed as the monster that Anna is hiding for the majority of the film, after all anybody who has committed adultery would know that it is a burden to carry around with them for the length of the time they keep it a secret.Helen, on the other hand could be how Mark remembers Anna from all the good time, and when he reverts back to Anna, it's just a case of where did it all go wrong.The film becomes more frustrating for Anna and Mark, and the audience, as we get to the bottom of Anna's secrets, and the scene in the subway station is one of the most haunting and disturbing scenes you could endure, and Noé owes a lot to this film for his scene in Irreversible.The final scene is both heartbreaking and mind boggling. Parents, after divorce, sometimes change for the better, and for the worse, hence the exclusion of old Mark and Anna, and we have a doppelgänger Mark, and Helen, who both in turn appear to be the perfect people, but with sinister undertones.The light in Helens eyes and the noises she hears at the end of the film could indicate the birth of the new Nuclear family, and Bob 'drowning' himself could indicate the prison like feel of coming to terms with parents not being together.It's not for all tastes, that's for sure, and it left me feeling pretty low about the world after, but if you can stomach the tone of the film, it's really worth while.",Possession

13,The_Void,"Sexy, bizarre and twisted - a compelling film experience!",10,5 June 2006,"Andrzej Zulawski's film is relentlessly confusing and I bet that even the man himself doesn't always know exactly what's going on; but it's such a beautiful and unique film experience that it's difficult not to go along with it; and while I understand how this movie has become a 'love it or hate it' film, I am firmly on the former side of the equation! Almost everything about Possession is twisted and/or bizarre; so I suppose it is fitting that the film was included on the British censors' 'Video Nasty' list back in the eighties. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair amount of gore on display; but the inclusion of this film on the list is yet another sad example of censorship depriving the general public of a movie that really deserves to be seen. Possession starts off like any drama following the break-up of a relationship. Mark has just returned from a business trip to find that his wife wants to leave him. Naturally, he deduces that the ending of their relationship is down to another man; and he's not wrong - but things take a turn for the sinister when she leaves her lover for...something else.The style of the movie is superb throughout, as director Andrzej Zulawski manages to create an atmosphere that is sexy, surreal and bubbling with mystery. Zulawski's use of the camera is fascinating, as by keeping everything mobile he manages to aptly convey the characters' fractured mentality, and continue to build the mystery surrounding the central plot. Indeed, the film is a labyrinth of sub-plots, and many of them don't really go anywhere - but everything in the film serves a purpose; even if that purpose often is simply making the film even more bizarre. A trio of great performances make up the movie. Sam Neill is superb in the lead role and, unlike in his more popular films, he actually gets to act here. Isabelle Adjani is scintillating in her role, and while it appears that she doesn't have much to do; she actually carries the film's biggest burden as it must be difficult to convince an audience that you're in love with something that isn't human. Heinz Bennent's role is the least weighty, but he rounds off the film nicely with a good performance. The special effects are brilliant and never go over the top; the director's use of what can only be described as a 'monster' being especially well done, and on the whole; Possession is a movie that everyone should give the time of day to. HIGHLY recommended!",Possession
14,deloudelouvain,"Weird doesn't mean good, in this case weird means Garbage with a capital G.",2,23 May 2018,"When I think about the trouble I had to get this movie. What a waste of my time. Before watching it I read it was one of the most disturbing movies I was going to see. And I had my share of disturbing movies, like A Serbian Movie, The Human Centipede and so on... Maybe for 1981 it was disturbing but to me it was just a piece of crap. I don't know why Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill agreed to act in this movie, it must have been because they were young and didn't know any better, or because at their debut they didn't have much choice and couldn't refuse a role in a big picture. But I'm pretty sure if you would ask them again now they would refuse. I read it was a movie for cinephiles, and that only those people could get the movie. Well I must have seen at least 20000 movies or more, and I still don't consider myself as a cinephile, but this movie doesn't make me thrill at all. That people love this movie is a mystery to me, that it got awards is an even bigger mystery to me. Not that Isabelle Adjani isn't a good actress but she had way better movies where she could have won awards. The director must be one of those people that thinks if it's weird it must be good. Well, let me tell you something, it isn't. A weird movie isn't good, it's just weird. For example, and that's not even a spoiler, at one point Heinrich is bouncing wall to wall in a corridor trying to make a point. That's just overacting, making yourself completely ridiculous. I can't see that actor coming up with that idea himself. It must have been the director that demanded that from him. So for me it's very easy after this movie. This director goes on my list, for movies I never want to see, and it doesn't matter what he made or what ratings it gets on here. It's been a long time that I don't pay attention anymore to the ratings on here. Weird movies from Lars Von Trier, David Lynch and now this weirdo are just not for me.

16,siderite,"Weird, wild ride with the personal demons of the writer/director",6,1 July 2017,"I can't begin to pretend I understood the film, but that means that, at least for me, the movie failed. It was a roller-coaster of great and stupid scenes, of hysterical acting and amazing acting and a script that mingled together divorce drama and Lovecraftian body horror and zen thinking and symbolism so heavy that I couldn't possibly enjoy it.Keep in mind that this is a performance that brought Adjani a Cannes best actress award, which is totally deserved. Sam Neill isn't far behind with an intensity of expression that makes the viewer feel things. However, what I felt was obnoxious was the heavy symbolism, the ""you're not smart enough if you don't get it"" type of art that always irritated me. If you are a great artist, express yourself so that people can understand.Bottom line: a weird melange of genres that ultimately felt like a masturbatory work for the writer and director of the film. The acting of the main character and the creature effects, as few as they were, were great. Others, like the gay detectives and the ""best friend"" where not only bad acting, but poorly made characters. The story was a mess. And it was a two hour long film that felt like a three hour one.",Possession
17,lasttimeisaw,"two protagonists' extraordinary submergence into a rarefied sphere of total delusion, submission and possession, and that is the hallmark of Zulawski",8,21 September 2018,"For all its over-brimming madness and mind-bending delirium, Zulawski's POSSESSION, more than anything, brings out a corybantic Adjani as its unrivaled center piece, a performance that blows right in front of a viewer's face with excessive intensity, peculiarity and potency, topped off by her subway tunnel solo-dancing as the possession reaches its apex with a gloppy miscarriage, heralding the conflicting dyad of Faith and Chance finally crumbles, she loses Faith, so only Chance remains inside her body. That might sound inexplicable, but POSSESSION is Zulawski's gonzo imagination of the inexplicability that torpedos marital unions (extracting from his real life experiences), Adjani's Anna, makes a deal with a demon to exchange for the eternal affection from her husband Mark (Neill), why? Because she senses that Mark's love is dwindling, yet, the contradiction is that Mark, blindsided by Anna's divorce plea, is still besotted with her, clear as day, so where does she get that impression? In the bedroom one might posit, in her mind, Mark's sexual potency is directly indexed to his interest in her physical body, when that interest appears diminishing, seeking corporeal pleasure from a virile lover Heinrich (Bennett, uncannily exuding some homoerotic heat as the ne plus ultra of an alpha male) cannot disabuse the idea that Mark has fallen out of love with her, so when Faith is ritualistically purged out of her system, she plays fire with Chance, instigates her possession of molding a carbon copy of Mark out of a gooey, amorphous entity (courtesy of Italian special effects maestro Carlo Rambaldi's staggering craftsmanship), so she can have him for keeps. But of course, Mark loves her, more precisely, he is mad about her, Zulawski's straight headspace even offers Mark a carbon copy of Anna, Helen (also played by Adjani, with a more pleasurable comportment), the convivial kindergarten teacher of their son Bob (Hogben), to distract him, but he remains being possessed by Anna, even her increasingly erratic behavior driving both to the precipice of hysteria, physical violence and nervous breakdown, not to mention her murderous spree, he is going to the stake for her, to appease the profound guilt that he cannot satisfy her. Sam Neill's unsung embodiment of a man losing his grip and inwardly humiliated by his unsatisfactory sexual prowess can be attributed to one of his finest screen bravura, and he is equally chilling in the form of Mark's doppelgänger in the end, as if being directly teleported from Graham Baker's THE FINAL CONFLICT (1981), as the Antichrist, a movie he starred in the same year. As this reviewer sees it, the entire horror is stemmed from a woman's instinctive misapprehension of her husband's lessened libido, a message might appear misogynous to a certain degree, but that is just one school of thought, and there is some truth in it, which can be ascribed to the thin fine line between ""libido"" and ""jouissance"", a perceptive hindsight is that both genders should dial down on the phallocentric obsession. Trifling with the Berlin Wall background and espionage games (yes, the film is a French-West Germany co-production, set in Berlin and it appears Mark's vocation is a spy), POSSESSION is a manic jumble of a married couple's self-destruction reified by restlessly roving camera movement, grueling intimate confrontation, cacophonous sonic experiment and gory demonology, all circling around the two protagonists' extraordinary submergence into a rarefied sphere of total delusion, submission and possession, and that is the hallmark of Zulawski.",Possession
18,Red-Barracuda,Intense and unrelenting art-house/exploitation movie,6,19 July 2013,"Of all the films from the video nasty list – films banned by the authorities in the UK in the 80's – Possession is the one that comes from the art-house side of the spectrum. It's a very different proposition compared to the other films from this list which were in the main pulpy exploitative genre efforts. Possession, by contrast, is an experimental movie that has some genre elements. It's the most obtuse video nasty and will certainly be one of the most divisive. Whatever way you look at it one thing is certain and that is that it is one bizarre film. Set in cold war Berlin, it's about the disintegration of a marriage. The process leaves the couple suffering nervous breakdowns. The woman forsakes her husband and lover for a tentacled creature that lives in a run-down apartment. It seems as though the story is allegorical in some way but, if I am being honest, I don't really know. It was way too strange for me to make any claims at understanding it.What I can confirm for sure is that the acting from Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill was very impressive. These cannot have been easy parts to play by any means and they both give their all in full-on performances. They match the style of the movie, as this is an unremittingly intense film from start to finish. Even the constantly moving camera work is agitated. I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a film that could exactly be classified as entertainment though. It's so cold and tormenting that it's pretty far removed from the comforts of genre cinema. The film that it reminded me most of was Lars von Trier's Antichrist (2009) which was also about a married couple in turmoil. Both are esoteric films that make you feel somewhat uncomfortable. In Possession the geographic location is also used to create an oppressive feel, seeing as events happen in the shadow of the Berlin Wall. So there is no doubt a political subtext to this as well but, like I said before, your guess is as good as mine.My feelings on this one are a bit mixed. One the one hand, the sheer coldness of it is very difficult to get behind and there are no characters you can really relate to seeing as everyone consistently acts in an all-consuming, severe manner. On the other hand, there was certainly something there, of what I am not sure but I am convinced there is an overall purpose. The scenes with the weird monster in the apartment were always interesting and there were individual moments that were hard to forget such as the subway miscarriage sequence where Adjani goes absolutely ballistic. Everything ends up with both parents being replaced with clones, while it appears that World War III has begun. As I sayyour guess is as good as mine.",Possession
19,dromasca,horror near the Wall,7,1 May 2020,"The beauty of the cinema universe is that it is big enough to allow exploration and even discoveries. I confess that I knew nothing about the Polish director Andrzej Zulawski. His 1981 film 'Possession' was waiting for me for a while to watch, and the surprise was huge. Here is a strong and original film-maker from the country of Wajda and Polanski, a little younger than them, whose work I completely ignored. 'Possession' is a daring, violent, challenging work, which shocked the audiences at its release. It was mis-categorized because it refuses standing in a defined shelve as Zulawski juggles with the genres. It anticipates trends that would be visible but not completed accepted even decades later. It includes many hidden corners and secret ciphers that can be decrypted only by references to the personal biography of the director. It is no easy watching, not only because of the large amount of shocking visuals but also because Zulawski does not like and does not care to explain everything that he shows on the screen. He relies on us, the viewers, to be smart enough and to fill in the missing with our own pieces of imagination. Or of horror.'Possession' begins as a film about a falling apart marriage. We are still less than a decade since 'Scenes from a Marriage' and 'Kramer vs. Kramer' were made. But we immediately realize that the separation between the businessman (or maybe the spy) Mark (Sam Neill) and his beautiful wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani) will not be an easy separation, that behind the seemingly trivial reasons (the suspicion of infidelity of the wife) there is something much more evil about Anna's personality and the forces that have taken over her. The story quickly slips into violence but especially into the supernatural, and I will say no more here than that Zulawski used in this film the services of Carlo Rambaldi, the creator of aliens and monsters who contributed to the 'look' of some movies like 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Alien', 'Dune' and 'King Kong Lives'. Isabelle Adjani creates one of the most intense roles of her career in this film. I hope that the information about her suicide attempt at the end of the filming was just a rumor, but I'm not surprised. I confess that Sam Neill was not on my list of favorites so far, but his creation in this film has greatly increased his rating. I need to mention also the German actor Heinz Bennent, who had already starred in films by Bergman and Truffaut, in an ambiguous and memorable role of the lover who completes the triangle.I think that 'Possession' is a film that cannot be fully understood without references to the personal biography of its director. Zulawski himself had gone through a traumatic divorce, and seems to be exorcising his feelings through shocking scenes and images belonging to the extremes of the horror film repertoire. However, the Devil is also present under another incarnation in the film. It took me a while to realize that the action was taking place in the divided Berlin during the Cold War. The presence of evil is explicit in the horror scenes and implicit in the location, the apartment where most of the horrors take place being placed right next to the Wall, overlooking the communist world that Zulawski had to leave to create in freedom. The production is international, the film takes place and is filmed in Berlin by a Polish director, the main heroes are actors from France and New Zealand, and the biggest admirer is the Italian Dario Argento, who I think would have signed the film without hesitation. 'Possession' is a film that gains in historical perspective. Today's viewer can see in it a forerunner (but not a much more delicate one) of extreme productions like Lars von Trier's 'Antichrist'. For those who are not afraid of violence on screen, it is also an original combination between art cinema and the horror genre.",Possession
20,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,21 July 2016,"The marriage between Mark (Sam Neill) and his French wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani) is crumbling. Anna is having an open affair with Heinrich (Heinz Bennent), blaming Mark's elongated time spent away for his work (an undisclosed spying mission he is trying to walk away from). Their unfortunate child, and the most stable character, is Bob (Michael Hogben), caught between the increasing madness and paranoia of his drifting parents. It's apparent that the child's presence keeps Mark and Anna more grounded than would otherwise be the case, for when he is out playing, or at school, increasingly violent hysteria ensues.Through a private investigator, Mark discovers his wife has a second apartment in the rundown side of town. When the investigator discovers a slimy, living organism in the apartment, Anna glasses him. Events spiral further into rich absurdity and madness and with that, 'Possession' lurches confidently into uncategorisable territory. It is also the most enjoyable and refreshing horror film I have seen in a long time.Conversations are replaced with intense dramatic exchanges involving characters forever at the end of their tether, frenzied even from the outset. The direction comprises of shots that give the actors space to do their thing, and what intense performances are unleashed! Often shot in cool blue colours, this was filmed entirely on location in cinematically drizzly Berlin.Director Andrzej Żuławski wrote this whilst going through a divorce, which might well have contributed to the fraught emotions exhibited by the characters.Each time we see the organism, it increasingly exhibits human shape until ultimately, it assumes Mark's appearance (as well as the sexual attentions of Anna). In a bid to outdo even its own outlandishness, I feel the ending is ultimately slightly disappointing – however it cannot be easy to bring a satisfying closure to such an outlandish and shocking series of events.Meeting with disappointing sales on its release, 'Possession' was banned by the usual feint UK hearts as a 'video nasty' yet has assumed cult status. It also won Isabelle Adjani multiple awards for best actress for her astonishing performance. As it is, every performance is astonishing, from Bennent's passionate portrayal of the flamboyant Heinrich, to juvenile's Hogben's commendable playing of Bob.",Possession

Neill is great but Adjani is out of this world, giving absolutely everything to her role. To reveal anymore about the film would spoil it.

22,drownnnsoda,Domestic drama? Horror film? I doubt even Zulawski knows,10,15 June 2014,"Andrzej Zulawski's infamous cult film has Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill as a troubled couple living in Berlin. After returning from a business trip, Mark (Neill) finds his wife, Anna (Adjani) wanting to divorce him for inexplicable reasons. The film chronicles the deterioration of their relationship as Anna exhibits increasingly psychotic behavior, going back and forth between the apartment they share with their son, and an abandoned flat where Mark believes her to be holding secret rendezvous with someone... or something.It's been said that Zulawski wrote this film during his divorce from his wife, which is pretty damned clear. It's difficult to explain the film in terms of plot beyond what I've already said, so I won't even bother, but I will say that it is magnificently crafted in just about every way possible. As a meditation on divorce and how people deal with remnants of what was once a relationship, the film is astounding. Beyond that, however, is the fact that it's operating on levels far different— it's also a horror film, a creature feature, and perhaps even a sci-fi thriller, all rolled under the blanket of a twisted domestic drama.Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill turn in jaw-dropping performances here. I've heard accusations of overacting in this film, and I simply don't see it. Adjani's wicked, otherworldly presence in the film is haunting; she turns from frustrated mother to murderess to madwoman writhing on the floor of a subway tunnel having a miscarriage, and you never once question her or her motives, no matter the level of madness her character reaches. She is both touching and horrifying, and the catalyst around which the entire film hinges. Neill plays her counterpart with extreme precision as well, communicating the emotions of a husband driven mad by his wife's infidelity, and an abusive control freak who will stop at nothing to possess her.Zulawski tells the story among the gloomy cityscapes of Cold War Berlin, and the photography in the film is stunning in all its greyness. It's a disturbing film in both content and imagery; the scenes of domestic violence are just as disturbing as the gruesome murder scenes and Adjani's infamous copulation sequence with the tentacled monster whom she's been nesting away. The last act is particularly compelling, mainly because of how out-there it really gets, and the ending follows in line. I still don't know what to make of it; what I do know, is that is was brilliant, and that it demands repeat viewings.Overall, ""Possession"" is a gobsmacker. Ajdani and Neill's performances are reason enough to check the film out, but there are some utterly bizarre plot twists and shocking special effects here that will satiate fans of thrillers and creature features alike. The film's duplicitous nature makes it a difficult one to really pin down, but conversely is also one of the most fascinating things about it; it's a domestic drama, and a horror film, and a creature feature, and perhaps even a love story. Regardless, the end effect is that we are ultimately as uncertain of what the film is as we are of Anna's schoolteacher doppelgänger, or her grotesque paramour locked away in the abandoned flat. In any measure, ""Possession"" is a ruthless tale of betrayal and desperation, and I think that's one of the few things Zulawski and his audience would agree upon. 10/10.",Possession

24,EVOL666,Not Exactly Sure What To Make Of This One - But I'm Pretty Sure I Liked It...,8,28 August 2006,"POSSESSION (like several other reviewers of the film have rightly noted...) is a VERY strange film that seekers of ""straight-forward narrative"" will probably either be confused or down-right frustrated by. There are no solid answers to be had at the end of this one, nothing will be magically made astonishingly clear. Instead - it's more a strange, grotesque, bizarre journey through two individual's failed relationship, and the resulting madness that it creates. From the bit of special-features that I went through, I understand that the director wrote this film after experiencing his own divorce from his wife...all I can assume is that based on how POSSESSION is filmed, the break-up didn't go so well...Mark (Sam Neill) comes back to his wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani) after conducting some secret government assignment - and it's apparent that their relationship is ""strained"". It comes out that Anna has been cheating on Mark for a year with an eccentric guy named Heinrich - and Anna no longer wants to continue her relationship with Mark. He doesn't take the news too well and spirals into a sort of controlled madness, while Anna runs around like a crazy person also. We find later that not only does Anna have Heinrich as a lover, but also some strange, slimy, humanoid thing that is never quite explained as to what exactly it is. Yeah - you read that right. At this point, everything goes completely haywire as both Mark and Heinrich vie for Anna's attentions - but her main focus is on her slime-buddy, who seems to have some strange psychic hold over her...I can't begin to tell you what any of the scenes in POSSESSION really amount to story-wise - but it is obvious that it's some sort of metaphor for the confusion, hurt, anger, feelings of betrayal etc...that accompany a relationship that experiences infidelity. The completely insane performances by both Neil, and especially Adjani, punctuate the nightmarishness of the bizarre experiences, and the film as a whole has a sort of Cronenberg-esq controlled grotesquerie that is both compelling and confusing. There are also some scenes of pretty explosive and relatively graphic violence that come just at the right times as well. I can honestly say I enjoyed and was engrossed with POSSESSION, though I can't hope to truly make heads-or-tails of it.

Director Zulawski is all symbols and metaphor, and his narrative does become fractured and confused, but the central idea is fascinating and the execution is adroit. Sam Neil plays a man whose wife, the stunning Isabella Adjani, becomes estranged from him and his son. He hires a detective to monitor the woman's movements, and the man's discoveries open a Pandora's box of worms and assorted beasties. It is difficult to describe the plot of this film because the many revelations contribute considerably to the impact of its gruesome and surreal horrors. The scenes of Neil and Adjani's marital disintegration possess a raw, hellish intensity, with the angry incriminations reaching a peak not seen in cinema since Roger Donaldson's ""Smash Palace"". This is a portrayal of madness -- the madness of a society at odds with its true nature. The violence is nasty and wet, bloody and beautiful.

27,Witchfinder-General-666,"Extremely Bizarre, and Doubtlessly a One-of-a-kind Experience",7,9 March 2010,"Being a huge fan of bizarre and surreal cinema, I wonder why I waited until a few weeks ago to finally see Andrzej Zulawski's ""Possession"" (1981), which had , on multiple occasions, been recommended to me by fellow cult-cinema fans as brilliant and absolutely essential. Having finally seen it, I must say that, while the film is definitely worthwhile, I do not quite get the hype it receives from most of my fellow admirers of European cult-cinema. ""Possession"" is often called a 'love it or hate it' film, but, personally I must say that neither is the case with me. On the one hand, ""Possession"" is a wonderfully bizarre film which really isn't like anything else, and furthermore an exceptionally shot exercise in fascinating cinematic style. On the other hand, it is - plain and simple - a mess.Terriffically set in Berlin (divided by the Berlin Wall), the film is about an... eer... slightly troubled married couple - Mark (Sam Neill) is slowly going out of his mind over his wife Anna (the stunning Isabelle Adjani), who does not merely betray him with a quite sinister lover, but also with someone (or something) else... This is only a very vague description of the first part of ""Possession"", but, in this case, giving a proper description would mean describing every scene from start to finish (and what would be the point of that?). While I usually LOVE cinematic weirdness (one of my all-time favorite filmmakers being the Chilean/French/Mexican genius Alejandro Jodorowsky), and this one is full of it, the weirdness of ""Possession"" is too messy at times. Too often does it seem as if director Zulawski simply put together unrelated scenes, just to make the film more bizarre. The cast is great, and the over-acting (from everybody, which was obviously requested by the director) fits the film in this case. However, there are many scenes in which the characters simply grimace and do things like cutting themselves with electric knives for no reason whatsoever. Scenes like these may be shocking or fascinating in a film every now and then, but when large parts of a movie do only consist of barely related weird sequences attached to one another, the weirdness can loose its impact. Still, the film never gets monotonous.Technically, ""Possession"" is a masterwork. Both the settings in Berlin and the cinematography are fascinating. The film is set in West Berlin, and, in many parts, one can actually see the Eastern part over the wall, through windows on one the Western side. This aspect alone makes the film fascinating. Besides its stylistic and cinematographic greatness, ""Possession"" has many other fascinating aspects. The characters are entirely sinister. As mentioned above, all cast members are extremely over-acting, but, in this case this isn't a bad thing. Especially Sam Neill and Isabella Adjani are great. Neill is a terrific actor and he greatly portrays the maddening despair of a left husband obsessed with his crazed wife. Adjani (who actually plays two roles in this film) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful actresses ever, and she is an equally fantastic actress. Her performance as the ravishing but 'possessed' Anna is magnificent. Heinz Bennert is also very remarkable as her sinister, creepy and somewhat nuts lover, who claims to be a sex-master and still lives with his mother. ""Possession"" has the reputation of being very gory and perverted, which even landed it on the UK's infamous Video Nasty List (another proof that Film censors are a bunch of fascist morons). Except for one very gross scene, however, the film isn't really exceptionally gory, and the perversity is mostly suggested rather than show.Overall, ""Possession"" certainly is an unforgettable film experience, maybe even a must-see for every true cineaste. Still, I cannot quite see it as the masterpiece that some of my fellow cult-cinema fans seem to regard it. For true masterpieces of bizarre cinema see any film by Alejandro Jodorowsky (especially ""El Topo"", ""The Holy Mountain"" or ""Santa Sangre""); in case you dig surreal Art-Horror films in which beautiful women have sex with strange monstrosities, I recommend Walerian Borowczyk's ""La Bête"" (1975) over this one.

It definitely lived up to its reputation. The first hour or so is a truly painful examination of the breakdown of a marriage (the director stated he was going through a divorce at the time) and the second hour is a totally surreal metaphor for the reasons people leave each other. Basically it is the perfect date movie for David Cronenberg. Neill is very good in his role as the husband who goes a little bit nuts, but the real standout is Adjani as the wife who goes a lot nuts. She is really impressive with her crazy, vacant stare that quickly morphs into bouts of rage (the bit where she got psycho in the U-bahn station is flat out amazing). On a side note, I was shocked at how much Clive Barker seems to have ripped this one off for his story ""The Hellbound Heart"" and the subsequent film HELLRAISER.

Unfortunately today it no longer holds it's power. It just seems to be strange, awkward, annoying, and presumptuous.Both of the main actors are strong in their characters and roles. Sam Neill is Mark, who comes back to his wife after being away for months on work. He returns to find things have changed. His wife has been having an affair and now wants a divorce while seeming to be in the grip of a mental breakdown. This sets Mark on his own course of mental illness and Neill does a good job of portraying anxiety and depression.Isabelle Adjani as Marks wife Anna is, for the most part, brilliant at portraying her character's breakdown. She rushes about agitated, unable to complete even one simple task.Though the actors do exemplary jobs it's Zulawski that makes their illnesses a weakness to the film by overplaying them. There is just too much of them ""spazzing"" (Sorry for not being PC but when you watch the film you may forgive me) out to create a relatable atmosphere.Then with the unveiling of Anna's lover, the truly unbelievable self- righteous and pompous Heinrich, superbly over-acted by Heinz Bennent, that the film falls further into implausibility. The only realistic anchors in the film are the secondary characters, such as Heinrich's mother played with feeling by Johanna Hofer and Anna's friend Margit Carstensen portrayed by Margit Gluckmeister.Having said that, Zulawski does an impressive job of creating an unease through all the insanity. You get the feeling that there's something more, something darker, which is bothering Anna and Mark. When this is finally revealed the revelation is startling and is the reason why this was originally banned. It also shows why Carlo Rambaldi was one of the great special FX artists.This is a long two hours and four minutes. There are sequences that didn't need to be so long, and others that didn't even need to be in at all.

I can't pretend to have actually UNDERSTOOD this intellectually rigorous horror film, but I do know that it is arguably the most beautiful film of the 1980s, that ugliest of cinematic decades. 
The chief source of this beauty is Zulawski's camerawork, unsettling, spacious, constantly mobile, it achieves the kind of elaborate shots you normally expect with cumbersome, expensive equipment with the nimbleness of a handheld camera.  Static scenes in repetitive milieux are subjected to awesomely complex movements, as the camera encircles, tracks, reveals, blocks, opens up space, creating a narrative that never stands still, offering us different, usually startling viewpoints within the one scene. 
What is most remarkable is its transformation of scale - the film is set in Cold-War Berlin, a famously constricted city; the plot takes place mostly in inhumanly modern apartments or on streets, and yet the sense of size, scale, space is as monumental as a Fordian Western.  This is apt for characters who are simultaneously confined and alienated by their environment.  Even scenes of flamboyant repulsiveness, the puling monster mounting Isabella Adjani, Mark's lavatorial dispatch of Heinrich, have a clarity of composition that is simply breathtaking.Unlike most horror films, which open with images of normality against which to measure the transgression of terror, 'Possession' hurls us into its relentless unpleasantness in medias res.  Zulawski opens at full speed and never lets up.  Mark in his car looks out at a city he hasn't seen for some time as if it is an alien land, full of troubling images, including an iron cross.  Anna rushes to meet him.  We assume they are husband and wife, reuniting, but their talk if full of exasperated dislocation.  Mark has apparently come home too early.  They have a son; after making love, their post-coital talk is full of Antonionian misunderstanding, uncertainty, alienation, cruelty.These scenes create the mood of the whole film.  'Possession' is shot in English with a French lead by a Polish director.  The dialogue has a stilted quality, like a translation from some lost original; this sense of not-quite-rightness extends to the acting, and the scenes themselves, which seem too mannered, too abrupt, too stylised to seem natural.  This sense of the drama being at one remove from some original 'reality' is perfect for a film about alienation - people alienated from themselves, each other, their marriage, their home, even their identity.  The horror that constitutes the film obviously has its roots in the female hysteria (one scene in a subway, remembered by Anna, has her miscarry, as she pours out blood and milk, the essence of her femaleness spilling from her; the toilet scene between Heinrich and Mark has a gynaecological terror similar to Argento's 'Suspiria') and male bestiality that cannot be hidden by affluent modernity, but this, on its most basic level, is a harrowing portrait of a failed marriage, horribly truthful to anyone who has even rejoiced in that institution.  All the while we are constantly reminded of the contemporary political reality - Mark's espionage (or is he an assassin?) activities; the wired Berlin wall with its faceless surveillance guards (a divided city, a divided marriage, literally divided people, the whore and the madonna).  The film has a lot of talk about faith, chance, God, good and evil, but its true power is recognisably more mundane, yet more unaccountably wrenching than that.  One should not overlook the comic sense that flickers through the film, the exaggeration of scenes by prolonging them (the restaurant scene), and the Franju-like waltz-of-death music.",Possession

35,garethcrook,Enter at your own risk.,9,29 April 2021,"Mark (Sam Neill, a very young Sam Neill) and Anna (Isabelle Adjani) are having marital problems. That's only one part of this crazy rollercoaster, but it's where we start and it's the catalyst for what's to come. Mark is something of an obsessive and when things get frosty with Anna, he starts searching the couples apartment near the wall in Berlin. So far, so standard domestic discomfort. To be honest this side of the story would be enough. Shot in the stark East Germany of the Cold War. The camera lingers and circles around it's subjects as they deliver overblown heavily scripted drama one minute, followed by acts of uncomfortable chaos. Chaos that Neill in particular does very well as he struggles to cope with the separation, but to be fair Adjani is every bit his equal as things quickly come apart at the seams. It's intense. Very very intense. Running much like a play on a sparse stage, it's all about the raw emotion of a family breaking up. Marks inability to accept it, to lose control of his world. But it's increasingly obvious that as Mark is having his issues, Anna's are all the more severe. It's aggressive and violent. Disturbing and confusing. With an excellent supporting cast. Most notable Heinrich (Heinz Bennent) Anna's new pretentious lover... who lives in an amazing apartment and is quite nifty with balletic martial arts. The focus though remains on the increasingly deranged couple at the core. If Possession isn't brilliant in its opening act (it is) whats to come is unexpected and spectacular. Take all the dramatic tension of the first half and dial it all the way up for the second. It's a wild ride with blooded otherworldly creatures writhing on squalid beds, theoretical riddles and Anna's video nasty manifestations. Which is captivating and terrifying to watch. You'd struggle to find more visceral cinema anywhere. The effects truly shocking until like many of the red paint horrors of the era. It's Lynch and Argento rolled into one and I suspect an inspiration to both. There's a lot going on. I know I've missed half of it on one viewing, this is most certainly one to revisit. It's not for everyone I fear with several scenes of pure nightmare fuel, but I'm enthralled and need to find out more about director Andrzej Zulawski and the making of this monster. I'm still a little too confused to declare it a masterpiece worthy of full marks, but even still it's clearly an amazing piece of cinema by any yardstick. Great, but enter at your own risk.",Possession
36,bregund,Exhausting to watch,7,7 July 2012,"If you like watching people scream at each other at the tops of their lungs, this film is for you. Though there is nothing subtle about their performances, both Sam Neill and Isabella Adjani are terrific actors, taking their characters just shy of what would be a cartoonishly over-the-top portrayal of a young couple's slow, destructive breakup. I could probably sympathize more with Sam Neill's Mark as he confronts the impending loss of his wife than I could with Anna's bizarre obsession with the worldly, smartass Heinrich and his metaphorical doppelganger in the decayed flat, obviously intended as a symbol of ugly, forbidden lust. Trapped in the middle of this noisy mess is the couple's gentle young son Bob, who is so horrified by the climactic confrontation among the characters that he does something drastic and painful to watch. Don't watch this film if you're depressed, it's not going to cheer you up. Watch it instead with a sense of detachment, and see the characters for what they are: human beings trapped by their own terrible life choices.",Possession
37,loganx-2,"Intelligent, Emotional, Grotesque, Horror",8,12 June 2008,"This was my first experience with Zulawski (and thank god because the next film I saw by him is the even more difficult, even more bizarre ""On The Silver Globe"" and ""Diabel""). This film however floored me instantly. People can and will mention the in...(read more)tensity of all the performances, the swirling cinematography which moves constantly even as the characters remain static, and the bizarre ridiculousness of the situations these characters find themselves in. Anyone watching this movie would be hard pressed not to laugh at quite a few scenes, some of which are intentionally funny, others merge grotesquery, absurdity, and intensity to such a degree that it's impossible not to laugh out of discomfort.The story also is not a kitchen sink affair, but a surreal examination of division and breakdown. The setting is west Berlin, a divided city, and we are introduced to our characters a divided couple whose marriage is in smolders, Sam Niels character has some shadowy job with the government and he's been ""away at the war"", while his wife has seemingly lost all control over her life due to an obsessive affair with...(SPOILERALERT) ...a slimy tentacled creator which resembles an scaly abortion with the head of a carrot, like the baby from ""Eraserhead"" had they let it grow up and reproduce with the sentient pile of zombie intestines from ""Dead Alive"". Meanwhile, Sam Niels character grows more and more suspicious and begins an affair with his sons school teacher who is also played by Issabell Adanji, and is essentially the opposite(or other) of Sam Niels wife's character, calm, sweet, dependable and loving, to manic, maddening, unstable and lustful. To prevent her other lovers, policemen, and curious parties from finding out about her relationship which she describes as beautiful for its ""otherness"", Adjani(as Niels wife) kills several people leaving their corpses spread about her flat. Sam Niel, after one knock-out emotional performance after another, discovers the horrible truth. His wife was pregnant and miscarried(in a disturbingly powerful scene where she menstruates milk in a dimly lit subway), and gave birth to a ""thing"", which she took back to an apartment and fed until it became the tentacle creature, who she then took up as her lover(shown in another disturbing erotic scene). Sam Niel's character is horrified, and flees, until the two catch up with him them and the creature is revealed in his fully grown form (which is played by Sam Niel, just as Adjani had dual roles), the creature smiles, and appears to be invulnerable as a hail of police bullets cut down Niel(human) and his wife, but don't seem to affect the creature. The creature then returns to the couples home, where their other young son repeats ""dont open the door"" and hides under his bed, as his teacher(also Adjani) screams in terror as the creature stands outside the door screaming and causing the house to shake and bright lights to appear which eventually overwhelm the camera and we have the end.So yeah, there's some intense performances, monster sex, and a story that feels more like Franz Kafka, bare desperate human emotions displayed through inhuman events and surreal happenings, more than Clive Barker(who was very influenced by this film). It's difficult to nail down precise meanings, and there are no polemical points or tragic flaws, it seems as if both characters have their angels and demons, and all that is assured in the end is destruction.""Possession: The Night The Screaming Stopped"" is a one of a kind horror film full of psychological bends and monstrous gore, it's a story of a relationship divided, a nation divided, and an eternal divide between the ""self"" and the ""other"", that gives us our God's and monsters, as well as our repulsions and attractions. It is absolutely not a demonetization of ""woman"" as destroyer, as the dual roles suggest that no one is A. whole in any sense of the word and B. free of guilt. There's few horror films which are really this good (too smart for their own good, because this will largely sail over your head if your not watching closely, a good deal hinges on a one off sentence roughly about God having pink socks, and a man with pink socks showing up later, albeit briefly in the film).Very hard to find, Netflix doesn't carry it, but those of you in the Los Angeles area, might try Eddie Brandts Saturday Matinée in North Hollywood(just off the Orange Line), that's where I found a copy as well as many other hard to find films.

38,sunznc,"Bizarre, disturbing, perplexing",7,27 December 2012,"There are other reviewers here that probably have a broader understanding of what is happening in the film and may articulate what they've seen much better than I. However, I think I can give a basic description of what this is about.A young couple's marriage is falling apart and they are both suffering, in vivid detail I might add, nervous breakdowns in their own way from the collapse. I assume the catharsis for her is the manifestation of what she perceives as the evil of her participation in the break-up of the marriage. A being very different from humans. In The Brood by David Cronenberg a wife's hatred for herself manifests itself in welts and a womb that forms on the outside of her body. The resultant births are extensions of her rage and the children that form from those births act on Nola's thoughts.Here the being seems to be undergoing a growth of it's own, a sophistication, becoming more human-like. But to what purpose? Is this the end of the world? Is it the end of all living things on the planet? Is the being God? I'd have to think about it for a while before I could make that decision.I will say this-there are many, many scenes of people screaming in agony, people suffering from mental anguish and physical pain. This is NOT a peaceful, feel-good film. This is a film of people in pain. If this isn't your thing I'd avoid it. But it isn't something you'll forget soon if you decide to sit through it.

39,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,4k restoration re-hash of my fave of all time,10,3 November 2021,"I recently caught a screening of the new 4k restoration of this movie so I am giving a quick re-hash of my thoughts.POSSESSION is my favorite film of all time.Isabelle Adjani puts on the most intense acting performance I have ever seen in my life. She had PTSD for several years after making this movie. If you feel no pain resonating through what she lays down in this movie, I feel you are either afraid of opening up to that level of raw darkness, so you reject it, or you have lived a privileged enough existence that you simply can't comprehend it.The film is fully singular in it's soul-crushing vision, which primarily functions as the most legit interpretation of the greatest pain a romantic person can feel: the polar end of being deeply in love. Yes, it's a psychological horror film ""about divorce"", but more so, the agonizing end of a spiritual convergence with a partner, portrayed in a fully surreal manner.The environments (Berlin around 1980) manage to be grimly terrifying on their own. The joined forces of director Andrez Zulawski (Poland), Sam Neil (Australia - yes, the guy from Jurassic Park), Isabelle Adjani (France), and the German environments add more to the other-worldly feeling of this celluloid nightmare. I've only witnessed such an international concoction create something nearly as alien in Sweet Movie (1973). Possession conjures a world entirely of its own - one which you will only experience by watching this movie, and likely never again anywhere else.About 8-9 years ago I brought my ex, her roommate, and her neighbor to a 35mm screening of this, and they were all upset that I brought them, but this is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I have never felt any other movie so deeply in my soul. It is a dark masterpiece from the heart, from the soul, and from the guts.",Possession
40,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,Disturbing beyond belief...,9,6 July 2009,"A young married couple, Anna(Isabelle Adjani) and Mark(Sam Neill) living in West Berlin split up at Anna's behest for unknown reasons. Mark is left to care for their young son, but becomes increasingly more paranoid that Anna is having an affair, so he hires a private detective to follow her. His fears are soon realized and Anna admits to being more satisfied by her new lover. However when Mark tracks this lover (Heinrich) down, he says their relationship has been over for some time, Mark soon realizes that there is another mysterious lover, but what he finds is more terrifying than he could have dreamed. My first Zulawski film i had been warned was just a little odd, while not the most linear of films to start with, i had no idea where or when the craziness would start or how it would present itself. It begins with a couple being destroyed by a lack of intimacy, paranoia, jealousy and ultimately separation. I must say that this aspect is brilliantly realized by Zulawski with two incredible performances to back it up, i really felt the guilt, the betrayal and the pain for both of them as they spun into self destruction. . Mark soon finds a lover of his own, strangely its his sons teacher Helen, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Anna . As the film evolves Anna becomes ever more manic, as a result, every one she knows seems to come to a bloody end, can anyone survive the mysterious beast that hides in Anna's apartment? I guess there must be many explanations for how and why the film evolves the way it does, my take is that both Mark and Anna invented their respective lovers to compensate for their own failings, of course others may look at it as a skewed version of Invasion of the Body snatchers. Adjani provides the viewer with perhaps THE most manic female performance since Shelley Duvall in The Shining (perhaps even ever), she even makes that performance seem restrained, such is her dedication to her performance that she really does seem possessed. Neill is equally strong, putting in what could be a career best performance. The standout performance for me though was the bizarre and crazy Heinz Bennent who plays uber mannered Heinrich, i was in awe of his every word and movement, he even made me laugh out loud. Zulawski for his part controls things to perfection, his camera is always moving making even mundane scenes seem really interesting. The setting of Berlin before the wall came down is a constant reminder of separation that mirrors the couples plight. Again though i feel this is a film that will benefit from subsequent viewings, i did lose my train of thought towards the end, still though it didn't spoil my overall enjoyment. If there's one over riding memory i'll take from the film, besides its bizarreness, that would be its incredible eroticism, despite the fact there is almost no sex contained within, it left this viewer a little hot under the collar. Before i finish off, its hard not to mention Anna's real lover, but how can one give justice to him, seeing is believing. Its onward and upward with Zulawski for me, next up Diabel.",Possession
41,eagandersongil,A psycho cinematic experience,8,2 April 2018,"""Possession"" is a film that transports the linear between reality and pure madness, with dozens of allegories, metaphors, sublime performances and precise direction, the Polish Andrzej Zulawski does almost a cinematic / psychological experiment. Focused on a screenplay, which in the foreground looks something very mundane, the film develops with a psychological apprehension, seen the depression of the character Mark and his lack of moral sense that is created when he discovers that he is being betrayed, soon in the first minutes of film, and on the other hand we have Anna, who is completely out of her mind, and with the course of the film is only getting worse, with psychotic deaf, bipolar syndromes, etc. The family drama at first is what causes the horror in the film, until we discover the monster to which Anna relates, and when the supernatural element comes by surprise in the film, in the best Stephen King style, you start to question and make reflections about everything that will already come here in the film. The monster can be interpreted as the materialization of the relationship of the couple, the deaf can be interpreted as the duality of thought in the head of the woman, between being a mother or indulging in pleasure, since Anna's character is apparently nymphomaniac, little-quoted but present, we have the social context of Germany in the early 80's, which ultimately influences the film and even make the viewer conjecture bizarre theories, since the wall was still standing. Technically the film is great, and the first thing that makes the most attentive viewer to film in the film is its Camera angles, with many long planes, and even the sequential planes, the camera direction of this film is perfect, even moments at which the film is harmed by repetitions of ideas is saved by the beautiful camera framing, always aiming to show the environment, with open or closed plans, exploring the loneliness or madness of each character, another notable point in the film is its track sounding, sneaky but perfect, it does not come to bother or scare, as the track of a good horror movie should do, but the trail helps to punctuate the mood of the film. Isabelle Yasmine Adjani and Sam Neil are more than perfect, they are perfect, they captivate, enchant, denubland and live with passion and finesse their characters. ""Possession"" is not a perfect movie, it tries to create mysteries and makes references within its idea that often go unnoticed at first glance, in addition to a gore half trash for a serious movie, but anyway, ""Possession"" by Andrzej Zulawsk is a little commenting film, but it is an excellent artistic expression of cinema",Possession

For those who have never encountered the term, call them amateur film scholars. Some really are film scholars with the degrees to prove it. Some write reviews for blogs and various sites and some are just fans of movie, who have gone far past the typical popular Hollywood pablum to dive into the history and culture of film. Some might call these people ""film snobs"". In a lot of ways I would consider myself to be one. One of the horror movies that I have seen a lot of these friends tout through the years is POSSESSION and it was with anticipation that I finally was able to find it on TMC and got my chance to watch it.I can only say I'm left more than a little disappointed. This is truly the kind of movie that only hardcore ""film lovers"" would appreciate. It's the sort of movie that's an acquired taste, developed through years of watching similar films and I just didn't have the patience to sift through the layers and find the value in this movie.We begin in what seems to be the middle of the story, as the guy from Jurassic Park returns home after years spent in government service to find that his marriage has hit bottom, his wife has been cheating on him and divorce is imminent. In the middle of this rocky relationship is a young child, who displays very little natural action. He is almost an object in the movie, meant only to serve the purpose of becoming another something for this couple to fight over.Much of the movie is spent in endless conversation, sometimes between two characters and sometimes with characters just babbling to themselves. There is not a normal person in this entire film. Everyone is neurotic, obsessed and ""possessed"" by various forces. It becomes an unnerving experience for the viewer after awhile. The wife is falling apart mentally and showing obvious cracks. Her behavior is completely irrational. She screams and shouts, talks nonsense and acts in bizarre ways that tend to grate on the viewer's nerves.The husband is reacting in obsessive ways, shown frequently rocking himself back and forth with a blank look on his face. This is carried out to such an extreme that it almost felt like a farce from a FAMILY GUY skit. His behavior is, also, erratic as he tries to cope with this failing marriage. At times, he is the focal point of the plot and the only ""normal"" thing, but then goes to extremes of behavior even worse than his wife's. Then, we meet the ""lover"", the wife's boyfriend, who is is as much unhinged as the rest of them, bouncing from an almost flirtatious encounter with the husband, to spouting college philosophy course views on life and love.Somehow, this all leads to the wife having a third (second?) affair with something out of a Lovecraft short story, a tentacled, vegetative bloody monster that feeds on human blood. She gives her body, her blood and her lovers to this new monster, who is bedridden and must be brought his dinner by this young woman. None of this is really explained and the director never intends to do so, because it's all some metaphor that we're supposed to think through about the nature of love and the forces that both bring us together and tear us apart.I'm all for art in my horror and appreciate a film that has layers for me to tear through, but this movie is too perturbing. By the end point, I want to kill all of them myself just to end their babbling and their drama queen behavior. By the time we get to the end, I no longer even cared what the director was trying to say and just wanted it to be over.",Possession

I can argue some of the ""visions"" presented here are ways to cope with a separation that involves a kid, which makes it harder. the characters might engage in enhanced versions of what they wanted each other to be. and feelings of deep jealousy and inadequacy towards themselves and their world. the film sems to project this for me but i might also totally wrong.there are the lynch films in place here but i remind a lot of jacob's ladder when i see this. the problem was jacob's ladder wasn't strong enough to keep its options open: the end makes the movie very linear. this one dares not to do it. nd just piles surreal scenes over surreal scenes that confuses us even though we might try to find meaning in everything. in a way we're like the charcters: wanting to find a meaning for their lifes, their existance their future life.now both of the main actors are great. the directing and cinematography are top notch, they give us the perfect ""descent into madness"" type without creating a deep claustrophobic atmosphere (polanski's possession also seems to play a part here but it seems to be a ""simpler"" movie - still awesome).

It's an enigmatic film that needs several viewings to connect with it. It is laden with anger, anxiety and hysteria. It was actually included on the DPP's list of 'Video Nasties' in the UK in the early eighties.The story involves a man named Mark (Sam Neill) who arrives home after being away on his mysterious job (possibly a government secret agent) and is told by his wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani) that she is having an affair with another man named Heinrich (Heinz Bennent). The film then goes into a convoluted mode of visceral frenzy.Isabelle Adjani gives an extremely powerful performance as the crazed wife, (think of Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant, and then some more) in one scene in particular in a subway she is irrationally wild. The film is added more surreal flavour because Adjani plays two characters in the film, the other being the couple's son's teacher. Heinz Bennent is also in similar form as the creepy and odd Heinrich, he just looks like Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lectar. Anna leaves Mark and moves into a large vacuous apartment, where in one of the rooms she has sex with a strange slimy creature, whose purpose is to evolve and change into a doppelganger of Mark.

It's infamous for two reasons: For being one of the 72 Video Nasties and for being the movie where Isabelle Adjani has sex with a squid. Yep, live-action tentacle porn.The film is rife with visual symbolism. This was written while the director was going through a bad divorce, which is obvious. Sam Neill comes home from an undefined espionage mission to find that his wife is acting extremely erratic and demanding a divorce. Things quickly get stressful. Their relationship deteriorates wildly. It's not too long before what appears to be a drama pitched at a hysterical emotional level evolves into a horror film about madness and slimy monsters from another place.Neill and Adjani spent the entire film screaming. Chairs are tossed, fridges are emptied on the floor, self-mutilation with electric carving knives ensues, people are beaten, lots of other self-destructive behavior follows. It's a mess of emotional trauma. Neill, near minutes in, lies on a bed, wearing the same clothes for weeks, seizing, running around in a daze. As the story goes on, he commits arson, theft, and murder. Adjani is in emotional turmoil throughout. In the second most famous scene, she stops in an alleyway, hysterical. She rolls around in filth, cries and wails. Finally, she coughs up milk, while blood and green slime flood out from under her dress, in an inexplicable miscarriage of Something. Oh yeah, before that, she's masturbates in a church.The insanity extends to the rest of the cast. Adjani's (human) lover is a weirdo named Heinrich, a New Age guru. He hits on everybody, even Neill. He talks in an odd accent and is constantly moving his arms around. He does drugs and knows jujitsu throws. He also lives with his dowdy, suicidal mother. Bob, the son, is always making siren noises, when he isn't testing how long he can hold his breath. Adjani's best friend, Margit, wears a cast and romantically hits on everyone too. There's the world's most incompetent private eye, who is extremely bad at following people. A character known only as the Man in Pink Socks might know something about what is going on.The only normal person is Bob's teacher, Helen Who is also played by Adjani. Why? Anna babbles about how there's a Sister of Chance and a Sister of Fate inside of her, warring for control. There's a bizarre scene of her torturing a girl in a ballet class. There might be something about the Madonna/Whore dynamic, since Anna abandons motherhood in favor of a bizarre, sexual relationship. Neill falls for Helen and she immediately fills the mother role to Bob.There might be some Lovecraft influence. Carlo Rambaldi's monster is exactly the kind of creature HP wrote about. It's greenish, transparent, blood and organs flexing inside. It develops tentacles and feeds off of people's emotions. Eventually, glassy eyes form. You could throw adjectives around like proboscidian, semi-amorphous, or squamous to describe it. Moreover, SPOILER ALERT, the movie ends with this creature taking on human form. As he floats in front of a green glass door, visually illustrating forces pushing through one world to another, the lights fade and bombs are heard outside. It's an apocalyptic image and suggests this madness has a world-wide effect. Assuming I'm not just applying my own meaning to an inscrutable mess.And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much insanity in ""Possession."" It pretty much defies critical analysis. The performances, as out-of-control and high-pitched as they are, are quite good. If nothing else, Neill and Adjani commit fully to the rigorous material. The movie is well-shot. Zulawski's camera roams in creative ways. The electric score is softly unnerving. It's certainly not a movie you're likely to forget any time soon. You'll probably think it's either indecipherable pretentious nonsense or a very deep statement.

Throwing in a random Pod Person isn't going to make it anything more than that; a discount European Invasion of the Body Snatchers spliced with Kramer vs. Kramer. This is one of those cases where if someone says this has ""powerful performances"", what they really mean is that it's full of screaming - lots of over-the-top exaggeration and screaming - at one point Isabelle Adjani strokes out in a subway station, and a bunch of film festivals called it ""brilliant"" - it's just ""A Woman Under the Influence"", though while Gena Rowlands was wonderfully restrained in that movie, making her performance all the more distressing, and the character's breakdown uncomfortably palpable, this was hilariously over-the-top. It's told pretty linearly, but feels like one of those undeservedly up its own rectum art-house movies like 21 Grams - it even has the same look, tone, mood, and sense of acting. The director wrote this while going through a divorce, and I hope he at least got some catharsis from it, because for the rest, it's a mild waste of time, even if the 21 Grams crowd don't know it.",Possession
50,imagiking,Possession: Utterly Mad,8,1 April 2010,"Famously violent, bloody and brutal, Possession is a member of that most hallowed hall of ""Video Nasties"" we know and love. Boasting scenes of some noteworthy infamy, Andrzej Zulawski's complex allegorical explanation of marital disintegration is known for its thematic obscurity.In Cold War Berlin, Mark returns home from unclear duties to a marriage which is on its last legs. His wife Anna, suffering from increasingly inclement behaviour and mood swings brought about by their ailing relationship, is revealed to be having an affair, leading Mark to investigate. What he discovers is more bizarre even than his wife's drug loving German lover.The one feeling which appears to be universal in conjunction with Possession is that of helpless confusion. As the credits roll, the only thing we can justifiably think is ""What just happened?!"" The film is utterly mad; unendingly so. From start to finish, I struggled not to miss a beat amidst the mire. Difficult to follow and impossible to understand at first, Zulawski's frustrating work leaves us scratching our heads for the entirety of its running time. Possession's gradual descent from a Kramer Vs. Kramer-esquire marital drama to a bloody and supernatural allegory is as surprising as it is bizarre and mental. Thereafter, we are treated to a visual feast of harrowing images and strangely violent outbursts. The increasingly insane plot is marred by overeager performances, though it is considerably attention grabbing. The film is not at all a bad one, providing a deeply interesting message (which may take time and thought to fully comprehend) albeit through a hazy, complicated and apparently nonsensical narrative. Additionally, Heinz Bennent's Heinrich is a wonderful and whimsical character, bringing an element of farcical comedy to the plot.Managing to shock and surprise as well as stupefy, Possession is a film well versed in oddity. Exploring an interesting topic with a veiled depth, it gives us a message in an unconventional way which is quite brilliant in itself.",Possession
51,Gloede_The_Saint,Too ridiculous to be taken seriously,2,26 February 2011,"Pssession, which is most likely supposed to be an allegory of the emotions a bitter divorce can create in people, fails on most levels. I will grant it that it does catch the emotions, to a certain degree, and I can see how some people, particularly those who have experienced it themselves, will find power in this.However, despite certain insights, what destroys this is the presentation. From an intellectual step by step analyzes, it could most certainly prove a revelation, but taken as it actually is I can't help shaking my head.The performances are flat out disgusting. All the actors seem to do is make odd noises and gurgles, say retarded nonsensical lines and walk and look as if mentally disabled. Most is not even aimed at comedy, though certain aspects most certainly are. The mixture seems utterly displaced.To make it perfectly clear - to me it fails no matter what it attempts. It's fails as an emotional allegory, it fails as the moment of zen, it fails as body horror, it fails as nonsensical art-house and it most certainly fails as a comedy. The reason I put out all of these possibilities is because it was so god damn horrible I can't see where it could possibly fit.Why make something this bad if you aren't even trying to be funny? Why mix in retarded comic relief lovers? Why walk around in a constant trance? I get the concept that you change as a person and that who you are is destroyed, but when you mix in a ridiculous plot, shoot outs and detectives you have gone in the wrong direction.I know this film has gotten a lot of fans over the years and that it will most likely remain a classic for decades to come.

52,kclipper,Over-the-top performances and a really big surprise is an understatement!,6,16 July 2011,"It starts off as your typical but powerful drama. Sam Neill suspects that pretty wife, Isabelle Adjani is cheating. When his suspicions are confirmed, he ventures into a nervous breakdown, and soon enough, both of them are thrust into depravity, self-mutilation and other disturbing behavior. It takes a turn for the ultra-weird when he finally realizes that there is much more to the plot than just the average cheating housewife scenario.This features some of the most non-stop, emotionally charged performances ever by Neill and Adjani, and other odd-ball characters are introduced into the mix as well, coming off so eccentric that one can only determine that this was filmed as some strange, artistic freak-show of some sort. It's well directed, written and executed, but when you eventually stumble upon the explanation of all this madness, you'll understand what has kept this from being the classic that its potential would suggest. The shocking punch-line of this European eye-opener will either leave you revolted and appalled or mesmerized and amused. It was perverse enough to be labeled as a ""video nasty"" during the 1980s, and the U.S print was cut by a whopping 47 minutes sending it into doomed obscurity.

Lots of lofty, philosophical dialogue as well about religion and human nature, though tonally the film goes for outlandishness and, at times, comedy, rather than feeling stuffy and intellectualized. Most of my enjoyment was derived from the unique genre-mashing, very compelling and somewhat experimental camerawork, and the absolutely unhinged performances. The acting in this film is really quite something. If you've ever seen a film by Andrzej Zulawski, you're aware that he directs his actors in a very atypical way and the result is what most would call ""overacting."" In this film, the absurdity and sheer intensity of the performances works quite well and leads to some truly arresting moments. However, the ""heightened"" acting style persists in nearly every scene, even those that may not really call for it. I fully realize that this is the style Zulawski is going for, but to my taste it was occasionally off-putting and took me out of the film. Perhaps just a bit more restraint here and there could've magnified the impact of the most volatile moments. It also felt like the film could've done a bit better at escalating the tension as it progressed. It's at full throttle nearly right out of the gate and manages to sustain that nicely, but it comes off feeling a bit one-note by the end. Again, some restraint could've possibly made the proceedings feel more dynamic. Regardless, it's a very unique and notable film with great performances that's very much worth checking out if you're into this sort of thing.Light 4/5",Possession

Articles about the many distribution difficulties and cut versions made it all the harder to find the true one. A very edited copy existed in Sweden for a long while but I just never bothered. It was also never presented to me as the exceptional piece of work that it is, not until I got the awesome Eyeball Compendium, which features many interesting and well-written articles about Zulawski, among other things. Here is a director with a truly original and provocative vision. Despite the surreal and disjointed storyline, it is all held together by his sensibilities. There is no need for complete explanation, just sit back and enjoy the dreamlike atmosphere, the furious camera-work, editing and the dynamic acting and blockings.

57,eonbluedan-1,Truly demented cinema,9,1 February 2011,"As a fan of David Lynch (which means I have seen ""Eraserhead""), and not being somebody unfamiliar with experimental cinema, I can honestly say this is the most demented film I have ever sat through. It would be easy to think that means it makes absolutely no sense, is about nothing, and is essentially a host of ridiculous imagery edited together, much like the previously mentioned Lynch piece, but that is not the case. ""Possession"" is a film that actually appears to be about something, and does apparently follow that through to its logical, if by the point of the finale, completely twisted conclusion! It is the fact that on some level, you are aware it is following a story, that makes what you are experiencing all the more insane.The story is pretty much a precursor to the Lars Von Trier film ""Antichrist"", the main differences being that in the case of ""Possession"" it is not grief over a lost child that is destroying the couple's relationship, and that ""Possession"" is the better, if more messed-up piece (seriously!) Mark returns home in the knowledge that there is something wrong with his wife Anna, and it quickly becomes apparent to him that she is unhappy with their marriage and that she has taken a lover. Once past this point, the film appears to become a much larger, extremely metaphorical piece, which goes far beyond these two people's relationship. My impression is that the characters you are watching become political archetypes, dialogue and on screen events often not making any sort of literal sense, but rather begging you to read between the lines. This impression is backed up quite firmly, I believe, by the fact that it all unfolds next to the Berlin Wall, the monstrosity often in frame, if not being shot as a central character at points; the fact that Adjani is clearly playing two roles, and that the lover Anna has hidden away for her private sexual encounters is in fact a monster! Talking of the monster, Carlo Rambaldi, the man responsible for the ""Alien"" creatures and E.T, is the person behind this, and he still does not like to talk about this film, apparently.There is some complaint that a lot of what happens between these character seems very stagey and false, but that is now how I saw it. Given my previous impression, I believe that we are being taken up close and personal in this surreal play, often far too close for comfort, as these people scream their conversations hysterically, and we plunge into the madness. The ""stagey"" feel comes from the fact it does seem to play out as a theatre production, but we are put right on the stage with them (again, something Von Trier would later visit in his work). It is clearly intentional that everything be surreal and strange, adding to how unnerving the whole thing feels, but the performances are undoubtedly superb. Adjani did, in fact, win an award at Cannes for her performance, despite the film being banned! You need no other explanation as to why, other than watching the acting; to see her give this grotesque, shrill, hyper performance is truly uncomfortable. The fact Sam Neill stands his ground is testament to his prowess and presence.You walk away from ""Possession"" completely dumbfounded and unsettled, with an inexplicable desire to watch it again; either that or you will simply despise it. Whatever happens, and whatever one makes of it, its power to alarm is still top-notch.",Possession

59,Krug Stillo,What an experience!!!,10,31 May 2003,"Acting, colour, camera movement and story thrown into hyperactivityWhat do you get? Well, the headache inducing, enthralling Possession. Beautiful, erotic and extremely disturbing, Andrjez Zulawski's film (admired by the Italian Master of the Macabre himself, Dario Argento) is an extreme assault upon the senses.Mark (played excellently and deliberately over-the-top by Sam Neil) returns home from secret government work to his wife in Berlin, cue many shots of the Berlin wall representing the couple's marital breakdown. However, Mark's wife, Anna (a truly unforgettable, no holds barred and hypnotic performance from the lovely Isabelle Adjani) is behaving inexcusably strangely. Mark finds out that she is having an affair with Heinrick (another crazy performance from Heinz Bennet) and confronts him only to find that the lover has not seen Anna for some time. This is the part of the rollercoaster ride before your cartplummets into some real thought-provoking, unsettling and scary surrealism.Possession is definitely the film that requires many subsequent viewings. Excellent performances that frequently go way OTT, dreamily fluid camerawork and migraine inducing metaphorical horror, this is a true beast of the imagination. Love it or hate it, it is a true original masterpiece that is definitely not for all tastes. If films were placed in boxes and divided by flavours, like crisps, POSSESSION would sit in a box entirely by its self, awaiting only those who can take it. Go into it with an open mind like you've never gone into a film with one before. It can seriously mentally damage you if you try and figure it all out on that initial viewing, so beware; if there is truly anything to work out. The now infamous miscarriage in the subway scene is confusing, painful and sickening to watch and nothing like it can be found elsewhere.

62,logicproreviews,"Next time you start an argument with your partner, think again... !",8,20 March 2020,"The best way to describe Possession to someone who hasn't seen it, would be to use the analogy of a roller coaster ride. Imagine if you will, creeping up that steep railroad track, strapped into your seat with no way out. You watch as the incline draws near and before you can gulp - DROP! Your screams robbed of you as shock trumps your breath.Just when you think its all over, you see some tight turnings and steep slopes up ahead. Similar feelings of dread and apprehension are conjured up during the course of Possession. It starts off slow and rushes furiously through the progressivly worse second and third acts, When the end credits roll, you're left with the rug pulled from under you.Andrzej Zulawski and Frederic Tuten who penned the screenplay - based in some part Zulawski's own marital difficulties - crafted a gradual, uneasy relationship breakdown and the subsequent psychological effects on both partners.Mark and Anna are the characters in question, brought to life by the frenzied performances of Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani. As an audience, we're the fly on the wall, watching these characters go through a harrowing breakup.Each scene progresses into something unbearable and yet, we are compelled to watch more. Their arguments are a mix of passive-aggression, verbal assaults and domestic violence.We soon learn that Anna's infidelity is fueling these quarrels and Sam Neill spirals out of control as the now cuckolded Mark; his emotional devastation is grossly realistic and he looks to be losing a grasp on own his sanity. He also confronts Anna's lover - the slimy, yet suave Heinrich - only to be floored when the confrontation gets physical.The horrors of Mark and Anna's breakup are intertwined with genuine horror tropes, a perfect marriage (pun intended) that makes the story work so well. Any Cronenberg fan will appreciate the body horror on display; we have a mysterious slimy, writhing tentacled creature that Anna visits and has intercourse with.Plus, there's a seemingly random and utterly bonkers scene which sees Anna gyrating around an empty subway in a macabre dance until she falls to the ground and has a graphically intense miscarriage - a scene that feels much longer than it actually is.The wrought emotion exerted by Isabelle Adjani in this scene is genuinely unnerving and it's no surprise that she won Best Actress at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival for her work in Possession.Andrzej Zulawski included shots of Berlin Wall - on one hand to represent his own political affiliations - while on the other, it's a fitting allegory for Mark and Anna's separation.Zulawski's nightmarish take on a marital breakup is a sucker punch for the senses. The invasive camera angles, dark tones and most off all, the performances, all work together to deliver a film you won't forget.Highly recommended.8/10",Possession

I have seen some very bad movies and this movie deserves to be in my worst 5 ever movies seen. The story of the film is Sam Neill is husband of Isabella Adjani. He comes home after doing some secret job which remains disclosed throughout the film. After he comes back, Isabella starts behaving like she's nuts. She has an affair with some German dude. One thing that annoyed me, was she screams at the top of her voice throughout the film for no reason.She screams and breaks things in the house and behaves like a total lunatic. It's shown in the film that she is possessed and has sex with some monster like creature, which is created by her own evil personality according to the film. Sam Neill also gets fascinated by his son's school teacher who exactly looks like his wife, but her behavior just opposite of his wife, and as desired by him (Sam Neill). Really, I didn't understand how one's imagination can create monsters,and to top it all that particular scene when Isabella has sex with that gruesome creature is very unpleasant.Both the main characters in this film are good actors, but they are told to overact in this film. Especially, to watch Isabella Adjani's hysterical character was painful to watch. The only thing that made sense to me was the kid commits suicide in the end. Really, he had no other alternatives left, as we see his parents are screaming and fighting throughout the film. It is completely idiotic film, some people say again that it has some symbols which act as metaphors. But, screw all this. We watch film to be entertained not to be annoyed.

The photography here is so clean and crisp - with white colors being white and black being black - like I haven't seen it in ages (well, American Beauty in parts maybe coming close to this). With ample use of natural daylight, congenial and non-intrusive camera movement and angles, and excellent choices of interieurs and exterieurs this film makes for some thoroughly impressive imagery.Adjani fans in particular should be thrilled. I can't recall having ever seen such beautiful closeups on the actress, in her younger days. The contrast of black hair, fair skin and blue eyes is breathtaking. Unfortunately, I can only imagine how extraordinary the film should look like on the big screen.Thematically, this piece reminds of Polanski's ""apartment movies"", like Repulsion or The Tenant. A bit more of the former maybe, because it's lacking any humor whatsoever. The film is atmosphere driven, and soaking with a profound, relentless sense of alienation.The latter is achieved also by means of odd dialog pieces and intentionally wooden acting, in parts resembling a clumsy stage theater rehearsal, thus constantly suggesting a second, hidden meaning to everything that's happening. So the focus is not on a straightforward plot but rather on disorientation - enhanced by the use of ""doppelgangers"" - which might put off some viewers accustomed to more simplicity.Still, the protagonists - Neill, Adjani, Bennent - are plain awesome. And Adjani's subway scene provides for a dimension of physical acting I can't recall having seen ever before.A gem, as far as I'm concerned.

I can't speak for the writer of this story but can comment off of what I've seen and I do beg to differ when it comes to categorizing this movie in something other than horror because it is horror. Besides the monster that has sex, it shows the horror of both husband and wife.Sam Niel plays a perfect deranged husbands, made that way by his troublesome wife and he suffers through it all because he has a child with her, they're married and he loves her until the brutal end.I think every guy's worst nightmare is to loose his woman to some doped out kinky guy who does nothing but has sex with her.In fact, I commend both actors for playing their parts because it really does show how people can turn crazy from the stress and heartbreak of a flawed relationship.Kudos.",Possession

And I have been an avid, one would almost say ""possessed,"" fan ever since.  That said, I can't help but ponder some of his career choices, although 1981 was at the beginning of his career, so that probably accounts for his taking this role. This stands -- beside the execrable ""Night Train to Venice"" -- as the worst movie of all time, Sam Neill or no Sam Neill.  I actually bought this sight unseen on eBay for not much money because I try to collect everything Neill, and I WILL keep it, but I will never watch it again in an unaltered state. Neill is, as always, very good and, God love him, I give him all the credit in the world for sticking to the old adage:  A job worth doing is worth doing well.

She is SO convincing as a certified nut case that I have to wonder if she isn't really nuts.  There is such a thing as good acting, but she's so over-the-top that it only makes a bad situation worse.  The whole thing stinks to high heaven.  Sam Neill, if he has the right material, is all a body could hope for in a leading man.  But no one could sit through this, not even Boopsie.",Possession

74,mikeburdick,Trying way too hard,4,8 February 2015,"I love ambiguity in films. Which is why Haneke's ""Cache,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" all rank very highly amongst my favourite films. It's great when filmmakers give viewers credit and allow them to draw their own conclusions or search for their own meaning. Unfortunately, for ""Possession,"" I don't really care enough about the characters to want to go through the mental gymnastics required to dig out the deeper meaning hidden in this film.It's apparent early on in the film that much of the action is allegorical or meant to reflect the internal emotions of a couple going through a divorce. (God, I hope so. If it's meant to be a literal story, it's a monumental fail. A really annoying horror film.) If only there were an honest moment where you got to feel that these are real characters who perhaps were once a real couple with a real connection before the film slipped into allegory. A marriage can't slowly disintegrate if it never happened.And it's disappointing, because I really like Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill, and rate them both as actors. They obviously put everything into their performances, which must have been very demanding, the only reason I can conjure up a few stars for this one. That and the special effects, which are super creepy and hold up well more than 30 years later. Oh, and the amazing German architecture.But there are too many reasons it's hard to take this film seriously. The over-the-top acting, goofy choreography, elaborate camera moves for inconsequential moments, closeups so tight they managed to make even Isabelle Adjani look bad, soundtrack that's completely ripped off from ""The Godfather."" There were quite a few laugh-out-loud moments that I'm certain weren't meant that way.Perhaps the filmmaker meant it as purely art, and it's raw emotion splattered on the screen. But my takeaway was, it's hopelessly dense. Every scene, every action, every movement, every word is imbued with a deeper meaning that, unfortunately, can only be deciphered by the filmmaker, and leaves the viewer with little more than the visceral experiences played out on the screen.",Possession

Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani are really great, and I think that a good movie does not have to be completely clear, because it allows you to think a lot, (I might mention Mulholland Drive as an example) and thats what happens with Possession. It just faces you to the evil. Obviously you should not consider that the ""thing"" that is living with Anna is a monster, is just one of the many faces of evil, and that explains why Anna's character changes so much. Sometimes she is she, sometimes she is possessed, sometimes she has acknowledge, sometimes she just cannot control it. In the scene where he tries to cut her throat is just after his husband says ""help me"", though it seems that she is barely listening, thats what she does: try to help, and the best way to do that seems being death.Anyway I did not catch all these details the first time I saw it, but after one second time, all gets clearer. It even gets clearer that all the nightmare started more less when she was still a ballet teacher.

SO I read all the reviews, downloaded this movie, and...I don't even know where to start, except to say I don't get why this is a 7.3 out of 10.First off, Im glad movies don't start off with running credits anymore, the few reviews I read didn't mention a ""creature"" but golly-gee, the idiots who made the movie wanted to give that away. I don't know why crediting the ""CREATURE MAKER"" had to be done in the first 5 minutes of the film, but that was a spoiler alert I cant even top in this review.Secondly, this movie is Poorly edited, you jump from scene to scene and you get left with the feeling of blue balls, like they are unfinished scenes. The story is confusing, nothing is explained, like how did this all start? Why is what is happening, happening? None of that is answered.Sam Neill, the star of Jurassic Park and creepy guy from Event Horizon, is a good actor, but even his acting is over the top. The lead actress and the guy who plays Heinrich, both ham their roles up at times, especially when she miscarries in the tunnel! WTF is she doing, she is supposed to be writhing in agony I guess, but its just comes off as modern day ""twerking""The men in this movie are Utterly Weak and Stupid, even Heinrich, who comes off strong ends up portraying weakness,(forget the 2 PI's NEill's character hires to follow her, they are the epitome of weak) Sam Neill's character loves her to the point of insanity, which I can understand the movies point, love is irrational, but come on! Near the end, when he walks in on her with the creature, and finds whats in her fridge, he Still Keeps pining after her, saying, ""If I laid down in front of you, would you still walk over me?"" and he Does lay down(SPOILER ALERT: and guess what SHE Walks OVER him) At that point I was Cheering for him to die!He literally does NOT get it till the very end, and even then he Still doesn't really get itThe last 5 or so minutes of this movie are Utterly confusing...that is the main problem with the movie, scenes simply do not tie together and make sense. Whatsup with the pink socks guy and the work Sam Neill's character did for him at the very beginning of the movie, does that have something to do w/ her being possessed? I have no clue, its NOT EXPLAINED, but he shows up at the end after everyones dead, hinting that he does, but once again the movie doesn't explain it.Shes keeps talking about Faith & Chance, but once again, its not clear if the doppelgangers (the doppelganger teacher of their child Bob, and the, Spoiler Alert: the fact the creature turns into a evil Sam Neill's twin) how are they related to any of that, if they are even related.Also, nearly every outside scene on streets, subways and the tunnels in subways, the train ride, there are Literally no people on the streets, anywhere save for the weirdo on the train that takes one of her bananas from her shopping bag.I'll agree, this movie starts off innocently, with a break-up of a family and his hunt for the other man and some sort of CLosure, but then it descends into weirdness and gets weirder and weirder by the minute, but your left utterly confused and po'd...the last minute where the kid runs upstairs yelling repeatedly ""Dont Open the Door"" and then jumps in the tub full of water, is he drowning himself? or trying to hide? and the (good) doppelganger teacher is at the door, with the evil doppelganger Sam Neill right outside, but then their is an earthquake, and shes in a trance or something, not opening the door but staring off into space...roll end creditsThis movie leaves you confused and unsatisfied, hence my blue balls comparison",Possession

The American release is obviously butchered from the 120 minute European version, rendering it incoherent. Events and characters pop up randomly, making us confused instead of scared. The acting is way over the top (I hear Adjani actually won a Best Actress Award in Europe for her performance, which is basically her running around screaming and slashing both herself and other people). Possession ends in a twist that is too idiotic to even bother spoiling. Whoever thought this subject matter could pass as watchable entertainment, much less be scary, was sorely mistaken.

Jokes aside, this movie was annoyingly ridiculous to me. She was beautiful, he an awesome actor, the atmosphere screamed Polanski all over it, and I thought what could go wrong, right?
Well, first of all, her acting was terrible and annoying when she played the role of Anna. I could literally picture in my mind in most scenes how the director behind the scenes screaming to her ""now roll over, be more insane, do this do that"", such a feeling I had when I watched the annoying Babadook kid acting out too. They both did a bad acting job IMO and or maybe it was the director's fault. I can see the director as some kind of visionary megalomaniac, clearly inspired by Polanski. That being said, the movie didn't make much sense nor it explained anything. It was long and boring, but if it was made better, even with the same elements but placed more logically, could have been good. I also like the Lovecraftian overtone that it has.
I'm actually surprised that I disliked the movie. I mean I didn't actually dislike it, I was intrigued to a degree but at the same time I was put off, because I was constantly seeing the missed potential. I don't know, I may be wrong, perhaps I'm doing injustice to the movie, but I was ultimately disappointed. I felt like the director was improvising badly, and he did that a lot.

There are films from ten years previous that had moved well beyond this kind of screechy, scratchy rubbish.The plot.. About the plot: There is no plot.

My problem is that I 'got it', I understood the symbolism and mostly what the director was trying to say but I still thought it was a crap movie. That wasn't where my difficulty ended though. I was trying to decide whether it wasn't a good film or if I just didn't like it. To explain explain my point further in musical terms, you might like the music of Beethoven and Bach or maybe your taste is for Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman or perhaps for Miles Davis and Tubby Hayes. If you are an affection-ado of classical music you may say the music of Keith Emerson has little merit or you may say Keith Emerson has talent coming out of his little finger but I don't like what he does. And so it was with Possession. Did it have little worth or was it personal preference? Let me get into the movie a little bit. The Sam Niell character Mark was weak all the way through. He was besotted beyond the point of rationality. ""Yes you can have your lover just so long as you don't leave me."" The Isabelle Adjani character Helen showed what a fine actress she can be when directed properly. For her Anna character, Zulawski wanted serious overacting and that is exactly what he got. Full marks to Adjani for making a career call and deciding to do it. It was like a classical trumpet player performing in a bad Mardi Grass band. The monster, which wasn't all that frightening or even creepy, represented Anna's (or Zulawski's) depressed state of self loathing. The miscarriage scene where the bad acting reached its zenith, was Anna (and Zulawski) exorcising their demons. Not being a woman and never having witnessed a miscarriage, I do not know if women do actually bleed from the mouth at such times. I suspect it is highly unlikely. The scene reminded me of a bad John Wayne movie where even if he gets shot in the leg he still bleeds from the mouth.Having said that, there were some fine pieces of cinematography in the film. The shots of deserted streets around dawn representing Anna's feelings of isolation and loneliness. The buildings austere facades mirrored her feelings of sinister unease.The film ends with scenes of death and redemption. We always assume that knowing what we do, we will make a better job of things the next time around but that may not always be the case. If there is reincarnation it might not be for the better. The sons actions at the end of the film foresee a state of hopelessness that the granted re-run of the situation will not fare any better than the first.Zulawski has confronted and raged at his own daemons with this film.

97,groucho_de_sade,Unfairly Neglected Art-Horror Masterpiece from an Unfairly Neglected Director,10,7 January 2006,"This shocking, bizarre, and emotionally brutal film from little-known (to mainstream audiences) Polish filmmaker Andrzej Zulawski combines the dark suspense and ironic humor of ROSEMARY'S BABY, the biological horror and familial disintegration of THE BROOD, and the unabashed histrionics and directorial flamboyance of Ken Russell's THE DEVILS. With themes of marital strife, familial disintegration, and psychological breakdown harking back to the former two and the in-your-face grotesquerie and visceral drama reminding the viewer of the latter two, little-known but acclaimed Polish filmmaker Andrzej Zulawski tells the story of Anna (Isabelle Adjani, in the performance of a lifetime) and Mark (Sam Neill), she a bored housewife and he an overworked... something (the film never makes clear his occupation). They share an apartment in an empty, run-down Berlin with their young son. After completing an important job of some kind, Mark comes home to his family to find things changed. He drags the truth from Anna that she has been having an affair. She insists she cannot stay with him, and leaves Mark with the child, apparently to shack up with her lover. Mark tracks down the lover, a real weirdo named Heinz (Heinrich Bennent), but after insults and fisticuffs, Heinz insists he has not seen Anna in quite a while. Mark, perplexed, hires a detective to follow her from their apartment after one of her sporadic visits, which always end in chaos. The detective manages to get in and... something really strange happens. I know what that something is, having seen the picture, but on the off-chance you haven't read the other (spoiler-inundated) reviews, I'll keep it secret. Instead I'll talk about the photography, which goes a long way toward mirroring the absolutely unhinged performances, and the set design, which provides a cool counterpoint to the feverish tenor of the film's action and dialogue. It obviously isn't going to be for everybody, and in fact some will doubtless find it repellent. Writing the film was obviously therapeutic for Zulawski (who, like Cronenberg when writing THE BROOD, was going through a nasty divorce). A friend of mine said he was more sickened by the scenes of emotional anguish than by any of the film's often-stomach-churning special effects. Just keep two things in mind: firstly, this isn't your typical ""horror flick"", therefore the splatterpunk/gorehound set should stay away; and secondly, this one is playing for keeps: though laced with a bitter humor, there are no light moments here AT ALL, and this should not be watched by couples on a first date, or any couple whose relationship is not secure. Also, keep impressionable children away from it. I was very impressed with what I thought would be just another dreary, over-hyped horror film and turned out to be a genuine classic (at least as far as I'm concerned). Watch POSSESSION if you like Polanski's horror films, Cronenberg's more dramatic outings, or any of Ken Russell's stuff.

100,ArthvrPendrag0n,Gruesomely mesmerizing,8,17 December 2019,"Possession is the kind of movie you don't try to explain, you just have to experience it. The experience, however, is nothing easy and you're probably gonna feel like you didn't get a single thing right from the whole thing or that you got everything wrong. But the movie is thrilling nevertheless. The major pillar of the plot is the decaying marriage of Anna (Isabelle Adjani) and Mark (Sam Neill) and that's gonna be reflected in every single aspect of the movie. But the thing is that it goes way beyond a simple story about divorce. We see how Mark struggles to get Anna back to him, but at the same time that he tries to prove he is a loving and kind guy - going as far as to physically hurting himself, he also shows a possessive and scary side. Anna on the other hand has a totally declining mental state, which later is explained why, but she also has some moments of clarity. Even though they're basically divorced Anna still shows up and every time she does Mark begs her to stay with him. Their son Bob is also a really important part of the story, since it's so surreal to watch Anna and Mark going against each other, it's in the figure of the child that we see how the tragedy of separation is reflected in the rest of the world. So , it's indeed a story about marriage, but there's some more. A lot of the impressions you get will lead to a totally different path you expected. I think the supernatural essence of the movie is rather a plot device than something just to cause disgust or be taken in literal terms. As the situation between Anna and Mark gets more and more complicated, more of the otherworldly plot is revealed; it's as if H. P Lovecraft wrote a story about divorce - and I don't think I'm exaggerating. The type of terror here is very subjective and it's delivered through the flawless expression of the actors, especially Isabelle Adjani. So what once was just the story of a couple who can't really stay with each other anymore turns to be a story in which a husband can't have his wife back 'cause she's having an affair with a monster. However, if you watched the movie you seem that the monster turns to be a copy of Mark - which for me shows that in the end Anna just wanted a ideal version of her true lover which she couldn't love at all. She seems to be very aware of her sins though, but it does not hold her back from doing a lot of atrocities, I think this goes to show that we often find ourselves needing someone who might not really exist in our reality, in this case Anna created someone and that was the ultimate sin for her. Also, in the figure of Helen, someone physically identical to Anna, we observe how Mark also makes up versions of his wife on his mind - I see it as if he's yearning for a ideal wife, who will love him and take care of their son and quit a life of perversion. So the movie doesn't really give you a definitive perspective, it gives you a experience of both extremes. For me the terror in this movie is not real, but rather a metaphor for how terrible and unreal can be the end of a relationship. The ending in which both Mark and Anna die is for me a representation on how no one gets out of a relationship unscathed; this theory is reinforced by the fact that Andrzej Zulawski was experiencing a divorce around the time. All that's left is just the ideal Mark, or rather the monster, and Helen - which you could view as an ideal Anna. For the ideal to thrive, the real must die. Again about the deaths of Mark and Anna, another of my theories is that it represents that their relationship was so corroded that there was no way for them to be together under regular circumstances; that's why they're only really together in an extreme situation such as death. As for their son's death, it's for me a comment on how the separation of lovers can also hurt others; or you could just really see it as an objective comment on how kids are affected. We see that the kid drowns himself in the bathtub after the new Mark arrives at Helen's house, he begs her not to open and runs to his suicide - for me that rejection could represent how the rest of the world reinforces the separation and newfound incompatibility between former lovers. As the monster arrives at the door, the equally unreal beauty remains inside, bombs fall to sign the destruction of the world; the destruction of the institution known as marriage. There's a lot of other stuff and possibilites to find meaning in this movie, but I stick with it as being a portrait of the nature of a breaking relationship, the end of love. At first it is perhaps too odd to be inviting, but it's definitely worth the effort.",Possession

106,Food,I Loved It,10,29 April 1999,"I think that Possession is one of the most effective horror films ever made.I've read mixed reactions to Possession. I think that this is because the writer/director intentionally introduces dozens of narrative ambiguities. There are many unanswered questions, and the viewer is placed in a position where she/he must become a creative participant by answering these questions for themselves. Audiences are by and large uncomfortable with this type of thing, but luckily I've seen a lot of experimental/unusual cinema, so I'm acclimated to it.Isabelle Adjani is glorious in a dual role (which is a reversal of the Bunuel mindgame from 'That Obscure Object of Desire'--Instead of two actresses playing a single character, there is a single actress playing two characters.)Adjani and Sam Neill's enacting of a horribly troubled marriage is spectacular. Heinz Bennet's distasteful character would give anyone the creeps. When Adjani is seen in the company of a terrible Lovecraftian monster, it's almost a relief after the awful domestic situations depicted earlier in the film.

Possession is avant garde film noir that truly has to be seen to be appreciated or believed. Set with the backdrop of Berlin Germany (wall and all) in 1981, Sam Neill plays a husband who's dear wife (Andrzej Zulawski) is becoming increasingly bleak, with her bitterness of him escilating as her self loathing intensifies. Eventually she retreats to a world of despair and increasing erratic madness ultimately resulting is an aggressive separation. At a loss and fast becoming a psychological & physical wreck, he follows his love and soon discovers she is fornicating with a black tenticled malevolent entity and has embarked on a murderous rampage, killing those that intrude on her nest. Is she acting of her own free will and a slave to her urges, are there more sinister forces at play, what is this being that has such a grip on her? Immensely entertaining dark and often nasty but poetic through out, Possession feels like no other film I've ever seen. It is beautifully filmed with often odd seductive angles, supurbly acted, near masterful work of art which only falls down due to its extensive length and at times sluggish pacing. This is a film that is burned in your brain long after viewing and is as much an experience of the senses as a piece of celluloid entertainment.

If you have a chance to see this movie I would grab onto it because it is such a ride. However don't expect to understand that the story that you are about to embark. Possession is maybe the most emotional movie I've ever seen. It embodies the feeling of absolute desperation that takes place during a separation, and takes on forms of the several stages of grief, in both characters expressing them in different ways. Your senses are left assaulted by the heavy battery that the characters exert on each other and on themselves. But since the drama is so dialled up constantly the movie becomes almost comical and takes the plot to such insane levels. The German lover is extremely funny. However, at the foundation there is such bottomless sadness that the movies two main characters are experiencing in wanting to be together, but also wanting and expecting other things. The horror is lowkey to a point where you forget that it's a horror movie until it completely catches you off-guard.

Unfortunately these parts are undermined by the screeching histrionics of many of the domestic scenes, with Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani getting very am-dram and silly at every opportunity. In particular, the guy playing Heinrich is woefully theatrical; the director apparently prides himself on his toughness with ""difficult"" actresses such as Ms. Adjani — a shame this approach didn't extend to this bloke.The standout scene is Adjani wigging out in the empty subway like she's auditioning for a Cradle of Filth video. Had the director used some restraint on the performances throughout, scenes like these might have carried more weight.

Cut to the estranged husband and wife, whose acting is so amateurish and over the top that it reminded me of the student plays we used to produce in high school. You can rapidly understand why these two don't get along. Wife wants to leave and live with the man who, she cackles joyously, satisfies her like the husband never could. For some strange reason, husband wants to hold on to wife and establishes at least 2,457 times that he will not take ""no"" for an answer. Wife does leave, but keeps coming back for short visits, presumably to spend time with the couple's young child who, frankly, is the only likable character in the entire cast. Relations between husband and wife continue to deteriorate. Eventually we come to the miscarriage-in-the-subway-corridor scene, where wife spends three minutes making us forget (finally) the screaming episode of Faye Wray in ""King Kong."" And yes, things continue downhill even from there. All along, you've wondered how the couple's young boy could remain so even-keeled and undisturbed in the midst of all the marital explosiveness and physical violence swirling around him, but at the very end you hardly blame him for taking to the bathtub face down.

The plot is a little difficult to follow but makes more sense if you track down the full 2 hour version.Contextually similar to Cronenberg's The Brood (1979) the lead female character (Adjani) gives birth to her sexual frustration in the form of a multi-phallic squid-like creature. In the full version we see an extended scene in the Subway where she suffers the agony of a miscarriage which is perhaps her first attempt at manifesting her anger. She appears to find comfort in this monster as her marriage to Marc (Sam Neill) bitterly degenerates.We also learn that Anna is cheating on Marc and as she becomes increasingly disturbed both the men in her life turn on each other in a desperate attempt to understand her behaviour.Skillfully directed and masterfully acted this parable on relationships rivals Jean-Jacques Beineix's 'Betty Blue' in psychotic spontaneity.

Eventually I got a hold of it not even a year ago and I have watched it at least six times since. This is a horror movie, but, if you expect a slasher flick, zombies or any other clichés though you've come to the wrong place. This movie is about the deterioration of a marriage and how the couple hurt both each other and the child they both have brought into the world. The horror is psychological and through the couples actions instead of monsters. (Though there is a monster of sorts in the movie..). The acting is superb, (Adjani and Neil both shine) and the use of bleak color and claustrophobic way its filmed further lend to the sinister atmosphere. If you look around you can clearly see the influence this film has had on others. Dario Argento's ""Tenebre"" and although Lars von Trier made the actors in ""Antichrist"" watch Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror"" I can almost guarantee this movie had just as much influence on him.

There's serious acting, hammy acting, B movie acting, serious/Oscar winning acting, comical acting, silent film acting, but never any acting like you have seen in this film. And I guess you could include David Lynch acting, as thats pretty unique too. And of course method acting.Its like watching a theatrical play in cinematic form on acid.

Her performance in this is monumental, especially the often noted 'underground menstruation' scene which could induce some viewers to a panic attack. I certainly nearly had one when I watched the film for the first time.When a character has a breakdown in this film (both of the leads) its a REAL breakdown. And boy, do you ever feel it. Its realistic yet surreal. God knows how the director managed to coax these types of performances out of his actors. He must of drugged them or hypnotized them or something. He certainly didn't just yell 'action'.The way the scenes are cut together is highly unusual and unconventional but it makes absolute perfect sense. I don't know how, it just does.

Maybe the relentless tone intended to convey the ceaseless pain of a break up but there was a lack of subtlety to Neil and Adjani's relationship, what made them love eachother in the first place? What was at stake in them splitting up?There was also something to be said about Zulawski's use of Adjani's beauty, as I believe a less beautiful actress could not have given and gotten away with her performance. She has a beauty magnifies during her violent outbursts (emphasized by close ups) and I could see, on one level, why it was so hard for Neil to let go of her, as who could stand to lose access to her inexplicably divine beauty? And when gory images of her get too morbid, the camera cleverly cuts to images of her serene doppelganger, driving the point home.The photography was the other star of the film, the pastel whites and spare spaces conveying how during a break up things come to light, the mind fixates on the beloved and the world becomes objectless, flattened out.So much more could be said but those are some first impressions.",Possession

Made in Polish, ""Diabel"" was essentially cut off from it's only possible audience. He took a trip to France, ended up making a film and then returned to his homeland. He worked on yet another film for two years which the authorities did not allow him to finish. Since then he has basically lived and worked successfully in France.""Possession"" is the first film he made immediately following the 2nd incident in Poland. I read an interview where he talked about how his personal identity was in crisis at the time due to his divorce and being (for all intents and purposes) exiled from his homeland.

As their discord escalates, it becomes a horror film with some scenes taking place only in the psyche of the wife. The last part is an action film, driving the frenzied pace even higher through chase sequences.There are many lines of dialog (especially in exchanges between Heinz and Sam Neill) that were written as critique of his treatment by the government of Poland. In many ways this film is an examination of the internal landscape of Zulawski at that moment; divorced from his wife and exiled by his beloved homeland. It's astoundingly dramatized because he was probably on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and these characters/actors are screamingly portraying every pent-up emotion he wasn't allowed to say about Poland to his fellow countrymen. I love this film. I love every gut wrenching, hysterical, chaotic minute of it. Long live Zulawski.",Possession
130,gallantentry,Artsy Horror,6,17 May 2017,"I have heard that this movie cannot be easily explained or made sense of, and yet I find it one of the easiest of all movies of this horror- genre to understand what the writer/director wanted to convey. The hurt; the rage; the jealousy; the monstrosity; the confusion; the violence of adultery in a graphic and painful movie. Every man believes his wife's adultery is a monstrosity that he believes all others cannot fully comprehend because the pain is often so deep and surreal. He sees his wife's actions as bewildering and confusing; as evil and archaic. The madness of unfaithfulness and the effects on the marriage. I have also read that the suicide of the boy at he end was a desperate attempt to give the audience one last shock, but I believe the writer is telling it's viewers that adultery has a traumatic effect on the children..one that should never be minimized. I don't believe even for a second that this movie was over-dramatized or acted. It was all intentional and deliberate. There is no sense to the victims of adultery, but only madness!",Possession
131,dimathanitis,Among the 100 best films,10,28 April 2006,"An extraordinary story that mixes reality and fantasy by a very talented director with a specific point of view. Sam Neil comes here in his first big roll that has never achieved to his career.Atzani is maybe also at her top point. Not to forget that she gained the Best Actress Prize in Cannes Festival. From small details, like the red stockings of the homosexual detective to the broken leg of the couple's friend (Margita Kirsternsen, Fassbinder's diva)the film doesn't hesitate to take any risk crashing all the clichés. Except the three main characters (Atzani in two parts) you can not forget persons like Atzani's lover and his dying old mother, or the two detectives. Among the 100 best films.",Possession
132,machinexd,Themes expressed in a worth experiencing way,9,24 November 2020,"This movie is a very metaphorical and sometimes complicated exploration of spirituality, morality and family structure.
Just as the title can be interpreted in many ways, the same can be said for many lines of dialogue or scenes. The acting is so good this movie has become a staple when it comes """"crazy"""" performances.
The whole movie has its very unique way of conveying ideas and themes that even if you're not a fan, in the end at least you'll keep thinking back to certain scenes.A film woth experiencing for the sheer uniqueness and one to think about for some time after viewing it. Although, if you're not into metaphor or the aforementioned topics you might not like it.",Possession

134,jtoubro,A masterpiece!,10,30 January 2002,"This has become my favorite movie, but only after watching it 5 times, and a 6th with the commentary of the great Zulawski. I believe this is the greatest movie ever, because it is completely flawless in its depiction of dysfunctional marriage, insanity, and ultimately the end of the world. Despite it being shot in 3 weeks, it is so tightly structured, beautifully shot, and marvellously acted, that at simply blows me away. I can only feel sorry for the people who have only seen the American version. Cutting a single frame from this movie would be a crime, and cutting 45 minutes is a sin.Another example of how the American movie censorships lack of understanding the art of cinema. Luckily the movie is now out on DVD,and any movie fan should pick this up.Possesion is simply a masterpiece!",Possession
135,Carlos Kasuski,Not a horror film but an artwork of highest level.,10,30 April 2002,"Possession was made 20 years ago and I am still surprised that people still think of it as a Horror film. Before all, this film is one of the most achieved and dramatic self explored results a director can put into the screen. The acting, the camera, the story and the power of image definitively take this picture far beyond than a simple Gender film. For me this is one of the most personal films of one of the  greatest 'Maestros' of modern cinema.",Possession
136,geckojoe08,There is really no way to summarize this film....,8,1 March 2011,"I enjoyed watching this film.I give this film an 8 out of ten stars? Why? Well, it all depends on the viewer. If you don't watch a lot of films, you will rate this one automatically low. If you watch a lot of films, then your mind will be open to more possibilities of what can happen in film. With that said,when the film starts, it may seem a bit confusing and random, but keep watching....it all goes together quite well. The directing, acting,setting, and mood are in place right from the start, so when other events start happening later on, it really hits you hard..... This is a type of film that you like or you don't like. There really is no room for middle ground is this one.....",Possession
137,jenniferofthejungle,A negative review from me,1,20 December 2004,"I wanted to like this movie because it was recommended to me by a friend, but the over the top performances and bad dialogue made it a horrible experience. Isabelle Adjani is hysterical in almost every scene and Sam Neill, who I have always thought of as a great actor, gives the worst performance I have ever seen from him. There is no character development and we are simply thrown into the middle of a marriage which is ending badly. We never learn anything about them or what their motives are. There is just a back and forth of screaming and pleading until you get tired of the whole film. There is comic relief from the guy who plays Heinrich and I don't know if it was intentional or not. His wigging out in the bathroom was very amusing. He was like a Zen-Gay-Kung-Fu-Loving Hannibal Lechter. The ending of the film was very confusing. It's not one I would recommend to anyone. The director's commentary is very entertaining. This review is for the 123 minute version.",Possession
138,anchitpandey,"Pathetic, Please don't waste you time on this",1,15 January 2012,"First of all I don't think that Possession is a horror film at all. simply pathetic, allegory is different I liked machinist because that made somewhat sense. But showing or using supernatural phenomena isn't artistic at all. Please don't waste your time in watching this, as director awfully presented real life events in an UN-realistic manner. I have read mixed reactions to Possession. Few liked it may be because they like movie without any link to reality, sorry did I use reality. Please excuse me as I shouldn't have used reality kinda words in review of this movie. :( God time is money and I have wasted that on this movie. feeling sad :(",Possession
139,anssi-karppinen,Distressing piece of art,9,24 October 2020,"Being tired of modern Hollywood and Netflix horrors, I started to watch this film with an open mind and optimism. And I got so much. This film crossed my expectations and somewhat restored my hope to good horror cinema. Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill showed their best, and especially Isabelle's performance was not from this planet. Cinematography included a few interesting shooting angles and long shots that I enjoyed. Some scenes were cut terribly to next scene, but to be honest, that's the only big minus that I can figure.Instead of underlining motives, this film gives a lot room for viewer's own interpretation which is refreshing and different in comparison to modern blockbuster films. To me this film again proves that the most horrifying elements of a good horror film are build on tragic relationships, not on the supernatural stuff, although this film might include some of that also.",Possession
140,webfix-532-741287,A Load Of Utter Boring RUBBISH!,1,11 March 2017,"I really cannot understand those who rate The Possession so highly. I have just watched it and have been utterly bored throughout. All you see is this couple screaming and shouting at each other, not to mention behaving rather oddly in other ways too. You would not think this was meant to be a ""horror"" movie; more like a tedious, slow, borefest.",Possession

I'm nigh on certain that this inbred arse farmer's dentures were giving me the come on.Anyway, I watched this garbage under the ill-advised supervision of a one-eyed fruit bat and last weeks issue of 'By-Jingo he's got a big Clock' monthly expecting something of a European master class in high gear filth. What i received was in fact a bile infested self-indulgent crap bonanza of the highest order.The direction stank like the ratatouie at my girlfriends sisters' last tupperware party, musky and familiar, whilst the script itself could have been written by some dole reaping cudgehole who's not left the confinements of his house for 10 years, drawn all the curtains and jerked off to all the naughty bits from Dario Argento's back catalogue.Suffice to say I'd sooner lick the inside leg of someone who's just completed a 50 mile run than have to sit through another minute of this dire horse-abortion of a film.",Possession
142,swiatwylazlzforemki,excellent!,10,4 January 2006,"hi, it's my first comment :) I am proud that such an excellent film was made by my countryman, because I am Polish, as well as Żuławski. In my opinion ""Possession"" contains such elements, which make from it an almost ideal work. It's atmosphere is really unique ad the role of Isabelle Adjani is something different than usual theatrical art. Her role is something more, something, which cannot do any other actors. She has proved that she is a rel genius. I know that ""Possession"" is a very strange film and for some of you, it may be something completely abnormal. But I was strongly impressed by it and all it's components. Although, I am unable not to say that it is worth seeing.",Possession
143,ampus75,visceral allegory,8,27 May 2006,"This one has to be seen twice. Once on a visceral - I can't believe what I'm seeing sitting on the edge of your seat with your mouth open -level. The second time on an intellectual - aha I think get some of the allegory but it still kinda doesn't add up - level. All in all, you haven't quite seen acting until you've seen Isabelle Adjani breaking apart, or rather, literally, oozing apart, in a subway tunnel. Linda Blair's got nothing on her. Speaking of oozing, the camera-work is simply unbelievable. The uninterrupted shot of the drunken Heinrich spinning around in the stairway is choreographed in a way that makes the camera seem immaterial.",Possession

145,gabrieltonka,best movie ever,10,17 January 2006,"i saw this movie in 1981, on its first release in the UK. a newspaper review claiming that possession was the death of cinema attracted me to the film. the utterly bemused faces of the audience, struck dumb by the absurdist, expressionist visual feast they had witnessed was looked upon knowingly by the cinema staff. a week later the film closed. i was at every London screening for the next 10 years. it has been wonderful to see this film's gradual acceptance by the critical under-establishment. contemporary critics would call the film valueless, except as weird travelogue and technical tour-de-force. i always consider ""top tens"" as pretty facile exercises, however this film surpasses and bypasses stereotypical classification. IT IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE..",Possession
