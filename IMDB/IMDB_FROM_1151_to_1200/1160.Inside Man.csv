0,Leofwine_draca,Far too clever for its own good,5,5 August 2016,"INSIDE MAN is one of those clever-clever thrillers in which things aren't as they seem, people aren't who they make out to be and everything's layered in cloying, murky conspiracy that leaves you unsure of just what, exactly, is going on. At its heart it's a simple tale of a bank robbery but, as in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, things are far from simple. The villains' motives are never revealed and it leaves you wondering who the real villains are after all.Now, I'm all for a head-scratching thriller – I've seen and enjoyed enough of them – and while I liked this film on the strength of the actors alone, I can't help but acknowledge that it's deeply flawed. One of the main negatives about it is Spike Lee, whose 'urban' style of direction is at odds with the film's premise and plot. He can't help but throw in many flashy scenes and moments of over-direction that scream ""look at me"" and subtract from the realism, as they keep taking you out of the movie. Lee should have stayed in the background, choreographing his actors and scenes and not getting in the way like he does here.It's also weird that he has this whole '70s throwback going on, a kind of nudge-nudge type aspect wherein Denzil Washington's detective feels like KOJAK. The unusual Bollywood-style opening music is point in itself. It's like Lee is trying so hard to be 'edgy' and different and he ends up with just another thriller that thinks its cleverer than it really is. It's also half an hour longer than it ought to be, and with little action to recommend it it frequently veers towards boring. In fact, it's only the cast that keeps it entertaining: Washington excels as the laid back detective, a role he could play in his sleep by now. Thankfully he doesn't sleepwalk through it, instead creating a likable character. He's ably supported by newcomer Chiwetel Ejifor as his partner, absolutely great in an understated role. Long-time acting heavyweights Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe do well on the sidelines, but I absolutely couldn't stand Jodie Foster here; just one of those roles where you want to slap the character. As for Clive Owen, he's good, but hidden beneath a disguise for much of the movie so left out in the cold a bit.It's not a bad film and it's one that kept me watching to see what happened, but in the end I was left feeling that nothing much happened after all. It's a long way from classics like THE NEGOTIATOR and the aforementioned DOG DAY AFTERNOON but it's worth a look for thriller fans.",Inside Man
1,SnoopyStyle,Spike Lee puts together A-list cast,6,16 June 2014,"Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) talks about a perfect bank robbery from what looks like a prison cell. Police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), still in the dog house for something, is given the bank robbery. Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is his partner. There are hostages. The bank president Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) has something important in a safe deposit box. He brings in fixer Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe) is the uniform cop in charge of the crime scene. The robbers seem more interested in the storage room than the bank vault or the deposit boxes.Director Spike Lee is making a stylized robbery. It's wall to wall A-list stars. That's actually distracting to have so many stars scattered in one movie. It takes away from any realism that Spike wants to inject into this movie. Also everything Spike does here is pointing to a surprise reveal. There is teasing, but this is over teasing. Everything is a mystery. Wink! Wink! Again it takes away from any realism. The mysteries are compelling for awhile but it gets tiresome. The reveals are the biggest aspects of this movie. It's a shocking reveal and the jolt is quite enjoyable. But the more one thinks about it, the more problematic it gets. I have questions about the investigation. I have questions about the scheme. The cops should have used a re-enactment to place everybody in their spot. There is also video of the customers before the robbery. The investigation should be able to narrow the suspects much better. Then they should have tailed the suspects. I have questions that don't get answered.",Inside Man
2,Hitchcoc,Just a Tad Smug!,7,9 March 2010,"This is a decent but not particularly memorable movie. I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, ""Isn't there an easier way?"" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that ""get me a plane and a million dollars"" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.",Inside Man
3,boblipton,I Keep Six Honest Servingmen,9,13 November 2020,"Clive Owen is in the middle of a perfect bank robbery on Wall Street. Denzell Washington is the cop in charge, and the bank's owner, Christopher Plummer, wants something in a safe deposit box safeguarded. He calls fixer Jodie Foster, and she calls in a lot of favors for a private talk with Owen.It's a riddle wrapped within an enigma within a caper film. Once upon a time, director King Vidor said he made one for the studio, and they let him make one for himself. This movie was made by director Spike Lee for the studio, and it's a beauty: not only is the story compelling, its character ambiguities a constant compelling series of mysteries that keep you watching. He's directing a great cast, and set them doing their work, each very competent, each tugging and pulling the movie in his or her own direction. It's a structure like Fred Zinneman's version of THE DAY OF THE JACKAL.... except that in that movie, you knew DeGaulle was not going to get shot. In this one, you don't even know that.",Inside Man
4,claudio_carvalho,The Deception of the Year,6,9 December 2006,"It is amazing how a cast with names such as Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, directed by the great Spike Lee and with a high-budget can ruin due to an awful flawed screenplay. I wasted my money buying this DVD with a great expectation of a terrific movie, but I found it terrible and boring actually. I would like to leave just one question: Why Mr. Arthur Case, magnificently played by Christopher Plummer, kept such evidences that could destroy his successful life for almost sixty years in a safe? The whole story spins around this ridiculous situation. If you want to see a film of heist, prefer to watch again ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or even ""Heist"", but do not spend your time or money with ""Inside Man"". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Plano Perfeito"" (""The Perfect Plan"")",Inside Man
5,kosmasp,"Nothing really new in this heist flick, but ...",8,25 April 2007,"... it's really well done. If you see the movie, you might have guessed what this movie is aiming for (because you've seen similar heist movies), but still you will be amazed by this film! And that is a credit to all involved (starting from the scriptwriter, to the producers, director and cast).Although I have to say that I don't think you can guess, where this movie is going to go 100%. But it's cut and pasted together in a manner, that will make multiple views of the film more than enjoyable. So you might not understand what is going on, when you see a flash""forward"" (as opposed to a flashback, but I just created that word, I don't think it exists), but you will get there sooner than later. Because Spike Lee knows that the audience is not stupid, he partly gives away the ending ... It's right there in front of you, so that the subplot becomes more relevant ... you will see!",Inside Man
6,classicsoncall,"""We never leave until the job is done.""",8,28 March 2006,"As an action adventure, Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" delivers the goods with a mysterious bank heist that has more at it's center than meets the eye. You realize there's something a bit different about Clive Owen's character Dalton, allowing hostages to go free at points in the film when it serves his unique purpose. For his part, Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) comes across a few dots that refuse to connect, and can't get over the feeling that this is a bank heist that's not a bank heist.For me, the mark of a good actor or actress is how they make you feel about the character they're portraying. In that regard, I was fairly repulsed by the smarmy brashness and curt innuendo of Jody Foster's Madeline White character. Her performance was masterful as a behind the scenes power broker, known by reputation and called personally by the president of the bank under siege. She can read between the lines as well as anyone, and you don't quite believe it when she says she won't do anything illegal to earn her payday.It occurred to me as I did the math that we're quickly coming to a time when real time stories with themes from World War II are nearly at an end. Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) would have to be about eighty five for his character to make sense, so one wonders why he might have kept the reminders of his Nazi connections in a safe deposit box of his bank for over sixty years. Of course without it there's no story, so an appropriate grain of salt is necessary here.""Inside Man"" is the kind of film that begs for a repeat viewing that allows one to now concentrate on the character relationships that the first time might have seemed unimportant or unconnected. In particular, there are some head scratching scenes offered that seem to suggest ""what might happen"" if the police storm the bank, with one shot zeroing in on a blood splattered lock box 392. At that point in time, detective Frazier still didn't know what was at the core of the caper.I've read some of the posts that take the movie to task for lack of back story and the unknown background and motivation of the Owens and Foster characters. I can live with that in a film that already takes a couple of hours to tell it's story. The action is intense when it needs to be, and demands your attention to keep up with key elements. The film winds up being just clever enough to be exciting and entertaining, and there are times when that's good enough for me.",Inside Man
7,lee_eisenberg,I finally know how to pronounce Enver Hoxha's last name.,8,3 September 2006,"Some people say that Spike Lee is overrated as a director, but I beg to differ. ""Inside Man"" proves what a good director he is (and I've heard that his recent documentary about Hurricane Katrina is also worth seeing). ""Inside Man"" begins with criminal Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) mysteriously describing a bank robbery. After a few minutes, we get to see the bank robbery: Dalton and his friends dress as decorators, lock the doors, and pull out their guns. Within a few minutes, the robbery is the biggest news in the city, with Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) called in to try and negotiate.Ah, but this is no ordinary robbery. You see, these bank robbers aren't after what we think. And as Madeline White (Jodie Foster) learns, the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer) has in the bank a little something that no one's supposed to know about - so he can't report it if it gets stolen.This is probably one of the tautest bank robbery movies that I've ever seen. Aside from the tense scenes of hostage-taking, there's the problems entailing the people outside the bank. In this movie, no one is really what s/he seems. It's the sort of movie that makes one wonder just how much we really know about anyone, even our closest friends and confidants. Definitely a movie that I recommend. Also starring Willem Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Oh, and one more thing: I can take pride in being probably one of the few people who knew about Enver Hoxha before seeing ""Inside Man"". It was just that I learned here how to pronounce his surname.",Inside Man
8,ccthemovieman-1,Great Acting Highlights This Heist Flick,8,4 December 2006,"Here's another heist-with a negotiator story but done with a different angle and with a few twists. Among the ""twists"" are (1) a bank president who hires someone to try to get something NOT robbed out of his band during the heist, evidence that could destroy his status and career, and (2) the crooks all get away with the mastermind of group hiding in the bank for a week before slipping away in broad daylight. That last part leads me to ask a few questions about that could possibly happen, specifically how get could get out of the vault where he was hidden without all kinds of alarms going off, etc.Nevertheless, credibility-aside, its an interesting two hours of entertainment, sort of a modern-day Dog Day Afternoon film. (In fact, DDA is mentioned in the movie.)The four lead actors in this film are all quite diverse: a veteran cop.negotiator (""Det. Keith Frazier"" (Denzel Washington), the main crook ""Dalton Russell"" (Clive Owen), the bank president ""Arthur Case"" (Christopher Plummer) and the professional business woman he hires ""Madeline White"" (Jodie Foster.) All of them are fascinating, thanks in large part to the fact they are all outstanding actors to begin with. Unlike most people, I particularly enjoyed Foster playing such a controlled, low-key character and the same could be said about another top actor in here I almost forgot about: Willem DaFoe as ""Captain John Darius."" The more I think about it, the actors here are just as fascinating as the story, if not more so. I am sure it will be them, not the story, that drives me back for more viewings.",Inside Man
9,rmax304823,Surprising bank heist flick from Spike Lee,7,9 April 2007,"I missed the first 20 minutes or so of this film so that may have contributed to my inability to follow some details of the plot. I get the impression, though, that it was pretty complicated to begin with. And there seems to have been some elisions here and there. (What, exactly, is the significance of the diamond ring?) Basically, a gang of thieves takes over a bank and holds hostages. It is to be ""the perfect bank robbery."" When you hear a phrase like that, used in all seriousness, you must cringe.As it turns out, however, it's not really a robbery at all but rather a scheme to expose the bank's founder and owner for the money-grubbing opportunistic scoundrel he was when he played footsies with the Nazis in order to come into possession of some valuables taken from victims of the genocide. The robbers escape without detection and the lead detective (Denzel Washington) alerts the mayor of New York to the nefarious history of the bank's founder (Christopher Plummer).Lee has more smoothly integrated white folks and African-Americans than in some of his earlier movies. And he has turned the police into good guys for a change. To be sure, when all of the hostages are released and come storming out the bank's front door screaming, ""Don't shoot! Don't shoot!"", and the officer-in-charge (Willem DaFoe) shouts ""Stand down!"" into his radio, the assembled cops open fire for a minute or two anyway. Firing into the crowd, they MUST be hitting people and yet no one is hurt or killed. I suppose this is related to an earlier suggestion by DaFoe that they use rubber bullets, even though this is never made clear.But then a lot of the story takes unexpected twists and seems jagged, the way life is, rather than the way movies are. ""He won't execute any of the hostages,"" Washington announces firmly, ""because he's not the type."" Next scene, we see the principal heavy shoot a hostage in the head. And when offered a promotion as part of a deal to cover up the bank owner's scandalous past, Washington seriously considers it. Everybody else is going to get something out of it and he might as well get his.The performances are uniformly good, as they generally are under Spike Lee's direction. And Lee has an impeccable eye for camera placement and movement. He uses one or two extremely effective overhead shots and is given to angles that turn individuals into masses. Jody Foster, in a relatively small part, gives her most confident performance in years. Clive Owen as the gang leader is a paragon of tranquility throughout, but he has evidently been told to keep his eyes wide open and never blink, a tired cliché.The villain of the piece is Christopher Plummer, head of a bank, filthy rich, and white. And yet even his crimes are mitigated, though not excused. He has insight. ""I sold my soul to the devil,"" he says, ""and I've spent my life trying to buy it back."" He's turned philanthropist in his later years and has gone about doing good, as John D. Rockefeller did.In ""Do the Right Thing,"" Lee's DP was Ernest R. Dickerson and he did a splendid job except for a few lapses. He seems to have been caught up in current trends and lost sight of his responsibility to the viewer. Most of the movie is shot in darkness with neon-blue highlights. The images are so high in contrast that in the interrogation room they turn almost black and white. He uses a ""Vertigo"" zoom twice, without point, and he succumbs in one shot to the loathsome current fad of strapping the camera to the front of the actor, so that the images are jerky and disorienting. The script could have been nothing more than another genre piece, an imitation ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Instead it's a rather different take on a rather old idea.Worth seeing.",Inside Man
10,Tweekums,A rather unusual bank robbery,9,20 June 2012,"As the film opens we see a man in what appears to be a cell; explains to us that his name is Dalton Russell and he has just executed the perfect bank robbery. Immediately questions are raised; most importantly being; if it was the perfect robbery why is he in a cell? The action then jumps back to the start of the robbery; a small group of robbers all identically dressed with masks and hoods enter the bank and disable the cameras, chain the doors, toss a few smoke grenades and take the employees and customers hostage. A passing cop notices the smoke and starts to call in that he suspects as robbery is taking place; before he can finish the call an armed man emerges and tells him hostages will start dying if the police attempt to enter the bank. Back inside the robbers confiscate all phones and keys before ordering everybody to undress and change into clothes identical to the ones they are wearing. Inevitably the police turn up in force and set up a command centre; although he is not the senior officer Detective Keith Frazier takes charge as he is the hostage negotiator. He waits for their demands and eventually they receive the cliché demand of buses to the airport and a fuelled jet... a little disappointing perhaps but may be the robbers just want to buy time to do what they really want to do. While Det. Frazer tries to figure out what they really want the bank's owner and founder, Arthur Case, brings in a specialist, Madeleine White, to ensure that whatever happens neither the robbers nor the authorities learn the contents of one safety deposit box inside the vault... the box the robbers when straight to.Before watching this all I knew about the film was that it was a heist film with 'more twists than a Chubby Checker record'; but as nearly everything has to have a twist these days I thought it would be a typical heist film. Thankfully it was far more interesting than that; I was grabbed in the opening scenes and was constantly wondering just how it would end. While some twists weren't shocking the final, most important one was. The acting from all the leads; Denzel Washington, as Frazer; Clive Owen, as Russell; Jodie Foster, as White and Christopher Plummer as Case put in top notch performances and were able supported by the likes of Willem Defoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The scenes in the bank were not surprisingly the most interesting; seeing how the robbers not only kept the hostages confused but even managed to convince enough of the hostages that they were fellow hostages for it to be impossible for them to be identified when everybody eventually left the building. Director Spike Lee did a fine job keeping the story going and introduced the various twists in ways that didn't seem forced even in the rather amusing situation where detectives discover just who they are listening to on their bugs. If you want a good solid crime thriller with genuinely surprising twists this is well worth checking out.",Inside Man
11,ma-cortes,Caper film with a very exciting storyline and surprising ending,7,15 May 2006,"A carefully and neatly perfect crime about a bank robbery goes awry when a band (leader of the gang is Clive Owen)abducts and takes hostages to people of building interior. A Police Inspector(Denzel Washington)must save at whatever cost the hostages bank what's suddenly under siege and itself surrounded of heavily super-armed polices .The robbers have sworn kill if they attack.Psychosis and paranoia abound between the prisoners from all sides and they can see no way out and someone making desperate tryings to flee.Clive Owen as the mastermind,executes an intelligent scheme is both exciting and thrilling although with a twisted finale.Film packs maximum tension,emotion,thriller and surprise from the subsequents attempts by the policemen to enter in the bank. This movie is a crowd-pleasing blend of intrigue,tense,action packed and fast movement .It's a good production values with several stars and a clever twist ending. Great producer Brian Grazer assembled a highly talented international cast(Denzel,Owen,Jodie Foster,Christopher Plummer).The casting is absolutely perfect tough Clive Owen is mostly hidden into a hood. Crisp acting by Denzel Washington who plays a policeman making a first rate interpretation.Magnificent cinematography by Matthew Libatique.Memorable score by Terence Blanchard,he is Spike Lee's habitual films. Taut direction makes this splendid caper a crackerjack entertainment. Spike lee's realization is razor sharp.This is one of the finest last years of the big heist genre and much better than Ocean's eleven,Ocean's twelve and Italian job. Rating : Above average and well worth watching.",Inside Man
12,BA_Harrison,Washington makes it watchable.,7,10 February 2007,"It is to the credit of both director Spike Lee and star Denzil Washington that Inside Man, a rather routine heist story with some glaring plot holes, becomes eminently watchable thanks to their involvement. Washington turns in yet another credible and likable performance whilst Lee displays great control of the whole convoluted affair, with some impressive cinematography and nice use of non-linear storytelling.Denzil plays Keith Frazier, a detective called in to act as negotiator when a bank robbery turns into a hostage situation. However, when the gang of thieves make some peculiar decisions, and a mysterious woman (ably played by Jodie Foster) is given power by the mayor to intervene in negotiations, it soon becomes apparent to Frazier that this is not a typical heist gone wrong.As the story unfolds, we discover that the crooks are after a cache of diamonds, hidden in the vault by the bank's unscrupulous elderly owner (who co-operated with the Nazis during WW2 and received the jewels in return). It is Foster's job to ensure that the proof of the man's secret past, a Nazi document also kept in the vault, doesn't fall into the wrong hands.With Lee's confident direction and solid performances from all involved, I found it fairly easy to ignore the questionable elements of the script (such as why the owner of the bank didn't just destroy the damning evidence of his collaboration with the Nazi's, and exactly how the thieves managed to devise such a foolproof plan).Throw in some particularly funny lines (Denzil's quip about 'Jamal and Jesus' is priceless!), and what you have is an enjoyable, if somewhat flawed, crime drama that packs enough star power and delivers enough action to make it worth seeing.",Inside Man
13,moonspinner55,This bank robber is gonna walk right out the door...when he's good 'n ready,8,28 November 2009,"In a prosperous Manhattan bank in broad daylight, a group of thugs dressed like painters walk in and take control of the building--but what they're after is another story altogether. When a movie-watching audience invests their faith in a good filmmaker, such as Spike Lee is here, you can almost feel the giddy anticipation rising up in the theater; you know this picture is going to be a satisfying adventure because you implicitly trust where the director is taking you. Aside from several fast-forwards in time (which are confusing at first) and a let's-just-say sequence (visualized for us) wherein the police discuss storming the building, this is a twisty, marvelously absorbing cops-and-crooks thriller with fantastic characters. Denzel Washington plays the lead detective, his head already on the block from a former case, trying to decipher what these ""bank robbers"" actually want (at one point saying to the leader, ""You don't want a plane! You saw ""Dog Day Afternoon""...you're stalling!""); Clive Owen is the intensely focused gang leader; Christopher Plummer is the bank's wealthy owner who has a ""special interest"" in one of the safe deposit boxes; and Jodie Foster is the flirtatious, unscrupulous negotiator helping Plummer get what he wants. Perhaps some of the intricate details don't bear close scrutiny, however the set-up and follow-through are both marvelous. Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz should work with Spike Lee more often--together they make an unbeatable combination. ***1/2 from ****",Inside Man
14,blanche-2,Excellent and absorbing,8,23 November 2008,"""Inside Man"" is a wonderful Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. It's about a bank robbery planned by Owen that turns out to be something very clever and very different. Washington plays a police detective under investigation for missing money who, knowing he's innocent, wants to prove himself and get to detective first grade. He and his partner investigate this bank robbery, which has 50 hostages, all who have been given outfits and masks so that they're dressed like the robbers. Therefore, it's impossible to tell who the robbers are. It's also increasingly difficult, as Washington attempts to negotiate with them, to tell what it is they're after. When Foster, a high-level negotiator hired by the bank owner (Plummer) enters the scene, Washington knows something much bigger than money is involved.Really excellent movie with twists and turns combined with humor and some really scary scenes. My only complaint is that Clive Owen is a bad choice to play someone who spends most of the movie in a mask. It's too frustrating to have someone that good-looking covered up.",Inside Man
15,Quinoa1984,"goes a little long not knowing when to end, but it is a genuinely clever crowd pleaser",8,27 March 2006,"Inside Man has the appeal of a slick, cool, not-too-old used car. You know certain things will definitely be there, but you also are hoping some things might be surprising. Spike Lee isn't doing an incredible subversion of the heist picture, particularly the bank-heist picture, but he is putting his mark on it, and this split between common Hollywood stylistics and a personal vision make it a fine little piece of studio film-making. There's also a story at work here, one that does develop the ensemble (mostly of hostages, and cops, and others), while also developing in a way that, at the least, isn't too boring. There may be a lot of elements going on in the film surrounding this bank robbery, and its questionable if the focus isn't on one thing the whole time. But if Lee can do one thing quite well, it's making sure the pieces fit, most of the time.His cast is all top-notch, with his on/off again acting collaborator Denzel Washington in his smart, always interesting form as the hostage negotiator. He's up against Clive Owen's Don, head of a few really well-planned (he calls it the ""perfect bank robbery"") robbers, who've taken a heap of people hostage. Owen, to me, has one of his better performances, not an easy feat being under a mask and glasses through most of his role, but his voice (as usual deep and brooding in his English way) is dead-on and threatening. There's also Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer as the 'special interests' looking out for something that happens to be in a certain safety deposit box. If I'm being a little vague then its for the purpose of the viewer; this isn't a twist that just comes out of nowhere, and it could be argued to not even be a real 'twist'.One of the things that had me really attentive was knowing how the structure of the story would go after a while, the bits of general unpredictability of when a flash-forward (err, Denzel's interviews with the ex-hostages), and how it carried a similar lighting scheme to Lee's Clockers. It's a very good lighting set-up. And, like Scorsese with the Aviator, in this very prominent big-studio budget, Lee is able to put in little nods to the audience that this is still his 'joint'. Even if the screenwriter, Russel Gurwitz, doesn't have the focus always together, and after the climax there are a few too many exposition-type scenes, the last scene does give a nice grin to most in the audience. In fact, this is a terrific film to see in a packed theater, as I had the chance to have, as there are more than a few really funny moments interspersed with the more thrilling cat & mouse scenes. Inside Man plays on clichés in a way that reminds me of the Usual Suspects, and done in its own slick, used-car way that wont really break down, for most.",Inside Man
16,edwagreen,Inside Man-The Bank Robbery that Never Was? ***,7,23 August 2006,"The film starts off as another ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and for those of you who remember, ""Violent Saturday.""Yes, a bank is allegedly robbed and hostages are taken. Something is terribly wrong when the chief inspector, Denzel Washington, provokes the gang leader, Clive Owen to shoot one of the hostages. There is plenty of screaming and yelling by the shaken hostages. A Jewish woman refers to the gang as Mishagunim(crazies) when they tell the victims to undress. We have an assortment of people in the bank of all different ethnicities.Christopher Plummer is the bank's Board Executive who has a terrible dark secret hidden in one of the vaults. He sends in executive Jodie Foster to pay off the gang. They leave and the hostages are thrown to the ground and are forced on a bus by the police.We have a racist cop who would rather live to be an old aged bigot as compared to a young dead liberal and a Sikh bank employee who is harassed by the police when he is freed and a hint of the bank's collaboration with the Nazis during World War 11.The movie begins to falter once the hostages were released without incident and it is shown that the gang used fake guns, bullets and took no money whatsoever. What's going on here you ask? A good caper goes awry at the end.",Inside Man

This come from acclaimed director Spike Lee. Willem Dafoe,Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Plummer co-star to play key supporting roles.Dalton Russell is a bank robber with a difference. In his quest to execute the perfect heist, Dalton has taken every possible factor into consideration.

The bank president has requested the services of high-profile negotiator Madeline White. Despite her commendable track record, Madeline is something of a wild card, and before the day is over, this bank robbery will go down in history as one of the most elaborate heists ever executed. This energetic and clever bank-heist thriller touches on questions of race and class without taking away from the tension and fun of the cat- and-mouse games between a hostage negotiator, a bank robber, and a high- powered fixer. The film puts a spin on the Dog Day Afternoon scenario, with a group of sharp bank robbers who stay one step ahead of the police; it's a smart genre film that is not only rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings and it convoluted plot with wit and skill.",Inside Man

But nothing is as it seems, especially since ruthless ""fixer"" Madeleine White (Foster) shows up to broker a deal with the robbers on behalf of the bank's owner (Plummer).Spike Lee does a formulaic movie? Surely not? Well yes and no, the genre staples are adhered too but Lee stamps his own authority on proceedings. Where aided by a tricksy and well written script by first timer Gewirtz, he has crafted one of the best heist movies in the modern era. Propelled by a cast on excellent form, Inside Man always has a trick up its sleeve, while characters motivations and reasoning's are always sketchy, thus making the audience just as suspicious as Washington's driven detective is. With Lee choosing a choppy chronology process to unfurl the plot, this too helps to keep the nagging narrative question of ""what is going on?"" to consistently linger in the air. And with multiple characters ducking in and out of the story, it's a credit to Lee and Gewirtz that the film is neatly streamlined, it's never confusing and always gripping.How Lee moulds the character dynamics at play always holds the attention, be it the battle of wits between Washington & Owen, or the Foster and Plummer ask no questions axis, no frame or dialogue exchange is wasted. The director even manages to slip in a couple of statements of race related bother involving a Sikh and a copper who gets pulled up on his terminology. While an aside at violent video games sneakily slips in with ironic potency. For sure this is no ""Spike Lee message movie,"" but his awareness of the times, and particularly New York's denizens, never wanes. Blanchard provides some wonderful snatches of music, at times sounding very James Bondian, it adds a nice espionage like flavour into the New York melting pot. As for the ending? Well more like as for the series of reveals? It's cracker-jack time, no cop outs or reverting to type, it's a fitting finale to what has gone before it.It's not flawless, some little problems reside within, but they are not large ones. Though it is fair to say that if you are someone who makes a point of working things out as soon as possible? Then you are able to do so here, though I do think the makers aren't exactly hiding it, in fact we are dared to pay attention right from the off as Owen's mastermind looks us in the eye and tells us so. But small itches aside, this is darn entertaining stuff, a film that can raise the pulse and hold you in suspense, whilst also demanding you engage the brain as well. 8.5/10",Inside Man
20,jotix100,The insiders,8,29 May 2006,"Spike Lee achieves a great triumph in this studio sponsored film and shows why he is one of the best directors working today on his own, or in Hollywood. The film was written by Russell Gurwirth. The movie is hugely entertaining as Mr. Lee and Mr. Gurwirth take the viewer for a ride, that for all appearances involve what appears to be a bloody bank heist, but when all is said and done, it was something else, altogether.The first clue about what the ""Steves"", as the bank robbers call one another, are trying to do, is how easy they gain access to the place. When everything is set in motion, one expects the bandits to start eliminating the hostages, as one is accustomed to expect from other films of the genre. Right after the robbers stage the plan, the police is set in motion to keep the bad guys surrounded so they can't escape without being apprehended.The man who is on call when the news is learned is Det. Keith Frazier, a man who has had problems within the force. He is assisted by his fellow Det. Bill Mitchell. Although they are the ones in charge, another man, a Capt. Darius is the man who is monitoring the action from a van. Det. Frazier clashes with Capt. Darius, who has no clue about what the others are doing.It's at this time that the bank president, Arthur Case, an older man who is well connected comes to the powerful Madeline White to ask for her help in securing important documents that are in a safe deposit box in the vault of the bank. Madeline White uses her influence with the Mayor, to get permission to negotiate with the robbers. It's at this moment where our suspicions are confirmed about the nature of why the heist.Denzel Washington makes a great Det. Frazier. He is at the same time a man who uses his intuition to try to solve the case, without much success. Jodie Foster makes a valuable contribution as Madeline, a ruthless woman who knows a few secrets about her clients. Clive Owen doesn't have much to do. Christopher Plummer is Arthur Case, the man who thought he knew it all and whose past comes back to haunt him. William Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofer, are seen in minor roles.Ultimately, Spike Lee pulls all the strings in moving this story in ways only he could do. The viewer is in for a treat.",Inside Man

He has an Excellent Eye and Loves to do Camera Flourishes and Off Beat Montages. But When it Comes to Characters and Character Speak, He More Often than Not Strays Far from Realism and Ventures Into In-Your-Face Platitudes and Stereotypes.This is a Good Heist Movie with a Stellar Cast and Keeps You Mostly on the Edge of Your Seat, Until it Doesn't. The Ending is Weak and Unsatisfying, All the While Wallowing in its ""Cleverness"", Parading Itself Around with a ""Look at Me"" Glare that is About as Subtle as a Pole Stripper.But Getting to the End is the Fun, and Lee is Patient Getting You There, Filling the Film with His Typically Heavy Handed Social and Political Commentary. There are the Usual Suspects, Like Racist Cops, Fat Cat Followers of Satan, the Nazis, the Jews, and the Most Overused Spike Lee Target, White People. He Just Can't Help Himself.Overall, Not a Bad Time Waster but a Let Down in the End. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington Fans will be Kinder than Most.

22,CinemaSerf,More complex than your average cops and robbers film...,7,17 November 2019,"As heist films go, this isn't at all bad. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington keep the drama going and although quite few, the twists do keep you guessing. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer appear sparingly, but they contribute quite substantially to the rather more evil and interesting sub-plot. This movie touches upon social and religious mores a little, though I wouldn't say this was Lee at his most political - and this all adds to an enjoyable multi-layered story.

The throwback half-way through to MARATHON MAN (1976) territory is unexpected and not totally convincing, however, especially since Clive Owen's real motives are kept from the spectator. There's the occasional caper/police procedural cliché, too, to be sure - but, overall, the film manages to work around them in clever and original ways. Also, while the film deals with Washington's family life from time to time, it's mercifully left in the background and doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Lee's direction is needlessly flashy at times, but one can't really blame him for playing the Hollywood game when given a big budget and a specific genre to work in.",Inside Man
24,lastliberal,C'mon! You've seen Dog Day Afternoon! You're stalling!,6,18 May 2007,"This is a great caper film. You are kept guessing throughout the entirety of this movie.

Did it fail or not? Will they get away? Is it the perfect crime? You just have to tune in to find out. Brilliant.Spike Lee gave us a great film that is a departure from his usual fare. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen were absolutely on target with their performances. It is all low key and methodical.

That is a shame.",Inside Man
25,zardoz-13,Be Prepared For Lots of Surprises!,9,23 September 2007,"""Inside Man"" qualifies as the slickest movie that ""Do The Right Thing"" director Spike Lee has ever made. A criminal mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen of ""Sin City"") and his cohorts masquerade as painters, enter a Manhattan bank during business hours, take hostages,force their hostages to strip to their underwear and then make don the same outfits that Dalton and his crew are wearing. Meanwhile, a cop on the beat sends out the alarm when he notices something suspicious at the bank and the N.Y.P.D. surround the building. N.Y.P.D. Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe of ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"") deploys his army of blue uniforms and erects a command post not far from the front door. Detective Keith Frazier (a bald-headed Denzel Washington of ""Mo Better Blues"") is surprised when his boss sends him in to serve as the hostage negotiator. It seems that the regular hostage negotiator is on vacation, so Frazierwho is under suspicion for a missing cache of lootgets the assignment. Meanwhile, the man who built the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer of ""The Sound of Music""), hires a go-between, cold-as-ice Madeleine White (Jodie Foster of ""Taxi Driver""), to protect his interests, particularly the contents of safe deposit box number 392. Ms. White persuades the mayor to let her enter the bank and chat with Dalton about his options.Initially, ""Inside Man"" shapes up to be a top-notch, perfect heist thriller, but it isn't what it appears. At least, Dalton and his people are not out to rob the bank in terms of money. Instead, they set out to expose the chairman of the board of directors of the bank, Mr. Case, who has a deadly secret that he wants to keep from the public. Namely, Mr. Case had some suspicious dealings with the Nazis involving Holocaust victims. Call it a cold case that turns red hot before fadeout. ""Inside Man"" puts Spike Lee into distinctly different surroundings. This is a big movie with logistics, not Spike's usual small production with a straight-forward agenda. He spends more time throwing red herrings at us than taking us through the permutations of a hostage negotiation thriller. ""Blind Justice"" TV scenarist Russell Gerwirtz has constructed a thriller with a labyrinth. Not unsurprisingly, the principals pay homage to director Sidney Lument's hostage thriller ""Dog Day Afternoon"" when Dalton and Frazier talk about getting buses to transport his hostages and crew to the airport. Neither Lee nor Gerwirtz set aside much time for character development, aside from Det. Frazier's pursuit of a promotion, his relationship with his yearning for marriage girlfriend, and the mystery of the missing money from a previous assignment. The Jodie Foster character is as anonymous as Clive Owen's Dalton Russell. ""Inside Man"" is the kind of movie where you have no idea what is going on the entire time until the ending, which is pretty clever but not as satisfying as you might have expected given the set-up.The film benefits from first-rate photography, editing,and surroundings, but Terence Blanchard's orchestral score is very overbearing and intrusive at times. The structure of the action is uncomfortable as Lee and Gerwirtz splice in scenes of Frazier interrogating hostages released from the bank during the situation. Be prepared for lots of surprises. This is Spike Lee's best movie in terms of a big Hollywood production since ""Do The Right Thing."" He brings up racism only in minor scenes. The only other complaint is that--along with those interrogation scenes that interrupt the flow of the action, ""Inside Man"" could have been about 10 minutes leaner without losing any of its considerable punch.",Inside Man
26,grantss,"Okay, but had the potential to be brilliant",6,26 December 2019,"A gang holds up a bank, takes hostages and is trapped inside the bank by police. A police hostage negotiator arrives and takes charge but the gang don't seem to be following the usual playbook. Even more mysteriously, the chairman of the bank has hired his own negotiator.Intriguing and riveting...initially. The movie was set up to be a great heist drama, with a large dose of mystery thrown in. I was looking forward to see the course of events unfold and the puzzle be solved (or, even better, figure it out myself).Unfortunately, the level of intrigue and uncertainty reduces almost immediately as we have flash-forwards that give away elements of the outcome of the bank siege. From a point you can see how the siege is going to pan out.The bank chairman / private negotiator aspect, something which I initially thought was unnecessary and just detracted from the main story, becomes more important and adds intrigue, but it also serves to muddy the plot somewhat. More disappointingly, this sub-plot becomes the main plot and results in a unsatisfactory, smug, moralising conclusion.Overall, interesting enough but also quite disappointing as it could have been so much better.",Inside Man
27,Boba_Fett1138,Having a twist at the end does't automatically mean the movie as a whole is clever or well written.,6,3 September 2006,"All that praise for this movie...while it in my opinion is nothing more than a simple written but very well directed heist movie which cast and style still make this an entertaining enough and certainly watchable movie. It however is a movie with a tad more misses than hits really.Main problem for me was the story. Over and over again it is told in the movie that this is the perfect bank robbery. Quite frankly I really don't see back in the movie why exactly the plan is such a brilliant one. Also the twist at the end left me cold and it was far from satisfying for me. I found the story to be simple and formulaic written. The movie tried to make itself seem more complex and clever but putting some non-linear story lines in the movie but its all not enough to make the story seem more interesting or any more clever. Spike Lee's directing however certainly spiced things up and manged to give the movie still some flair and an excellent 'cool' atmosphere. Nevertheless the movie and its story just didn't hit me as clever, surprising or perfectly solidly written, which made the movie as a whole to me a bit simple although it certainly still was perfectly entertaining to watch.""Inside Man"" isn't really a movie that allows itself to be put in a corner. It's hard to classify this movie as to what genre it is. As a thriller it isn't tense enough and as a crime movie it isn't clever and tough enough. For most part the movie is mostly entertaining to watch but than again at the same time the movie tries to handle some more serious and delicate matters. Best example of this are of course the racial and discriminating issues, a returning element in Spike Lee movies. The moments felt forced, out of place and totally unneeded. Because this movie doesn't really fit in a genre its hard to known how and with what approach or distance to watch this movie.The cast is impressive, perhaps a bit too. Denzel Washington is perfectly in his element, as yet again a police detective. He seems to be getting with every movie I see him in. Clive Owen isn't as impressive but he is a good actor and he plays his role convincing and 'cool' enough. The movie also has Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer in it but it makes you wonder why. Their roles are small and don't seem significant enough, even though they play an important part in the story. This is mainly because their screen time is too limited and it feels like a huge waste of talent. Jodie Foster normally picks her roles very carefully and it makes me wonder why she ever agreed to be in this movie. Willem Dafoe on the other hand again is a perfect, pleasant and most welcome addition to the star-filled cast.This movie still shows that Spike Lee is a great talented director with a nose for the business. This unfortunately in this case only shows in its style. The movie has some great executed- and almost artistically style-full sequences. It to me was the only reason why this movie still was a good- and entertaining enough movie to watch, for the story and its character left me cold mostly.Simple entertainment. Style-full but not solid.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Inside Man
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Somehow simultaneously glued to my seat and laughing it off,8,18 May 2013,"When a bank is expertly being robbed by four people led by Dalton(Owen, lending tremendous personality, using primarily his voice, his face covered 80% of his screen-time... not to mention that we sympathize with him, in spite of us seeing him terrify hostages), not all seems right. Detective Frazier(Washington, a man of principle, and one whose wits may just match those of the aforementioned law-breaker) is trying to figure out what and deal with the dozens of innocents trapped inside. Meanwhile, White(Foster, utterly nailing the role of an ice queen who gets results) uses considerable pull to try to ensure at least part of the outcome.New York, and its both ethnically diverse and racist people, come alive with the slang, the different types, the many small character moments - the frustration(not fear or empathy!) of their day being put on hold by a nearby negotiation with armed perps. Everyone is credible, and the tight writing leaves little to be desired. Dialog is quotable, poignant, and often hilarious - the comedy in this is disarming, mixed in well with the ever-present threat(did I mention that the hold-up begins right out of the opening credits?).This is tense(especially with cutting away from the scene we desperately want to see the next part of!), with several sudden bursts of violence(a little of it bloody, hardly ever graphic), as it builds and you wonder what's actually going on. It keeps you guessing, and the twists all work out and come together - not only that, but(unlike Minority Report, which I recently rewatched), you can actually keep track of what's going on. Everyone is driven by self-interest, and feel like real people, no one is just a stereotype(positive or negative). The acting is great or better; our trio of leads are incredible.There is a lot of strong language(some sexually suggestive) in this. The DVD comes with trailers for Jarhead, King Kong(the 2005 one) and United 93. I recommend this to any fan of heist thrillers. 8/10",Inside Man

High concept bank robbery melodrama from filmmaker Spike Lee seems like a departure but really is a half-baked homage to one of his favorite '70s films, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", with an under-investigation NYC police detective (Washington having a ball) assigned to a Wall St. area bank robbery led by no-nonsense Owen who may or may not have something up his sleeve in perfecting the perfect crime. Foster's mysterious woman who gets things done via the most unusual negotiations is a neat wrinkle to an otherwise simplistic and overwrought screenplay by novice scribe Russell Gewirtz yet the on location settings add authenticity to how New Yorkers take their crime seriously.",Inside Man
30,view_and_review,Probably Spike Lee's Best,7,12 April 2006,"Inside Man definitely was a well thought out piece of work. This was no obvious, dumbed down crime mystery. The movie as well as the bank robbery the movie was about was near genius. The acting was excellent as can be expected from Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, but Clive Owen was not to be outdone either. This movie held my attention every step of the way. I didn't want to miss a word, a clue, a single gesture so as not to be left behind. I was thinking about the movie and discussing it well after it was over; the tell-tell sign of a good movie.Spike Lee did an excellent job with this one. In fact, minus a few Spike Lee-isms, I would not have guessed that he was the director. He did throw in the gratuitous person-moving-on-a-trolley to simulate walking, and he also had music that didn't seem to quite fit in certain scenes. Those two minutiae were all that separated this move from brilliance.",Inside Man
31,ferguson-6,Therein Lies the Rub,6,24 March 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" will forever be the film in which all bank heist/hostage negotiation movies will be compared. ""DDA"" featured a brilliant and mesmerizing performance by Al Pacino as the bank robber. ""Inside Man"" focuses less on the bank robber played by a mostly covered up Clive Owen, and more on the negotiator played by Denzel Washington.Although we see little of Clive's face (other than the opening and closing segment) he does a nice job of playing the cool as a cucumber thief with mostly his voice. Denzel plays the slightly erratic, career on the line cop, whose skills few have confidence in. Add to the mix an egotistical, intellectual mercenary played by Jodie Foster (who gets to flash her near perfect 43 year old legs), and a powerful Bank Chairman played by Christopher Plummer and director Spike Lee has quite a loaded gun with which to play.Overall the bank heist and hostage stuff is thrilling and full of suspense. The film loses a bit with the whole Christopher Plummer storyline that is really kind of hard to believe. Also, the obvious Spike Lee moments will make you cringe, but he still has a great eye for the city. The song that plays over the opening and closing credits is amazing, but most of the film score is flawed. Due to the painters uniforms and masks, very few in the supporting cast stand out, but as you can guess, Denzel is fine carrying the star power load.",Inside Man
32,anaconda-40658,Outside Man.,3,25 May 2015,"Inside Man (2006): Dir: Spike Lee / Cast: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe: Well made yet standard bank thriller. It is one of those political thrillers that seems promising until it plays out as pieces of superior films. Title refers to the bank robber played by Clive Owen or the hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington. Despite the unoriginal concept it is flawed with the motive for the robbery and whether it makes much sense. Washington is called in when a hostage situation takes place at a bank and the usual negotiation clichés follow. Washington's forth collaboration with Spike Lee. Lee is a skilled director who has made such cool films as Bamboozled and Summer of Sam. Owen steals the show as the villain who presents surprising elements when clichés attempt to populate. Washington also does good work here bypassing clichés to arrive at a shocking truth. Fine supporting work by Christopher Plummer as bank chairman who has something to hide that renders why the robbers are there. He is in deep regret over a past lifestyle. Jodie Foster is hired by Plummer to deal out certain information until certain facts surface that cause her to question. This is not a bad attempt, thanks to good cast, but perhaps if Lee had an inside man writing the screenplay then his film might not look as bland as it does. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Inside Man
33,The_Void,Would have been better if it wasn't so 'clever'...,7,23 July 2006,"It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society, but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends, it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me, but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining, and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case, while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.One of the principle problems with this film is that too much is made of it, and the plot sometimes doesn't come together very well as Lee analyses his plot from both a past and present perspective. This means that we have the police interviewing suspects at the same time as the robbery is going on, and this usually involves cutting back to the bank and seeing someone doing something memorable, before Denzel Washington and his partner try to crack the people they think could be responsible. It gets a bit repetitive too often, but there's usually just about enough going on to make the film interesting. The acting is good, with the wooden Clive Owen getting a role that suits him as the masked bank robber; while the charismatic Denzel Washington provides more interest as the copper. Willem Dafoe doesn't make much of an impression, however, and Jodie Foster could have been better used. Scenes such as the one that sees a kid talking to Clive Owen about a video game involving some rapper are painful and unnecessary, however. The heist plot is well worked out, though, and seeing the plan come together at the end is the film's biggest highlight. Overall, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film as its entertaining and well worked; but it's not the great film that the director obviously wanted it to be.",Inside Man
34,deloudelouvain,My kind of movie in this genre.,8,22 April 2019,"In the crime/mystery genre Inside Man is just a bit better than a normal good movie. It's not excellent though, for that the heist is just too far fetched and perfect. Everybody likes to watch the perfect heist but in this case it's a bit exaggerated. But other than that small detail the rest of the movie is suspenseful, or at least it keeps you attentive as you keep wondering what will happen. For that there was the excellent interaction between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Both did a great job with their characters. The whole cast was perfect for this story. Spike Lee made another entertaining movie, one that I will watch again in a few years.",Inside Man
35,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Inside Man,8,1 April 2006,"How do you plan and execute the perfect robbery? Is there even such a thing as perfection in a heist? There are many unknowns, and with hostages, you never know what kind of complications they'll give you. And what more, when the police are all over you in a matter of minutes?Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, who tells the audience right in the beginning of the usual questions of the whos and the hows. You know, that bit in the trailer where he almost brags about being able to perform the perfect robbery. He and his band of merry men, dressed as painters, storm into a Manhattan bank one day in broad daylight, to rob it. EXcept that this isn't no plain old by-the-book robbery. The methods used are pretty innovative, and we are left to question the motives of what they are doing.Denzel Washington plays hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier, brining him back to a good cop role after his award winning stint in Training Day. He's been on the side of hostage taker once in JOhnny Q, and here, he plays a good cop with an edgy suspect past, which despite his plea of innocence, still continues to haunt him. Despite putting on a paunch and looking almost unrecognizable here (is it in to be fat for a role?), Washington too provides a charismatic presence in great counterbalance to Owen's enigmatic screen presence, even though he had to do an almost Hugo-Weaving tribute by acting behind a mask.Completing the heavyweights of casting, is Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. Plummer plays Arthur Case, the Chairman of the bank that Russell is holding up, and it seemed that he has a dark secret hidden inside the bank which he doesn't want revealed. Jodie Foster, as Madeline White the mysterious power-broker, gets employed to muscle her way into the situation between felon and cop, while Dafoe lends his muscle as a police captain, in a good person role for a change.Although the film consists of great performers as mentioned, there are limited scenes in which they share the screen together. But it really didn't matter that much, as the material given was riveting enough, and therefore making each moment they share, more treasured. You are left guessing most of the way as the cat and mouse game got underway, and when the finale is revealed, you can't help but share a smile, that it was yes, executed to plan, the way confident Russell wanted it to be.There is a gripe though, that in the local version, swear words were all being silenced over. Which was irritating as there were gaps in conversation which you have to fill in the blanks by reading lips. Even milder swear words like a-hole were censored blank. What gives? There are PG films out there which has characters swearing, you know? And there was one scene which involved a Sikh, that I felt was a tad insensitive. There are times when the movie lapses into prejudices, but maybe that made this movie a little grittier, and in tune with more realistic sentiments and environments. Watch out for that electronic game too, which I thought was a very subtle jab at the kind of games that are selling well in the market, with no regard to the effect on its targeted audience.The highlight of the movie, at least to me, was the opening credits scene, which contained pretty ordinary visuals, mundane even, but when somehow played out to the Hindi Song Chaiyya Chaiyya (which was the opening song in the Shah Rukh Khan movie Dil Se), it added a raw energy factor to Inside Man, with visuals and music blending so perfectly. And it was played to its entirety in the opening, and ending credit sequence - where the characters and the performers name are given a final encore.It's a slick heist thriller, which doesn't conform to the notions of how a heist movie should be. It's the feel good factor at the end of the movie that makes this movie satisfying. This is perhaps the most accessible, and commercial of all Spike Lee Joint films. I'd watch it again, for its engaging politicking story, and for that opening credit sequence.I so love that track, I'm gonna plug it again:Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint. Written by A.R.

And the end moral, about punishing the people that benefited from the Holocaust? That makes me sick. I am sure that event payed itself with interest just from the cliché movies that came out of it. And those last scenes, just after a short critique on the exaggeration of racial issues in America, with a cop twisting his tongue to say ""african American"". And it's a Spike Lee movie.

37,JamesHitchcock,One of the best crime thrillers of recent years,8,20 February 2010,"A group of robbers, disguised as painters, storm into a bank in New York and take all the customers and bank employees hostage. The police arrive and surround the bank and a battle of wits begins between Detective Keith Frazier, the chief police negotiator, and Dalton Russell, the leader of the robbers. At first it seems that the police hold all the advantages. The robbers are trapped in the basement of the bank, and the police can listen to their conversations using bugs. A team of armed police are ready to storm the bank should any of the hostages be harmed, the only exit is covered, and it seems that the only way the robbers can leave is by surrendering.Gradually, however, we realise that the situation is rather more complicated. Russell is clearly a highly intelligent man who has planned the robbery meticulously and seems able to predict the police's every move. It becomes clear that Russell has a clever escape plan; what is less clear is exactly what he and his gang hope to steal. There is also a subplot involving Madeleine White, a fixer hired by Arthur Case, the founder and president of the bank, to negotiate with the robbers for the safe return of certain documents which Case is anxious should remain secret.Back in the days of the Production Code, crime dramas had a simple moral code; the cops (who always won) were the good guys and the robbers (who always lost) the bad guys. The modern heist film, exemplified by something like ""Ocean's Eleven"", has an equally simple code of morality, or rather amorality; greed is good, crime does pay, the robbers are the heroes and the cops are only introduced so that they can be outwitted.""Inside Man"" may, technically, be a heist movie, but it avoids relying on either a simple morality or a simple amorality; it recognises that the distinction between good and evil may be a complex one, but that it nevertheless exists. The existence of shades of grey does not mean that there is no such thing as black or white. Certainly, the characters in the film cannot be sharply divided into good and bad. There is a distinction drawn between Frazier and his police colleague Captain John Darius. Darius wants to storm the bank and overpower the robbers by force; Frazier prefers a more peaceful, negotiated resolution to the standoff. This does not, however, mean that Frazier is the whiter-than-white ""hero"" of the film; we learn that he is under suspicion for corruption and malpractice.Case seems to the outside world to be a model citizen; he is a close friend of the mayor and famous for his philanthropy. We learn, however, that the secret he is trying to protect is that during the war he was in some way guilty of collaboration with the Nazis and founded the bank with the money he received from them for his services. His philanthropic work has been undertaken in an attempt to assuage his guilty conscience over these dealings; part of Russell's motives for organising the robbery is a desire to expose Case's past crimes.I felt that the film's ""Nazi"" angle was a weakness. Christopher Plummer, who plays Case, would only have been ten years old when the war broke out and sixteen when it finished. We must therefore either assume that Case is much older than the actor who is playing him (Plummer would have been 77 in 2006) or that he was only a child when he worked with the Nazis and only 19 when he founded his bank. There seems to be a tendency on the part of writers to reach automatically for the Nazis to serve as a symbol of ultimate evil, regardless of plausibility.That point apart, however, I found little else to criticise in the film, except that I thought that Madeleine White should have been given a bigger part in order to make the best use of that excellent actress Jodie Foster. There is some very good acting, especially from Denzel Washington (Frazier), Willem Dafoe (Darius) and even from Clive Owen, an actor whom I have not always admired in the past, as Russell.Director Spike Lee brings a certain gritty realism to the proceedings. By the term ""realism"" I do not mean that real-life criminals necessarily behave like the ones depicted; rather I mean that I found it much easier to accept the characters and situations shown here as realistic than I did while watching, say, ""Ocean's Eleven"", and even more its sequel ""Ocean's Twelve"", which never seemed anything other than fantasies with about as much connection to reality as a Mickey Mouse cartoon. I think that Lee was the right director for the film; I cannot imagine Ron Howard, the original choice, producing something so hard-edged. (Howard's films often have a certain soft-centred sentimentality about them). Russell Gewirtz's intelligent, thought-provoking screenplay is several degrees better than those normally associated with action-oriented thrillers. ""Inside Man"" is one of the best crime thrillers of recent years. 8/10",Inside Man
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,A new Dog Day Afternoon with a clever twist,10,12 August 2006,"Unfortunately, my generation did not have Dog Day Afternoon, nore did most of them get the full effect, it's a terrific movie. When I saw the theatrical trailer for this in the theater, I just thought it was another crappy remake that some amateur director thought he could do a better job of a priceless and flawless classic.Inside Man was surprisingly another terrific heist film that had some really good twists in it. It is like a new version of Dog Day Afternoon, not to mention it has an honorary citation in there. The acting is terrific and it keeps you going into the next scene after another. I loved how it wasn't typical and it had like a new attitude to it in this world of typical action movies.I would highly recommend Inside Man, it's a great action heist movie that could grab anyone. And to my generation who hasn't seen Dog Day Afternoon, please go out and rent that as well.10/10",Inside Man
39,blanbrn,"OK, but I've seen better.",6,26 March 2006,"Just yesterday I watched ""Inside Man"" at the cinemas, coming out feeling entertained and somewhat disappointed. Your typical cop- robbery and hostage situation is portrayed well, but the way the film ends lets me down. You have Denzel Washington as a NYPD detective called out after mastermind bank robber Clive Owen and his team hit one of New York's biggest and richest banks, within the first minutes of the film after taking the bank employees hostage it was nice to see those sexy and cute female bank tellers strip down in underclothes getting to see those sexy colored bras and panties they wear! After the hostages are finally free the ending upsets me as sure Clive Owen is sent to prison, but Det. Denzel collects the money as it turns out to be an inside scheme started by a hostage negotiator played by Jodie Foster and bank president Christopher Plummer. A sad ending for me because I'm tired of all the crooked plots and schemes designed in our movies, because they happen more and more in our world, making everyone rich not only just the bad guys, but also the good guys as we see of Denzel Washington's character in the end.",Inside Man
40,DKosty123,Nothing Is As It Appears,7,20 March 2009,"Spike Lee has taken an extremely talented cast and turned the film and the story inside out leaving the viewer guessing all along the way. This is Lee's attempt at taking a suspense movie & making it into a nearly meaningless exercise. In fact a lot of what he does works as the film is definitely unpredictable.What I noticed upon viewing this film is the fact that as the film tells the story, it shows interviews with hostages that break into the s by the main suspect. story but are obviously timed for after the robbery is over. There are about 30 minutes of deleted scenes which don't really help put it together any better either on the DVD.Denzell Washington is good in his role as the detective who is a negotiator, and is trying to settle the whole situation without deaths. What is interesting is that he realizes the person he is negotiating with is blowing smoke at him. He does not realize until it is much too late how he is gamed.While Spike Lee has done better work, this one holds up as really good suspense that has a mystery wrapped inside a some things which don't make any sense. It's a robbery within a hostage situation but it is not anything that appears as it should.",Inside Man
41,sddavis63,I Didn't Care For It,3,28 January 2012,"Generally speaking I enjoy Denzel Washington's movies, but - while I acknowledge that most people really liked this - ""Inside Man"" just didn't hit home with me. It started out with some promise, as a mysterious group of robbers attempt to take over a bank, seizing a number of hostages. Washington plays a detective sent to be the chief police negotiator. The robbers are violent and seem to mean business. Into the mix is added Jodie Foster's character of Madeleine - a strange and largely unexplained character who's doing some sort of dirty work for both the Mayor of New York (where this is set) and for Arthur Case - the chairman of the board of the bank (played by Christopher Plummer) - who clearly has something from his past stored in a safety deposit box at the bank that needs to be kept hidden.With the bank robbery and hostage taking this seemed to be going in the right direction. Somehow, though, the whole subplot around Case's background didn't really interest me, and Foster's character was (for my liking) too ill-defined to be really interesting. Admittedly, by about halfway through this I was completely lost and found that I was enjoying it less and less as it went along. It turns out to be one of the few movies starring Denzel Washington that I really didn't care for. (3/10)",Inside Man
42,Buddy-51,disappointing entry by Lee,5,4 May 2006,"Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is probably the most commercially viable and least cutting-edge film the maverick director has ever made. I wouldn't exactly call it a sellout - Lee is as entitled as anyone else to make money off his projects - but it is a bit disheartening seeing Lee aiming his sights and his estimable talents as low as he has here.""Inside Man"" starts out like a dozen other bank robbery tales, with a gang of masked gunmen storming into the establishment and turning the terrified customers and employees into ready-made hostages, then hunkering down for a prolonged standoff with the law enforcement officials outside. Denzel Washington plays the hostage negotiator whose job it is to bring the perpetrators to justice with a minimal loss of innocent life.The movie deserves credit for bringing a few novel twists to the storyline, but, frankly, most of what happens in this film simply defies credibility. We don't believe for a moment the goings-on here. Despite a ""surprise"" ending and a plethora of Lee's trademark cinematic flourishes, we leave the movie shrugging our shoulders uttering, ""Is that all there is?"" Washington does the best he can with a halfheartedly written character, but Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe and the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer aren't given much to do in their various roles. Only Jodie Foster - playing a ruthless real estate agent inexplicably brought in to assist in the case - seems to be having any fun at all with the film. She brings a much needed note of high-spirited camp to a movie that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.""Dog Day Afternoon"" this ain't.",Inside Man
43,cherold,"Terrific movie for the first two thirds, then ... (spoiler at bottom)",7,28 April 2007,"For most of its length, Inside Man looks to be a great crime movie. The movie is efficient and stylish. Even the smallest characters are given real personalities and the movie has a wonderful sense of New York attitude. Denzel gives a thoughtful performance and Plummer is excellent. The script is smart.But then, about two thirds of the way through, problems with the script begin to show up. The movie begins to seem unfocused and some of it is unconvincing and even tending towards the ludicrous. One begins to realize that Jodie's character serves no use in the story and the story itself wanders off in an odd and unconvincing direction. The final idea behind the story isn't bad so much as the execution; there is no proper setup in terms of plot or character. It really feels like the scriptwriter had an idea that he was determined to use even though he couldn't completely get a handle on it.Still, it's fun for the most part and even though it loses a lot of momentum at the end it's still reasonably entertaining. And it's certainly worth watching.****************SPOILER*************** Here's a small but telling example of a script problem. After this big hostage thing and standoff the cops finally get into the bank and discover nothing has actually been stolen. Then Denzel's boss tells him, just forget about the case; no one really cares. But 50 people were taken hostage, which is kidnapping and thus is a very serious offense, and it was a big news story, and just because no money was lost no one is going to be demanding police action? WTF? The movie seems to have this idea that the robbers really didn't do much wrong because they didn't steal any money (this is reinforced at the end), but that's just nuts. ****************END SPOILER***********",Inside Man
44,Robert_duder,Sorry folks...my first big Collassal disappointment of 2006,5,10 April 2006,"I thought The Inside Man was a sure fire enjoyable film. How could they miss?? Great, strong leading cast, seemingly flawless action/heist film with some good twists and maybe a mystery to boot. I was psyched to see it, one of my first big anticipations of this year and unfortunately it let me down. I seem to be one of the few as it garnishes rave reviews from IMDb viewers and continues to rake in the money. What can I say?? I found Spike Lee's latest attempt at an intellectual action film campy, poorly delivered and put together, and completely utterly confusing. I'm still not sure the entire basis of the story except pieces here and there. I have not seen a lot of Spike Lee ""joints"" but the few I have seen his style appears to be a non-conformist, mish-mashed, play on regular chronological order ex: Son of Sam, 25th Hour. Both of which I felt a little confused during. Perhaps my ""intellectuality"" I don't know?? The amazing if not slightly pontificating Denzel Washington takes the lead role as newcomer Hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, and unless you looked on here I don't know if you'd ever know his characters name. Nonetheless Washington pretty flawlessly makes any role watchable with his intense acting ability and his sometimes frantic portrayal of men under stress. Washington is the films saving grace and even though his humility leaves something to be desired (the man reeks of knowing how good he is) he's still an amazing leading man. Clive Owen is his adversary Dalton Russell and under normal circumstances this would have been a match made in Heaven. Owen is becoming a great leading man in his own right having really impressed me in Derailed, King Arthur and even one of my less favorites Closer. Owen spends the majority of the film behind a mask which could be perfectly fine but none of the characters in the film are ever really explored or opened up which makes operating behind a mask even more difficult. His true genius is left untapped and his character is left completely undiscovered sadly. Same with Washington's character who has a great back story that is just never explored with any real class or expertise. Still with what Owen is given he does his best and plays a great bad guy but still in some ways an anti-hero. Jodie Foster plays conniving black market mediator to the rich and famous Madeline White. In actuality she IS the Inside Man. Her role is without a doubt the best in the film and the most developed. In many ways she is more the villain than Owen's character. She's devious and underhanded and is more about the money than anyone and at the same time because of her line or work she has some very powerful connections even if those connections despise her for the work she has done. Foster is tight knit, no holds barred, and easily believable as a man-eater or people eater in general. Christopher Plummer as the aging bank executive who is on the receiving end of the robber's bitterness does a decent job but his role is equally unflourished and it goes to waste in the end. Another great actor Willem Dafoe goes to complete waste as the seemingly bored Captain John Darius. His role is so small despite having a lot of screen time and he just seems like he doesn't want to be there. Chiwetel Ejiofor who did such a great job as the bad guy in Four Brothers is made into Denzel Washington's lackey, following him around like a puppy dog and never doing much of anything except being Washington's straight man.Nobody from this film is the problem with the film. Everyone does the best job they can with what they are given with a poorly slapped together script. The story makes little to no sense and desperately needs so much more explaining and depth and maybe it all ended up on the cutting room floor but for me it ruined it completely. What started out as an intense action film began to spiral into completely and utter non sensical story. The heist wasn't clever, it was confusing because we as the audience knew even less about what was going on than the people involved. The interspersed interviews with witnesses and possible suspects DURING the bank robbery was even more confusing and leaving the film in chronological order would have been much neater and easier to follow. There were small little moments when I wondered why in the hell they decided to do such little things that made the film look downright fake. There is a scene where the female robber is guarding the vault and she is swaying back and forth like a cartoon castle guard?!!? It looks ridiculous!! What should have been a very real and intense and incredibly clever heist film was a brutally confusing and misused and poorly directed and written crap film that was only saved and marginally watchable by it's high priced and high priority cast. It had it's moments where I thought everything was going to come together but it never did and when those credits started rolling my disappointment began rolling in. I won't tell anyone NOT to see this movie, in fact I would say enjoy my review let it fire you up if you like it because everyone seems to love this film. It just wasn't for me and disappointed me a great deal, no one is more saddened than me to not have loved it. 5/10",Inside Man
45,Lejink,Flaccid update of 70's heist movies,4,10 February 2008,"For me an unsatisfactory, unconvincing heist movie. With an A-List cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub-genre. For a start I didn't like the pacing of the film, starting off with mastermind Clive Owen's raison d'etre piece to camera, unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion, then finding the narrative peppered with confusing, not to say unreal-seeming witness interviews, then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier. Of course the camera work is fluid throughout, constantly on the move and incorporating hand-camera shots a-plenty, but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense, falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film. Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad-ass jive talk of a ""Shaft"" movie thirty - five years earlier (he even has that ""no-one understands him but his woman"" thing going on, replete with his ""hot"" girlfriend, baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate ""dirty-talk"") and his mild ""In The Heat Of The Night"" riff with Willem Defoe (in almost a bit-part) raises barely a ripple. Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we're given to believe the gang is Arab-based, also hindered by having to play 90% of the film with a mask over his face. Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight-lipped, ice maiden, sub-Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty-hunter, if you will, to little effect. Overall it's a real mish-mash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans. Worst scene (of many) is undoubtedly Washington's witness-interview, unbelievably, with an 8 year old street-kid, although Owen's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes. During the film in-joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" - but there's no honour in self-praise. More like ""The Hot Rock"" instead...and even that was good for a few laughs.",Inside Man
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A film that cheats itself of greatness,7,7 April 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A group of people in plasterers uniforms walk into a busy New York City bank, produce guns and bundle everyone together downstairs. A tense hostage situation has soon developed and Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is in charge of keeping everything under control. But the raiders, lead by the devious, condescending Russell Dalton (Clive Owen) aren't making their demands very clear and after a while it seems to all be about something a little more than money.This is sort of an unusual film for Spike Lee to make, and he's done a bit of a Devil's Advocate by using the brilliant Denzel Washington and the rather wooden Clive Owen as co-stars. But Washington, Jodie Foster (although a bit too smug in what is a rather small role), Christopher Plummer and, yes, even would you believe, Owen are all on pretty good form here, delivering great versions of the sort of performances they do best. Plus the film is distinctively Spike Lee all the way, with his trademark use of the camera and delivery style. The film also has a really engrossing story to it, with some great dialogue and soforth.But those are it's good points. The bad news is that it's badly paced, badly edited and as a result the story ends up dragging on a little and becoming a little boring. Some of the plot is badly tied up and doesn't even make sense by the end. As a few other reviewers have said, it's a film that may have tried to be a bit too smart for it's own good and cheated itself of greatness as a result. ***",Inside Man
47,ElMaruecan82,Spike Lee toying with the conventions and non-conventions of an overly codified genre... for our greatest delight and excitement!,8,6 October 2019,"If a movie deals with a crisis, it better offers a proper resolution. This is why hostage movies have always been unnerving experiences to me. I'm not too brave whether in a good or a bad way, so I'm more likely to emphasize with the hostages and one victim can be one too many.""Inside Man"" is a heist film whose perfectionist tone is set from the start and so is its kinship with ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (Lee even included a hostage named Miriam, played by the same actress three decades before and the same actor playing the pizza delivery-man). But while in Lumet's classic, Pacino stumbled with the gift box to get the rifle out and one of the accomplices chickened out foreshadowing the disaster to be- here we have four robbers fully masked, deactivating the cameras, undressing the hostages, giving them the same uniforms they wear and proving organization-wise that the comparison with ""Dog Day"" will only extend to the frantic media coverage.One of the robbers, named Russell, is played by Clive Owen. He introduces us to the story with the premise that he's made a perfect heist. I was wondering what he meant by 'perfect' but I assumed it had to be clean and that caught my attention. Indeed, while there's a general consensus that we must know the villains mean business and won't take any chances (security guards are always the first victims and over the course of the robbery you have a smart guy who wants to be the hero), ""Inside Man"" made me decide that there shall not be any civilian death. Why? Because a/I took Russell at his word and believed there would be no civilian deaths b/ even the security guard wasn't killed (a rarity) and c/ the most significant defiance to the robbers' authority went unpunished.So there's clearly a sense of misleading that emerges from the first operational minutiae, which it's not surprising from a Spike Lee film. While the director is mostly known for his racism-themed and originally crafted films, here he shows his talent in toying with the viewers' expectations and subvert many tropes of a genre that has been codified to the point of dogmatic requirements. Besides, isn't it more thrilling to have protagonists as competent as their counterparts? On that level, ""Inside Man"" is still closer to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" than ""Die Hard"" (which I love).And as Frazier, the man in charge, Washington plays a focused and rather relaxed cop who understands quickly that there's something unusual about the robbery... so unusual that he's got to understand the robbery to better stop it, he doesn't need men or weaponry, what he needs is time.And that's one of the first hints that the heist has been engineered with the smallest detail in mind, because time is precisely what Russell and his team needs but it shouldn't be their call but the cops'. And since we deal with smart men, it doesn't take time long for Frazier to realize how convenient it is that Russell gives him the time he needs, whether through false tracks involving a recorded foreign language or a riddle à la Simon Gruber that the team (including Chewitel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe) still debate after the phone call.Therefore, Frazier's issue is the following: is Russell stalling or bluffing? The robbery turns out an exciting poker-game where the cards are finally laid at the end. The catch is that the robbery is so captivating that I was wondering about the purpose of the Christopher Plummer part. Ebert kept criticizing it because of the suspension of disbelief regarding his age, I could forgo that element. What bothered me was the importance given to that plot device at a moment where the focus was the hostages, and such a big deal was made about the involvement of the fixer, played by Jodie Foster and some mysterious case she got to take back from the safe that. Naturally, that had to be more than a detail and the script ties the plot together at the end and allows the subplot to give the big one its overdue pay-off... and if the level of excitement is nowhere close to the cops vs. robbers, Plummer and Foster are as pivotal to the story as Washington and Owen.Once again, Lee is some trickster because he seems to have made the film like Owen orchestrated his plan, anticipating the reactions and questionings from the viewers. When Frazier believes Russell's stalling and provokes Owen, the scene is followed by its biggest shock, one that could almost ruin my enjoyment, except for the fact that it served its purpose whether you think of the film's plot or the robbers, which are quit the same. The film's ending reveals the final details of the robbery and justifies the use of a clever editing that consisted of hostages' post-robbery. Over the course of the film, I was wondering why they were all asked whether thy took part to the heist, and then something hit me, why shouldn't they? How about that being part of the plan?The editing might be the film's masterstroke (which is saying a lot) because we've seen heist movies before, some made great dramas, other great action pictures, but how many robberies are told like a 'mystery' film? At the end, we're not just impressed by the genius of the plan, but the way Lee reinvented the genre using unconventional elements and yet relying on conventions. Not your typical Spike Lee joint but a terrific thriller, served by a fine performance from Denzel Washington.",Inside Man
48,paul2001sw-1,Absorbing but unsatisfying,7,30 June 2011,"Spike Lee's 'Inside Man', a film about hostage-taking bank robbers in New York, at one point name-checks 'Dog Day Afternoon', another film with a similar subject matter. But whereas that film, as with Lee's own early work, was an authentic portrait of the hard lives of ordinary Americans, 'Inside Man' is high-grade tosh. Lee can do this sort of thing, he even does it quite well, but there's a fundamental shallowness here: the motiveless criminal, the super-cool, super-connected Miss Fixit, the evil banker who once did a deal with the Nazis (and I'm no friend of the Nazis, but the use of ""Nazi"" as a convenient shorthand for an evil which cannot be questioned and which is by definition completely different to the evil of any other customer who any other banker might conceivably have dealt with is typical of the laziness of the film's grander concepts, however well worked out the details). Moreover, the essential trick of the movie is intrinsically undramatic, and the film's structure is highly constrained as Lee attempts to extract some impact from the idea. Overall, it's absorbing but not quite satisfying; with little substance below the surface.",Inside Man
49,MOscarbradley,One of the best heist movies for a very long time,8,5 April 2006,"One of the greatest pleasures the cinema can afford is the well-orchestrated heist movie. Unfortunately, they don't come around often enough so who would have thought that one of the best for a very, very long time would come from none other than Spike Lee. This is unquestionably Lee's most commercial movie to date. That he has carried it off with such consummate skill, while at the same time diluting his own political attitudes hardly at all, is quite an achievement. In other words, he hasn't sold out and has made one hell of an entertainment into the bargain.The film begins with Clive Owen talking direct to camera and telling us he is going to rob a bank, setting out the who and the why. The how is the movie that follows. Lee cuts straight to the chase and the opening scenes of the robbery are brilliantly detailed. The plot's a real tease. We know from the outset that this is no conventional robbery. We are in a hostage situation from the word go and when the robbers start demanding a getaway plane ... well, we've been down this road before. But as hostage negotiator Denzel Washington tells Owen, 'Didn't you see ""Dog Day Afternoon""?' In other words, bank robbers don't really expect planes to fly them to God-knows-where with a pile of people they didn't really want in the first place. The fun is in figuring out what is going on. And the plot twists are as nifty as they come: a brilliant device are the flash-forwards to the hostages being interrogated by Washington and partner Chiwetel Ejiofor. Are these clues or just red-herrings? In a movie like this the element of surprise is everything and Lee, working from a first-rate script by Russell Gewirtz, keeps us guessing.As the louche, lippy detective in charge, Washington is excellent. He looks like he's having fun. And Jodie Foster is terrific as ... well, let's just say her CV would make very interesting reading. The part could just as easily have been written for a man but whereas a man would simply have been a sleazy villain, Foster manages to be both charming and sexy; (she's a charming and sexy piranha fish, as she says, her bite is worse than her bark).Often movies like this tend to run out of steam before the end. Once we know the denouement things have a tendency to dip but Lee keeps it ticking along nicely for a coda that should send you out of the cinema with a reasonably wide grin on your well satisfied chops.",Inside Man
50,dromasca,"good thriller, but was this a Spike Lee film?",7,24 September 2006,"'Inside Man' is a good thriller movie. It has a different idea, and what starts like your usual bank robbery film turns into a more sophisticated action film that you would have expected. You keep asking yourself together with most of the characters what the thieves are after, and they plan to get out of the hostages situation in the mid of Manhattan, and when it happens it all makes sense.It is also well acted. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen are the main players in the cat and mouse game, while Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Cristopher Plummer give strong and key supporting roles.Yet, I may ask, is this a Spike Lee movie? We are always used to Lee making something different or surprising, saying something that makes sense from a social or political point of view. Here he almost plays truthfully the role of conventional thriller director, the fact that the good detective is an Afro-American does not take it for a social comment for a long time, and from this perspective I was a little disappointed.",Inside Man
51,gbill-74877,Entertaining heist film,7,3 March 2021,"I can't really say this heist film stands out in the genre, but it's entertaining and has a star-studded cast. There are nice moments, like the Sikh bank worker who points out the harassment he receives in a post-9/11 world, and some stupid ones, like the detectives ogling the women with large breasts. There is cleverness in the mastermind's plan as we see it gradually revealed, but there are some head scratching moments in character motivations along the way. There is something pretty subversive in how it's all resolved, if you think about what happens to the detective, the bank president, and the criminals, and yet it also feels a little unsatisfying too, maybe because the historical crime isn't completely avenged (in fact, it's re-perpetrated). I simultaneously wish the film had been pared down and that a little more effort had been put into developing its characters, even though those desires pull in opposite directions.

I thought Jodie Foster does not need to be in this movie even though she's a good force.This movie is about a bank robbery at the Manhattan Trust. The robbers are looking for something very important. Will they get it or will they not? I think Spike Lee is an adept director despite what everyone else says.

53,secondtake,"Well made absolutely, but a hair long, and a hair routine...",7,1 March 2015,"Inside Man (2006)An attempt at the mainstream by Spike Lee, and a really solid bank heist movie with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington at the two poles of the story, bad guy and good guy. The meaning of the title isn't clear until the last five minutes.Heist movies are partly about the mechanics and ingenuity of the plan, and this one is good. At first it all unfolds with alarming routine, but Lee manages to change it up after awhile by have some flash-forwards that make us re-evaluate the main plot as it happens. There are a couple of sub-plots and one of them, using Jodie Foster, is important but forced on us. But the main heist isn't enough for a full blooded movie of this kind, so there is a script weakness somewhere here.Washington as the main detective (embattled, of course) is charming and effective. He can make any movie click in his scenes. And Owen is strong in his own usual way, but we get a weirdly limited view of him because he is almost always covered with hood, mask, and sunglasses. No facial intensity here.The filming is pure Lee, with lots of moving camera and a few simple special effects, elegant and oddly a hair old fashioned. In fact, as much as I admire Lee's best films, you get a sense he's riding an old wave, a little like Woody Allen (another NYC auteur director) keeps an older style going even in his most recent films. If, for a comparison, David Fincher had made ""Inside Man"" I think we would see some kind of verve and intensity and originality that Lee somehow avoids. But well made this is, and don't get it wrong, if you like crime and caper movies at all, this is one to see. I wish there was a director's cut that was 20 minutes shorter, but nestle on the couch and let it flow.",Inside Man
54,A_Different_Drummer,Ahead of its Time,10,1 December 2016,"Do I need to justify the high score? Have seen this three times and conclude: 1. The best Spike Lee film. Most of Lee's films I have found tend to be self-conscious and this is the exception. In the tradition of the greatest directors of all time, he just stands back and let's the story unfold. Perfect direction.2. Possibly best Denzel film and - oh boy -- that is saying a lot because we have a class-A actor who continually turns out brilliant performances. (This review penned in 2016 and -- for the historical record and IMDb readers of the future -- Denzel just shocked his fans yet again by doing two ""action"" roles which ordinarily would have strained even a younger actor.) What makes this part special is not merely that Denzel is great -- he is always great -- but his character actually evolves and grows during the narrative. Wow.3. Best in a short series of Clive Ownen performances. If you are a student of film you know that Clive was almost ""the next big thing"" (especially after a breakout performance in Bourne 1) and then sort of disappeared, which is a pity. Am a big fan, he has one of the most distinctive voices in film (sounds like a smarter version of Adam Arkin) and brings a gravitas to any role he picks up.4. Script to die for. It is not until you leave the theatre (or turn off the DVD) that you realize this film was ahead of its time. It did not merely offer a clever ""heist"" film but actually de-constructed the heist movie and turned it upside down. (Like Cabin in the woods.) This is a brilliant and entertaining film that you can think about after it is over. And watch every few years, and still enjoy it.",Inside Man
55,tabuno,A Counter Twisting Movie,7,22 January 2019,"9 April 2006. Like The Village, The Inside Man uses the 180 degree twist and to pretty good effect. This mystery thriller built up slowly, perhaps too slowly for some, in its convoluted plot about a bank heist. Strangely this good-feeling movie manages to reveal all in one of the ""longest explanations"" of any movie and short changes the screen time of Jodie Foster creating some imbalance in the overall presentation of the movie. Yet this is a tight, more cerebral mystery movie, that doesn't quit have the same intense bite of The Crying Game or the Usual Suspects. Yet it does have more of a sympathetic and uplifting message, something well received in these more fearful and uncertain times. Seven out of Ten Stars.",Inside Man
56,nairtejas,Gripping Tale Of Corporate & Political Games ♦ 80%,8,1 July 2013,"I had huge expectations from the story. As a matter of fact, the plot gives something for me to chew on. Only, I chewed and chewed and chewed, only to spit it in a ravine.Clive Owen is fantastic. But I loved Denzel Wahsington's charismatic performance as a detective. He steals the limelight for sure. His character scores massive points, but Owen's character's got depth and anonymity. Jodie Foster has the cleverest dialogs while Christopher Plummer was a disgrace (I don't know.. either his character or portrayal - something went nasty). The makers have made it a point to keep the viewers hooked to what they are showing on the screen with witty dialogs, humor, action & serious plot. Indeed, more than meeting my expectations... it surprised.The opening song surprised me. Well, being an Indian, it was a matter of pride. Although, I should reprimand the selection of that particular song; was an inept thing to do for a crime thriller like this. Yes, it involves great thinking to churn out what is happening on screen, but as it enhances... the plot gets even more confusing. That troubled me. Lots of implications & unanswered questions plastered over heavy political jargon... well, it is too cryptic. Although, on a second watch, everything got clear. 8.0/10.Mighty thinking of changing the idea of the whole bank-robbery thing. Quite an intuitive take. Appreciate the makers for giving something different on that!BOTTOM LINE: Falls short of credibility, otherwise Inside Man is pumping, thrilling & food for thought.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

57,kenjha,Muddled Heist Drama,6,28 September 2010,New York police negotiates with bank robbers who have take hostages. The plot is basically a rehash of other heist films except that this one is rather muddled. It clumsily moves back and forth in time in an attempt to be edgy but winds up being confusing instead. There are enough plot holes to drive a Brink's truck through. There is very little suspense and the ending is quite underwhelming. The plot thread involving Plummer is predictable and nonsensical. Washington does his usual cool guy schtick; his reaction to the hostage situation is much too nonchalant. Owen isn't given much to do. Foster is too arrogant and it's not clear who she is and how she holds so much power.,Inside Man
58,The-Sarkologist,"Good, but not one of Lee's Best",7,18 August 2021,"Basically this film is a heist film, so you can probably guess what it is about, and how it is going to end as well, though it differs from a lot of others as you have Spike Lee's distinctive touch. Mind you, it isn't one of his more distinctive films in that it doesn't seem to explore race relations in the US, but then again not all of his films fall into that category. However, as I mentioned, it still does have some distinctive elements to it, and it does show a bit of his signature flare.As I mentioned, it is a heist film, and the film begins with one of the robbers speaking about how he pulled off the perfect bank robbery. Mind you, he also talks about being in gaol, but is actually pretty vague about the whole idea. The film then shifts to the robbery, and what turns out to be a hostage situation.One of the good things about this film is that you are never quite, one hundred percent sure of what is actually going on, and why they are actually in the bank. Things are eventually revealed at the end, to an extent, and there are a few interesting twists and turns through the whole film. There are also a few plot holes as well, but I don't want to go too deep into them due to spoiling the film, and that is something that I'm not all that keen on doing because, as I mentioned, there are a few nice and interesting twists in the film.Yeah, it's not bad, though it really isn't one of those standout films either. Mind you, it does fall into the category of heist film, which pretty much means that you can generally guess how it turns out. As I said, it's interesting, has some nice twists, and is put together rather well, but it can be a little bit slow in parts too.",Inside Man

I have seen Inside Man several times before, always a great ride; well written dialogue too. Among the greatest endings ever too, just wait for it!!",Inside Man
60,paulclaassen,"Well acted, well written, but not my cup of tea, really...",5,2 May 2020,"There's no denying 'Inside Man' is a very good production, with an all-star cast. However, I found the film would have been much better paced had it been about 20 minutes shorter.Almost the entire film is set inside the bank. Being such a long film - with more talk than action - it was so drawn out that it lost all sense of urgency. Even the robbers operated at such a snail's pace that moments in the film became - dare I say - tedious. Inter-cutting between the robbery and interrogations ruined the suspense for me, and already gave us an idea what happened after the robbery. I didn't want to see that as early as around the 30-minute mark. (Unnecessary) Humor elements and character's private lives also took up a lot of screen time. The film deviated way too often from the matter at hand.The acting was very good, but then again, there wasn't really much for the actors to do, was there? I still don't fully understand Jodie Foster's character, Madeleine. There's this great importance about her character, but then she doesn't achieve anything noteworthy. She tried, but that's about it.I did enjoy the constant sense of mystery. Ultimately, though, it just wasn't worth sitting through 128 minutes just to enjoy the mystery element. There are far more enjoyable movies in this genre out there. (Note, I said more enjoyable, indicating this is not a bad film - don't get me wrong on that. From a entertainment point of view, it just didn't score high enough for me). The only real action comes from a reenactment of Captain John's thoughts (played by Dafoe). And it lasts about 30 seconds or so...Would I watch it again? No.",Inside Man
61,sol-,The Insider,7,8 July 2016,"Two overworked New York detectives try to uncover why four bank robbers who have taken hostages appear to be stalling for time in this unusual heist movie directed by Spike Lee. The amount of thought and detail in the robbers' plan is a constant source of fascination and the film derives a lot of mileage from how the detectives always find themselves one step behind. The mystery at the heart of the film (why they are stalling and what they are really after) is pretty decent too, even if all the cutaways to Christopher Plummer as the owner of the bank spell things out a bit. The film tries to do a bit too much that is daringly different for its own good though. The flashforwards as hostages are interviewed afterwards, for instance, are intriguing but also subtract from the intimacy of the action. They prematurely reveal who survives too. The subplot with Jodie Foster is likewise a mixed blessing. She is easily the most interesting and mysterious character in the piece, however, as the film is primarily about the two detectives and the bank robbers interacting, she likewise breaks some of the tension. Even if is not always edge-of-the-seat gripping though, 'Inside Man' is a film with very few (if any) dull moments. Matthew Libatique (the Oscar nominated DOP of 'Black Swan') does a great job visualising the material together with Lee. From the dark lighting choices, to a vertigo shot on Plummer at his desk, to a tracking shot from Denzel Washington's chest, the film looks great. Terence Blanchard ('25th Hour') also provides another solid music score for Lee.",Inside Man
62,zkonedog,"Payoff Doesn't Equal Buildup Here, But Still A Solidly Entertaining Mystery",8,6 March 2017,"The ""mystery"" genre (and that is exactly what Inside Man is, regardless of its heist/cop trimmings) is often a tricky one to nail. A common problem? For viewers, the setting up of the mystery is often infinitely more engaging than the resolution. That's exactly what happens in this film. Fortunately, it has enough other elements going in its favor to still be quite entertaining.For a very basic overview, Inside Man focuses on a bank robbery perpetuated by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). When Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called to the scene as hostage negotiator, however, he begins to realize that theft may be the furthest thing from Russell's plans. Concurrent to the central mystery is no-nonsense ""fixer"" Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) trying to preserve the shadowy interests of bank owner Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).The best thing that Inside Man has going for it is that it sets up one whopper of a mystery. One of the best I've ever seen for a non-scifi or fantasy flick. It will immediately pique your interest and keep you guessing on multiple occasions. Much like the detective doing the heavy lifting, you'll become utterly flummoxed by just what the heck Dalton Russell is planning!Of course, a feature film like this has to spill the beans at some point, and when that indeed happens--the house of cards comes tumbling down. The resolution of the intriguing mystery falls considerably flat. That isn't to say that there is no resolution (there most certainly is, and potentially a very interesting one), but director Spike Lee just doesn't quite handle the endgame right. In other words, the journey is far, far more fun than the actual destination. Had that been rectified, this might be a 10/10 star effort.Fortunately, there is enough else to savor in Inside Man that I have no qualms at keeping it a high 8/10. Denzel Washington's repartee with Owen is predictably incredible, and the tension that builds between those two is palpable. The Foster/Plummer angle is also well-acted (of course it is with those two legends cast!), so there is nary a moment on screen that isn't crackling with some type of thespian greatness.I've probably seen Inside Man three times, and each viewing takes basically the same route: I'm utterly engrossed in the mystery and then somewhat put off by the off-balance ending. Overall, then, it ends up being a solid-but-not-spectacular movie that is incredibly engaging mystery-wise and features great acting in every single scene. If you enjoy fast-paced mysteries or are a big Denzel fan, this one is not to be missed.",Inside Man
63,Floated2,Intelligent heist film,9,2 December 2018,"Spike Lee's Inside Man starring Denzel Washington has been heavily praised since its release in 2006, both as a bank heist film and an overall crime drama.This film is quite unique and different than the typical heist film in a sense where the drama had a slow build but a worthy of suspense and thrills. The acting is top notch from both Washington and Clive Owen. Jodie Foster was seemingly thrown in and was about the worst part of this great film.Otherwise, Inside Man delivers what was expected as an entertaining crime mystery heist film. Even with a run time of over two hours, the film moves at a solid pace where time seems to go quickly (meaning it's a good thing). Highly recommend for fans of Spike Lee, or Denzel or fans of well made heist films.",Inside Man
64,johnnyboyz,"Spike Lee goes to Hollywood, but takes his touch and his ideas with him.",7,12 May 2008,"It appears that Spike Lee can do conventional; he can do genre and he can do generic. But to call Inside Man conventional, generic and by the book I feel would be a little harsh because it's actually a thoroughly entertaining and somewhat engrossing film about a heist (heist being the genre) and the actions and reactions that will shape the outcome of the heist. This is Spike Lee for the most restless of crowds: big name actors like Denzel Washington; Clive Owen; Jodie Foster and Willem Dafoe; sequences drawn out in suspense and intrigue as hostages threaten to out smart their captors and enough fast cuts and scenes of fast talking dialogue that furthers the plot and makes the film the fun ride it is. From what it sounds, Inside Man seems like a film that could've been directed by anybody  indeed, Ron Howard was going to direct this initially but Lee stepped in when Howard took up another project; I think both directors are very different to one another in terms of their approaches to film so for a film to be scraped by Howard, taken up by Lee and STILL to turn out to be pretty darn good just goes to show you.But underneath Inside Man's supposedly generic surface lies certain 'Lee' touches I've come to notice in each of his films. I wonder how different the script was after Lee stepped in; my guess is it changed, centrefold. The character's in Howard's film might all have been white but Lee has African-Americans; Jews; Chinese people and even a Sikh in his film, indeed all four of these ethnic backgrounds are hostages at one point, are let out at another point and then interrogated. The film has its Sikh character independent and strongly willed. He is agitated that the police forced him to remove his headwear and does not cooperate thus giving the police a hard time. I wonder how the scene would've panned out had another director that doesn't take time to acknowledge and respect ethnicity in films  perhaps the same, perhaps differently in a disrespectful way, perhaps there wouldn't even have been a Sikh there in the first place: we'll never know.But this is one of quite a few clever things Inside Man has going for it. This is Spike Lee doing action, this is Spike Lee going all 'Hollywood' on us but in a good fashion because he brings his touch to the picture and he brings his ideas and content to a genre film. There are numerous references to previous American films that have stood the test of time in the majority's eyes: The Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon; there is even a brief reference to the third Die Hard film that anybody who has seen it more than once will immediately pick up on; I read after seeing Inside Man Spike Lee had no intention of the reference, but there you go. However, it is a single quote that backs up my theory that the screenplay and script may have been changed once Lee came onboard and that is when one man states ""Anybody who has seen decent (Hollywood) action film knows what an AK-47 looks like"". I feel this is Lee almost announcing 'Yeah, OK; I'm going against directorial type here but you know what? I'm going to show you anyway by making this film in the action genre'.This repetition and use of reference to older, more recognised American films made by white Americans at the time could well be a personal commentary by Lee on how so few black directors make truly recognisable films. Indeed, when the character that states the Ak47 quote comes so close to being self-aware in the film, it is Spike Lee recognising formula and typical props used in these formulas. Spike Lee tells us he recognises the typical gun in the typical action film but deliberately keeps it in because he knows that's what people want in the genre  familiarity and formula, two words you would never usually associate with Lee. This also tells us that just because he makes Inside Man, he will not buckle under the temptation to go 'formulaic' on us in the future after his career of 'un-formulaic' films.Spike Lee also finds space to toy with formula. To begin the film with a monologue told by the antagonist of the tale is a twisted method of story telling in itself. Suddenly, the story is being told orally from the bad guy's point of view and in the past tense  that can't be usual. Lee also echoes some of his earlier work, namely Clockers which dealt with 'black on black' crime. The black son of a seemingly upstanding black man plays a video game that even the antagonist played by Clive Owen labels 'sick' since it is all about black characters killing other black characters. What's even eerier is that it is a young black boy who's playing it. This may well be an even more in depth response to computer game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; released two years previously to Inside Man and a game loosely about African-Americans killing one another. But as a film, Inside Man works a treat. There are too many scenes in which the police and the bank robbers talk to one another face to face for my liking and that cannot be attributed to the breaking away of conventions because it doesn't need to even happen. However, with twits and turns as well as an enjoyable approach, the film holds up as a piece of entertainment; holding your attention close to throughout.",Inside Man

Spike Lee hasn't made a good movie...ever. Put those two together and you get a mega-mess of a movie. The camera never stops moving. The music never stops playing. Lee is from New York but you would never know that from watching this movie. All of his ""New Yorkers"" are corny, stereotypes with unbelievable accents. The plot itself is so contrived and silly that you don't care about any of the characters. Jodie Foster is totally wasted in a rather minor role. Chistopher Plummer is no spring chicken but he is still 15 years too young to be playing his character. Inside Man was a never ending, mind numbing experience. I saw this with three friends and we all hated this bomb. It will have a good opening weekend then quickly fade away as word of mouth spreads.

67,Chris Knipp,Shaggy dog bank heist: a smooth entertainment that ultimately fizzles,8,25 March 2006,"Spike Lee's personal inside job, a conventional bank heist film that has a shaggy dog twist on the genre and a spattering of feisty Spike-isms about Sikh's profiled as ""rag-heads"" and robbed of their turbans by cops, a racist video game played by an 8 ¾-year-old black boy from Brooklyn bothering the white head robber, an Albanian ex- called in by a bystander to identify a distraction tape, a puzzle about Grand Central andwell, they're the best of the film so it's best not to give them all away. And the film sparkles sometimes because its creaky machinery, echoing such outdated classics as the explicitly referenced Dog Day Afternoon, is kept going by pros like Denzel Washington, as the head cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank president with an anachronistic secret to hide, Jodie Foster as the suave fixer he hires to hide if for him, and Clive Owen as the preternaturally calm bank robbery mastermind.It's also intriguing that a small group of robbers take over an austere downtown Manhattan bank, terrorize several dozen bystanders who become hostages, and dress them all up to look alike -- and like them. Likewise it tweaks our genre-tired curiosity to see as things drag on and the pizza gets stale that the robber doesn't want the dough, doesn't want the 747; doesn't want to kill hostages (or does he?): what the heck does he want? But at some point even though the pacing is good, we gradually stop caring. And then it's not just the pizza but the suspense that has gone stale.I guess the young first-time screen writer Russell Gewirtz's story appealed to Spike because it hinges on a rich white guy whose wealth all got started with a mega-wrong: cooperating with the Nazis. One trouble: the actor's too young to have done that. Another trouble: he wouldn't have saved the incriminating document. A third: evidence of his wrongdoing would be in a dozen places other than that document. How Clive would know about this, and how Clive would get away with his final escape trick, are not to be asked; this clever story that seems to have entertaining new twists on convention, takes a long time to get to an anticlimactic and bumpy finale. What are Jodie and Denzel doing sitting on that bench at the end, chatting? Not a darn thing, except taking a bow.Even though Lee can't edit himself down to under two hours and this movie splits its seams a bit, he is a pro and he can entertain and provide original socio-political commentary -- this time the more effective for being plot-driven and not crudely in-our-face. But the trouble is the excitement generated by the setup and the interplay between members of the cop hierarchy (including Willem Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofor), and the usual phone calls and negotiational gambits and challenges, goes into that slow fizzle-out once it's clear the robber is just stalling. Stalling is stalling. There's only one act of violence that might get your heart rate up again, and if you've been paying attention, it won't.So in the end, if you like Spike Lee's efforts to be mainstream, and you don't care if they quite work, this is an entertaining film. But if you expect real punch or quirkiness from Spike, don't come knocking, not this time.",Inside Man
68,Polaris_DiB,"A fun charade, but ultimately no point",3,27 March 2008,"It's hard to see why Spike Lee's films aren't more commercially viable on their own strength--the man has an eye for beauty and visual storytelling that makes his movies entertaining and enjoyable as much as they are important arguments about the world of ethnic unrest, which movies like Crash show are popular Hollywood fixtures anyway. However, for this reason or that, Lee is not typically considered a ""mainstream director"", which is pretty much the biggest commercial curiosity this movie incorporates: Lee is making a joint that's a bank heist thriller?Well, yes, yes he is, and he's having it both ways. What is mostly a straight-forward genre piece is imbued with his floaty, detached camera, and ethnic profiling. The cops not only have to figure out a way to defuse a violent situation, but tensions underlying the community are getting in their way. Up to pretty much the ending, the movie is both a really great game of cat and mouse and a sober rumination on how cultural dysfunction can rise to the surface during some of the worst times.However, it all basically drops off at the end. After seeing this movie, I became a bit confused about what the point of all of it was supposed to be. At that point, any moralizing about crime or justice in this film drops off into emptiness or is deconstructed by Dalton's insistence that ""I am not a hero, and I am not doing this to provide a point."" No real purpose resides in Lee's focus on racial tension, either, besides the fact of his interest in it. We're made to believe that Washington's character is satisfied by the diamond he receives, but doesn't that go against the motivation of his character's direct and businesslike manner? A ""bad guy"" not getting caught is an okay device, but for the purpose of some anti-heroic construction. This movie doesn't have that, it just has what is basically a sequence of events and then the letting go, or even purposeful forgetting, of them. So why tell the story in the first place? Of course, Lee's work is always somewhat ambiguous. Unfortunately, this time his ambiguity lacks real significance.Anyway, it's a pretty engaging and well-directed piece of work, it just ultimately leaves a lot to be desired. At least it provides proof that Lee can work quite well within the world of mainstream genre film-making, hopefully so that he can get funding for his more purposefully and significantly ambiguous works.--PolarisDiB",Inside Man
69,dfranzen70,Well plotted hostage thriller,7,30 August 2006,"Denzel Washington plays Frazier, an opportunistic New York detective trying to redeem his career who lucks into being the man in charge of defusing a possible hostage situation at a downtown bank.Only things aren't what they seem. For one thing, the robbers are very deliberate, taking their time to accomplish their task. For another, powerbroker/go-to gal Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) appears on the scene at the behest of the bank's president (Christopher Plummer) to retrieve something that the bank president keeps in a safe-deposit box. Sounds like someone has something to hide, doesn't it? Well, Frazier smells a rat, but nothing he tries seems to work. He at first is content to sit back and let the chief bad guy (Clive Owen) indicate his terms and conditions, maybe get him to release a hostage or two. But there are too many unknown variables at play. No one knows how many gunmen there are, or how many hostages. Or, most importantly, how the baddies plan to escape, since they're surrounded by hundreds of law-enforcement people, vehicles, and guns.So this turns into a cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Owen. From the audience's perspective, we can see that the robbers have dressed the captives just as they themselves are (i.e., gray pullover, sunglasses, and white mask), and sometimes they release one - just enough to keep Washington's Frazier off balance. He can't figure out what they're up to, but he also can't storm the bank and take them by force without risking the lives of an unknown number of hostages.The story is told in overlapping time frames: the standoff and the aftermath. This is instructive to the audience, as we can ascertain how the standoff ends. Ah, but the strength of the plot lies in the details. As the title bluntly puts it, someone - or some people - who were in the bank when it was commandeered were in on the heist. But who? We see Frazier and his partner interview the hostages, trying to ferret out the robbers, and from what they say we can piece together the rest of the story.Spike Lee does a wonderful job of maintaining the tension of the situation without really forwarding the plot, but there are some small problems with the script. Washington's character seems a little too glib; he's not quite snarky, just kind of flippant at times, and it doesn't feel right with the scene. I'm not sure if this is a product of Washington's acting or Lee's directing, but the two usually mesh much more seamlessly.All in all, The Inside Man is is a taut whodunnit, reminiscent of movies like Dog Day Afternoon and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, films that highlighted the congealed multinational humanity that is New York, that should keep you guessing until the end, although it does raise a few questions more than it answers.",Inside Man

71,Chris_Docker,Very polished heist movie,8,26 March 2006,"Intelligent, professionally made, very polished, and still with the streak of independence that has made Spike Lee's movies so famous, Inside Man demonstrates how to have a commercial cops-and-robbers movie that still retains artistic integrity and the power to entertain, thrill, and engage an adult audience. It's fast moving and witty, keeps you guessing to the end, and is sufficiently mentally stimulating to inspire conversation on the way home without intruding on your apres-cinema meal.Clive Owen is the heist mastermind, relating his perfect crime to the camera at outset before going to flashback. Denzel Washington is the New York detective who specialises in hostage negotiation. Christopher Plummer is the chairman of the bank's board of directors and maybe has more to lose than just the money. He consults Jodie Foster, a mysterious and powerful top-notch 'fixer'  a power-broker who can deliver.As the bank robbers lock themselves in, NYPD swing into action with crowd control (heavy-handed of course), an array of impressive equipment, and radio transmitters in pizza boxes. It's a convincing and exciting picture of Manhattan in full flow. Interspersed throughout the movie, post-bank-break-in testimonials from the hostages offer tantalising clues, but Owen and Washington are extremely clever at second guessing each other so you have to work hard to outwit both of them. The official website has an eight-page 'Hostage Negotiator's Handbook' as well as test scenarios in case you want to practice your skills first, but you'll need to be very smart to figure out the bottom line and how it's being achieved until all is revealed.Spike Lee, normally more at home making hard-hitting social commentary films, shows he is more than capable of turning out a faultless thriller (though he doesn't miss the chance to have a dig at policy brutality, racism and a few of his other favourite topics in passing). At over two hours long, mostly spent on a state of siege inside and outside the bank, Lee performs an admirable job in maintaining tension in the absence of car chases, murders and explosions. The 'hostage debriefings' are shot with subdued, almost greenish light, and contrast with the bright colours of the main action. The script is cleverly written, both in the ingeniousness of its plot and with its occasional burst of welcome humour. Actors are well-cast and used to best advantage, from Owen's insidious genius and Washington's intelligent rage to Jodie Foster who is a bit like a latter day Mata Hari that can put either of them in their place and almost without pausing for breath.This is a film that isn't the mindless, run-off-the-mill bank-robbery movie that audiences could be forgiven for expecting in the first half-hour, so it may disappoint those who wanted something less challenging. Inside Man, with its all-American credentials, never patronises its audience. Although there are some moral dimensions worth pondering, it doesn't have the angst-ridden agendas or unevenness of Spike Lee's earlier movies and is undoubtedly the director's most mature movie to date.",Inside Man
72,MaxBorg89,"A smart, rewarding thriller that sees Spike Lee return to form",9,18 January 2007,"When Empire magazine listed the 25 best movies of 2006, Inside Man was part of that list (number 19, to be more precise), and the brief review of Spike Lee's latest big screen outing read: ""First time in ages he's done the right thing!"". Now, I don't think it's the first time in years he's made a good film (I mean, what about the superb 25th Hour, which was released less than half a decade ago?), but it sure as hell marks a return to form after the interesting, but uneven, She Hate Me (2004). The problem with that movie was that it had enough material for two or three different films, with Lee trying to put it all in one flick. This time, though, he sticks to the main plot, with only one or two short digressions, thus delivering one of last year's most accessible and enjoyable films.On the surface, Inside Man may look like just another heist movie. The fact that it isn't is highlighted from the beginning, the opening sequence featuring Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaking straight to the camera and telling the audience he has a plan to pull off the perfect bank robbery. And within a couple of minutes from that scene, he puts his plan into action, using a very simple trick (posing as a painter) to enter a New York bank and ensure everyone cooperates. Naturally, it doesn't take that long before the NYPD is contacted and sends detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to negotiate with Russell. In the meantime, someone has told the bank's owner, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), about the ongoing robbery, and the old man, desperate to conceal some big secret, asks a woman named Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to help him. What was meant to be an ordinary crime has therefore become a mind game between the cop, the robber and the mysterious lady.In the hands of another filmmaker, this could have been a pretty formulaic genre film. However, this is a Spike Lee joint, so there's much more than the usual good guy/bad guy showdown. Inside Man is both exciting, funny and intelligent, Lee taking his time to briefly explore other territories as well. A scene where a Sikh hostage is mistaken for a terrorist (""Sh*t! A f*cking Arab!"") is a brilliant example of how to use (grotesque) humor to criticize the times we live in, and there's almost a Michael Mann-esquire feel to the relationship between Frazier and Russell, particularly when the two discuss the former's reluctance to getting married. Washington has plenty of fun and proves a convincing lead, even when he's making fun of himself (""I've got them right where I want'em"", he tells his partner; ""Where's that?"" ""Right behind me with my pants around my ankles, but it's a start"") and Owen is brilliant as the cunning thief, despite a less convincing American accent than the one he adopted in Sin City, because he's got the best material to work on: we don't care about his motive, partly since it's pretty clear he's not after the money, but we keep watching nonetheless, because his methods are fascinating. As for Foster, she's an intriguing presence, although the audience could have benefited from a little more insight on a woman so manipulative she's called ""a magnificent c*nt"" by the mayor of New York.So, Spike Lee may not be Christopher Nolan, and Inside Man certainly isn't Memento, but it is undoubtedly one of the most compelling films of 2006. Let's hope Lee keeps making them like this...",Inside Man
73,JasparLamarCrabb,A Sidney Lumet film directed by Spike Lee,7,12 April 2006,"Spike Lee's Sidney Lumet movie. After a gang of hoods take a bank full of people hostage, negotiator Denzel Washington slowly learns that they have no plans to rob the bank. Lee infuses the film with a lot of personality and the script develops even the most peripheral characters. As the head hostage taker, Clive Owen is suitably menacing and Washington is as good as he always is. The real surprise is Jodie Foster as a NYC power broker whose special talents are called upon mysterious bank president Christopher Plummer. Foster has never been sexier, wearing power suits and showing off a pair of gams that never end. The movie is at least twenty minutes too long, has a few too many endings and a couple of loose ends --- WHY is Owen in that bank? Nonetheless, it's still a gripping, highly entertaining thriller.",Inside Man
74,jimbo-53-186511,"Enjoyable, but it drags in places",6,28 April 2018,"Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is a master criminal who has spent an awful lot of time preparing and planning the ultimate heist - his target is a large bank in Manhattan. Attempting to thwart his plans are disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and broker Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) who is acting on behalf of the bank's CEO Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).Spike Lee's Inside Man is certainly intense and energetic in its early stages; when the gang enter the bank and take their hostages the film has a high level of tension and intensity - the elaborate lengths that they go to in order to stay one step ahead of the police are also quite clever. Where the film falters slightly are on occasions where the focus shifts away from the bank and on to other characters; whilst I could understand why Jodie Foster was in the film and what her character was all about I didn't feel that she made any real contribution and that she had any real impact on the film itself. It also has to be said that her character and story arc were undoubtedly the weakest aspect of the film and did drag it down slightly. Whilst I liked the idea of the film cutting between the heist and interviewing several people 'after the event' it all feels a bit disappointing when in the end it all serves very little purpose.Still going back to the positives, the film does have one or two twists along the way (although for every good twist there is another which is more obvious) and the acting is pretty good by everyone. It is pacey and energetic enough to make it worth watching, but it lacks the tight and fluid direction of a film like Dog Day Afternoon which is a film that it clearly aspires to be like (it is even referenced directly at one point in the film). The actual story behind the 'heist' is actually the strongest part of the film (it is certainly better than many of the gimmicky twists) and isn't as generic or obvious as one may initially assume. I also found it hard to really hate a film where boobs actually form part of the story (both Kim Director and Samantha Ivers assets were the focus of the film on a couple of occasions which was perfectly fine with me). Inside Man is a decent film and is worth watching, but it lacks tight direction and unfortunately it does drag in places. If you enjoyed this film then I would recommend that you watch Dog Day Afternoon which is a similar but much better film than this one.",Inside Man

76,noralee,A Rollicking NYC Roller Coaster Ride that Is the Triumph of Brain Over Brawn in a Heist Film,10,30 March 2006,"""Inside Man"" is terrific thriller, teasing us constantly as it deliciously delivers brains over brawn. Reveling in its very NYC atmosphere, it has much of the grittiness of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" crossed with the clever suspense of ""The Usual Suspects"". Following Clive Owen's arresting monologue to the audience that alerts us to pay attention to the clues (""I'm only going to say this once"" - though that's repeated at the end after we are realizing what he really meant), the opening scenes set up that director Spike Lee is for the first time using the clashing, unmelted pot of NYC's divergent races and immigrants not as a hortatory end in itself but to heighten and color what could have been just another perfect crime heist movie.Reversing the trek of ""The Warriors"", we are immediately on a relentlessly purposeful tour of the length of Brooklyn from Coney Island through its diverse ethnic neighborhoods representing the corners of the globe to the gargoyles of Wall Street, the center of the world's financial power, all to the rollicking beat of a symbolic ""Bollywood Joint"" featuring Panjabi MC, a leader in the bhangra blend of dance and Indian diaspora pop music. When we are first introduced to various ethnic types among the cops and the bank customers I was afraid that Lee was doing his broad brush stereotypes again as he did to nasty effect in ""Summer of Sam"", but instead it's all slyly setting up the red herrings, cul-de-sacs and final outcome in Russell Gewirtz's roller coaster ride of a debut feature script. Some of the best dialog is in pointed exchange of raw identities that almost trump the main action, whether an Albanian or Sikh or Armenian or Jewish grandmother or racist officer or sexist punk or rich WASP Park Avenue CEO, plus we see NYC's rainbows of Asians, Latinos, workers and politicians, old and young. Many of the lines are laugh out loud funny and marvelously ironic.Owen plays on the cold bad Brit stereotype we've seen from Alan Rickman in ""Die Hard"" to Paul Bettany in ""Firewall"" before doing his version of the right thing while the smart alecky boy amusingly recalls the fresh kid inevitably nicknamed Brooklyn who is in every World War II movie troupe, as he shocks the bank robber with his violent and racist video game (played while they're sitting in the bank vault). Everybody has prejudices or pre-suppositions or a deal to make that are confused by the robbers' physical and strategic masks (coincidentally recalling the symbolic use of the Guy Fawkes' masks in ""V for Vendetta"") and cleverly edited shuffling of positions. The flash forward interrogations of the hostages by a wily Denzel Washington -- who is just plain enjoying the tripping on his tongue of sharp dialog more than he had in his several other detective roles-- are jarringly integrated in with a grainy look throughout to give us revelatory clues about what is really going on to emphasize that we can't assume anything about anyone we see even when he seems just too suspicious. This is a constantly keep 'em guessing story with visual bread crumbs dribbled out for us to follow. It's nice to see Jodie Foster play a tough broad who is a talker not an action hero, even if her smarmy fixer doesn't make 100% sense in the plot, though her nefarious negotiating in front of a flag tribute to 9/11 is a chuckle about the American Way. Christopher Plummer is repeating an elegantly corrupt type we've seen him do many times, most recently in ""Syriana"", and his explication was a bit too conveniently delivered for the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Washington's partner and Willem Dafoe as the technocrat are underused throughout in restrained roles. While I appreciate that Washington's sexy girlfriend is given a career as a fellow cop, which is unusual for this genre, I was disappointed that she seems to be half his age. It was nice to see the usually comic Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell in a small serious appearance. The production design details of NYC accuracy are an utter delight, from real TV stations to the authentic feel of NYPD's handling of emergencies to the current Mayor's bull pen office at City Hall plus script references to real people in sports and government. Even the sound design reinforces the realistically gripping experience.Terence Blanchard's score is much less jazzy than his other works for Lee's films and matches the action and human variety we see on the screen.The gang's calling themselves variations of ""Steve"" seems like an amusing crossing of Howard Hawks with Quentin Tarantino.The closing credits are generous in giving full attention to the very large ensemble by letting us match their personas to the actors.While the violence is more implied than real, but still scary, the dialog is full of rampant, explicit profanity so I was surprised that folks brought very young children to a matinée.",Inside Man
77,davispittman,Top Noche!,9,3 July 2016,"Inside man is an excellent film starring Denzel Washington and Jodie foster. Denzel, Jodie, and Clive Owen all work together very well on screen, and they play their individual characters perfectly, I really loved the casting for this movie. The plot summary is also very intriguing and it pulls you in, trust me, you won't want to stop watching this movie until the very end, there definitely won't be any walk outs or people quitting on it before it's over. Clive Owen is such a meticulous and wise/sharp robber here, I was very impressed with the words he chose and his mannerisms and how he interacted with the detectives and police. You realize that this robber is very clever and that he knows what he's doing. And you won't actually know what the movie is all about until the end comes, this is not the average bank robbery cookie-cutter plot, this movie has many very different layers to it. I really liked the pacing of this movie too, I didn't think the pacing was too slow or too fast, I thought it was just right. The critics got it right with this movie, it is excellent. The run time is good too, it's a little over two hours, but the longevity of the film is very necessary. Inside Man receives a 9/10! I 100% recommend this film. The ending is very smart and clever too, I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that the robber knows what he's doing.",Inside Man

80,drystyx,Hits and misses,6,5 December 2017,"There really isn't any incentive for watching these movies, because of the poor directing that is set as a standard for modern movies, and because of the lack of inspiration caused by establishment writers stealing ideas from the better writers, as this movie so obviously shows us.It isn't a bad movie, but it has the flaws of modern movie making.It's a ""bank heist with hostage"" movie, but it's clear from the start that something else is happening. When the robbers separate the many hostages, and make everyone change garb over and over, including the garb of the robbers, we know they are intending to blend in with the crowd at the end in some way.In effect, it's much like the 1960 war movie, THEN THERE WERE THREE, in which a German is disguised as an American during a big battle involving many units that get split apart. The war movie is a hidden classic because of low budget and few big names, but it is written and directed skillfully.The first problem is the inane modern day use of ""mixing time frames"" which not only doesn't fit here, but is stupid, because it is contrived. It's a device meant to confuse whereas it doesn't work in real life. It only serves to hide the flaws of the plot. If you see the movie, you'll understand.Second problem is that every one of the hostages and robbers looks exactly alike. I believe there are about 4 that don't fit the pattern. All the men look alike, and most of the women look alike. And yet we're supposed to understand who is saying what at any time? Added to the ""time frame mix"".Third, no detective is as astute as Denzel's character. Of course, this is spoken of in the movie. Detectives are unimaginative and have no sense of reality compared to the cop on the beat. They're upwardly mobile machines who are incorrect about everyone most of the time, because they adhere to these dark ages of Psychiatry and Sociology meant to give the squeaky wheel the grease and avoid being hurt themselves.Fourth, the flood of information. That means all the useless crap we get that is purely in the movie to showcase or advertise someone's dialect, product, etc.. Because of the nature of this movie, that works as long as it doesn't interfere with the reality of the viewer piecing together the puzzle. It sets the viewer back from what the actual detective is piecing together.This fourth flaw is important, because it a simulation of modern culture, including Academia. Colleges and businesses pretend to give tests to grade students, but for the past 30 years, at the very least, have instead cheated. For example, a professor will ask a question in an oral test to a student, and then after the student answers, the professor will change the question, and will be backed up by the students who are part of the establishment. This happens in all U.S. universities I have attended. Businesses do this, too. It's the modern norm to keep control in the hands of the mob.Herein lies also the strength of the movie. The fact that no one really knows anything, and everyone is lying. However, the script is not very good at showing that.The fifth flaw is characters that no one can relate to. Again, this is because of modern culture, and because the control freaks are in control. They actually think we enjoy them bragging about their hatefulness, but only the geeks enjoy that. There is absolutely no explanation or credibility in some of the characters, particularly the blond woman who acts as a go between for police, bank president, and robber. She would never have been let into the situation by any of them. But then, this also serves as a strength of the movie, because Tarantino is telling us that the control freaks in charge are too moronic and self righteous to realize this woman is nothing. She has no assets. She's normal looking, not pretty by any means. She says nothing, offers nothing, and yet the ones in authority kowtow to her. That actually works. However, when Denzel's character gives in to her, we lose respect for him, too.The characters are mostly poorly written and done. The usual Hollywood preaching of ""bank robbers are cool"" fools the naïve, but not the rest of us, and it irks sane people.There are other modern movie flaws, but the production team was wise enough not to show that this ""modern movie making"" was indeed a flaw. It's a self depreciating bit that does make a point.Hits and misses. The worst part is the ""mixed time frame"" element. Get rid of that, and the movie will be a lot better.",Inside Man
81,EUyeshima,"Spike, a Sharp Cast and Crafty Script Bring Dimension to Tense Hostage Drama",8,2 April 2006,"It's good to see filmmaker Spike Lee come back to form with this highly entertaining popcorn movie that transcends the tense hostage crisis portrayed with a clever plot of psychological gamesmanship and duplicity. At first, the film feels like it's going to be a new millennium update of Sidney Lumet's 1975 classic, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", complete with Terence Blanchard's jazzy, 1970's-sounding score. Lee, however, spices the story with his own sensibilities around urban survival and post-9/11 racial tensions, and the movie benefits greatly from the perspective of a director not known for such predictable genre pictures. While it runs a bit long at 125 minutes, there is so much zigzag to the proceedings that the length is forgivable.Impressively written by first-time screenwriter Russell Gewirtz, the plot meticulously unfolds on a precise, need-to-know basis as it focuses on the mano-a-mano game between coolly confident criminal Dalton Russell and cynical NYPD detective Keith Frazier after Russell and his crew hold up a Lower Manhattan bank and keep fifty hostages at gunpoint. This is no standard good-versus-evil melodrama, as Gewirtz and Lee give both characters a lot of intriguing texture which make them fascinating adversaries in an unlikely search for a common bond. Audaciously, Lee chooses not to spotlight so much on the suspense elements of the tense situation at hand since the movie includes flash-forward interviews with freed hostages. Rather, the film is far more involved with the characters' motivations and what they are willing to do to move toward resolution.An additional wrinkle is the bank chairman Arthur Case, who is worried about securing the confidential contents of his safe-deposit box once the robbery is underway. At this point, he hires Madeline White, a coolly calculating, designer-outfitted power broker willing to negotiate with Russell to get the box. How all four characters dance around each other is the primary pleasure to be derived from the movie, as one keeps guessing what each will do to get to his or her objective. Moreover, Lee's trademark touches are everywhere from the unexpected sparks of comedy - some piercing in their political incorrectness but no less funny - to the artificial backward zooms that make characters look like they are on conveyor belts to the idiosyncratic behavior of the hostages.Casting is just about ideal here. It's no surprise that longtime Lee muse Denzel Washington is terrific as Frazier, showing the character's flaws, ambition and moxie with maximum fluency. Clive Owen has the most cryptic role as Russell, but he manages to exude supreme confidence and a conflicted conscience with minimal fuss. Leave it to Lee to capitalize on Jodie Foster's inherently chilly intellect and subvert it to make the patronizing White a curiously ambiguous and utterly fascinating figure. There is nice supporting work by Christopher Plummer expertly shifting between benign and treacherous as Case, Willem Dafoe surprisingly non-villainous as the head of the SWAT Team, and especially British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor a completely convincing New Yorker as Frazier's enthusiastic partner. There is a nice twist at the end, but Gewirtz's script makes it satisfying within the context of the entire plot. This is a deft, character-driven thriller most welcome during the typical late winter/early spring movie-going doldrums.",Inside Man
82,Jonny_Numb,Potentially great thriller gets lost amid an aimless civics lesson,6,24 November 2006,"In Jan De Bont's 1994 action extravaganza ""Speed,"" he pitted Keanu Reeves and a busload of ethnic/social/economic stereotypes against a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper); it was a taut, intense, and breezily implausible ride that didn't leave the viewer pondering much afterward. On initial glance, Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is another concoction in the mold of De Bont's film, but is undermined by the director's unleashed tendency to prod us with a civics lesson. While this is the kind of thing you expect from a glorified After-School Special like ""Crash,"" it does not help along an alleged thriller...as a matter of fact, every time Lee brings a new ethnic stereotype into the fray, the film comes to a screeching halt because his technique is so heavy-handed (the racist patrolman; the busty Albanian translator; the Muslim who natters endlessly about his turban). The result is a film of diffused intensity through and through--which is a shame, because its setup promises something very cool: Clive Owen plays a crafty extortionist who takes over a branch of a Manhattan bank with his masked, hooded partners; bank head Christopher Plummer is extremely concerned about the contents of a safe-deposit box inside; Jodie Foster is enlisted as an impartial 'fixer' to negotiate things with Owen. Meanwhile, Denzel Washington reprises his 'flawed-yet-resourceful cop' role, trying to figure out Owen's motivation...which, to the film's credit, is unique. The leads turn in good--if rather typical--performances, and the cinematography puts us within the action very well...but ""Inside Man""'s suspense is constantly thwarted by a manufactured look and some of the most artificial supporting characters ever put on-screen. That, and Lee's aforementioned perpetuating of the racial divide at the expense of story and thrills...well, it makes one long for the summer of '94, when ""Speed"" delivered entertaining action, sans a political agenda.5.5 out of 10",Inside Man
83,nycritic,The Heist With a Trick Up its Sleeve,10,18 August 2006,"Spike Lee wouldn't be the kind of director who would be called on to do this kind of film. INSIDE MAN is more on the vein of the works of David Mamet, who has tackled this genre several time with fairly clever results. However, the story of INSIDE MAN, while on the surface a basic heist inside a bank with all of the elements present, is interested less in the eventual shoot-out between cops, marshals, and the criminals, or even in a deep, co-dependent relationship between the Main Guy and the Main Cop as was the bulk of the story of DIE HARD back in 1988. INSIDE MAN is an excellent crime thriller, a puzzle that practically gives its solution in the way it's own narration evolves, but one that is strong on plot, stronger still on acting, and strongest on its gradual build-up, in which nothing is as it seems at first glance and a group of criminals may have concocted the perfect bank robbery. Clive Owen essays yet another of his dark villains (maybe his own physique is to blame; I can't see him playing a lightweight role in the vein of Cary Grant, there's just something brooding underneath that every so often explodes in dangerous rage, and I've seen it happen since CLOSER). Jodie Foster, cast totally against type, plays a powerful woman who has a degree of mystery about her and who has reached a point in her life where she can make deals with the Devil, call it a monster, and walk out, smiling. Her Madeline White is anything but -- she's a sneering, calculating, bitch with her hands firmly planted in the steering wheel of power -- and it's great to see Foster finally break out of her ""altruistic heroine"" or ""victim"" role for once! Denzel Washington, however, is the drive of the movie, and practically skips his way through his scenes like it was recess and he was impersonating Shaft -- and his character is given quite the kinky side, a rarity in crime dramas, but a nice touch courtesy of Lee himself. Chiwetel Ejiofor (KINKY BOOTS), Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Plummer have small but noteworthy parts.",Inside Man

But this movie really made me reassess what I have thought about this director.The movie starts of with a surprise musical choice: Panjabi music. I still have no idea why Spike Lee decided on such a selection, but it almost conveys the fact that this movie is unpredictable and works outside the box.Really quite a brilliant piece of work with the script really setting new standards for 'bank job' movies. The suspense is constant. The idea behind the heist sound and slick. The execution is inventive if simple. The actors do a great to excellent job. And that includes everyone from the main actors (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen) and the supporting cast (Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ojiofor, Willem Dafoe) to the smallest of characters... Immense work from the director and kudos to being able to keep his whole vision intact.An additional bonus to the whole intrigue and primary action are short social and racial commentaries, which are darn brilliant, even if superfluous. Spike Lee however nails it every time, with the Sikh incident being the highlight of the movie. These elements were to an extent reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's earlier work. But this is a whole new level of what Tarantino has been striving to achieve. Respect to Tarantino for showing the way, but this movie shows just how comparatively lacking he is as a director.This movie almost makes me think that Spike Lee may not only be one of the greatest African-American directors of his generation.

Dalton Russell is a bank robber, who planned the perfect bank robbery. Hostages are at stake and Frazier needs to get them out. When an unexpected guest arrives, Madaline White, Frazier begins to believe that there is more to this heist then just the money.A Spike Lee Joint, one of his better joints if you ask me. Leaving his ""pro black, con white"" message in his past, Lee has made an entertaining heist film that makes you side with the bad guy just because he is cool. Right from the get-go Owen tells you the What, Why, Where, When and eventually the How on the perfect bank robbery. Hearing this, you get the impression that he will be successful in this attempt. I'm not going to tell you whether he is or isn't, but throughout the entire movie, even though you might not want to, you can't help but cheer for Owen to get away with it in the end.While viewing the trailer, one gets the impression that Inside Man is more then just a normal heist flick and it is. It's difficult to go into an explanation of the plot without giving some bits of it away, as I've probably already have done for some. The plot of the film is interesting, although some may be expecting a bigger pay-off in the end, Inside Man does deliver the twists and turns, just not as big as some may suspect.Lee throws in his usual character has a racist moment as he does with virtually every film he does. He also manages to have fun with the time line and give us some testimonies of the survivors, it manages to flow well with the film. Here Lee is able to keep up with what's on the screen. He makes the plot follow along smoothly, up until the end though, where the film unexpectedly goes on and on dragging the viewer with it. It has to have that clichéd ending where the detective realizes what has just happened.The performances are top-notch. Washington delivers us another great performance as the tough cop who seems to catch on to the scheme quicker then others. Jodie Foster gives a good performance with what little she has, even if her character has no background information what so ever as to what she does or who she is. She just happens to be there and with connections. Clive Owen is great as the bad guy, even if his face is covered for 3/4 of the film. He is so cool and sly as the villain that you end up rooting for him, knowing that it's the wrong thing to do. William Dafoe rounds out the supporting cast and along with Foster, doesn't have much screen time. This is forgivable because Washington and Owen are so good on the screen that you wish the story would stick with them.Inside Man begins as an action thriller and takes a quick turn to something a little bit more sophisticated, once we get inside the bank with our captives. The film itself will make you want to try and plan your own ""perfect robbery"". Lee gives us a great heist film that I'm sure will be mentioned with the best of them. If Inside Man was a bit shorter...such as cutting out some ""digging hole"" scenes and a better wrap up, then it could have qualified for an early start to one of the year's best films. But for now it can just stay as being an entertaining heist flick....oh yeah, get ready to root for the bad guy.",Inside Man
87,pc95,"Interesting Story, editing, but sometimes poor dialogue, music",7,27 August 2006,"Overall I enjoyed this film for #1 especially not indulging in ultra-violence as well as it's charades and antics reminiscent of The Thomas Crown Affair a it. It's strengths far outweigh the few problems that I felt were minor - one of which was some of the dialogue. For instance some of the racial banter and pretentious movie homages (""ever seen Dog-Day-Afternoons"") throw-ins were out of place. Then I thought Jodie Foster looked completely out of her element in trying to portray immoral uppity behaivor. She looked sort of uncomfortable. Also the music sometimes didn't mesh well in some scenes. However, thanks to Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer for anchoring; so the movie kept the interest level up. Denzel Washington was a little bit toned done - but still entertaining. The editing was good, and directors know to leave narration to the English....always the safe and good bet - well done by Owen. I'm a pretty big fan of narration kept concise. This was a good movie, not quite worth the buy imo, but the rental for sure.",Inside Man
88,Luigi Di Pilla,Stop doing these boring and disappointing movies,5,10 September 2006,"I was already tired from my day and I thought that it would keep my attention but it helped me nearly to fall asleep and my wife too. I am disappointed after I have seen this cheap disaster because I expected more action and suspense but there was not enough of all them. The marketing and publicity of this product promised all an intelligent and perfect thriller but I missed all these elements. Even on the DVD-cover was written that. There were two or three weak points and the end was just very poor without any aha-effect. I am surprised that Inside Man did earn such a great gross amount at the US Box Office because it's a predictable and slow paced story. Okay, there were some good political jokes but that was all. Denzel Washington was funny but it was not his best performance. For all these reasons I think that the actual vote with 7.5 is too overrated.

However the intricate plot it tries to tell us, has some obscure or less well explained aspects beginning by the motives and personality of the robbers. The first part of the movie is convincing in terms of action and situations and the dialogues are lively and witty. But from the moment where the character of the president (and owner) of the stormed bank begins to define itself in terms of his past guilty actions, the story becomes banal and ends in a very uninteresting and meaningless way.

He delivers the goods in this heist movie about the PERFECT BANK ROBBERY. there are a few twists and a great line in this movie about a Pina Colada. Denzel just always delivers the goods no matter what! The part where the execution took place was a great scene. Denzel was on some sort of cart and was thrust forward in anger. Hard to explain but it was a very interesting scene to say the least. I saw this just after eating at Rubios and missed a few minutes.

Denzel phones his performance in and there is so much racism and misogyny as to make a documentary.No one cares about the 50 hostages. No one bats an eye at allowing Jodie Foster into a bank full of raging gun men armed to the teeth.I'm amazed I sat through it to the end but it offered many laughs as to keystone cops procedures (they dropped the case at the end because, hey nothing was stolen but the hostages were held captive for a day? No charges for that?). Oh sleepy Denzel was kicked off the case at midpoint but he's still working it all through the second half? Lots of police tactical equipment and stalking around importantly but really light on the dialogue or a comprehensible script.The weary Christopher Plummer is the villian.But why in gawd's name didn't he steal his own bloody box? He owned the bank!!Avoid.0/10.",Inside Man
95,Screen_Blitz,Smart heist thriller puts Spike Lee in the spotlight,8,17 April 2016,"Director Spike Lee gears up sheer suspense, a powerful plot, and a compelling, though slightly flawed screenplay by Russell Gewirtz of a bank robbery gone wrong in this heist thriller starring the stellar cast of frequent Spike Lee collaborator Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Chiwetel Eijiofor, and Jodie Foster. Owen plays Dalton Russell, a violent but intelligent criminal who orchestrates a bank heist at a local Manhattan bank that quickly turns into a high-stakes negotiation situation between detective Frazier (played by Denzel Washington), his partner Bill Mitchell (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor), Captain John Darius (played by William Dafoe) and high-powers broker Madeleine White (played by Jodie Foster) when Russell's comrades take the occupants hostage. With bank president Arthur Case (played by Christopher Plummer) vowing to protect a case containing secret war items and hostage pitted as suspects by the vicious bank robbers, the rookie detectives and the SWAT team are the only chances of bringing Russell and his comrades to justice and saving the hostages. However, as tensions heat up, the law enforcement learn that the criminals are not just after money, but an airplane. And the mystery is: what do they want it for?This heist film has plenty of smarts and elements that make up for a tense, compelling thriller with brooding suspense. Rather than focusing on violent shootouts and confrontations, this thriller leaves fair room for tense interrogations and political themes including war connections to war, while blending cohesive thrills and violence. One major subplot consists of bank president played by Christopher Plummer desperate to protect a briefcase filled with Nazi documents from World War II. References to 9/11 scares also come into play, with one of the suspects being Muslim leading to suspicion with the law enforcement. The biggest light however, comes from the tense atmosphere of the bank robbery. From the opening minutes of the fledging criminals' arrival, the film pits viewers with a strong plethora of thrills and suspense, with intersecting cuts to scenes of Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Eijiofor interrogating various hostages and suspects. Though the robbery scenes often consists of elements that strongly resemble those of the terrorist attack in 'Die Hard', there is plenty of edge-of-your-seat thrills to captivate viewers, while leaving others uncomfortable and disturbed by the robbers' sadism; although the main antagonist is not portrayed exactly as a vicious savage with bloodlust, but a man with a heart and humanity. The plot doesn't always have its novelty however. The film works well for the most of the first half, but eventually sprawls through some tonal inconsistencies during the second half. Overall, Director Spike Lee steers the film in the solid direction, even the plot slips off track towards its climax. After all, how hard is it to enjoy the genuine performances by the cast, especially Clive Owen who brings solid conviction to the the main antagonist. Inside Man is smart and compelling heist thriller, though it has a few flaws. It is a strong and compelling portrayal of the heist genre, and demonstrates the true vivids efforts by director Spike Lee. The film is certainly no classic nor does it try to be, but it is utterly intriguing.",Inside Man
96,punishmentpark,No clean getaway.,4,11 February 2014,"First off, read the review by 'sissoed'; it has some very good arguments why this film really doesn't work, even if the points made about the faulty investigation cóuld be nullified simply because there are influential forces up high (via Case and White) that wanted the investigation literally, as said in the film, 'buried'. Beyond that, an influential man like Case could probably get some contract killers to 'get rid' of Frazier in a more or less inconspicuous way (as could White, probably) when he still decided to carry on. And points 2 and 3 by 'sissoed' are spot on; bad morality in the end and why would Frazier so gladly take that 'blood diamond' (I've read elsewhere that hé could have been an inside man, but I consider that to be nonsense)? I can understand the fact that White has less moral objections to working with Case, though. Another point: why would Case not have the particular safe registered something made up, something 'safe' (and even then, how would anyone find out about it if he was the only who knew about it?)... well, questions that raise more questions than anything else, I suppose.Other than that: neat, but standard heist flick which, in plan, reminded me a little of 'Quick Change'... before you blindly go check that one out: it's a (great) caper with Bill Murray! The acting here is just fine and for a long time the story is rather intriguing, but it becomes more and more dull as we wait along with the negotiator. No, wait, the robbers. No, wait again... erm... who were we waiting for, exactly? And then it spirals out of control as described in paragraph one.4 out of 10.",Inside Man
97,dunmore_ego,The Heistman Cometh.,7,7 April 2006,"Movie opens with Clive Owen, as Dalton Russell, in hard close-up, warning us to listen to every word he says, because he'll only say it once. (As George McFly might say, I don't think I can handle that kind of pressure.) Dalton goes on to boast of his Perfect Heist; we know he speaks truth because we are shown heist scenes inter-cut with flash-forwards of the cops getting nowhere interrogating hostages. *Inside Man*, a Spike Lee Joint, is structured so that we know the outcome during the first act  at least, we think we do  for there is a robbery within a robbery in this heist, and it is that secondary robbery which gets everyone's knickers knotted.With Clive Owen laying down his customary foreboding, soft-spoken Hard Guy; with Denzel Washington plying his smooth blackness, playing yet another Intelligent Cop (is that oxymoron?); with Christopher Plummer settling into one of his comfort-zone characters  black-hearted CEO (is that tautology?); with Willem Dafoe playing it straighter than his Jesus as a SWAT captain, this movie seems all too familiar, yet director Lee and writer Russell Gewirtz exploit the symbiotic triangle of heister-hostage-heat in refreshing ways.The heisters do not seem too concerned with looting cash; the hostages are regularly interchanged with their captors (in being forced to dress like their captors, in blue jumpsuit, mask and shades, we are never sure who the true hostages or ""inside men"" are); the heat  Denzel, as Detective Frazier  is not as ethical as most leading police characters are painted. This all culminates in a satisfying resolution which illustrates that not every heist movie has to land someone in jail to comply with MPAA hypocrisy.Amongst all the ""comfortable"" leading roles, only Jodie Foster plays hard against type, doing some strange hybrid of *Ocean's Twelve* School of Smug by way of Vincent Wolf from *Pulp Fiction*, playing a kind of ""cleaner"" for the super-rich, with inside connections so high and dirty that - like Austin Powers - ""Danger"" is her middle name. I'm still trying to figure out how much scenery was chewed.After the heist is underway at a Manhattan bank  with the usual scenes of cameras deactivated ingeniously, this-is-a-stick-up and we-mean-business - head CEO of the bank, Arthur Case (Plummer), enlists the aid of Madeline White (Foster) to safeguard a life-damaging secret he harbors in one of the bank's safety deposit boxes.No matter her over-the-cheese performance, it is refreshing to see a strong female character (Foster) who does NOT use sex as her social-climbing lever or power-mongering weapon, but sheer politics instead. Not that she is devoid of female wiles; there is a scene in long shot, tracking Foster walking alongside Plummer, explaining how she will aid him  an exposition totally lost on me, as my discernment was temporarily impaired by the vision of secretariat skirt cleaving to muscled buttock and silk-tanned legs. Convent-severe and domina-disciplined, Foster comes off as dangerous all right  but in the wrong way: not dangerous like she'll stymie your career or have you shot - dangerous like she's going to clamp your nipples too tight or grind a 5-inch spike heel into your scrotum. *Caveat homo.* Story structure then denotes that if a CEO is desperate to guard a secret, it will be that selfsame secret that the thieves are after.Amongst the thieves, stunning Kim Director, a cross between Liv Tyler and a Robinsons-May mannequin (her fifth outing with Lee, second with Washington). There is much ado made over her ample bosom. As above, I concede to paying absolutely no attention to anything else during those segments. So sue me for being a fully functioning male.Any film that alludes to three Pacino films has to be doing something right - even if what it's doing right is just mentioning those films; Frazier's sidekick, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) cites the Michael Corleone method of disposition (""Do you renounce Satan?  Bam!""); Dalton mockingly refers to Frazier as ""Serpico""; and Frazier throws in a reference to *Inside Man*'s granddaddy, *Dog Day Afternoon* - a self-deprecating jab, letting us know the filmmakers are well aware of how closely their pic follows Al's lead.All *Inside Man*'s characters are portrayed as intelligent (with no silly ""movie"" slip-ups to drive the plot to a crime-doesn't-pay conclusion). Therefore, Dalton's mundane request for a bus and plane are taken with suspicion of stalling by Frazier, who realizes Dalton is too wily to be pulling your average Dog Day heist. (The only person who displays insurmountable stupidity is Arthur Case, whose incriminating secret could have been disposed of with a twenty-dollar paper shredder or the flush of a toilet.) The game of outguessing one another wears thin enough for the SWAT captain to take the drastic measure of storming the bank.Just the way Dalton planned it Suffice to say, there are surprises in store. And note that the title is not pertaining to the hostage switcharounds, but a wry reference to Dalton's method of deluding the heat in the final scenes.Bad Guys win.And somewhere, an MPAA censor has been fired for letting this dissident message go unchecked in free Christian amerika.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Inside Man

99,KUAlum26,"Great concept, strong cast and yet...{{Spoilers Possible}}",7,7 September 2006,"...something feels a little wanting here.Spike Lee,continuing to gradually drift away from the straight,socio-political meat movies that made him famous(Do the Right Thing,Jungle Fever,Malcolm X,Get On the Bus) and towards more general genres(Crooklyn,Clockers,Girl 6,Summer of Sam)helms this film which is intended to be a crime caper. I say intended because the story takes fragmented turns throughout,no doubt to be the(or part of the)""twist""this movie aims for.On a seemingly typical New York City morning at a large branch bank,a highly elaborate robbery takes place and in the process,a large number of hostages are taken. The leader of this effort,Dalton Ross(Clive Owen,interesting choice and doesn't disappoint)has planned this effort to the letter,creating a situation that has the NYPD scrambling. One detective,Frazier(Denzel Washington,cool and smart,game for any head-game out there) is reading the situation and seems to be able to make a psychological connection with Ross. At the same time,the upright bank founder and owner(Christopher Plummer),sensing that there may be some sort of sticky mess on the loom thanks to this burglary,employs an outside agent--a ""fixer"",as she's referred to--named White(Jodie Foster)to try to work in concert with the police get what he wants.As said before,this is a neat concept of a film:basically,a crime caper that sort of ""knows"" what it is and yet moves at a somewhat different pacing and aim. I'm coming perilously close to revealing stuff about this film,so I'll only say that you the viewer if you choose to watch this will be well-advised to AVOID jumping to any conclusions during the run of the movie. I say that,because I kinda fell into that trap a few times while watching this. Writer Russell Gewirtz's script seems to be striving to be a little TOO clever,and the cut-aways and non-sequitirial jumps in the linnear progress of the story can be somewhat(if not a lot)discombobulating and irritating. Washington and Owen are strong here,Foster doesn't seem to quite belong in this movie and plummer seems to be playing something he's been playing a little too often,namely upright elder-statesmen who have potential for keeping ugly skeletons in their closets. Director Lee's social commentary is limited but smart,with the very few of his observations leveled mostly on the NYPD police and how they can over-react and assume(a la profiling)to suspects or perceived suspects in a crisis situation.Interesting,somewhat difficult to warm up to,I'd still say that this film shouldn't let down fans of most of the principals of this film(particularly Denzel's). My only real tip for viewing this movie is this:watch it to the end and keep an open mind.",Inside Man
100,pyrocitor,Lee's mainstream effort leaves something to be desired,6,5 September 2006,"Considering director Spike Lee's usual, more provocative and heated material, Inside Man, a more conventional suspense thriller seemed a bit of a change of form. Therefore, one would expect the director to have something clever up his sleeve, something genuinely different or shocking, a reason why he would accept a project so seemingly mundane and ordinary. It's likely that assumption that particularly drew viewers to see Inside Man, in short to see the trick Lee had up his proverbial sleeve, the huge twist or execution that would make Inside Man stand out enough to have the director depart from his usual material to accept it. Unfortunately enough, though such a clever twist may seem inherent throughout the film's course, it never really surfaces, leaving us as an audience constantly wanting more, hoping something more interesting and genuinely shocking and throughout provoking might turn up. Needless to say, this never really happens, and as such, Inside Man culminates as nothing more than a watered down run of the mill suspense thriller filled with plot holes and the occasional clever part. The first twist in the ""huge double-twist ending"" becomes so obvious early on in the story that when it surfaces in a crescendo of dramatic music, it doesn't come as surprising at all. The second twist may pose a bit more of a surprise, and may take a bit of thought, but still... one would expect better. And even for those who did not predict either twist early on,there's still the apathy factor. There's a constant sense of ""so what?"" throughout the story, as if the audience starts to question each new occurrence or event throughout the story, half-heartedly hoping that it will somehow lead to a sudden twist one would have to be carefully following to catch. In actuality, when it becomes more and more apparent this isn't going to happen, our minds start to wander and wonder why so much detail is paid to tiny, near insignificant details, or oddball occurrences, such as the constantly resurfacing Indian music, again with no plausible reason or explanation. Quite simply, the film is lacking a spark, a punch, to make the material really hit home and become relevant, or even watchable to us, the viewers. As it is, Lee loses control of us, and instead of being drawn into the half-hearted suspense, we simply wonder what is the point.Denzel Washington is easily the best aspect of the movie, his charismatic, joking, easygoing yet intelligent hostage negotiator is a truly amicable lead, the kind of quality absent from the rest of the film. Clive Owen makes a good enough antagonistic figure as the chief bank robber, but his ""calm but calculating"" side which is meant to make his character seem truly menacing in the end just makes him seem too docile to pose much of an actual threat. Jodie Foster has very little to do in a tiny little role as a mysterious financial adviser sent to speak with Owen's character regarding more under the table matters. She has such a little effect on the story however, that one wonders why her character was included in the story at all, and not just more incorporated into another character. Similarly, the excellent Willem Dafoe is given absolutely nothing to do as a police captain, and it seems such a waste to give such a talented actor such a mundane and devoid of personality role. Christopher Plummer however is a strong presence as the owner of the bank in process of being robbed, who may or may not know more about it than it seems.All in all, Inside Man manages to pass itself off as an intelligent and tense thriller through trailers and publicity, but in the end is nothing special in the least - just another watered down, suspense thriller where the suspense is next to non- existent. There may be the occasional clever or quirky touch, but the inevitable racial component to the story (a particularly memorable scene recalls a bank clerk putting up a huge argument after his turban is removed by the police) is so predictable and out of place it simply raises a groan. Washington may make an excellent lead, but he is the high point in a movie which ultimately comes across as uninspired and uninteresting attempt at breeding tension and suspense. It's not a good sign for a movie's quality and content when the words which come to mind the most are ""so what?"". Such is the case for Inside Man - those not fans of Spike Lee or any of the stars might want to give this one a pass for a more intelligent and engaging thriller.-6/10",Inside Man
101,xredgarnetx,Entertaining to a point,6,12 August 2006,"When is a bank robbery not a bank robbery? That is the million dollar question in Spike Lee's INSIDE MAN, a tricky crime thriller starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Bad guy Owen is holding 50 people hostage during what appears to be the robbery of a Manhattan-based bank, and Washington is a stressed-out, possibly larcenous detective who must talk Owen into releasing the hostages and giving himself up. The first half of INSIDE MAN is a gritty, fast-paced crime yarn, while the second is an intellectual exercise in piecing together just what happened while the bank was under siege. INSIDE MAN is Washington's film all the way, a huge improvement over OUT OF TIME, his last outing as a stressed-out, possibly larcenous law enforcer. Everyone else -- Owen as the bank robber-not-bank-robber, WIllem Dafoe as a fellow cop, Christopher Plummer as the bank's shady president and Jodie Foster as an even shadier ""fixer"" who poses as a real estate mogul -- plays second fiddle to Washington in this one. Is INSIDE MAN a must-see? Not by a long shot, especially with a second half that crawls to the finish and distracting cinematography as the film jumps back and forth in time. Is it a compelling bank heist yarn? Not really, once we understand the bigger picture, which unfortunately is telegraphed early on. But the movie should make for a pleasant, nothing-else-to-do kind of evening viewing, if nothing else just to watch Washington in action.",Inside Man
102,seymourblack-1,"The Heist, The Hostages & Some Dark Secrets",8,16 April 2018,"""Inside Man"" is a routine bank heist movie that's been made more interesting by the inclusion of a succession of entertaining twists, a collection of colourful characters and a surprising motive for the crime. Predictably, for a Spike Lee ""joint"", it also makes some political points about racial profiling, disrespecting religious beliefs and the damaging influences that violent video games can have on impressionable children. These issues are all touched on with great clarity but also without ever getting heavy-handed, disrupting the pace of the action or jarring with the regular moments of humour that add greatly to the enjoyment of watching this fine film.After a gang of four masked men wearing shades and dressed in painters' overalls invade a Wall Street bank and take its customers and staff as hostages, NYPD Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is given responsibility for dealing with the crisis. The highly experienced hostage negotiator immediately bases himself in a Mobile Command Vehicle outside the Manhattan Trust and takes charge of communicating with gang-leader, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and listening to his demands.The bank's founder, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) is soon informed about the on-going heist and calls in a power broker called Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) because he's anxious to avoid the contents of his safe deposit box being stolen or becoming known to anybody else. White, who's well-recognised for her efficiency and discretion, uses her considerable power to go over Frazier's head and arrange a meeting with Russell in what turns out to be just one of a number of instances that wrong-foot the increasingly frustrated negotiator.When a point is reached where it appears that the only option left is to storm the bank, Russell, who'd listened-in to the planning of the action by courtesy of some strategically-placed listening devices, arranges for all the hostages to be released. However, as he'd compelled them all to wear overalls, shades and masks that were identical to those worn by the robbers, Frazier and his colleagues are left with the huge and difficult job of interviewing more than fifty people to try to determine which of them were genuine and which were not. The events that follow, then illustrate Russell's considerable skill as a criminal mastermind and Frazier's determination to pursue his investigations to their conclusion despite being ordered not to by his superiors.The high quality cast does a great job of making ""Inside Man"" a riveting thriller with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen both outstanding in their roles. Interestingly, the actions of the main characters (played by Washington, Owen, Plummer and Foster) all involve dark secrets and dubious actions which play neatly into the movie's theme about the ubiquity of corruption and its key role in the acquisition of wealth and power.",Inside Man

Clive Owen is brilliant as the scheming robber who has a moral fibre in his corrupt soul, he brilliantly hides the brilliance of the character hidden with stares and glares.

Here it is, all those years later, and I have to confess I didn't mind watching it for free on TV. It's not that Inside Man is a bad movie. It's just so, so much less than meets the eye. Here we have a cast to die for--Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe.

106,bobsgrock,"Suspenseful, yet very inconsistent.",6,4 July 2008,"Spike Lee creates one of the most unique and interesting heist movies in recent memory with Inside Man, the story about a group of robbers led by Clive Owen that hold up a bank for all different reasons. The first half hour or so is pretty intense and interesting as we watch these four robbers force all the hostages to dress up exactly like them for a crucial reason later in the story. Denzel Washington plays a hostage negotiator trying to get the robbers to cooperate, yet he seems like such a weak character when he should dominate the screen. That role goes to Owen, who is so convincing as an unflinching bad guy as well as being very interesting so we actually care about what he is going to do next. Jodie Foster plays a ""fixer"" trying to help Christopher Plummer get something of great value inside the bank. Unfortunately, that is all we learn of her. What fails mostly with Inside Man is the confusing storyline Spike Lee throws at us. He mixes in post-hostage footage with actual hostage footage, and soon it becomes confusing which is which and what came first. There are too many little revelations at the end instead of one big one. The acting is mostly good, especially by Owen, and the rest of the script is well done. But, Lee could have stayed more consistent and suspenseful. Instead, at the end, it doesn't feel as intense or satisfying as even Ocean's 11. Too bad with all this talent.",Inside Man
107,Prashast_Singh,A well-written crime thriller engaging from the very beginning.,9,13 January 2021,"One thing that had caught my attention about this film was the usage of Chaiyya Chaiyya, one of my favorite Hindi songs, in the opening sequence, and in a pretty amusing manner. With only that and some of my favorite actors as the cast members being in my knowledge, I gave it a watch on Netflix and found it gripping. Even without a lot of action or nail-biting suspense, its writing is strong enough to hold your attention as you watch the story of an atypical heist unfold in front of your eyes for more than two hours, replete with some good twists delivered just at the right moments.Clive Owen and Denzel Washington's characters drive the plot and the way Spike Lee has dealt with them is incredible. You get to see both sides of the story, i.e, from both the criminal and the detective's perspectives, and how they keep the tension going on as the story keeps switching from character to character. Needless to say, their performances are impressive too. Especially that of Denzel, who reminds why viewers regard him as one of the greatest actors of all time. His dialogue delivery, at times intelligently hilarious, is a real highlight.The only thing that I found a little flawed was the running time. The story sure is intelligent and gripping, but it could've been shorter. The pacing is pretty normal for the most part, before the third act keeps swiftly revealing things after things, which can get a little hard to keep up with for certain viewers, but the twists being the highlight of this dialogue-driven thriller make that one flaw forgivable to some extent.So, it's not your usual blockbuster heist film with a lot of action or suspense, but a grounded drama/thriller instead. It sure demands patience, and doesn't forget to reward it either as you go on watching without demanding way too much. It has all the trappings of a well-written crime story, and fans of the genre can surely have a good time watching it.",Inside Man
108,Philby-3,Clever crime caper,8,26 March 2006,"This is a clever crime caper comedy/drama from Spike Lee with authentic NY atmosphere (you can almost smell the bagels and coffee), astringent dialogue, and a hole in the plot you could drive an armoured car through. There is fine acting from a mostly obscured Clive Owen as the chief robber and a brown suit-wearing Denzil Washington as the lead cop, with significant contributions from Jodie Foster (in a rather improbable part of a super fixer), Christopher Plummer (suavely villainous as usual) and Willem Dafoe (cast against type as the most sensible person in the NYPD).A bank siege is one of the great movie/TV clichés but this one is off-beat enough to hold the viewer's interest, despite going on too long (125 minutes) and having too many diversions  though we are spared too many sub-plots. Some nice camera work is helped by ""cosy"" production design  it's an appropriately crowded film. The intercutting of the story with post-robbery interrogations, done without giving the game away was a clever touch also.The hole in the plot? Well, again without giving the game away it seems the robbers are not so interested in the bank's money as in the contents of a certain safe deposit box. We not told how they found out about it, but the contents, we are told, will severely embarrass the respected elderly citizen whose box it is (and who happens to be the chairman of the bank). But ask yourself, why on earth would the person concerned have kept this particular incriminating document? It has no value to him. He has no incentive to keep it. Yet he keeps it in the box for 60 years. Has he got a death wish? Have I missed something?",Inside Man

110,Stephen_A_Abell,A Classy Bank Robbery Film. Well Shot & Acted.,8,20 July 2017,"This movie is one hell of a classy way to tell the story of a bank robbery. Spike Lee brings Gerwitz's story of an unusual bank robbery to life with a stylish noiristic flair. Though this isn't noir film there are definite overtones of the style throughout the film, which adds a greater depth and strength to the movie. Lee made a great choice here because I believe that without this element this could have easily been a boring film. There's not much action as most of the story is about trying to figure out what happened in the bank and just what were the robbers after. Luckily enough there's a plethora of acting talent to make this a very interesting movie, Even Clive Owen works well. I've always thought him to be very flat as an actor - verging on zero dimensional - though his woodenness works here as that persona is perfect for his character.The main letdown of the film is the story, which is also one of its greatest strengths. It's a letdown because it needed a tad more action and tension, there are a few cat and mouse scenes where these could have been expanded upon but were ignored. However, the strength comes from the whole concept, the twists, and the eventual climax of the story, which is brilliantly crafted and woven.The camera work is exemplary and on a couple of occasions beautiful. I particularly liked the pan shot from the rear of the police van as Frazier exits. The camera sweeps up and around, showing the crowd gathered at the cordon, then moves down in a slow arc to the person leaving the bank, surrounded police officers. The movement is so smooth. Then there's a great panning shot of the police officers as they search the bank after the hostages are released. This is, once again so steady and smooth. It was a pleasure to see as there's not a lot of this style of camera work around today.However, not all the camera shots work. The one where Frazier loses his temper and rushes out of the control vehicle is pretty risible and made me wince. Lee puts Washington on a wheeled stage and pulls him forward. at speed giving him a floating come flying movement. This was meant to represent his anger and haste at the situation. Unfortunately, the movement is juddering and the whole shot looks silly and feels wrong for the film; how it didn't end up on the cutting room floor. It would have been better to have Washington just run. Lee should check out the Nun scene from The Blues Brothers as this utilises the effect perfectly and makes the scene just perfect.Though this did detract from the film and breaks the link between the movie and its audience it doesn't do it to the point of hitting the off button.In fact, I would recommend this film to everybody who likes police procedures and stories with a mystery with plenty of twists. Back when this was made this would have been pretty original, though today, a lot of the issues in this film have been used quite a few times. A bank robbery that isn't a bank robbery. How do you get out of the building without being captured? Though, with Lee's involvement and the great cast, this is still worth a watch.",Inside Man
111,saptesh786,Safe Deposit No. 392 !!!,8,8 April 2019,"Good thriller a little bit long and could have been shorter by 15-20 minutes. It is a heist movie. Illegal diamonds are stolen in its way, a unique way that makes you think very carefully to watch what was happened, what is happening and what would be happened. Along with thriller it is also a brain tester too! Story is strong and gripped you from very first scene and till end you will be fasten at your seat as there is much surprises and twists at the end of movie. Acting done by Denzel Washington is superb. Clive oven is just okay is clever thief. William Dafoe is as usual. Chiwetel Ejiofor having a comic touch in his detective character. Jodie Foster is impressive but as me it is unnecessary character. The story would go interesting till end without this role of Madeleine White. Rest is okay.

112,classicalsteve,Underrated Heist-Hostage Movie That Puts Most Other Heist Movies To Shame -- Keeps You Guessing all the Way,10,14 October 2010,"Late in the film, Jodie Foster as Ms. White says an interesting line: ""When there's blood on the streets, go buy property."" At first the line just seems like an innocent little anecdote, meant as a kind of joke. But then I realized it may sum up the premise of the film. Unlike many of her other roles, Foster plays the equivalent of Mr Wolfe from ""Pulp Fiction"", hired by the upper-crust to ""clean up"" their little public relations problems. (At one point she claims her next job is to help Bin Lauden's nephew.) Although Foster is essentially a supporting character, I bring her up because her non-typical casting is a lot of what this movie is about or isn't about. It's about everything being upside down. At first glance, this is a movie about a bank robbery and hostage crisis, right? Or is it? The brilliant screenplay by Russell Gewirtz coupled with the outstanding direction of Spike Lee create constant miss-direction--about things not being as they seem. A lot of what seems very straight-forward are in fact illusions. But there are hints throughout the movie regarding the motives and the goals of the robbers. But even if you can't put it all together before all is revealed at the end, the final denouement is a stunning twist that makes most other heist movies seem more like mere cops and robbers B-movies. This is a highly compelling and very different take on the genre.The film begins with a brief monologue by an unknown person who says he ""chooses his words carefully"" and never repeats himself. He speaks from a confined area that is not exactly a prison. The movie then takes off with a compelling heist at a bank in lower Manhattan. Denzel Washington plays Detective Keith Frazer who thinks he's in the middle of what seems a straight-forward bank-hostage situation. The siege is perpetrated by people claiming to be high-powered and highly-intelligent criminals, asking for buses and planes in exchange for the lives of the hostages. Their guns are AK47's. Frazer, Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe) and their team set up a stake-out on the periphery of the bank and begin negotiations with the head-honcho. But even from the start, the demands seem strange.In a bit of a slight-of-hand, about one third through, the movie engages in what can only be described as ""flash-forwards"" (as opposed to flash-backs). We see Frazer and his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) questioning former hostages as if among them were the criminals who created the situation. But with every interview, we begin to understand the authorities don't know who perpetrated the heist. And we also start to lose the sense of the ""bad guys"" and the ""good guys"". When each flash-forward ends, we return to the ""present moment"" of the hostage crisis. In an interesting little trick, we never see the interviews in the present moment but only as flash-forwards.An absolutely mesmerizing film from start to finish with a twist at the end that might cause you to put into question all ""bad guy vs good guy"" films. The acting is first-rate with quite an interesting cast: Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Christoper Plummer. All the characters are on different sides with completely different interests and agenda. One of the enjoyable aspects is to try and figure out the motives of each of the characters which may help in solving the ""riddle"". The ending is more reminiscent of an Agatha Christie book than a James Patterson novel. This movie appears to have been a little overlooked by audiences during its initial release, which is a shame as it is one of the highest-quality movies of its genre.",Inside Man

Also never stalling, having enough tricks to get the story excitement while the whole heist gets done.Some may think the Jodie Foster character is unnecessary, maybe?

115,fwomp,Spike Lee's Hit Came Close To A Miss,7,10 August 2006,"Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen  Foster  into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her ""business"" was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a cliché. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another cliché?).Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out. Just don't think too hard about the INSIDE MAN after it's over.",Inside Man
116,jon.h.ochiai,Inside Spike,9,15 April 2006,"Spike Lee directing a bank robbery movie? ""Inside Man"" is not an obvious Spike Lee movieat least until you realize what he accomplishes in this medium. His ""Inside Man"" has a high power and impeccable cast lead by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Russell Gerwirtz's edgy smart retrospective screenplay engages throughout eventually unfolding as a morality play. The movie opens with the charismatic Clive Owen as bank robber Dalton Russell who professes to have pulled off the ""perfect crime"". We soon realize that the story is a retelling of past events, though any resolution of events is made purposefully unclearat least in the beginning.Dalton and crew take hostages in a prominent national bank owned by the elderly Arthur Case (mysteriously played by Christopher Plummer). The robbers force the hostages to wear the same jump suits as the robbers; thus, making them virtually indistinguishable. Upon hearing the news of the hostages and robbery attempt Case (Plummer) instead of immediately calling the Police, calls Madeline White (a strikingly bold and arrogant Jodie Foster) who is some sort of ace power broker. What Madeline actually does for a living is left intentionally vague. However, she does point out to Det. Frazier (Denzel Washington) that ""I don't think you can afford me."" Case is concerned about his personal contents in a safety deposit box in his bank, for which he enrolls Madeline's services to protect. In a fascinating character turn Denzel Washington plays Det. Keith Frazier, a detective first grade wannabe assigned to the hostage situation only because his superior is on vacation. The commanding Washington cleverly navigates as this burn out detective grasping for his last chance at reclaiming greatness. Washington expertly balances Frazier's gifted smarts along with his perceived ordinariness. He is an unexpected formidable foil to Foster's cold razor-like Madeline and Clive Owen's dangerous and edgy Dalton.Writer Gerwirtz and Director Lee stylishly unveil their story where all is not what it seems. Washington as Frazier soon realizes that he may be a pawn in the grand power play by Madeline (Foster) and Case (Plummer). The audience also begins to distinguish that Owen's Dalton is not motivated by greed, but instead something more like honor. ""Inside Man"" is glossed with witty and sharp exchanges. Washington and Owen are powerful. Jodie Foster playing the cool calculated Madeline White all but steals the movie. This is particularly noteworthy given that her role is the most amorphous. Her Madeline exists out of her sheer force of will. ""Inside Man"" resolves as a surpriseat least for me. We encounter some narrative logical challenges in particular the age of the Case character, and the reason for retaining one of the deposit box incriminating contents. And for the most part we can forgive these logical indiscretions. For the most part. In keeping with Spike Lee vision ""Inside Man"" is really about justice and karma. See ""Inside Man"". It has compelling story telling and superb acting.",Inside Man

119,carbuff,"Spike Lee should ""sell out"" more often.",10,30 September 2018,"""Inside Man"" convinces me that Spike Lee would actually be a much more effective social activist if he would just get off of his insufferable soap box, stop incessantly speaking down to white people, and simply make movies showing black people every bit the equal of white people. This is really nothing more than a superior popcorn movie, but I think it's more likely to actually ease racial tensions than any of Lee's films that are much more intentionally intended to do so. I'm not even going to pretend to hide anything here. I'm a well read and educated white guy who od'd a long time ago on Spike Lee's simple-minded lectures on the problems of race relations in America and pretty much all of his associated work. Lee's interviews always seem to indicate that he believes he's making brilliant, original observations, but I've never heard him say anything that hasn't been said before. Now, on the other hand, I'm sure that Lee would say he ""sold out"" when he made this big-budget, conventional, Hollywood blockbuster, even though it's leading character was Denzel Washington and other black actors played significant roles. I, on the other hand, have to say that I think it's the slickest heist movie I've ever seen, even better than ""The Usual Suspects"". It's easily my favorite Spike Lee film, and I don't think the plot made one meaningful misstep the whole time. It was never difficult to suspend disbelief, and the storyline never bogged. Simply casting black people in favorable leading roles works better with me personally than constantly hammering on me for my lack of melanin, which I get really, really tired of. In the same way that not all black people are violent, sociopathic, drug dealers, not all white people are truly deep-down racists suffering from all kinds of ""implicit"" biases and relentlessly expressing ""microaggressions"". So, while overall I've had way too much of Lee's intellectually trivial sermonizing for a lifetime, and I think that nowadays he's only insincerely inflaming further racial division (as if we needed more) to further inflate his already monstrous ego (Clooney, a white guy, does the same thing using other excuses) rather than to actually benefit society, I fully endorse ""Inside Man"" as the the best film of its type ever made.",Inside Man

In addition, if you're not able to take an excellent heist flick, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Inside Man (2006) is not the best not the worst, just a good action-kinda thriller movie. It kept me interested the whole time, Denzel Washington as usual acts very well, Clive Owen also does the good job. This is really great bank robbery movie, it keeps you on your feet guessing what is going on and what will happen next, in this movie you tend to root for the robbers at the end just because how creative the idea was. This film is fast paced thriller, with full of twists around. It keeps get you guessing of what happened on the end of the film , what just happened now. Spike Lee has directed a movie very different than the other movies he has made, and it proves what an excellent and versatile director he is. If only other action movies were directed with such attention to quality. The story is well written, full of suspense, action and surprises, without relying on fancy special effects or impossible feats. The acting is also quite excellent and convincing. Highly recommended movie for a fun, thrilling, experience that will engage your senses and your mind.Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster where all incredible in their own roles. Here is even Willem Dafoe in it as Captain John Darius, for a long time I saw him in another positive role as the good guy beside Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam flick of all time!!! Great heist movie with solid and well acted script. Right from the opening scene we are treated to a mastermind performance from Clive Owen in which eventually leads to Denzel and also performance by Ms. Jodie Foster. Less we forget Christopher Plummer as well.The suspense inside the Bank of a group of bank robbers, who storm the bank and take everyone hostage, they dressed them in to a white suits, everyone thinks what is with a white suit, it is their camouflage. Christopher Plummer's character Arthur Case is a mystery and everyone has their own motive, their is no way out. I really miss 10.years back when movies where still great. I miss Jodie Foster. Inside Man is my favorite film, mainly because of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster! I really miss Jodie Foster, I wish she would made another thriller like she did in the 80's in 90's. my favorite Jodie Fosters films of all time are: The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - I absolutely love this flick!, The Accused (1988) and Panic Room (2002) that was the first movie I went to see in the movie theater when it was released in 2002. Still I think this movie worked because of the incredible script that delivered all the goods and from the incredible cast crew who made the acting in this film perfect.This movie is a 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative brilliant directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts and twists around with the incredible script. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing. In my opinion Spike Lee is a genius and did incredible idea to make a film. I am not his biggest fan, this was Denzel Washington's last and fourth movie he made with director Spike Lee. They are both great on their own way.

121,krorie,Take a lesson from a teacher,9,24 March 2006,"Who else but the brilliant director Spike Lee could take a fairly routine bank heist flick with a few innovative twists and turn it into a two-hour-plus action marathon which is also a vestibule for entertainment? Spike Lee uses fantastic camera shots, film editing, and flash forwards to deliver the goods. He also extracts excellent performances from the entire cast, especially Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. Foster plays the unusual part of a confidential agent for the bank owner played by Plummer. Kudos also to the actress who plays the Albanian interpreter. The story involves the robbing of a bank in New York City (some of the same street locations were used in 16 Blocks). Listen attentively to the mastermind Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) as he addresses the audience at the beginning of the film. What he says takes on new meaning when he repeats it at the end of the movie. Hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is assigned the difficult task of talking the gunmen down and rescuing those being held captive. He desires to make a good showing since his job is on the line because of misappropriated drug money. The negotiation process turns out to be a ball of confusion. Before the ending, the viewer is taken on an exciting journey with all types of convolutions and U-turns.The music is some of the best used in recent Hollywood films. ""Chaiyya Chaiyya"" adds much to the beginning of the movie to set the proper atmosphere and to grab the audience's attention.Too bad Spike Lee is not available to direct more action flicks.

122,gregsrants,A rip roaring robbery riot,7,26 March 2006,"When the movie trailer for Match Point starring Scarlett Johanssen starting showing up in my favorite multi-plex last year, I remember being mildly intrigued at the premise then being blown away when it was revealed at the end of the ad that the film was directed by none other than Mr. Woody Allen.Wha? Mr. ""Look at my neurotic bitching"" is directing a suspense/thriller? Whoa! My interest went through the roof as I couldn't remember the last time  of ever  that I had been so surprised at the genre choice for a directors upcoming effort.Well, it happened again with the new bank heist flick, Inside Man. The trailer and ads lead me down a guessing path wherein I was spewing out guesses such as F. Gary Gray or Brett Ratner as the man behind the camera. But when the final credit revealed itself, I sat jaw agape as ""a spike lee joint"" flashed upon the screen. The March 24th release date was then circled on the office calendar.Inside Man does have one marking of a Spike Lee film  Denzel Washington. The two have shared movie poster credits with films such as Malcolm X, Mo Better Blues and He Got Game. They are the black man's George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh. And that can be a very good thing.Inside Man also boasts some incredible talent in support of Mr. Training Day. Academy Award winners or nominees galore surround Denzel with names like Foster, Dafoe and Owen. Altogether, they fight for marquee supremacy while giving the viewer the biggest barge or egos since Ocean's Twelve.So the only question remaining was can all these remarkable talents join together and actually make a good film.Inside Man is a movie about a bank robbery. Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, the man behind the operation who in the opening sequences narration, lets us know that he puts together the perfect crime. His attempt to rob Case Manhattan Bank leads to Denzel's Detective Keith Fraizer being assigned as the hostage negotiator. Complicating matters and unknown to the paying customer until necessary is what exactly is being stolen. Dalton seems to have little to no interest in all the money that surrounds him in the vault and the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) seems so concerned about a personal belonging kept in the vault's safety deposit box that he employs the services of one Madeline White (Jodie Foster). Her background is never quite revealed, but what is crystal is that she is as tough as nails and has the right markers to protect the interests and reputation of Mr. Case.So the table is set. The characters are in place. Fraizer will try and talk Dalton out of killing anyone in the bank while White will try and arbitrate the negotiations and offer both sides future benefits for walking away from escalating the situation larger than the severity it has already reached.Inside Man is a better than average film with a much better than average cast. Denzel and Owen provide refreshing performances with characters that have been done before  and many times over. Their screen time together sizzles with tension and an understanding as to each others role in how the final act will play out.Foster's participation on the other hand is less impressive. Foster does her best in a limited role and definitely commands a presence on the screen, but you can't help but feel that she is a bit wasted when the final product is revealed and the end credits roll.But maybe most impressive is the directing of Spike Lee. We are used to his heavy handed films that are steep with racial tension. And although Inside Man does have its moments of racial indifference (most particularly a comedic breaking scene with a bank employee who's turbin has been taken by the police during a take-down)  Lee understands that the film at hand is that of a bank robbery and the attempts to salvage the hostage situation. He keeps things tight, moving and towards an end that even yours truly couldn't figure out until the results were revealed.That in short makes Inside Man one of the better films of the still new year and revives a Lee career that hasn't produced anything interesting since The 25th hour five years ago.www.robertsreviews.com",Inside Man

The plot kept me guessing.I loved the score, from the Hindi cinema music over the credits to the 1950s black and white throwback orchestral score.The only thing I wish the movie had had that it didn't was more of a sexual frisson between beautiful-but-evil Jodie Foster and handsome-and-noble-but-no-stranger-to-the-dark-side Denzel Washington. Maybe in a sequel.Really, see this movie. It's expert, it's fun, it's engrossing. It's just a great flick.",Inside Man
124,rainking_es,A master plan!,8,30 October 2006,"Spike Lee moves away from the social dramas to bring us the perfect robbery, one of those whose development leaves us speechless 'cause they're so creative.The script is just impeccable although the intensity flags a little in the last 15 minutes, after the robbery (but the truth is that this part of the movie is incredibly thrilling).As for the cast, there ain't much to say about it: Washington, Plummer, Jodie Foster... even Clive Owen makes a hell of a performance.

125,russem31,Great film,8,7 April 2006,"Inside Man (2006), the newest film by directing genius Spike Lee, is another great film, one that makes you look at what is right and wrong and who is good and evil. This film has an all star cast including Denzel Washington in another slam-bang performance as Detective Keith Frazier, a detective given a second chance to prove himself, as well as a brilliant performance by Jodie Foster as Madeline White. This cast also stars Clive Owen as the purported bank robber, Christopher Plummer as the bank owner with a hidden past, and Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius. What really did it for me though, was that the script was very strong and the right actors were cast to say and act the parts, along with BRILLIANT cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also shot Phone Booth). A true gem of a film - 8 out of 10.",Inside Man
126,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Clever and original thriller that doesn't rely on violence to thrill or be clever,8,11 August 2006,"What seems to be a run-of-the-mill bank robbery at first turns into a battle of nerves and wits between Dalton Russel, a thief who is more clever than he looks, and Keith Frazier, an NYC hostage negotiator who has his own set of tricks. Tensions mount on both sides as startling revelations show what is really going on.This film works and is enjoyable due to Spike Lee's ability to build tension. I haven't seen all of his films, but out of the few I have, the tension slow builds throughout and finally bursts in the conclusion. 'Do the Right Thing' is a prime example and ""Inside Man"" is very similar in that aspect. The setting of a heist along with the stand-off that takes up most of the movie is a perfect new setting for this type thing and it works out very well. Relying heavily on a good script, dialog and story progress to interest and excite the viewer and leaving the clichéd shootout/police raid out makes plenty of room for twists and turns in the film - the story even takes on an entirely new meaning and proportions by the end.Also of note is Spike Lee's ever-present interest in racial tensions and a police/criminal stand-off is one of the places where such things most likely flare as this film shows. It doesn't go to exploitative and over-done lengths, but it was slightly annoying that only white cops blurted out the epithets. Though it is an interesting little side message of the film that adds some overall feel and flavor. 8/10Rated R: profanity and occasional violence",Inside Man
127,jpschapira,Lee is there...,7,22 June 2007,"You get the feeling with Spike Lee films that they tend to become longer than you expected; that the ending doesn't seem to arrive. At first, you want the movie to end because of this, but then Lee grabs your attention again, and when the movie is over you are left wanting for more; it doesn't matter what kind of film it is.""Inside Man"" starts off with the incomparable face of Clive Owen, as he gives a superb introductory narration. The camera shows his face and we can see constant changes of light and movement in the background, apparently a brick wall. This speech demands your attention and you should listen because, even when ""Inside Man"" is a thriller with all the basic elements, it contains a little more.When the speech's over, we go to some classic Lee shots of Manhattan (quick changing cuts courtesy of Lee's frequent editor Barry Alexander Brown); reminding us how good he is at depicting the location's mood, either with a statue, a building or just the American flag. You should take this time, while the main credits roll, to try and remember what Owen said; because after 'directed by Spike Lee', everything moves at high speed.There's a bank robbery, detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are assigned to the case, they encounter Captain Darius (Willen Dafoe) and suddenly people start coming in and out of places without a pause; including hostages inside the bank. Owen says in his speech that he's planned the perfect robbery, and it sure looks like it; but that's all I can say.The pace of the images was a wise choice by Lee to really get the viewer into the film, and this aspect works all the way through. The problem, however, comes with the words. The screenplay is, surprisingly, original. Writer Russell Gewirtz is the guy who's written the script that will probably get DeNiro and Pacino together again: that's something. His work for this film is also something, with an unexpected amount of cleverness for the simplicity his premise has. It's contradictory, but in the good way; with some innovation but never forgetting the 'thriller' essence.But what's admirable about Gewirtz' writing is that he doesn't try to play the viewer (like ""Derailed"", recently, also with Owen); he lays out the results with honesty and professionalism. Maybe this aspect sounds strange but, although people like being tricked, there's a good way to do it and I'm getting tired of no one doing it right. On the other hand, not tricking could be even better than tricking well, if you follow.Now follow Denzel Washington's work during this decade; virtually every role he's played involves carrying a gun (you should check his whole career, he's got a good relationship with the weapon). I love Denzel Washington, I really do; and that's why I've tolerated most of the crappy things he's been doing. Also because he's always good in them, just thatGood. But I've got news for you: his portrayal here is the best since his last Oscar for ""Training Day"", where he also played a man of the law. I could easily say that Denzel Washington is the only megastar today who delivers good performances and also has a lot of fun. You can see him excel here; comfortable, all over the place, even more solid than in his directorial debut: ""Antwone Fisher"".Another thing I could easily say is that Washington plays a similar line of characters; always ending up triumphant, and Clive Owen is the same. He does it again here, and he doesn't have to show his haunting face to triumph. And Jodie Foster's character, wellYou see, she appears on screen, being the megastar she is; and I don't know how she manages to make us think she's a normal person. That's something megastar Denzel Washington hasn't achieved in a long time.The fact remains that, among all the polished though not great word, Lee's influence is still there, everywhere. His feelings are not left out in this action-packed piece; and you get all this little moments where you stop doubting that this thriller is 'a Spike Lee joint'.",Inside Man
128,Pedro_H,Quality pot-boiler with grade A stars -- but certainly not a keeper.,7,30 April 2007,"A gang of thieves take over a New York bank - but maybe there is more to it than a simple robbery-turned-hostage situation? When you get to a certain age you think you have seen all the movies that have been made or ever will be made. All you have left to look forward to is massive surprises (and very welcome they are too!) and movies that are bits and pieces of other (good) movies glued together. This is a very slick product with modern cinematography - the type is part TV advert and part professional clever-dicking: Arty shots for no real reason other than to show-off.Not the kind of material that I normally associate with Spike Lee (there is a back story if you want to search it out) but he gets us through it without ever stopping or running out of ideas. Not that a hundred directors couldn't have done it just as well.Get this for a cast: Denzel Washington (call-the-shots big city cop), Clive Owen (too good looking for his own good as a young man - now getting more interesting with age. Here a pro thief), Jodie Foster (not playing a goody-two-shoes character for once - won't spoil it), Christopher Plummer (a standard Mr Big) and William Dafoe (wasted as a police coordinator). Thankfully they are rarely on screen at the same time - probably because they would be too many arguments about who is getting blocked correctly and who has the individual spot on them.I have a problem with Denzel W - he is a very good actor that doesn't take on enough challenging parts. He has fallen in to the Sidney Poitier trap of thinking that he should be representing his race in nearly every movie (yes -- irony that he won an Oscar for the time he didn't) or else doing those walk-through parts that keeps his bank manager happy. Here he is good, but nothing special. I want to give him special praise for his command of the English language though - even though he doesn't display it here. He should come to London and do Shakespeare.I counted myself entertained and satisfied at the end of the two hours. Too superficial to watch more than once though.",Inside Man
129,deatman9,Good movie but Spike Lee shows his colours with bigotry,6,30 October 2012,"This movie had a great story line and some great actors but it had some very racist undertones made famous by director Spike Lee. Every white person in this show was either a bad guy. an idiot, a racist or someone evil while all the black guys were the level headed nice guys. Other then that though this movie is an exciting heist movie.This movie is about a group of bankrobbers who plan on robbing a bank but instead once foiled by police turn it into a hostage negotiation. A negotiator is sent to find out the bank robbers main motive because from what he tell the negotiator he is not telling the truth.This movie is pretty good I just really could not stand the racism of the script and screenplay.

130,oneloveall,Mediocre film doesn't redeem itself by it's revelation or by it's big name cast,5,28 July 2006,"Moderately exciting cat and mouse bank robbery movie, of course with a ""twist"", serves as a decent throwback to the early genre, although it provides little past it's superficial purpose. The A-list cast perhaps make the film appear classier then it ought to, although the work here is nothing beyond the range of ordinary from what we have seen these people do. I would even go so far as to say the great Jodie Foster's character was practically undefined and merely put in for cosmetic reasons, an undesirable angle that took away from the initial tension. Written and directed in this sort of detached manner, despite the tense plot, Spike Lee often shows up apathetic when certain scenes play themselves out although the pseudo-spontaneity sometimes produces genuine emotional connections and well timed delivery which serves as an unexpected subtle treat in this otherwise entertaining but far-fetched and mostly uninspired caper.",Inside Man
131,Superunknovvn,Instant classic,6,1 April 2006,"The fact that this movie was directed (note: NOT written) by Spike Lee lead a lot of people to believe that ""Inside Man"" was really a subliminal comment on racial issues. Yes, there are characters using politically incorrect terms here and a major plot point even involves the exploitation of Jews during the holocaust. Still, ""Inside Man"" is foremost a classic heist movie and a very good one at that.Spike Lee takes his time to tell this story. Like so many recent motion pictures ""Inside Man"" is almost of epic proportions, yet at 130 minutes running time it still manages never to get boring. It sucks you right in from the great opening monologue delivered by Clive Owen. Lee's direction is old-fashioned and classy. The cast is superb, although it's a pity that Willem Dafoe plays a rather bland character and isn't given more opportunity to show his talent here.Newcomer Russell Gewirtz wrote a fantastic screenplay, that's extremely well crafted and very original. A lot of background information is left in the dark, which probably frustrated some viewers, but actually we don't need to know more facts than the ones we are being given in the movie. Granted, some parts of the movie are rather hard to believe, but the story never reaches the point of absolute impossibility. Another reviewer wrote that the movie's main flaw is that it refuses to choose between realism and ""Ocean's Eleven""-style fantasy. I think that's a good way to put it, but the makers could have gone way farther over the top. To me the movie found the perfect balance between realism and fantasy to be thrilling and plausible at the same time.""Inside Man"" is already a classic and definitely among Spike Lee's best movies. Hopefully it will be remembered along with genre cornerstones such as ""Dog Day Afternoon"".",Inside Man
132,vostf,A suspension of challenging approach for both talent and story,3,5 March 2013,"Suspension of disbelief is your classic benevolent no prejudices first contact with a movie. That is what a good director can expect to build up a story even from a mediocre script. Or an average director can get away with it if he has a good story to start with.Inside Man got a very fine casting. Does that make a great cast? Well there is a tipping point in the movie where sheer stature and charisma can no longer make up for the weak characterisation. A nice cop (Denzel Washington), a (marginally) violent yet clean and sharp heist mastermind (Clive Owen) and a bunch of stock supporting characters (Jodie Foster as the ambiguous bitching lawyer type, Christopher Plummer as the polished evil grey-suited - but quite clumsy - über-class banker, etc.) doesn't really make a great cast.Now if there was a great story, no one would mind enjoying these cartoonish characters. But the story is far from pop-corn cartoonish, it really takes itself seriously. Suspension of disbelief: low battery.And Spike Lee does take himself seriously. Let's say he is only a bit over the hedge with the in-your-face statement by Clive Owen at the beginning. It sets the bar high, without being really clever, but OK... Now, all the over-hanging shots and the ridiculous trolley-shot at the end really make it a big fat failure in directing vista.Well a director must be short-sighted to take so seriously (I mean deep dork serious) this screenplay. Lots of reviewers have pointed out the flaws: again it is not the (big) flaws that count but the impotence at channelling suspension of disbelief into something that hangs OK.In the end, cinematically challenged audiences will only see it as a clever story with great actors, and actually no talent ever got harmed during the shooting. Nothing got properly challenged as to get the best from everyone and every situation. They are happy they shot this in little more than a month. Good for them, but the result is a weak movie further crippled by its stance as a very clever heist machine.",Inside Man
133,Isaac5855,Spike Really Missed the Boat Here...,4,14 August 2007,"INSIDE MAN is a convoluted and confusing crime drama that offers way too many questions and not enough answers. I've always considered Spike Lee a hit and miss director and this one was a big miss for me. This confusing and emotionally manipulative drama follows what appears to be a bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation except that the hostages don't seem to be the #1 priority of anyone outside this bank. Denzel Washington, in his fourth outing with director Lee, delivers one of his most unconvincing performances as Detective Keith Frazier, a badly dressed hostage negotiator who seems more worried about some pending charges from IAB regarding a prior case than he is about these hostages. Christopher Plummer plays the President of the Board of Directors of the bank whose only concern seems to be a safe deposit box inside the bank that he doesn't want anyone to know about and he dispatches Jodie Foster to get it out of the bank before the robbers find it. There's just way too much that's left unexplained here...its never really made clear who Jodie Foster's character works for and she also seems to have her own agenda which has nothing to do with the hostages. Basically, what Lee has given us here is a hostage drama where no one seems to care about the hostages. Washington comes off as forced but Clive Owen, who plays the mastermind behind the robbery, comes off as the most likable character in the film. The film also suffers due to overblown direction, a convoluted screenplay, one of the worst musical scores I have ever heard, and an ending that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. A big disappointment from Lee and Washington,who have both done better work.",Inside Man

Lee's film is directed perfectly, i mean i couldn't tell where he was going, it was very professionally done film, very visually convincing and nothing too fancy but the camera-work was just flashy enough for this kind of movie. I liked this film a lot, maybe its because im just a sucker for heist flicks. Clive Owen was very good as one of the bank robbers and Jodie Foster was also not bad in her role, though i thought she was a bit underused and her role was hardly significant, perhaps partially due to the writing, partially due to the way she performed it. This film was still very good however, a great cast, solid screenplay and good direction from Lee. Spike Lee shows his versatility here as he has perfected several genres with this project. A must-see for heist flick enthusiasts or any fan of Spike Lee or Denzel or even Clive Owen. --IMDB Rating: 7.6, my rating: 10/10",Inside Man
135,davidcarniglia,Makes the Case For On-Line Banking,7,7 August 2018,"A compelling heist movie with some unique twists. Fairly even performances, especially from Washington and Plummer. There's some clever plot devices; the foreshadowing, though a bit confusing, adds energy, and builds anticipation . Forcing the hostages to dress like the robbers was a great idea, as it made the subsequent escape plausible. Since no one knew what the robbers looked like, interrogating the bus load of hostages became a frustrating exercise for Washington and his cohorts. The robbers treated the hostages better than the police. That blurring of good guy/bad guy divides our sympathy between Washington and Owen.That leaves room for the Nazi-collaborator Arthur Case (Plummer) to emerge as the actual bad guy. The 'robbers' only steal incriminating evidence to blackmail Plummer. But why not break in at night so they don't have to fuss with fifty hostages and a ton of cops? I guess we had to make room for Jodie Foster.Her role makes no sense. She takes over an enormous police situation, with no standing or credentials. That snapped my suspension of disbelief. If she were the mayor, and insinuated herself into the crisis, it might just add up. As far as the police are concerned, she should be no more than just another onlooker. Exposing a war criminal is sufficient motive for Owen to go after Plummer; we don't need a whole subplot with Foster to establish that. She goes through her many scenes with a smug grin, lapsing into nearly 
incomprehensible mumbling too often. Maybe give her Washington's role and she what she does with it.As others have said, though Washington's Frazier is jovial, his demeanor fits. He's overwhelmed by the situation: his humor springs from exasperation, not over-confidence. That he relishes his advantage over Plummer in their last meeting is all the more convincing, as he's been successively surprised, scrutinized, dismissed, ignored, and even under suspicion.One of his surprises came from the captain. I can't understand why he would just smile and say the whole deal is no big thing: no one hurt, nothing of (monetary) value taken, no suspects, no crime. That's absurd. Toy guns and fake murders or not, taking a heap of hostages, roughing up some of them, turning out half the police in the city, disrupting business, etc., are all crimes of some sort.That the actual pilfering of the incriminating documents has a beneficial ulterior motive is beside the point. Does the captain have some ulterior motive too? What's the point of some misdeed hanging over Frazier? Thankfully, we have fairly slick pacing, cool dialogue, and enough good plot bits. The kid describing his sadistic video game to Owen, and the irritable construction worker going on about his Albanian ex-wife are gems.In addition to Foster's underdeveloped character, there's a non-existent back story. By passing up Owen's planning of the crime, the film leaves out a crucial element of the heist genre. Owen's motivation makes sense, but why is he interested in Nazi war criminals? He's a few generations distant from WWII. And, what of his three accomplices? Why did they throw in with him? It would've made more sense if they were in it for the money; have a real robbery for them, and the war crimes documents for Owen.Inside Man left detours and dead ends, but entertained all the same.",Inside Man

138,WriterDave,An Entertaining Lark,8,27 March 2006,"If you're a fan of Spike Lee (and I most assuredly am since I was one of the twenty people who actually saw his last film, ""She Hate Me""), there's a certain smug satisfaction in watching his latest ""joint"", ""Inside Man."" Spike Lee has never been a populist entertainer. His movies are almost always overtly talky, political, and married to New York City (I would even go so far as to call him the black Woody Allen). He has as many detractors and he does fans. There have been a few occasions where he's sidestepped to different types of stories (that were still very urban and very New York), fantastically disastrously with ""Summer of Sam"" and surprisingly deep with his superb ""25th Hour."" Here, hooking up with long-time collaborator Denzel Washington (who gives a cracker-jack performance as a slick hostage negotiator), Lee gives us his first flick of pure entertainment, and it's the kind of twisty, thrilling lark you would normally get from a latter day Hitchcock or a David Mamet at the top of his game.Like all great director's directors, Spike Lee, taking a que from Scorcese, picks a stale genre (the heist flick) and infuses it with his New York flair and socially conscious commentary. Sure, this is a film about the perfect crime (where robbing a bank is a cover for a much larger plot), but it also has the typical Spike Lee nods to society, race, and class struggles. There's plenty to delight in here, from Lee's self assured direction, to Denzel's perfect line delivery, to Clive Owen's oh-so-smooth performance as the heist-master extraordinaire, to Jodie Foster's atypical and surprisingly sexy turn as a consultant brought on the scene by the big-wigs to get things done. Foster, who has made a nice little niche as the prototypical ""powerful mother in crisis,"" in films like ""Panic Room"" and ""Flight Plan"" is perfectly channeled here by Lee to turn her typical iciness into cool seduction, and who knew she had such great legs!? Leave it if Lee to channel the sexiness of everyday women. Take for instance the closing shot of Denzel's girlfriend lying in bed in her negligee twirling his hat with her feet. It's the type of classy, jazzy riff on sensuality and showmanship Lee revels in when he's not mad at the world. It's a perfect ending to ""Inside Man"" and a reminder to the audience: sure, there may have been plot holes you could drive a swat team through, but who cares as long as you were entertained.",Inside Man

It is indeed an incredibly well done heist film. The characters are almost all believable. The performances are solid. The plot twists are a little too neat, but enough to keep you guessing. And the pacing is just about perfect. But far and away the biggest stand out is Denzel. I had completely forgotten how he could transform an average detective role in a standard heist movie into an epic performance.

Jody Foster adds nothing to the film and any woman or any person could have played her part.The film is basically a bank robbery where nothing is stolen, and no-one gets hurt. The only things taken are from a safety deposit box that actually doesn't exist according to the bank records so nothing is stolen.The point of the film (if there is one) is to make you work out what links the guy who owns and runs the bank to the Nazi's and how the robbers planned to escape the bank.I'm not too sure what the point of the robbers digging the hole in the storage room floor was (that is never explained), I thought it might be their planned escape route?

143,dfa120374,Not One Of Washington's Best,5,17 January 2015,"I REALLY wanted to enjoy Inside Man, but unfortunately, in the end, I thought it was just an OK action thriller and really wasn't anything special. Good story, great cast (and that's coming from a guy who's not a big fan of Clive Owen), and good plot twists. What else could a film need right? Well, for me, it needed a wee bit of pace to it. Don't get me wrong...it didn't have to go at 100mph like a Die Hard film, but it just moved a bit too slow I thought and just dragged on a wee bit. Spike Lee films do have a tendency to be on the slower side and that didn't bother me with the likes of Clockers, for instance, which I thought was a great film but Inside Man, however, fell slightly short of the action mark for an action/thriller.The majority of the characters were pretty well done (even if some were your usual stereotypes for a Spike Lee movie), but the part of Madeleine White (played by Jodie Foster), when you think about it, really wasn't needed as she really added nothing to the film. Foster's character didn't do anything and it's like she was there just for the sake of being there.Also, as a wee side note, I'm extremely thankful that the role of Washington's wife wasn't in the movie a lot because I don't think I could have stomached all the ""hurry home, baby"", ""oh yeh baby"", ""love you baby"", and the excruciatingly painful ""Big Willie"" line more than what I had to.For me, it's the twists and turns that the story takes that keeps the film interesting, and there are a good few of them scattered throughout. The suspense that this all produces is good, but really nothing fantastic.Overall, Inside Man was a decent action/thriller to watch, but Heat it most definitely wasn't. Not bad, but have seen much better.",Inside Man
144,the-movie-guy,Exciting thriller with an unexpected ending,8,22 March 2006,"(Synopsis) The movie begins with four people dressed in painters' clothes entering a bank in Manhattan. Once in position, the bank robbers take about 50 customers hostage and head for the vault. NYPD hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) arrives on the scene and makes contact with the masked man in charge of the heist, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). Detective Frazier wants to get all the hostages safely released as quickly as possible, in a peaceful manner. However, Russell has other plans; he begins playing a cat-&-mouse game to delay the police, and he outwits and confuses the police at every turn. Madeliene White (Jodie Foster), with the help of the mayor, bargains with Detective Frazier to let her talk to the bank robbers in an attempt to resolve the situation. Madeliene wants to make a deal with the robbers; if they give up and let her get something out of her client's safe deposit box, they will get a short jail term and $2 million when they get out.(My Comment) From the very beginning of the hostage takeover, you know that this movie is going to be a surprising thriller. Clive Owens as the mastermind bank robber was brilliant in the role. Denzel Washington's part as the detective, who could figure out the bank robbers, was outstanding. However, Jodie Foster's small part was a little disappointing. The storyline offers the audience enough suspense and intrigue to keep you glued to your seat through the whole movie. You will not be able to figure out the ending until you actually see it. This is one movie you must go and see. Since this was a bank heist, I did have this question. Where was the FBI?

145,phenomynouss,Kind of grows on you,10,3 May 2006,"It was kind of hard for me to like and appreciate this movie to begin with. I wasn't impressed by the previews and I was dragged to see this movie. After it was over, I thought it was a bit... like, not all there, kind of boring.After some weeks passed, with a few moments of reflecting on the movie, I realize it was a pretty good movie.Problems first: The only big problem I had with it was the ""Crash""-style blatant, pretentious racism, out to shock the audience.The rest of the movie was entertaining, and the ""bad guys""'s plot was very clever. It had lots of very funny, slightly mean jokes in it and a lot of situations which make you laugh because it's a ""duh!"" situation. Or something. I'm crazy.I purposely use ""quotes"" around the term bad guys (referring to the ""bank robbers"") because they really aren't bad, or out to hurt anyone or anything. Their plot was absolutely ingenious and would actually work in real life---but without monetary gain.Spoiler alert!: Their plot was really complex and very well done: They (Clive Owen's character and the gang) enter the bank disguised as painters, their faces hidden, use a high-tech device disguised as a flashlight to shut down the security cameras, then hold the bank hostage. They take all the hostages down to the bank vaults, have everyone dress in identical blue outfits with white ski-mask cloth things (you see in the previews) covering their faces and sunglasses over their eyes. The ""bank robbers"" then dress the same way. The people are divided and put into various little offices, and told to sit down and shut up. They're all whimpering and sobbing and such, and at random intervals, the ""bank robbers"" come in, take a few people out, and put them in another room, and switch people around. What they're also doing, is pretending to be one of the hostages, putting each other into the rooms at random intervals and whimpering and making noise like everyone else. That way, everyone thinks the ""bank robbers"" infiltrating them are innocent people. The ""bank robbers"" make outrageous demands to the police and make it very hard on them by demanding things and being very inflexible and uncooperative. At random moments, they push out one hostage for the police to apprehend, and because they are dressed just like the robbers, ALL the hostages are suspect! At the very end, after finding what they were looking for, the ""bank robbers"" let everyone out the front door--and include themselves in the bunch (their guns were fake) and manage to escape scot-free because ALL the hostages are suspects, and all of them recognize each other as being among the hostages (since the ""bad guys"" mixed themselves in among the hostages) so EVERYONE is let go and the bank robbers are never found---they also take nothing from the bank, no money, no files, nothing. What they DID do, however, because they would recognize Clive Owen's character's voice, he stayed behind in the bank, hidden behind the wall in the storage closet, where he came out after the whole ordeal, took some diamonds hidden in the bank, and documents telling about the bank owner's (Christopher Plummer) dealings during World War II with the Nazis and the diamonds were diamonds he stole from Jewish families during the holocaust, and kept hidden away because he was overwrought with guilt, and wanted to keep it hidden away forever (and he hired Jodi Foster's character to get involved with the police and make sure they found out nothing about this. The police never see the file, so the ""bank robbers"" get away with it) That was long, and probably unnecessary, but that's the movie's surprise twist ending and content involving the bank robbers. I'm too tired now to explain everything else. I'm too much into spoilers.",Inside Man
146,MichaelMargetis,"""My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. """,8,2 April 2006,"One of the most over-done genres of film is the heist movie. They used to be great, with spectacular ones like 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'The Usual Suspects'. Hell, my favorite movie of all time 'Reservoir Dogs' surrounded the after-math of a heist. In recent years they have ranged in quality from average to terrible and just when I had given up on that as a genre, along comes 'Inside Man'. Not since 2001's 'Ocean's Eleven' have I seen a heist movie so intense, original and solid as 'Inside Man'. Usually I don't care for Spike Lee, but he really does a nice job with this.I can't really tell you anything elaborate about the plot without spoiling it for you, so I'll tell you it surrounds a New York City bank robbery lead by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and the detective running the operation to stop him is the cocky, slick, fancy hat wearing Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). From there, the action starts. The acting is nothing short of excellent with stunning performances by Washington, Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe and Chitwetel Ejiofor. The story is unpredictable and original, and I actually admired the cinematography, the editing and Spike Lee's innovative direction.'Inside Man' will have you pinned to your seat at some points, laughing hysterically at the puns of the characters at points and will have you frantically guessing through-out the entire run of the film. It's not as powerful as Lee's '25th Hour' which I highly praised, but it's very original and something of good value. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to escape from most of the puke-inducing foul garbage that seems to be produced by Hollywood more and more often these days.

147,ridi-arahan,"Diamond is golder than money, doubt it?",8,17 June 2020,"What worked:
the theme of the movie; the obvious bank robbery is presented in a clever way. The robbers are smart, calm, disciplined and know exactly what they are doing, and they have a great plan. The movie is engaging and keeps us wandering what's and how's it going to end.What did not work:
screenplay; the movie that started with an interesting plot slowly goes down into a conclusion that does not add up completely. The acting by the lead is appealing but due to the lack of enough weight in their character , the movie falls and loses. It could have been a smarter movie if the conclusion screenplay was given enough attention.plus it's a theft, we do want to see at the ending of the movie about how the act was done or any explanation to the ending. It just ends and we are left with questions.-Plot holes; some questions about the Robbery(how?) isn't clearly answered. How much one of the robbers is taken into custody and released? That doesn't look smart whatsoever. What about the wall, the digging ??
Final verdict: recommended, just enjoy it. Don't think and you will love it",Inside Man
148,judywalker2,Quite good and unusual,8,28 March 2006,"Well this was quite good and very unusual. I went into this film hoping for a good flix, since I hadn't seen one is a long, long, longtime and I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually got one. This film is interesting in that it felt quite real so I guess the acting must have been good. Most of the characters felt right. Spike Lee did a good job at choosing his cast. It was more of an ensemble than a true Denzel vehicle and that was okay. Loved the cultural, what we feel and think about people undertone. Also I loved the smartness of the dialogue especially among the policemen, that was a first. All in all a good adult movie. As a sideline I wonder if theater owners will ever get enough gumption to tell parents when it isn't appropriate for them to bring their children to R rated movies. If they can't find a babysitter they should chose another film to see, as a family. Just my opinion. My husband and I, both adults, really enjoyed this movie.",Inside Man

Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and was not expecting to much. Well I was pleasantly surprised at the story with it's unexpected surprises. I thought that Jodie Foster was wasted in her part, but that Clive Owen was very good in his part as the bank robber leader. The only objection I found was that the run time for the movie was a little long, but other than that I did enjoy the movie very much, and I recommend this movie for those that like a good story, with a little to much sitting time.",Inside Man
151,DavidSim240183,"Great cast, great dialogue, great crime caper!",10,27 April 2007,"What a marvellous film Inside Man is! What I particularly loved about the film is the way it starts out as one sort of story. And over the course of the next two hours, it gradually turns into another. And then, if that weren't impressive enough, in the final act it pulls another rabbit out of its hat and transforms into a film of surprising depth and intelligence. Not to mention the fact it has an excellent ensemble cast, quotable dialogue and an enjoyably twisty screenplay that pulls off one great surprise after another.The opening scene contains a monologue from Dalton Russell (the criminally underrated Clive Owen), who informs the audience that just recently he pulled off what he describes as the perfect bank robbery. This is actually my favourite scene in the whole film. The choice of dialogue and the way Owen delivers it is so dead on that you're convinced right away Dalton is the master criminal he makes himself out to be.Then the action takes off. Four people, including Dalton, disguised as painters seize control of a NY bank. Initially it resembles the type of robbery you've seen in about a hundred other heist movies. But Inside Man isn't your standard heist movie!What starts out as a simple robbery becomes much more than that. It eventually evolves into a hostage situation. And an even more murkier element surfaces involving Christopher Plummer's shady bank owner. All the while the bank is surrounded by NYPD's finest, SWAT teams, news reporters, and as an added bonus, Jodie Foster's delightfully buoyant ""fixer"". She fixes things that need fixing!On top of the case are Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell (an inspired match of Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor). As the hours tick away, its up to them to safeguard the lives of the hostages, coordinate with Willem Dafoe's SWAT team leader, and basically find out what the hell's going on in that bank.I haven't enjoyed a crime caper this much since Collateral. Everything about Spike Lee's gritty thriller fires on all cylinders. Not simply because it delivers as a suspense ride. But it has style. Witty asides. And a wonderful cast of characters that transform Inside Man into a modern day masterpiece.Spike Lee uses an unusual method of balancing two stories. The first is the hostage situation. While simultaneously addressing the aftermath of events with the hostages freed and being interrogated. Now in that circumstance, we know beforehand that somehow those hostages will be freed. But instead of making Inside Man anticlimactic, it makes the film that all the more fascinating and complex. The interrogation scenes are surprisingly hilarious too, thanks to Spike Lee's quirky camera angles, the endearingly eclectic hostages, and Denzel Washington's considerable skills as a comic performer.Lee never allows things to get too heavy. There's a thread of humour that weaves all the way through the film. Like the Sikh hostage mistaken for an Arab. It's tough being a Sikh in these post 9/11 times he moans. But he gets great cab rides!Lee also makes sure all the cast members are given their moment in the spotlight. Except maybe for Willem Dafoe's character. He gets a bit shortchanged really because he's not allowed to flesh out his persona the way the others are. And towards the end, he gets forgotten about. Inside Man's only flaw.But as for everyone else, they're all superb. Washington has never been better. Throwing out witty one-liners at every turn, but maintaining his professionalism, he's a charismatic hero. Owen is excellent as always, wonderfully sinister, and as the film progresses, surprisingly ambiguous too.Christopher Plummer delivers a beautifully nuanced, modulated performance that swings between paternal and concerned, to self-serving and deceitful. He has a dirty little secret that Dalton's bank robbery threatens to expose.But the most interesting character is Jodie Foster's special ""fixer"" Madeleine White. Although a mysterious woman with unclear motivations, Foster's enthusiasm sells the character. She walks around the city like she owns it. She's on a first name basis with the Mayor. She talks terms with all the skills of an Ivy League girl. She acts like she has all the answers, and expects to be capitulated to. Even in hostage situations. Its a delightfully exuberant performance on her part. Foster hasn't inhabited a role so well since Clarice Starling. She's clearly having a great deal of fun, and her acting is so much better here than her somewhat neurotic performance in Flightplan.As things wrap up, Inside Man delivers a whopper of a grand finale. A genuine left-field turn that left my head spinning. An ending that's clever, satisfying and ultimately very rewarding. Check out Inside Man. Its wonderfully slick, very engrossing and kept in perspective by Spike Lee's marvellous direction.Superb stuff!",Inside Man
152,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Mildly intelligent cat-and-mouse game, but more than a little 'standard'",6,3 August 2006,"One day, an unidentified group of robbers lead by Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), dressed in painter's suits, walk into the Manhattan Trust on Wall Street. They set up a bank robbery, taking fifty hostages and have them strip down to their underwear and into similar painter suits. Inside Man zooms in between this hostage situation and the NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazer (Denzel Washington), rendering Inside Man into an enjoyable and well-paced heist thriller.It is evident that Inside Man is Spike Lee's more commercial and safe feat, taking us away from the gritty crime-infested streets of racial prejudice in films like Summer of Sam, Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever, and into the high-profile banks of Wall Street where corruption and deceit escalate as the film progresses. By endowing the film and setting with an air of class and upper-class elitism, he thereby showcases his versatility as a director, because this completely different from any film of his I have ever seen. Lee stills interweaves Inside Man with the odd racial issue, as is his trademark, but it seems he treats this as a mandatory inclusion, touching upon it but not really exploring it or giving it much importance.Inside Man is a very standard crime thriller, not just for Spike Lee, but as a heist-film in general; it has all the necessary plot twists and the intelligence of a cat-and-mouse game, but it is nothing special. Anyone but Clive Owen as the bank robber would have satisfied, because he still sounds like a bored photocopier with one eye on the clock for the pubs opening and is altogether incapable of projecting any charisma or screen-presence in Inside Man. Instead, Denzel Washington is left to facilitate the action by himself and he just about makes it. A completely decent, often entertaining crime thriller... but please, Spike -- stick to what you're really good at in the future. 6 out of 10",Inside Man
153,wrlang,Wonderful,9,11 August 2006,"Inside Man is a nice film about a bank robbery, hostage taking, and a little bit more. The movie starts out in an interesting manner; the star tells you the - who, what, where, when - of the film up to a certain point and then lets you see how it all happens. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington do a very fine job in this film along with Jody Foster and Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe. There are many twists, turns, and hints that giveaway some of the ending. A great combination of multiple story lines and flash-forwards that give the film a slightly different format. Owen and his crew enter Plummer's bank and take everyone hostage. While Washington and Dafoe try to catch the robbers and save the hostages, Plummer (a man with a secret) hires Foster to convince Owen to leave that secret alone. Foster calls in some favors from some powerful people that hinders Washington from catching up with what's going on. Can Washington catch up, save the hostages, and grab the robbers? A top notch film destined to be a classic.",Inside Man
154,socrates99,This is a far better film than the critics led me to believe,9,26 August 2006,"I saw this film last week and except for a minor quibble that I'll describe later, I've been thinking about what a travesty it was it wasn't highly praised during its theatrical release. Bank robbery is an old topic in the movies and the stories have been told from almost every perspective, but Spike Lee's treatment here seems new and fresh. There's a little bit of disappointment in store for you near the end but by then, for me at least, Mr. Lee had earned the benefit of the doubt. I particularly loved his capture of every element of the crime. There are no leaps ahead in the narrative that require you to puzzle what was left out. Foster, Plummer, Owen and Washington all show why they're paid the big bucks. They all bring depth of character and easy believability to their roles without making their characters worn out reruns.I don't doubt Russell Gewirtz deserves a lot of the credit for his screenplay, but Lee was right there with the goods to make it shine. For my money this is Lee's most entertaining film and though there was an annoying repetitive reference to an Hispanic police officer who mostly was a disembodied voice through much of the movie, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't had the subtitles for the hearing impaired on. (I don't appreciate missing clues.) This is a wonderful film and I hope Spike is willing to explore another highly commercial movie in the future. It's easy to see why he managed to assemble such a stellar cast.",Inside Man
155,asc85,Overrated,5,9 April 2006,"With all the positive press this film was getting, I was really looking forward to this movie. What a mistake on my part. ""Inside Man"" is above average at best. Where are the problems? 1. The ""twist"" ending. We sat there for more than 2 hours, and then we see this weak-ass twist? 2. Great cast, but horrible performances. Especially by the great Jodie Foster, who has this smirk on her face for the entire picture, and I have absolutely no idea why. 3. Just about everybody spoke in such a clever, heightened, but completely unrealistic way that I thought I was watching John Hughes' ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" the absolute record-holder in that category.With the dreck that came out in 2005 and now this, I've finally realized that the vast majority of movie reviewers are shills for the film industry, who tout and ""root"" for films that just aren't very good.

156,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,not your average Spike Lee outing,7,21 September 2006,"""Inside Man"" proves once again that Spike Lee has decided to expand his repertoire. It's a big, glossy-looking, Hollywood heist drama complete with all of the standard beats of others in the genre.What really sets this piece apart is the knockout job of Denzel Washington as the hostage negotiator who is starting to recover from a marred reputation. He's fully in charge of this film to the point that he doesn't even need a character arc to maintain the audience's engagement. We just enjoy watching him work, because he makes it look so damn easy! Jodie Foster turns in an exceedingly enthusiastic performance spent spouting some of the strongest dialogue in the film.Although certain aspects of it didn't coalesce, the parallel storyline that dealt with what exactly was being stolen did bring up some intriguing, if out of place, subject matter that fits far better with most of Lee's resume than the remainder of the film.",Inside Man
157,charchuk,Solid heist thriller that drags on a bit too long,8,16 August 2006,"Solid heist thriller that puts a new spin on the familiar tale and does it very well. The first two thirds or so of the movie are fantastic, with the entire bank robbery very gripping and suspenseful. Unfortunately, the plot gets tangled up in motivations and the film spirals downward a bit near the end. Perhaps a bit overlong, but the real problem is overwriting - an entire subplot could have been scrapped with only a positive effect on the film. Still, it's a great flick, chocked full of humour, intelligence, and interesting characters.The thing that separated this a bit from other heist thrillers was the Jodie Foster character, who was unfortunately underdeveloped and a bit of a waste. Her entire subplot with the Christopher Plummer character really seems out of place and poorly managed, and could have been much better had it been more properly woven into the story. The ending, which focuses primarily on this subplot, loses a lot of the momentum built up during the first two thirds, and just feels extraneous and drags the film on longer than it needed to be. That's my only large complaint; the rest of the film, by and large, is fantastic.The performances really stand out, and seeing Clive Owen and Denzel Washington going mano a mano is a real treat. Both of them are excellent, and it's hard to pick a favourite of the two. Foster is good, but her character is not really interesting. Plummer is decent but unneeded, and both Dafoe and Washington's partner are quite good. The direction is solid, with several scenes really standing out, although the entire robbery sequence is shot extraordinarily well. The cutting back and forth between the standoff and the later interviews with the hostages is interesting, and makes for a more compelling story. The final twist is quite original and intriguing, though logic is stretched a bit to make it work. Still, overall, a solid film.",Inside Man

Watch the movie and enjoy it; it is quite good.Good: The cinematography was fantastic and the acting is very good. The story is pretty well told. To make a good heist movie you need an exceptional plan or twist and this movie is not a exception. The heist plan and grand reveal were both interesting and a moment that you really should have seen coming. Good pacing and the minor effects used are acceptable. The villains are quite interesting as is Denzel Washington's character. Despite feeling very misplaced, the random moments of humour made me chuckle a bit.Bad: The ending is quite poor, not the grand reveal or the fact that the villains win, but the core ending is quite poor. The tone was all over the place with more serious moments and some more laughable moments. I didn't like the music nor did I like Denzel's partner who was just there to satisfy cop cliché 101.

When the shady CEO of the bank and a woman he's hired to help him protect certain interests arrive, he begins to discover that there's more to this bank robbery than it would seem. This is the only Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, but trust me, I'll see more, since this was a very intriguing film.What I liked about Inside Man was the style it was made. It is choppy, but not so choppy that it's annoying (cough, Domino, cough, Man on Fire), so you get a sense of tension, and it seems very high paced. The plot is good, and very intriguing. There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting. My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over, the film continued for another half hour, and it started to drag a bit. The dialogue in the movie is very cool. There's some humorous and some awesome lines that come out of the character's mouths.The acting is very good. Denzel Washington is good as always as Det. Keith Frazier. Clive Owen gives a solid performance as Dalton Russell. I liked Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer.

161,dilbertsuperman,Lots of wasted potential - a good plot start that goes absolutely nowhere!!!,5,10 July 2006,"Wow, what a movie of missed opportunities. The biggest thing Spike missed in this movie is having us be able to identify with ANYONE in the movie with some character development. The only character development I saw at any point in the flick consisted of a phone call to a horny girlfriend waiting at home and a 20 second discussion about a video game with a kid. Other than that.. there is no character development.There are a bunch of people all dressed the same and one of them has truly heavenly tits, but she never uses them so what's the point(s)?That's this movie in a nutshell- showing us all kinds of stuff that COULD happen- and never delivering with an interesting plot twist. This plot is a great idea, but it is not developed- I think they should have spent a bit more time on the plot and character development because when you have a movie full of people you don't care about, why watch it?This guy had planned the perfect heist but we are never introduced to how or why or what personal motivation he had or what ability allowed this fellow to plan this- we simply see the execution.. their is no buildup or planning like a regular heist gone wrong movie, it's just ... bang you are on and now it's a Spike Lee version of a bank robbery, only the man at the head of this operation is some kind of super genius that has foreseen everything and doesn't ever flinch. He's a complete mystery, as is why I should give a flying f#3Ck about anything that happens in this film.PLOT: A bank gets robbed by a crew in a most unusual and generally non violent method for payback of a previous thievery. When you see the plot twist of why they are there- just remember- your president's grandfather got rich the exact same way!!

The movie starts pretty much right at the hold-up and then takes us into a frenetic unfolding of their plan. These guys are good, and have a very complex plan. The police are quickly informed and set up outside the bank until the hostage negotiator (Washington, who is the glue that holds this film together) arrives. A cat and mouse game begins, and things start getting complicated when the bank's Chairman (Plummer, in his best role since ""Sound if Music"") and a mystery business woman get involved.The film was building to a crescendo...and then deflated like a balloon a day after a kid's birthday party.

163,nobbytatoes,a strange turn for Lee...,5,11 April 2006,"Opening center screen, our mastermind lays out the deal; who, what, when where, why and how. He's cool, calm and collected; you can see the gears ticking in his mind. Dalton Russell has planned the perfect heist. Confidently walking into the bank with his colleagues, they cut security and take all customers hostage. Making the hostages wearing painters uniform, people are unaware who are the hostages from the perpetrators.Called onto the case is Detective Keith Frazier. Handling the situation like other heist, Frazier lets Dalton sit. Soon Frazier smells something wrong; Dalton isn't interested in money; he has something better planned. Owner of the bank, Arthur Case, hires Madeline White. Case has personal belongings stored in a safety deposit box, which he feels might be compromised, which he wants Madeline to protect.Spike Lee has become synonymous with film of racial intolerance. Deceiding to make a genre film of a heist comes as a welcome change for Lee. Screen writer Russell Gewirtz has created a master plan for the heist, and worked out how it will play; yet there lies the conundrum. From a perfect start, Inside Man starts to split the seams on Spike Lee's inability to not venture away from making a film without making a statement. Inside Man could have been a perfectly constructed genre film, but the injections on race, tolerance, religion force Inside Man to collapse upon itself.Inside looses a lot of focus as it moves along. It doesn't really know what type of film it wants to be. The conflicting context between the heist and the racial intolerance fight with each other, instead of work together. By the end it doesn't really matter, as either of the conflicting side wont surrender; creating a rather muddled film.Over confidence can easily be said about all the actors. Denzel Washington playing the same sort of character again has become redundant; yet hard truth is he does it so well. Clive Owen is cool and calm as Dalton, yet doesn't feel like a mastermind behind this plan. Jodie Foster is disappointingly underused as Madeline, so to with Christopher Plummer as Arthur. Willem Dafoe flounders in the background, it looks like he doesn't know why he's there.

164,gary-444,Worst Jodie Foster film I've Seen,3,27 January 2007,"I watched this film as a Foster ""completist"" and was hugely disappointed, not by Foster per se, but by this clunking effort. The premise of the film - a bank heist that goes wrong with more to it than meets the eye - was promising. The execution was woeful.Denzel Washington is the lead character playing a flawed cop who is pressed into dealing with a heist, and the hostage consequence. Initially, I thought that Washington was simply playing an incompetent cop well. Then it dawned on me that there were some more fundamental incompetence issues.The musical score appears to have come from another film, it is so unsympathetically matched. Foster's appearance is at best a character part, at worst a cameo, and her role is a simplistic plotting device.The plot stretches suspension of disbelief to such absurd levels that as a viewer you feel stupid at the end for giving the Director the benefit of the doubt. A banal script gives the high quality roster of actors precious little room for manoeuvre and the direction is painfully slow.Frustratingly, the storyline has good dramatic potential. But this is squandered in spectacular style as the film limps through its two and a bit hours running time. This is the first Spike Lee film I have ever seen. I shall be consciously avoiding his previous efforts.I note that other posters have been much more positive and enthusiastic about this movie. It is rare that I am able to take such a diametrically opposed view with such confidence.",Inside Man
165,bobbobwhite,"Entertaining overall, but slow in the middle",7,10 April 2006,"I mostly liked this Spike Lee film, but I wondered early on if Denzel's cop character was going to turn out to be the real ""Inside Man"". He did get a gift from the genius bank robber at the end. Why? It was probably a token from the genius crook, who by that act was paying a smart detective handsomely for the rare challenge to his brilliance, or maybe for not being smart enough to catch him? With Spike, it has to be the former. And, actually, in the end, the detective actually did the bank robber's dirty work for him that cost the Big Cheese dearly and maybe even bought him down, so the detective worked out to be the brilliant crook's Inside Man after all. Pretty formulaic, but sharp and engrossing. Denzel was his usual very impressive, cool cat self and Clive Owen as the genius crook was terrific.Jodie Foster played a powerful rich bitch very well, one who rubbed viewer noses in something smelly that we already know, that the filthy rich are very different than the rest of us(maybe it's the money and the power and all the rest( and can do what they want to the rest of us. She did provide an important connection to the real bad rich guy of the story who paid her well for her slick work, and her bitchchick role was a great choice for the fixer between Denzel's cop and the Very Big bad banker. I liked the way that part was pulled off and the creative and suspenseful conclusion. In the end I thought it was worth the slow pace and lightweight violence that dragged it down midway.Spike Lee's boring and out of date racist drone of the white guys always being the bad guys and the black guys always being the good guys is getting real old.

Denzel Washington plays a police hostage negotiator who tussles throughout with Clive Owens criminal mastermind. I've never really rated Clive's acting before but here he shines as the bad guy and along with Denzel's performance they keep the film flowing along at a thrilling pace. Basically its cat and mouse with a twist or two but it is so stylish and clever and funny that it just has such a fresh feeling about it. With an orchestral soundtrack that should seem out of place but strangely fits, the music only goes to enhance the overall plot. There is an array of supporting cast members from bank staff to customers who all have their own little scenes that are cut in at intervals during the film to reveal a little more of the plot each time.

168,barberoux,Great!,9,17 April 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good. The story was good and there were plenty of funny lines that I guffawed at. Denzel Washington was great as the NY cop who had to negotiate with Clive Owen, also great, who was holding hostages in a bank. Spike Lee's direction was superb. There were no throw away scenes. Take for example the cell phone scene where the criminals told everyone to dump their phones into a sack. That could have been handled very differently but it was prolonged and stretched out to provide a suspenseful scene. The incident didn't really have much to do with the main plot but it was handled so well you were on the edge of your seat waiting to see what would happen. There were many scenes like that. Ordinary events, well ordinary for this type of movie, were treated with respect and used to provide entertainment and not just thrown away. This is a movie that you would want to see again after you know the whole plot just to see how they went about the caper. Another scene I enjoyed was the interview with one of the women about section 34DD. The tension created with this small scene was wonderful. Will he look or not? I thought the movie was well filmed, well written and well acted. See this movie. It was a delight.",Inside Man
169,refresh_daemon,"A good effort, but needs to be more cohesive",7,1 February 2007,"It's a new Spike Lee joint! So inside man is basically a caper/hostage negotiation drama. It's got all the typical things you'd see in these types of films. Cops. Robbers. Hostages. Intricate plots. But... no daring chases, no real flashy action... and so it's mostly the drama (and bits of comedy).In the end, the film feels sort of real and sort of unreal at the same time. The direction and the writing speak very much to the realness of the ""regular characters."" The regulars being the cops, the hostages, the citizens on the street. But the ""powerful"" characters, as well as the lead robber character are a little surreal. Not to say that they're bad, but the powerful characters are the ones that seem to come more out of the typical caper films and the regular characters out of more ordinary dramas. This clash has a slightly negative effect because it makes it hard to get ""in"" to the film.Although Spike Lee has a directorial flash and style all his own, at the same time, he hasn't yet been able to make it a standard language of his cinema, so when you need a backwards dolly-shot with Denzel Washington on what looks like a people mover you remember that you're watching a movie. It knocks you out of the film. The interview segments that intercut the action are less jarring since the film begins with Clive Owen in an interview.However, the plotting is clever, the humor is believable and enjoyable and the racial undertones to parts of the film are appreciable without being overdone. The weakness is in the total cohesion and the suspension of disbelief. It felt like there were two films being made of different tones and there were combined in this movie and didn't entirely get along. But a good effort. Spike, keep at it.Finally, Inside Man didn't feel very theatrical. Probably because it didn't immerse me that well in its world. So I'd say it's a rental. A flawed, but good effort. And certainly not a bad choice to watch... although by no means necessary. 7/10.",Inside Man
170,luke-a-mcgowan,"Lovingly shot and engrossing, with fine performances from Owen, Washington and Foster",9,1 December 2015,"This movie blew my mind as a kid, and rewatching it last night showed me that whilst it didn't stand up to that first watching, Spike Lee's film is still an enthralling, near-perfect bank heist even if its external subplot is a bit less fun.We open on Clive Owen, sitting in what appears to be a prison cell. The beauty of Inside Man is that often we see things that mean little to us until their meaning is revealed to us later on. Owen and his smooth, deliberate and calm delivery hook us into the film before we even begin. I'm a big sucker for ""listen carefully"" monologues, and Owen's might be one of the best.The opening montage is a clash between gorgeous cinematography and grating music - for some reason, Spike Lee wanted to incorporate Slumdog Millionaire music before it was cool. Then we kick straight off - Owen and co storm a bank, take everyone hostage and set to work. Much of the film is seen through the eyes of Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington), the lead hostage negotiator who handles the situation on the ground. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is one of the film's highlights. He uses Steadycam to show us that Owen is firmly in control, while Denzel scenes are filmed with hand-held cam to indicate confusion. The initial hostage scenes are genuinely frightening thanks to Owen's commanding performance (even behind a mask and sunglasses) and the almost too smooth tracking shots reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket's opening scene. There are almost no noticeable cuts during these bank tracking shots and they create an incredible aura of tension when we realise how close the robbers are in proximity to the hostages at all times. Flash forward scenes, during which Denzel and Chiwetel try to pick the hostages from the robbers, are bleached to show us the different time periods. Barry Alexander Brown does an impeccable job editing the film together from all of Libatique's cameras.Denzel Washington was an inspired choice for Frazier, a charming, calm and collected negotiator with whom breaking eye contact is impossible. The scenes during which he and Clive Owen talk are woefully too few, as both men are exceptional. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a solid partner for Denzel Washington (far better utilised than he was in American Gangster) and Willem Dafoe is solid as the lead uniform on the ground. The film also has a very meaningful subplot about the bank's founder (Christopher Plummer) and his hired ""fixer"" (Jodie Foster - exceptional as a calm woman who never looks down on anyone but nevertheless knows she is superior) trying to protect interests within the bank. All scenes involving the robbery itself are exceptional with few flaws. Many of the film's extras are excruciating - loud caricatures like ""New York woman"" and ""Jewish man"" - and some of the writing really ruins the scene (an old woman screeches for the robbers to ""go ahead, make my day""). The story is the film's greatest asset, but a fair bit of dialogue is poor. The best scenes are the ones owned by Denzel, who Lee instructed to improvise. Once the robbery comes to an end, the story stays overlong as Denzel plays politics with Foster and searches for the truth. Its never explained how Owen knew where his sought bounty was or even that it was in the bank - the identities of his accomplices tend to go over our heads given that we cannot pick them from the film's extended cast. And the film's final scene literally feels like it is leaning into a porno, with bow-chicka music and Denzel's annoying girlfriend on the bed moaning about handcuffs. However, Inside Man is a directorial achievement, featuring a cast of magnificent smooth- tongued actors and one of the best thought out crimes ever put to film.",Inside Man
171,PipAndSqueak,Oh come off it!,6,7 April 2006,"Two hours diversion...if you've got absolutely nothing else to do. Too many stereotypes and stupid setups to be at all convincing. Lee, an idealist, makes heavy weather of a poorly constructed script. More could have been made of this mishmash of ""isms""....without spending the huge amounts of money that must have been needed to produce this old boiler. I don't for one moment believe that the 'idealist'robbers would have been so insensitive to the Jewish woman's discomfort when commanding her to 'strip to her underwear' given that they were intending to expose the Bank's Nazi sympathising Chairman.

Denzel (who I always think kicks ass) is a hard hitting negotiator who plays by his own rules. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer are slimeballs that are there for him to eat. Clive Owen is awesome as well. Not to mention, Spike is working off a great Hollywood script. And although he takes every opportunity to throw in his typical racial messages, and references to the Yankees and Mets, you can't help but dig the story and cast.

This explains the 'when' too.The 'why' is obvious.But the 'how'? Like The Bard said, 'Therein Lay The Issue'.Or not? Detective Keith Frazier finds himself into one hell of a maze because of Dalton; a maze filled with the bank founder (Christopher Plummer)'s unspeakable secrets and with Maddie White (Jodie Foster), a woman with a peculiar choice of surname for what she is hired to protect...Spike Lee has created an instant classic of the bank robbery genre; everybody is in part, the script is really tight while having more twists and turns than a corkscrew (and some nods to landmark movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico), music, cinematography... probably the most inventive - and hard to guess - of the genre.Inside Man: 9/10.",Inside Man
174,Mr Parker,4 is the magic number,8,16 August 2006,"When you put Denzel Washington together with Spike Lee, the sparks are pretty much guaranteed to fly. Even with their weakest collaboration, ""He Got Game"", Denzel still gives one of his best performances ever. With ""Inside Man"", their fourth collaboration together, you get the satisfaction of both Denzel's solid acting and a genuinely exciting, well told and well acted thriller.I'm hesitant to discuss the plot but I can definitely say that this movie had my attention all the way through. I, like many others, am pleasantly surprised at Lee's handling of the material, which is a change from his usual fare. With this film and the 25th Hour under his belt, I guess it can be said that Lee can indeed direct a mainstream film.Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were all excellent. The film's pace never lets up and maybe I'm just misinformed or didn't notice any logistical inaccuracies but I thought that the bank robbery itself was ingenious. The last few minutes of the movie are pretty cool also. When everything becomes clear in the end, you probably won't see it coming and that's probably the biggest reason for me liking this film.The story is very surprising and very entertaining. It reminded me of those gritty cop drams from the 70's. I strongly recommend this film to all of those looking for an exciting little flick with a good story and great acting.RATING: **** out of *****.",Inside Man

176,anhedonia,Spike goes conventional,5,17 April 2006,"Here's my biggest problem with ""Inside Man"" - why does Spike Lee start it the way he does? Without giving away anything, I have never understood screenwriters and filmmakers who decide to start films this way as a means of being unconventional. The trouble is, when you pull something like this, especially in a thriller, you take away any sense of danger from the protagonist. The audience is already in the know a couple of minutes into the picture, so it's rather pointless to put your hero, or in this case, anti-hero, in any danger throughout the rest of the picture.""Inside Man"" still remains an intriguing picture with some good performances. But after the heist takes on a pleasantly unexpected turn, the writer and Lee don't really go to any pains to hide from us the ugly details of someone's past. Given the character and circumstance, it really isn't too hard to figure out what the big secret is. And once that is done - and, believe me, the secret can be found out very quickly, even before Jodie Foster figures it out - the rest of the film loses much of its edge.There really is no suspense here and you're simply waiting and wondering how the filmmakers will end this.And, therein lies another problem. This film does not know when to end. Like the Energizer Bunny, it just keeps going and going and going from one denouement to another.The performances are good. Then again, with Owen, Foster, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetal Eijofor and Christopher Plummer, how could they not be? But Washington, at times, seems to be going through the motions without much conviction and Foster - who's role is never quite explained, but that's alright - gets to be juicily cunning.Lee's touches are unmistakable. Ever the political filmmaker, the best moments of ""Inside Man"" are the slight ones, the ones you quickly forget. Lee, in passing, makes subtle, yet potent, statements about police response in a post-9/11 America (and New York) and also how Americans continue to confuse Arab with Muslim, Sikh with Arab or Muslim or just about anyone who looks different with Arab or Muslim.""Inside Man"" is an enjoyable, albeit slight, escape into a heist film that is not as taut as it thinks it is.",Inside Man
177,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"a worthwhile crime film with an interesting plot, good music, and great acting",9,26 July 2006,"Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' has a very recycled theme, the bank robbery. But this particular bank robbery film is much different, because it manages to keep you interested for every minute, with the 3 main stars, Clive Owen in particular, giving wonderful performances. The music is the classic good guy versus bad guy type, and even though it seems corny, you'll like it. With a stellar director, excellent writing, and a star studded cast including Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and Oscar nominee Clive Owen, Inside Man, as of this writing, is the best crime film of the year.Dalton Russell (Owen) believes he's planned the perfect bank robbery, as he tells us in the opening scene of the film. I won't tell you exactly how he's done this, because that ruins the surprise of how well organized the heist is. Keith Frazier (Washington), a troubled NYPD detective, says otherwise. Meanwhile, the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer) believes that one of his most sacred possessions is in danger, so he taps the help of Madeline White (Foster), a smooth and persuasive business woman who seems to have a certain dark mystery about her...First off, the shows the 3 main stars put on is fabulous, with Clive Owen leading the pack, followed by Jodie Foster, then Washington. Owen delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mastermind of the heist, because even though his face is sealed for a good part of the film, he delivers each line with a quiet voice, yet a voice that says, 'I'm in charge, and if you get in my way, I will crush you'. He is in control the whole film, making you wonder what he'll do next. This is the best villainous performance in a non-fantasy film I've seen recently. One cannot help but be in awe of Jodie Foster in this film, because while Clive Owen has control of everything inside, she seems to have control of everything else with her smooth words and seemingly effortless charisma. It is easy to see why her character is such a mysterious character, even more mysterious than the villain of the film. Denzel Washington has not delivered a bad movie since 1995, and the streak doesn't end here. As the star of the film, he does command the screen just as you expect him to do. It's a different turn for Denzel, as we're used to seeing him play strong willed characters with a seemingly unbeatable attitude. Washington does a great job playing a character that is flawed, apprehensive, and well...human. Also in the film are Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Washington's partner, and Willem Dafoe as a police captain. All three deliver strong performances, but none of an overwhelming amount of screen time, so it doesn't particularly matter.Spike Lee is a great director who's given us a ton of great films for the ages (not to mention classic moments at New York Knicks games), and Inside Man is no different. He captures the mystery of the story extremely well, but he also maintains a certain 'cool factor' by throwing in really clever lines and funny situations that keep the film from becoming too serious. I loved the writing here as well, as it'll keep you guessing until the end of the film. It's got one of those endings that you'll either love or hate, sort of how 2004's Collateral made you feel (for the record, the endings of the two movies are NOT similar, I'm just describing the feeling). When all is said and done, 'Inside Man' deserves to go down as one of the best crime films of recent memory. I enjoyed it a lot, and I hope you do too.9/10 --spy",Inside Man
178,ikanboy,One of the best in it's genre.,8,25 March 2006,"From the opening sound track (Indian?) to the satisfying ending, this is a most entertaining and engrossing movie. I hated having to go to the loo half way through! Bank robbery movies are great for tension and, these days, high tech gadgetry. They also let us try and decide how/if the bad guys are going to escape. This one skips around the gadgetry and goes for sleight of hand, but it has tension in spades and an escape scenario that is brilliantly conceived, and almost believable.Most of all it has great actors, with great lines, and a great Director - Spike Lee. Not only three super stars (Foster, Denzel, and the mesmerizing Owen), but other greats like Dafoe, and Plummer. and a slew of choice little cameo parts for the acting studios latest graduates. It's so well crafted that one can forgive it the inevitable ""I don't think so"" moments.Clive Owen and three ( or are there more?) accomplices walk into a Bank dressed as painters. They terrorize everybody in to ridding themselves of their cell phones - a post 911 must - and then dress them in the same outfits they change into: Jump suits, with hoods, and face masks, and sun glasses. Then they set to work...not robbing the Bank. They rip up the floor in a storage room; but why? They leave the money sitting in it's plastic wrapped blocks. They demand buses and a plane but seem to be in no hurry.Jodie Foster is hired by the owner of the Bank (Plummer) to negotiate with the robbers for the contents of a safe deposit box that he insist must not see the light of day. Jodie gets to play Ann Coulter on amphetamines. Blond, smart, take no prisoners attitude, and the best legs of any CEO. She's a ""fixer"", and though she insists she doesn't need to know Plummer's secret, we all know she has to have it, because that's how she got to be so damned irreplaceable and powerful - by knowing everybody's dirty little secrets. A bitch with J. Edgar's talent and expertise.Denzel Washington is fleshing out his ""cop with a problem in his past"" role from ""out of time"", only this time he's in New York and he's nobody's patsy. We know he's going to get his man, but who is that ""man"" exactly? Everybody under estimates him, and when he makes his biggest mistake, we are surprised and feel sorry for him.Clive Owen gets the best lines, many of them said dead pan into the camera, or into the face of Jodie or Denzel. He's tough and smart, and has figured out every detail of the robbery, but he's no sociopath, and at times we wonder if he's a vigilante criminal, out to right some wrong.Spike Lee makes this movie hum with tension and great scenes, many of them small little gems, such as the racist cop trying to tell Denzel about being shot without using racial epithets, which slip out any way; or the knock out Albanian lady who can translate the robbers taped conversation; or her ex husband, a New York Construction worker who is loathe to let her get any glory.Lee, throughout the movie, also lets us in on the investigation interview scenes that take place after the robbery, teasing us with some of the answers but too few to make a difference. He never lets the action lag, nor swings off into unnecessary cul de sacs for character development, and lets the intelligent screen writing show us the characters, and lead us through the plot with terse, meaty dialog. Spike, you've done the genre proud!",Inside Man
179,tccandler,Spike Lee Chooses His Words Very Carefully...,8,24 March 2006,"Have you ever heard someone play the first seven notes of a piano scale... and then stop? It's irritating isn't it? Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" is like a spectacular flash of lightning and the moments immediately after when you are waiting for a thunderous boom... and you wait, and wait, and wait, only to realize that it's not coming.One could safely describe this film as the anatomy of a perfect heist... A bank robbery so perfectly planned that it almost reeks of being too good to be possible. It is the set-up, the execution, the police response, the interplay between the two, the sub-plots and typical Spike Lee touches that make this film one of the finest three-quarters of a film this year. It is just that darn final act which fizzles in comparison to the electric build-up.Clive Owen is rigidly organized and controlled as the mastermind of this bank robbing team. The plan seems simple enough... Dress the team as painters, enter a Manhattan bank branch, overpower the patrons and employees and take the loot. Right? Wrong. It's never that easy, otherwise they wouldn't have made a film about it.Once inside, the cops swarm the exterior, led by the 1950's film-noir-styled detective played with debonair cool and muffled intensity by Denzel Washington. He is an ambitious cop with legal troubles of his own and he knows that this hostage negotiation could be his big break.Christopher Plummer plays the founder and CEO of the bank in question. He is under extreme duress when hearing of the heist because of some very secretive safety deposit box contents that could damage his reputation. He hires Jodie Foster's Madeleine White, a facilitator of solutions to such problems.The story unfolds in ways that would be unfair of me to divulge to first time viewers. Needless to say, there is a David Mamet like complexity to the proceedings that allows for twists and turns and misdirection.The cast is stellar. Washington, Owen and Foster are all in fine form, each delivering a character with wit and insight and each possessing a different kind of power. There is confidence brimming over in this cast. No one feels out of place.What is absolutely brilliant about this film is the way in which Spike Lee manages to build the film to such a crescendo using a very familiar formula. One of the characters even references the classic seventies flick, ""Dog Day Afternoon"". Lee manages to craft virtually everything for the first ninety minutes to perfection. No detail or plot hole is left to bother us. The viewer is crystal clear what is happening and we get a good sense of where every character resides during this stand-off.The only thing we don't know is how the film is going to resolve itself. Unfortunately, it is at that point that we start to realize that Spike Lee may have the same problem. I will not give anything away in regards to the plot, but I will say that the final act is untidy and unsatisfying considering the meticulousness of the build-up.I want to stress that I am absolutely not clamoring for a typical Hollywood ending here. A shoot-out would not be the way to end such crafty thriller. What is needed is a crisp re-write to clarify the positions of all involved... especially the Jodie Foster character.I felt like I was waiting for that chill-down-my-spine moment that never came. The big reveal. Instead, the film felt slightly anticlimactic and predetermined... Like there was nothing at stake all along. I am giving the film a strong grade in spite of that final fade because it had the makings of one of the best films of the year up until that point.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",Inside Man

And right from the word go it does not disappoint, as you thrown straight away into the action and one excellent thing was that you got to learn a bit about the characters as the film rolled on and did not stop for anything. Clive Owen was nothing short of brilliant as a smart, witty and ultra cool bank robber with Denzel at the other end pulling his weight as well. The other cast members like Defoe, and Foster not to mention Owen's team done a very good job. The film as it stands on its own was nothing short of fantastic as Spike Lee leaves you lost in it. Although it was an action/thriller movie it still had its bits of sharp humour which was most welcoming as well as being a smart taking an odd twist or turn and not leaving the viewer confused . I would love to go further into it and explain the film but I feel that might be giving a bit away, so my advice to you is check out the trailer , then the film and I promise you it will be time well spent ! To sum it up Inside Man is a clever, caper flick which has been very well directed and brought together, but if you don't believe me , check it out for your-self.

Lee adds his own touches to a very good, smart script by Russell Gerwitz, and creates a complex, non-linear, suspense drama. It does take a little bit of time to get this train running in the right direction, but when it gets going, you are not only going to enjoy the ride, but you will marvel at how you got to the end.""Inside Man"" is a homage to ""Dog Day Afternoon"". It is built around a bank robbery that is being led by Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). When the bank robbers take hostages, the investigation is headed by hostage negotiator Detective Kieth Frazier (Denzel Washington).Frazier was on track to become a first grade detective, but he is being investigated for some potential improprieties centered on his previous case. The man is down and may be on his way out. Russell is a thief in search of answers to questions that should have been resolved 50 years ago.Between the two of them is Madeline White(Jodie Foster)who is working for Arthur Case(Christopher Plummer), a man who can see to it that both Frazier and Russell get what they want, without having his dirty, little secrets revealed.The casting is impeccable. Washington is at the top of his game trying to put the case together, while his personal and professional life are coming apart at the seams. Once again the teaming of Lee and Washington yields wonderful results. Foster is terrific in a role that is very different from most of her other work. Type-A personality to the nth degree, and to say the least, she doesn't play well with others. Owen is also first rate. His Dalton Russell may or may not have a conscience, may or may not be just a thief, but he is a unique man who can be brutal when he needs to be, or tender ( the scene with the boy on his PSP is one of the best in the film), and he can see the point of view of his opponents, which makes him both dangerous and sensitive. It is the best performance in the film.In the end, ""Inside Man"" is a top notch suspense thriller with wonderful performances and a top shelf directing effort by Spike Lee.8 out of 10",Inside Man

Dalton plans on robbing the Manhattan bank in New York City. When he goes to rob the bank, he has a building filled of hostages and his plan is set in action. Detective Keith Frazier is the cop in charge of this hostage situation and will stop at nothing to solve this case. As time goes on, Frazier knows that Dalton is not the typical bank robber but a man with a much larger plan.""Inside Man"" basically brings back Spike Lee to the directing circle. This film has gained the attention of critics and audiences alike and for once in many years I can honestly admit I like Spike Lee again. I guess this is the new thing in Hollywood; older directors who seemed to lose their touch come back with a big hit. Woody Allen did it with ""Match Point"", Ang Lee did it with ""Brokeback Mountain"", and now Spike Lee did it with ""Inside Man."" The great thing about ""Inside Man"" is the suspense that the film builds. As the film continues on you wonder how it's going to end. You have a feeling early on that it's not going to be a typical ending but a surprise ending. So as you sit there watching the film you begin trying to piece together the pieces of the puzzle and try to figure out what's going to happen in the end of the film.Another thing I liked about the film was that it wanted be a good bank robbery film like ""Dog Day Afternoon"". It wasn't as typical as most bank robbery or cop films are today. It played homage to the 70s and 80s when it came to bank robbery movies. The good thing about this film was that it wasn't overly predictable. It had some nice twists and had you guessing up until the end.Be warned that this movie does throw a lot at you. There are many characters that are very significant to the story but as time goes on you can have a hard time connecting them all together. At first after watching this film I was wondering what the hell happened but then on my drive home I was thinking about it and everything clicked. This is a movie that you have to pay attention for. It's not a brainless action film like Die Hard where you can shut your brain off and enjoy mindless entertainment. This movie actually has some substance to it.The acting all around is superb as you probably already guessed. Denzel Washington gives yet another fine performance that has a nice hint of humor to it. Clive Owen is great as the brilliant and cocky bank robbery. Jodie Foster plays a very good character here which is different than many roles I have seen her in. And finally Willem Dafoe is great as well. ""Inside Man"" has a great cast and each person involved does a great job playing their role.In Conclusion, ""Inside Man"" is finally a bank robber film for people who actually like to think when they go to the movies. The film provides excellent performances and a very interesting and creative script. As I watched the film I found myself wondering where the film was going. I also wondered what Dalton's alternative motive was. It's a good film that really shows off Spike Lee ability to direct good movies. I think this film is a reminder to Hollywood that every cop movie doesn't have to be so predictable and action packed. It's a good cop movie that is actually pretty original.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Inside Man"" is a 7/10.",Inside Man
185,TheMovieMark,So far one of 2006's best...,9,29 March 2006,"Show of hands - who here loves heist movies where thieves are doing their very best to pull off the perfect robbery? Well good news - Inside Man is one of the best of the genre to come along in quite some time.What I love most about the movie is the air of mystery that surrounds it and its characters for the entire runtime. Nobody's true motivations are immediately revealed, and it's our job to follow along as everything plays out. And I recommend that as you follow along you pay careful attention to all the characters from the very beginning. You could start to get the hostages and bank robbers confused. But let's get back to our mysterious main characters...You've got Clive Owen - the calm and collected ringleader who has strategically planned this robbery to the smallest detail. He really doesn't seem to be that bad of a guy at heart. He doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has a job to do and he has to make sure everyone realizes that he's not messing around. He simply must establish that they're not smarter than he is. Who is he and exactly what is his motivation? Then there's Denzel Washington. He's a newly promoted detective whose girlfriend is ready for a ring, but at the moment he has a few hostages in the bank that concern him. But how innocent is he? He's currently surrounded by a corruption scandal involving a missing $140,000 and this could play to his disadvantage regardless of whether he's innocent or not.And what on earth is up with Jodie Foster and her uppity little self? Ever a total wainch (it's a Southern term my friends and I invented, you probably get the gist), she is obviously very skilled in hitting guys where it hurts, and no, I don't mean the pocketbook. She's a mysterious power broker who knows how to keep her ""clients"" happy.Her most recent client is Christopher Plummer who just so happens to own the bank that is being robbed. He is really interested in only one thing - the contents of a particular safety deposit box. He wants Jodie to retrieve these contents or make sure they're destroyed. What exactly is he trying to hide? Don't go into the movie looking for a rapid fire action thriller. Inside Man's pace is more deliberate, allowing for gradual character and story development. That's a hard thing to find in a two hour movie these days, but here's an example of how to pull it off. The dialogue is smart and funny, the characters demonstrate believable chemistry, and the script is cleverly written. There may not be any plot twists of Sixth Sense proportions, but it keeps you guessing and manages to serve up a couple of surprises along the way.To say any more would be a risk of revealing too much, so just go enjoy the movie. But you need to be prepared to immerse yourself for a full two hours. If you're even the slightest fan of heist thrillers then check out Inside Man and find out exactly why ""respect is the ultimate currency.""",Inside Man
186,cordenw,A journeyman's film,6,24 August 2021,"Clive Owen is a very good actor, Denzel Washington has all of the right star material and they do not a bad job in this movie made back in 2006. It's about a bank robbery in New York where nothing is robbed and no one is shot.Yeah I'm serious ..No one is shot in a New York cop movie.... say it ain't so😃You'll get it when you watch the pictureI'm always mystified when they bring in a ""fixer"" in these sort of heist- come political intrigue thrillers ... Are there really people like that out there?What's 'er face Foster does a good job as the fixer and to tell the truth, from my dealings with the New York, Political and Justice system, she's probably drawn from a real life character .....so there must be fixers in the system.She doesn't have to do much though, either acting or in her role but she's pretty convincing with her business suits and elegant style.It's a movie that you have to concentrate on or you'll lose the plot because it's one of those flashback set ups where you jump from one scene to another.A pretty dreary performance from Christopher Plummer but let's not speak ill of those who have passed away.It has a few clichéd moments in the script to keep it politically correct and it has an unnecessary side story involving the voluptuous girlfriend of Washington. But you need these things to keep it real, to raise the money and get people in to see it.The ending's a bit confusing if you don't keep your wits about you but overall it was a good way to spend 2 hours or so even though it's back from 2006.",Inside Man
187,pinkliz41,An excellent heist movie with many great thrills,8,5 August 2008,"Inside Man in my opinion nearly touches the greatness of other brilliant crime/heist movies like Heat. It delivers great dialogue a neat story and thrills to keep you guessing right to the closing credits. Not to forget an excessively good cast like Denzel Washington, Christopher Plummer, Willem Defoe, Cive Owen and Jodie Foster that also add that extra touch of brilliance to a well crafted and balanced film. Inside Man excels on all levels and beyond that most films wouldn't go near. The acting is stunning and will definitely leave you feeling like you have watched Academy Award performances from all. The story is edgy, gritty and epic. And the directing is of such high calibre that Michael Mann may even struggle to top.",Inside Man
188,kyrat,interesting thriller,7,3 June 2006,"OK, so you have to suspend some belief. Was it supposed to be guilt that led someone to keep 50+ year old incriminating documents? If you can accept that, it's pretty interesting to watch and figure out what's going on. I generally like Spike Lee films, but as always he does have issues with his women. I love Jodie Foster but her character was one dimensional. There was no explanation of who she was, how she got that way or how she could wield any power. Denzel's gf despite being a cop in her own right was just shown a few times lying around in lingerie waiting for him to come home while he's busy working on a huge hostage situation. The trampy gum smoking Albanian immigrant. I guess I should feel glad that the hostage woman was ignored, except of course for them trying to identify her by her bust size.Overall, it was worth watching. It gave enough clues so you could try to figure stuff out, but also kept you guessing til the end. As usual, there's some small moments highlighting racial issues (I liked the commentary on ""Grand Theft Auto"" game that encourages violence and sexism) or a Sikh victim being automatically treated as a criminal/terrorist. I also liked the fact that they had a diverse multiracial, cross gender/cross age group of robbers.",Inside Man
189,faraaj-1,Good heist flick,8,22 April 2006,"I just saw this on release in a local cinema. I'm not a huge heist film fan and high-octane thrillers aren't really my thing but I liked this movie a lot. The best thing, of course, was the plot. Really intricate unlike the negotiator. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington have both come in ""one"" of if not the best film of their respective careers to-date and both are quite good. This is an intelligent thriller and moves along very well just based on an excellent script. The heist is amazingly well planned.This is not a typical Spike Lee joint but he proves he's a good director with the pacing. See the pandemonium when the news of the heist first breaks (near the beginning of the movie). The camera goes crazy but when we get to the bank, its totally calm. Different mood tones are created. It was also nice to see an old legend like Christopher Plummer in a decent role. My only complaint would be that the Jodie Foster character was not fully developed. Well, there isn't much in depth characterisation or background info for anyone because the plot is more important and fast-paced.",Inside Man
190,mr_popcorn,My name is Dalton Russell...,9,2 November 2006,"Directed by Spike Lee, this film is about a bank robber, a tough cop and a power fuel broker and the events that happens that makes them connected and linked to each other. The bank robber, Dalton Russell, portrayed by the British fellow Clive Owen, along with his band of robbing ragtags holds a bank a hostage and won't release them until their demands are met. But not is all as it seems. Then enters a tough cop with his trusty partner (Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor respectively) who tries to negotiate with the bank robbers aided by the police chief Darius (Willem Dafoe). The bank robbers' demands are: two buses, a 747 Jet and food. The last one was already taken care of but the other two still remains a mystery to them. Why would the bank robbers bring their hostages all the way? Then, another plot comes in. The owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) hires Madeliene (Jodie Foster) to retrieve something from the safety deposit box inside the bank. You know, talk her way through the bank robbers and get the valuable possession that Arthur wants back. Whatever that was, it sure sounds very important to him and is shant be revealed to the public of its contains. Here comes the main ingredient of the whole movie: The robbers led by Dalton didn't rob the bank for the money, I mean not the green money in boxes and is hidden safely in the vault, they held the bank hostage because they want what Madeliene want: the mysterious item owned by Arthur.I'm not gonna tell you the whole story, you find that out for yourself. But I have one thing to say, its one of the best heist thriller flicks I've seen in a quite a while. Great acting by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. Support cast that includes Christopher Plummer, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe were top-notch too. Congratulations to Spike Lee and his dedicated crew for making an excellent movie worth remembering. A good heist movie for the whole family...well, not the WHOLE family, some parts of it yeah.",Inside Man
191,David_Frames,"""Why don't you take a picture, I'll bend down and pick up a pencil if you like""",8,27 March 2006,"Clever Clive Owen's got a plan to rob a bank and he duly does but strangely having broken in with his team, steals nothing and takes the customers hostage and waits it out while Detective Denzel Washington tries to fathom the whole thing with the police outside. Meanwhile Jodie Foster gets a call from bank owner Christopher Plummer and is ordered to safeguard the contents of a safe deposit box lieing inside the bank's vault This is relatively conventional fare from Spike Lee  heavily literate in 70's heist thrillers, indeed Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon get name checked during it's tense, carefully layered running time. This is Lee's easiest Joint to ingest in quite some time but easy shouldn't be confused with simple because Inside Man is intelligent, thoughtfully plotted stuff bolstered by the fine interplay between Owen and Washington. It works because it resembles numerous other similarly themed offerings, the aforementioned Pacino flicks included but subverts such expectations by copying the setup and then refusing to go to any of the usual places. This means you've often jumped ahead thinking you know what's going to transpire only to find Clive Owen's gun in your facemetaphorically speaking of course. Lee's strength has always been his instinctive understanding of community conflict and social difference  here used to great effect, particularly in fleshing out the multi-ethnic characters that populate the bank and notably in the tense relationship between Washington's tec and Foster's high at heel troubleshooter who's as rotten as a week old corpse but a nice contrast with Denzel's honest but rough round the edges rozzer. A fine script by Russell Gewirtz is done justice by a director with two firm hands on the material and a nice steady grip on the tension. A highly satisfying and often stylish night in the cinema for those of you looking for a meaty retooled slice of hard boiled New York Americana.",Inside Man
192,jessie-39,An exciting movie without your typical ending..great acting,8,8 April 2006,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.What an exciting movie. Denzel is his usual spectacular as are Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. The movie is great from start to finish and the ending is not known until you get there. We love movies that don't have the ending that you can guess half way through the movie. Highly recommended.",Inside Man
193,dougandwin,"Well done, Spike Lee",7,31 December 2007,"I have not always been a great fan of Spike Lee, but with The Inside Man, he has really delivered a very good and authentic film capturing the sound and feel of New York City. The plot is a little confusing at times, and complete concentration is a must, or one can very easily miss a key item. Thanks to Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Cheistopher Plummer (in particular), you are treated to great acting and suspense in a story that develops into some really good character revelations...but, in a film such as this, the real test is of the Director to deliver, and Mr. Lee has come through with flying colors.

195,daniellawson-14-787057,I'm very conflicted,7,31 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) The film does a great job of constantly building tension and maintaining its high tension levels throughout
2) When the film focuses on the central battle between Washington and Owen, it's outstanding. It should also be said that both Washington and Owen give fantastic performances
3) There are a number of great moments; whether that be a long and continuous take or our detectives trying to solve a trick question from our robbers
4) I'm very conflicted about whether this is a positive or a negative, so I'm including it in both, but the film is certainly more complex than just a run of the mill bank robbery filmNEGATIVES:1) The classic Spike Lee discussions of racial injustice pop up a few times and don't really fit in with this genre of film
2) The female characters are all either irrelevant (Foster) or objectified by their looks (to the point where two characters are literally identified solely by their big chests)
3) Of the four bank robbers, Owen is the only one that the film even attempts to give any character development to
4) As I previously mentioned, the film is more complex than an average bank robbery film. The negative side of this is that everything outside of the negotiations between Washington and Owen feels like it's in a different film. The entire subplot with Plummer and Foster ultimately amounts to very little. This entire subplot also raises more questions than it answers. This is because it brings up things like Plummer's involvement with the Nazis (which feels very random and out of place) but then the film ends so abruptly that none of the characters' story arcs are really wrapped up properly",Inside Man
196,lediscipledessocrates,A Pleasingly Unpredictable Thriller,8,23 December 2007,"The movie is good. The cast also fits in. What ,though , is the high point of this movie is the tone of the movie. No unnecessary life death situations , a suitable clourscheme and a unique use of sets. The script holds it's own and the viewer is kept guessing till the very end.The moral angle , was a bit ludicrous, but that much laxity can be given to see foster on the screen. Clive Owen is good. Denzel Washington is perhaps the star of the movie for his method acting. i rate this movie 8 though it could have mustered 9 had it been a bit more deep in characterisation . otherwise thumbs up to this different attempt in the genre.",Inside Man
197,Benjamin_Cox,Lee-Lite but still a damn fine movie all the same - 75%,7,31 May 2007,"Being new to the work of Spike Lee, I do feel like someone who has turned up late to someone else's party. Like all movie fans, I was aware of his influence and importance to modern cinema but maybe I was scared off in some way - being a white English guy probably moved me out of his target audience. Thankfully, Lee decided to give us his most mass-appeal movie yet so the uninitiated like me can admire his work and trust me, I do admire this. A twisting and thrilling heist movie with brains to match, ""Inside Man"" could well be a contender for the most under-rated movie since ""Road To Perdition"".Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who openly brags about planning the perfect bank robbery. At first, his plan works brilliantly - his gang commandeer the bank with ease and he sets his plan in motion. But it's not long before the cops arrive, led by Detectives Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who become ever-more determined to end the siege of the bank as the hostage crisis escalates. But it isn't as straight forward as that - the bank's owner Arthur Case (veteran Christopher Plummer) has some secrets buried deep in the vault and hires the mysterious Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Has Russell pulled off the perfect heist or can the cops stop him? Absorbing and beautifully shot, ""Inside Man"" shows a film-maker of real class at work. Everything from the quality of the performances (Plummer is simply great to watch) to the perfect subtlety of the soundtrack illustrates exactly how a film should look, sound and feel. Lee even manages to find time to squeeze a little humour from his stellar cast whilst simultaneously making some points on the nature of violence, racial tension and greed. Where I do feel ""Inside Man"" comes undone is the final act where I found my belief in the story tested as credibility is stretched too far. There were too many unanswered questions for me in the end, I thought, and it left me feeling curiously unsatisfied. I did feel as though I'd watched a lesson in film-making from a master of the art but maybe the tale was too convoluted to be told successfully.It's a pity that ""Inside Man"" loses its way towards the end because I can't recall the last time I was so impressed with a film. It draws you into its multi-layered story and doesn't let go for an instant. It is - rejoice - a taunt and tense thriller that actually delivers. If you wish to see how film-making should be done then I suggest you check this out. Ignore the 15-rating, though - the language is strong and frequent but assuming these things don't matter to you, I would happily recommend this utterly absorbing movie. Respect!",Inside Man
198,dhaufrect,An Outstanding Episode of Excitement,9,29 March 2006,"Spike Lee has directed an outstanding film that is filled with excitement. It is a story of a bank heist that supersedes all prior films of the same genre. Denzel Washington plays detective Keith Frazier who is assigned the job of cracking this case. His rival is Clive Owen who plays Dalton Russell, the gang leader who has taken over a major bank in New York City. Christopher Plummer plays Arthur Case, the CEO of the bank whose character is complex and challenging to the viewer. Jodie Foster plays Madeline White, a politically correct liaison to Plummer's character, and she is very convincing in this role. Wilem Davoe is Captain John Darius, and his performance is slick even though is is a minor one. This film will leave you breathless, and don't bother to guess the plot.

199,bob-rutzel,Weak Ending,6,21 August 2006,"People dressed as painters take over a bank and hold hostages. The police cannot figure out why it's taking so long for them to rob the bank and try to escape. Detective Frazier (Washington) believes there is more going on than a simple bank robbery.This is a slow movie, but it holds your interest because you and the police and the hostages have no idea what is going on. You are led to believe a bank robbery is taking place because that is what it looks like so you go with it. The police and you savor every clue and the director, Spike Lee, throws you off guard often by letting you think some of his turns have something to do with what is actually going on.The acting by all is first class and the story would have had more of an impact had the ending to this robbery made sense. Maybe I just didn't get it. At least I wasn't stressed out because there was no suspense or tension. My interest was held, but I wasn't on the edge of my chair. After you find out what the real purpose of the ""robbery"" is, you begin to question yourself as to why you sat there for 128 minutes. I sat there for this? For this? No, someone made a mistake. Not for this! See what I mean? That is where I was at the end of this movie.

200,saarvardi,"Plot holes and weak twists aside, Inside Man just reeks ""coolness"" however you look at it...",7,14 March 2006,"After attending it's press premiere here in Tel Aviv, Israel, the best thing I can say about Inside Man (2006), is that it's a very, very cool film. Plot holes and weak twists aside, this film just reeks ""coolness"" however you look at it. From the extremely stylish opening credits with the shaky camera movements, the brisk New York scenery and the uplifting Indian music; onto the powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen (which just gets better and better every film) and veteran actor Christopher Plummer, and up until that moment where the plot finally unfolds and the Indian music starts rolling again - Inside Man is a fun, if unsatisfying, roller coaster ride. That being said, the only obvious conclusions one can assume after watching this film is that A) Spike Lee has once again proved his well achieved acknowledgment for being a very talented director, and B) he did the best he could given the subject material he was given. Oh, by the way, two time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster and two time Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe also appear in this film, and give excellent performances at that, although their screen time is very limited, and makes you wonder if it was worth their efforts or not.For those who insist on plot details, take in mind that it's hard describing it without giving away potential spoilers, but I'll do the best I can. The film starts by presenting us Dalton Russell (Owen), a bank robber who confesses in front of the camera about his part in leading an extremely elaborate scheme he had recently pulled off with the help of some colleagues. What he exactly robbed, how he did it and why, is where the real fun begins. Because most of the characters in Inside Man are not what they may seem, and you'll find yourself not really knowing which side to cheer for when the curtain comes up. In the meanwhile, we flash back to the moment the scheme initiated, where we find Owen and his fellow robbers taking over a Chase Manhattan branch in Manhattan, New York. Keith Frazier (Academy Award winner Denzel Washington) is a NYPD cop who takes over the situation, trying to negotiate with Russell to retreat from the bank, where a hostage crisis quickly begins. But Russell isn't the ordinary criminal. He takes his time, doesn't seem to keen on robbing the place's assets and has all sorts of weird and unrealistic demands from the negotiation team. In comes Madeleine White (Foster), a very mysterious middle-woman who is sent to the scene by the bank's head of trusties, with a strange agenda of her own. Yeah, I know it sounds cool on the outside, but don't be tricked too quickly  the whole point of this motion picture is to look, sound and feel cool. The resolution is interesting, yet nothing we haven't seen before. If you're looking for a major resolution or for an original idea, don't get your hopes too high. But if you're looking for harmless fun, superb acting and rhythmic direction, and can skip some used ideas; you'll find Inside Man to be a fun ride in the theaters, and a tad bit better than your average matinée.",Inside Man
201,OneAnjel,Disappointing Thriller,3,23 September 2006,"As an action thriller, this movie lacks all possible triumphs and proves only that even the best actors cannot hold up a bad movie. My initial sense was that they were under-used, like high paid hookers with no one to do. Willem and Jodie, save for their faces, were positively unrecognizable. Foster's character was so far removed from her norm that it may actually be a tribute to both her ability to act and Lee's to direct. From that perspective, Foster outdid herself.But as a thriller this is a trying film with no unexpected twists. You will find yourself feeling frustrated at the lack of continuity when suddenly the movie ends. However, unlike most films that leave you with your jaw hanging open, here you will actually wonder if you dozed off and reach for the remote to back track a little.To be honest, I would bet that Lee himself is disappointed to hear all this far fetched praise for his ""coming out as a mainstream director"" when dissecting the movie will show that was not his intention. Doing the same old thing with a surreal accent, focusing on trivialities that he obviously feels target the essence of humanity, is what he's much better at. From this view, you can then understand this is not a thriller but an ironic view of life, which may explain the convoy of high powered actors performing out of their league.The one difference that Lee focuses on is making the criminals appear to have a calling that begs the question: Are they criminals at all. Not to mention the final twist, meant to offer such temptation to the good cop as to leave us suspect of how he will follow through once the credits role.Who is the Inside Man? Well, is there really a place called ""Crooklyn""? I think the title is just part of the irony; a play on words. To really consider Lee's prior work, one might have to ask if he is not referring to each of us on the inside. I still give it 3 stars for the deceptive advertising and write-up.",Inside Man
202,Barky44,A Keep-em-Guessing Thriller that Actually Works!,10,1 April 2006,"Hoo boy, I really liked this movie! Witty, intelligent, well-acted, well-written, cleverly planned, what a great film. The writers did a brilliant job, and Spike Lee did a brilliant job bringing their idea to the screen.This is so much more than just an elaborate, twisty-turny crime drama. There is so much to like here, from terrific dialog to spots of terror to political intrigue.For several years now Spike Lee has evolved from a ""ghetto filmmaker"" to a true icon of film. This film, along with ""25th Hour"" a few years back, prove that he has the ability to reach across all lines of society and make something with mass appeal. I was in a theater with a large cross-sampling of ethnicities and ages, and EVERYONE loved this film. One minute the theater is laughing with the lines, the next everyone's holding their breath, wondering what happens next.This is also Denzel Washington at his finest. His delivery is impeccable here.My only beefs are with the film score (the opening music was brilliant, but occasionally the music didn't set the right mood for the scene), and the somewhat miscast Jodie Foster (whom I love in virtually everything else she's ever done). She played her role admirably, but I don't think she was the proper person for that part.I have to give it 10 out of 10. I thought it was brilliant.Barky",Inside Man
203,film_riot,Inside Man,8,5 December 2006,"I guess it hasn't been easy for director Spike Lee to get ""Inside Man"" as good as he did (with large contributions by screenwriter Russell Gewirtz). If you plan to make a movie about a bank robbery these days, you better bring up some really good ideas. But after all, there is still a bitter taste about a heist film, because it's so hackneyed. However, after the miracle that ""25th Hour"" is, I put my trust in Spike Lee and he didn't disappoint me. There is no big introduction, the movie gets going fast and it keeps going. It features lots of interesting twists and you constantly wonder what the hell is going on. You have an idea that the burglar mastermind (very good performance by Clive Owen) is cleverer than you can imagine, but it's just at the end you realized how perfectly planned everything was. Great acting is also contributed by Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer and the rest of the cast, while Plummer's Nazi storyline is really extraordinary.",Inside Man
204,craig-hopton,Doesn't live up to its promise,6,3 August 2014,"The concept is good - it's a daring bank robbery with an original twist. And the cast is packed full of big name performers. But somehow this movie didn't deliver on its promise for me.After the initial break-in and hostage-taking by Clive Owen as Dalton Russell and his band of well-drilled co-conspirators, the plot kind of grinds to a halt and starts heading down all sort of random cul-de-sacs. I think the point is to keep you guessing as to the motives of the robbers and how they will escape - but to me it just felt fragmented and sapped the tension out of the movie. The worst of these subplots involves Jodie Foster acting as Madelaine White, an unconvincing go-between on behalf of the bank's owner who wants to recover some incriminating documents from his own safety deposit box. When White finally gets into the bank building, she simply has a short dialogue with Russell and heads straight out again. Thrilling stuff - not.I'd have preferred Inside Man to be a straight up cop vs bad guy battle of wits between Denzel Washington's character Detective Frazier and Dalton Russell. This is the main thrust of the plot in any case and where the movie is at its strongest, for example Russell outwitting Frazier by playing a tape in Armenian to make him think the robbers were from the Caucasus, or the excellent 'flash forward' scenes where Frazier interviews the 'hostages' to try and find out which of them were accomplices to Russell.All in all this movie has enough going for it to make it enjoyable viewing. But not a favourite of mine.",Inside Man
205,billion_mucks,Stalemate,6,3 November 2007,"Although it sets off pretty well, with Clive Owen talking straight to the camera saying he has the perfect plan to rob a bank, that he is 100 percent sure that his plan is flawless. We always see movies with bank robberies being the criminals risky and edgy, and repeating sometimes the same techniques and same lines. Well with the new optic of this film, one is excited. He planned it so precisely, so extensively he believes there is no possible flail. Well, this declaration is the only thing that the movie can claim of distinguished.Following this interesting commence, the movie will set with a boring brain fight between the chief police and the principal robber. Different ""interests"" for an account of the bank set an uninteresting premise where the script just doesn't go anywhere. I repeat, it promises more than whatever it delivers. The final and the twist are somewhat good, but doesn't surprise as the story doesn't introduce us to the characters correctly and we simply don't care. It appears to be a distinguished, different, excellent film. Avoid it, because it just isn't so.",Inside Man
206,masterjk2,Brilliant,7,28 April 2007,"For me, Spike Lee is erratic. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes not. But this movie is a fine example of what he can be. However, it's not for everyone. Those who love ""action"" movies, shoot 'em up, bang bangs will be disappointed, if not just plain hate it. It moves slowly. It has a labyrinthine plot. No money (from the bank) is stolen in a ""bank robbery."" You have to think. And worst of all, no one is killed in a hostage-hold up. Many will think, ""Where's the fun in that?"" While having a lot of tension and seeming violence, there is really little real injury done to anyone. The most pain is delivered by the police shooting the innocent bystanders with rubber bullets. But look at what happens...what the results of this story are: The robbers, who turn out to be the good guys (or as good as you can be when you're robbing a bank). They are rewarded with a fortune. The paragon of virtue, the Bank owner, turns out to be the bad guy and is exposed for what he is... a monster. Our hero, the detective, is promoted, cleared of erroneous, felonious charges and ends up with a fabulous diamond with which he can propose marriage. In other words, this is a truly perceptive, ingenious parody of American ""gansta"" movies. It parodies all the senseless violence we are usually subjected to and predictable plots. It parodies all the normal ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys."" It even has a moral. Although there is little violence perpetrated by the robbers, the most violent imagery is on a child's video game in which one ""brother"" slaughters another by shooting him and blowing him up. The child finds this machinima amusing and believes that you must get the stash and ""Kill that nigga."" Later, when Washington's character asks the cop who reported the robbery in progress if he's ever had a gun stuck in his face before, he responds, ""Yes, by a 12 year old. He shot me in the chest."" The juxtaposition of the faux robbery in progress with its lack of genuine violence is played off of the inhumanity of the child's game and the fact that the only time the officer has been shot was by a child. Lee's robbers are genteel. But in the real world, we teach children not to feel. Truly a remarkable movie...the camera work, the taut tale, the irony, the acting... Bravo.",Inside Man
207,teh_mode,Lee goes mainstream and succeeds,7,30 March 2006,"Spike Lee's most mainstream movie to date starts off as a standard popcorn heist movie, then turns into a character study whilst throwing some nice twists for good measure. It works most of the time, managing to squeeze in a couple of post-9/11 political points, but by and large this is much lighter on the racial Leeisms of films gone by, instead offering us a superior genre movie stop gap so that Lee can now go off and do the serious stuff he yearns to.The cast is one of those ultra-reliable ""do this in their sleep"" line ups featuring the wonder that is Denzil Washington doing his thing as the hostage negotiator sent to try and solve this situation, Clive Owen, whose American accent is still taking it's final exams, is otherwise having the time of his life as the criminal mastermind hoping to score the bank out of all that it's worth and there is fantastic support from Jodie Foster, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer.Half way through inside man the film skips to post-heist scenes of various hostages being interviewed about what they do or don't know. This then sets in motion an intriguing tale of what actually takes place during the heist. It appears as though the robbery may be far more complex than first thought by Detective Keith Frazier. The bank's owner appears to have his own dark secrets that may be dug up by the robbers, and sends Ms Fix-It (Foster) to negotiate it further. We are also shown the nasty side to the supposed good guys; Lee adopts a post-9/11 attitude, dealing with racial stereotypes of Asian New Yorkers. One such unlucky fellow is thought to be an Arabic terrorist when he emerges from the bank as a freed hostage, only to tell everyone that he's actually a Sikh.The main problem with Inside Man is that as it goes on, the plot holes become more evident. By the final third it seems as though the story has been wrapped up, yet we are still here. At 129 minutes it outstays it's welcome, but for all its faults it is still a darn good, very tense thriller, with a knockout cast and New York maestro director.",Inside Man

209,samseescinema,the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet,9,22 March 2006,"Inside Man reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 4 out of 4Inside Man is an intelligent film about intelligent people. It maneuvers about its battlefront, moving its pieces back and forth and around and about. There are good guys and there are bad guys. But who we want to win is rarely transparent. Here, the battlefront is the Manhattan Trust Bank. The Cops are Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Denzel Washington, the latter two playing Detectives Frazer and Mitchell. The robber is Clive Owen playing Dalton Russell, who introduces the film staring straight into camera, laying out the who, the what, the where and the when. The How, he says, is where there's the rub. His plan is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. But as in all heist films, the real genius behind the crime is the screenwriter. Richard Gewirtz is Inside Man's literary composer. His approach to the material is one of simplicity. The credits don't roll with our fingers scratching bald spots on our brains. Gewirtz keeps it simple. We are never duped by Inside Man. Mr. Russell tells us in the beginning what his clues are, filling us in on the rest of it at the end. That's right, I heard that sigh of relief. You don't need a PhD. in Criminology to understand this film. There also aren't cheap tricks of style here. No characters are Crazy Johnny, or Scary Sammy, and Fat Jimmy. They are Detective Frazer, Madeleine White, and Dalton Russell. And don't expect the dumb renegade robber undermining the mastermind's authority either. Gewirtz sidestepped that part too. Gewirtz in fact dodged all the usual bullets surrounding heist pictures. His film is smart and crisp, much like the suits our characters wear. They're attacks rarely involve bullets, but are instead borne out of wits and brains. And for this Inside Man feels full. Spike Lee is unafraid of Inside Man's 130 minutes. It's a long running time for bank robber flick, I know; but this is an epic, plain and simple. And Inside Man is lean. Not a frame is wasted here. It's taken at a vicious clip, never slacking and refusing to allow those bubbles of boredom to trickle up. Lee knows the script is magnificent, and lets it do its thing. He instead focuses his efforts on the film's look. Each shot drips with self-importance, which is fine. Lee wants us to believe these characters to be Power Players. They're all working for results, making us wonder on which side of justice each character rests. His aggressive approach to the film mirrors this, launching us past the money in the bank, and onto the battleground's topographical map, watching as the Players propel themselves about on little floating clouds of motive. Rest assured, however, Spike lee doesn't throw to the breeze his penchant for poetic justice. Justice with Inside Man takes a purer approach than laws can offer. But don't take this as a rave for a film of sophisticates. This isn't a bank robbery film without entertainment. If nothing else, Inside Man is the best damn fun I've had at the movies yet this year. It keeps us hooked, with actors behind the characters who are steely-eyed with experience; the kind of cast most film school students have wet dreams over. Spike Lee's film is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. Its style lends itself sometimes to indulgence, sure. But its indulgence is the spice that comes with a Spike Lee Joint, and must be inhaled fully. He's brought the heist genre back to its roots. There are no mice in this game. Only cats maneuvering about, waiting for their chance to pounce. And while we're at it, let's change cats to panthers. Because there are no kittens prancing around Inside Man. What Spike Lee has done is the impossible, much like his Mr. Russell is attempting. Mr. Lee has spun, quite possibly, the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet.Director: Spike Lee Cast: Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie FosterScreenplay: Richard Gewirtz MPAA Classification: R (language and some violent images)",Inside Man

This is embarrassingly my first Denzel Washington film, and he steals the show with a charismatic and heartfelt performance. I watched this before the late great Christopher Plummer passed away, and he did a good job here aswell, as did a young Chiwetel Ejiofor. The story structure was really intriguing, and kept me guessing about the mystery and how they would get away with the crime. The whole film pretty much hinges on the ending, and I thought it really worked. Spike Lee's direction is good, and the film on the whole is just a simple yet effective and enjoyable heist film. My only issues are that it took me a bit of time to be fully invested, and some of the side characters, particularly some of the hostages, were pretty annoying. But except for that, this was a great time, and I'd definitely recommend it.",Inside Man

Very entertaining and really well made.",Inside Man
214,jcanettis,Very Original Hostage-Crisis Thriller,8,30 April 2006,"At first sight, ""Inside Man"" does not seem very original: The plot is about a gang of bank robbers led by Dalton Russel (Owen), who use hostages as leverage towards the police. And yet, as the movie progresses we realize that originality is one of the biggest pluses of the film: We soon begin to suspect that the robbers are after something different than the bank's cash, something that the bank's chairman (Plummer) is willing to do anything to protect it, and to this end he plants Madeleine White (Foster), an enigmatic figure, into the scene. This interference displeases Detective Frazier (Washington) who is in charge of solving the case, as he believes that her presence will make his task harder. Eventually, everybody becomes entangled in a complex web with unpredictable consequences...Spike Lee has undeniably succeeded in turning a seemingly typical crime film into something much more intriguing. I subscribe to the view expressed by many that this is by far his best and most mature work to date. He manages to keep the tensions high without resorting to extremities, and he also aptly introduces key plot twists that keep us continuously excited. I also enjoyed his portrayal of characters, in which he carefully avoids to grant ""hero"" status to anyone (not even to Det. Frezier who is arguably the ""good"" guy of the film), but instead exposes each one's flaws in an objective and realistic manner.As far acting is concerned, Clive Owen is the big winner here. His performance as the sly and ruthless gang leader is superb, and I definitely value him much higher after seeing this film. Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington are also very good in their respective roles, while Christofer Plummer and Willem Dafoe (who plays the role of a police captain) have small yet significant appearances in the film.In brief, ""Inside Man"" is a solid and very original work by Spike Lee which well-deserves 8/10.",Inside Man

It even felt a little long to me.And yet ... do you ever see a movie that seems to have a lot of faults and yet the composite is so much better than the sum of its parts that it works anyway? That's this movie.

216,Robert_Hearth,"""My Name Is Dalton Russell, Pay Strict Attention To What I Say Because I Choose My Words Carefully And Never Repeat Myself."" --- Dalton Russell (Clive Owen)",8,24 September 2006,"""Inside Man"" (2006) Directed By: Spike Lee Starring: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, & Christopher Plummer MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for language and some violent images) Spike Lee is an admirable filmmaker, whether you agree with the messages that run thick within his movies or not. Lee is a filmmaker who believes what he believes, whether you or anyone else accept this or not. Many people take offense to his movies, or at least the messages they portray. I must admit that Lee is a very controversial filmmaker and I often find myself feeling that he goes too far in getting his point across. ""Inside Man"", however, is not a typical Spike Lee movie. Does he still have a message? Most definitely, but Lee makes sure that it is far more subtle here, instead of cramming it into the faces of audiences everywhere. There are moments of implied racism, though we can never be sure if the characters are actually displaying prejudices or if they are simply doing what they feel is necessary for security. These scenes are shockingly effective and grabbed my attention far more than a bold, blatant scene would have, because they made me ponder about what I was seeing. Lee hits an amazing high note here, yet he falters in other placesmainly the logical aspect. We often find ourselves wondering if a character's motive is even remotely possible and if a man who was old enough to be make a fortune during World War II (meaning that he would have to be of a certain age at that time) would still be able to be in charge of a bank, much less look as wonderful as Christopher Plummer.Dalton Russell (Owen) has planned the so-called perfect bank robbery and he executes it at one of the branches of the bank owned by Arthur Case (Plummer). Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) is put on the case and immediately realizes that this is not a typical bank robbery. Russell has fifty hostages inside, all dressed in the same outfits as he and his cronies. Russell releases one hostage every now and again for various reasons and threatens to kill the others if the police attempt to interfere. Arthur Case, however, cannot afford to let the robbers remain in his bank. He has something in a safety deposit bank that cannot be made public or it will ruin him. So, he calls upon Madeline White (Foster), a power broker, to go in and clear up the entire situation. With the help of the Mayor (Peter Kybart), a man who owes here a few favors, White gets full access to the scene. But her presence and her agenda only intensify the situation and make everything far more complicated. As secrets are exposed and the entire heist begins to spiral out of control, everyone involved is hurled into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse that will grab you, draw you in, and hurl you into a world of lies and manipulation as only Spike Lee could do it. What begins as an average bank-heist thriller turns into a movie of deceit that will keep you guessing until the shocking conclusion.""Inside Man"" is a very character-driven film and, if nothing else, Spike Lee proves that he knows how to get an amazing cast to fill these roles. Academy Award winner Denzel Washington takes on the lead and does so with utter competence and confidence. Washington knows how to turn fifteen minutes of dialog into an exciting scene, which was necessary for this movie. Academy Award nominee Clive Owen gives a subdued performance, which works well here. His calm demeanor adds to the idea that his character knows exactly what he is doing. Academy Award winner Jodie Foster was just so ""on"" here, but isn't she always? She exudes arrogance and sexiness and it all fits so perfectly with her role. After all, she is playing a woman that feels as though she can manipulate any situation in her favor (and she actually can, no less). I couldn't imagine her character being played by anyone else. Christopher Plummer always delivers spectacular performances and, here, there is no difference. I found his character to be one filled with wealth, class, and powerand yet, at his very core, was a pit of sleaziness and greed. Plummer made sure that both parts of his character were portrayed as they should be, with the dignified portion of his demeanor being the most prominent with only traces of his greediness slipping through. He hit the nail on the head.""Inside Man"" is a film that truly understands what it so desperately wants to be and it reaches with all of its might to achieve that goal. Did it actually reach its desired location, though? Well, yesand yet, no. ""Inside Man"" wants to be a twisted, intelligent game of cat-and-mouse and was throughout the entire movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat and had me guessing until the ending. I was constantly trying to decipher Dalton Russell's twisted motives and I found it to be shockingly intriguing to watch Detective Keith Frazier trying to outwit him. But, the finale just left much to be desired. I didn't buy Russell's motives. Why go through all of the trouble simply to expose someone's dark secret and steal a few diamondswhen there were millions of dollars right in front of him? I felt that the script was going strong for the entire movie and then, in the last twenty minutes, the screenwriter just decided to put down his pen and walk away with only a disappointing conclusion. Still, the journey to achieve this finale is a great one and is certainly more entertaining than the typical bank heist thrillers.Final Thought: ""Inside Man"" is a wonderful thriller, until the disappointing conclusion.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)",Inside Man

Inside Man is one of the best heist thrillers ever made, it has style, perfect planning and intricate detailing into the mind of a brilliant criminal and bank robbing. it's an intense and well thought out film by Spike Lee(probably one of his best.) the film shows you what would happen if a man pulled off the perfect crime and got away with it, It also is trying to get across what it is like to be in a situation like this and what would the police would do if it escalated to the point that they would have to go in guns blazing. How would they get the hostages out safely? How would they stop the bank robbers from killing them all? And the most important one, can they stop him?

219,Mr_PCM,A twisty tense heist thriller that will leave you scratching your head,8,29 July 2008,"Inside Man is a clever film that fits the bill perfectly for a Saturday evening's entertainment – a complex thriller that, while never too complicated, leaves you on numerous occasions thinking you have a handle on what is happening, only for the film to surprise you again. A classy heist thriller with modern twists, and a stellar leading cast, it keeps you guessing right the way through, which makes it ideal evening viewing, and at almost exactly two hours is probably just the right length. There seems to be hidden depths to all the characters in a multi-layered plot, where as questions are answered, even more are asked. Much discussion will ensue as the credits roll.Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who has planned what he believes to be the perfect bank robbery, whilst Denzel Washington is the detective who must resolve the situation, and Jodie Foster is the big shot hard nosed negotiator working for the benefit of 'outside interests'. Supporting this A-list leading group includes Chiwetel Ejiofor (who seemed to be in nearly every film released that year), Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer.The film uses the interesting format of interspersing the main film with brief scenes of witness/suspect interviews in the aftermath, all the while keeping the identities of the robbers concealed (with the exception of Owen, who announces his intentions at the start) so the interviewees could be anyone. What makes the scene more interesting is the complete and very distinct lack of lawyers for the interviewees. This proves to be a rather effective and innovative technique, as are the interesting mix of sympathies. The detectives dealing with the hostage situation and the interviews in the aftermath are not necessarily as warm and heroic as you might expect, in fact almost intimidating, while Foster's power broker and Owen's lead bank-robber are multi-layered, making for much more interesting characters, especially as they are used comparatively sparingly, while Washington's detective fills a large portion of the screen time – fortunately as a top quality actor he is equal to the task, although he does come across as slightly callous and unsympathetic. Denzel's unusual and cold characterisation makes the viewing uncomfortable for the viewer, and certainly alters the viewers sympathies. Meanwhile, Foster is particularly excellent as the ice-cold bitch negotiating on behalf of a third party, while Owen has some strangely effective cold charisma as the lead bank robber. Plummer and Dafoe are given very little to do however, while Ejiofor seems little more than a sycophantic sidekick for Washington, and he contributes nothing – unusual given his strong performances in other films round the same time such as Serenity and Four Brothers.With the emphasis on slowly-rising tension and very little action as the mast plan of the criminals becomes clear, Inside Man is a gripping tale of how to rob a bank – almost playing as an instruction manual for would-be armed robbers. In addition, what sets the film apart is that far from there being an obvious outcome as is the case with similar films, there seems to be a real feeling that someway, somehow, the robbers might actually get away with it and win. YOu never know what is going to happen. This makes for an incredibly refreshing film. Movie buffs will also love being able to play spot the movie reference – Sudden Impact, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon are all clearly referenced, almost as if the film is an homage to the great crime and heist movies of the past. Inside Man is also one of few 15-rated films that make use of the c-word.Overall a gripping heist thriller that will still have you scratching your head as the end credits roll, wondering not only how it happened, but what actually happened as well. A film that definitely warrants repeat viewings - make space on your DVD shelf, as you will want to watch it again.",Inside Man

221,imxo,Good Police Thriller with Excellent Acting.,8,26 March 2006,"It's obvious that Spike Lee is fixated on the subject of race and culture, even in this, his most commercial venture. The film has a great multi-cultural sound track and the movie is populated with the racial and ethnic rainbow that makes up NYC: blacks, Jews, Sikhs, Hispanics, and lots and lots of white folk. Lee even works in an Albanian. Lee is more upfront on how these people all relate to each other in the American melting pot than most other directors. At one point, when interviewing a Sikh who complains of discrimination at airports, Denzel Washinton's character tells him: ""But I'll bet you have no trouble getting a cab."" This real-life stuff is priceless.The story line - the caper - is rather mysterious for a great part of the film, and in the end it's rather a disappointment, if not altogether preposterous. Nevertheless, it's still a film with a lot of atmosphere and with very good acting performances, especially by Denzel Washinton. Here he is is not the pretty-boy Denzel of past years, but a middle-aged, roly-poly NYC detective who's obviously cut a few corners in his life.

225,sc8031,Spike Lee Phone Home,5,17 September 2008,"This is ""a Spike Lee joint"" that feels like a Hollywood film he was contractually obliged to make. The setup is interesting and the first third is pretty exciting, but the movie slows down and starts to putter around, prematurely revealing its conclusions. It includes a couple of twists, investigates potential Stockholm Syndrome, political corruption and war crimes, but ultimately fails in its predictability (and the fact that my own imagined outcomes were more entertaining that what transpired on the screen).It's not really a bad movie. It's just not nearly as substantial as people say it is. Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster are on autopilot the whole time, Willem Defoe is hardly even used, there are blatant product placements for the PSP and the iPod, the ""twist"" to the robbery can be seen from a mile away, and Spike Lee's questionable morality jibe in the finale seems like a sensationalist afterthought. The morality tale came off as lazy and seemed indicative of weird subconscious prejudices Spike Lee has.In short, the set up is pretty decent and the rest of the movie is professional and slightly above-average. The plot is ultimately typical bank heist fare, though presented with the intent of being a crime mystery/thriller.

It was predictable from the beginning. The only thing I didn't figure out was the 'very' ending however by that time I didn't try because I didn't care.The directing of this film was horrible in my opinion. It was like some great actors and a big budget was given to someone doing they're first film school piece. Trying to throw in something cool from this film and that, that just didn't work. Like the 'Hitchcock' style or the 'move Denzel on the dolly toward the emergency' thing. It just didn't work at all. (you'll know when you see it) Love Jodie Foster however her performance was out of touch, too snitty, and I believe that was from direction. Same with Power House Denzel. This guy can blink and eye lid to convey message however Spike wasted this actors talents along with the others.There were a 'couple' of funny lines here and there yet other than that, I didn't believe the characters... I wasn't on the edge of my seat... I wasn't confused or thrilled by a thing. It was a blasé experience through out.And what's up with the racial stints? I've heard read and seen Spike personally be a racist through the years but why does he have to find it a need to speckle or drown his projects with it? It's like every N.Y. cop is a racist? Come on! I'm so sick of it and it takes away from films when it's a distraction and not a part of the story. In fact, Spike's direction with this film was just like a said, a film student in first year on his first project.And whats with the face masks? Clive Owens is tightly stretched accenting his meaty lips while everyone else's is not. There there are times you see his mask not as perfect as other times. It became so distracting from the film itself.And who is this writer anyway? Not a single credit... not a single thing on biography? Makes me wonder who, if anyone this was that wrote this thing. And smart? Maybe the idea was but from there to paper, weak. Then given to the hands of Spike... even weaker.To me, this was a waste of talented actors and an idea that could have been good yet went south. If there was someone there that could actually have a limber ability toward directing, this could have been a far better film.

The cast is good - a very svelte Jody Foster as Madeline White, enigmatic, and a good Christopher Plummer, as the bank's owner.This film is intelligent and thought-provoking and the acting is very realistic. It's a good film, which will keep you thinking for ages.",Inside Man
229,johnny-burgundy,Crime Thriller with a touch of drama and action,7,25 October 2017,"Inside Man (2006) This is a crime thriller directed by Spike Lee, and starring Denzel Washington. It's about an elaborate bank heist on Wall Street. It also stars Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer. The film received a mostly positive critical response and was a commercial success. This a reasonably decent movie, with the right amount of action and suspense. Definitely worth your time if you like crime movies with a touch of drama and action.",Inside Man
230,winopaul,"OK script, so so direction",5,31 October 2010,"The script was very clever, almost too clever by half. We all liked the 6th Sense, were there was a twist at the end. But we all hated every other movie M. Night Shyamalan has made, since there was not a twist meant to be enjoyed, they were tricks meant to make the director feel smarter than us. Spike Lee does not get quite so bad as M Nighty Night, but he travels perilously close to the edge of showing contempt for his audience. The saving grace here is that he did not write the script. The script was one of those deals where a creative guy sits around and tries to figure out how to do the perfect crime. we know it is a perfect crime since the robber speaks directly to us, twice, and tell us so. I do wonder how the robbery completely failing made it a success, but I am too literal to recognize this great art anyway. Anyway, so far so good.Then the scriptwriter adds the Jodie Foster subplot. Then Spike has to start jumping the time line around, like some hack director that wants to be like Memento. I suppose that the creative team felt so clever and daring, to keep the entire audience asking what was going on, since that was part of the plot, that the robbers made a confusing situation to rob the bank. But see, when you are on the inside with a intimate knowledge of the script, it may seem artistic and clever, but we peasant peon subhumans that actually have to pay 9 bucks to see this have to do it in real-time. We don't get to study and script and have creative meetings with butt boys lighting our cigarettes and laughing at our jokes for a 9 months. Same thing when they show the bank assault. We are somehow supposed to know that is not a real event, just what would happen if the characters did it. Jeez, sorry Spike, I didn't make the meeting, I didn't get the memo. So when Spike smash cuts to a hostage interrogation a day after the robbery, he knows he has jumped a day, but everyone in the audience, and I mean every single human being, is scrunching up their forehead and asking ""what the fu<& is going on?"" And that little bit of profanity brings me to the other problem with the movie, that urban sensibility, where everyone uses the coarsest language imaginable, and all the wives act like porn stars. That on top of that is the normal cute little bantering and wisecracks in life-and-death situations. Boy you can tell when an upper middle class kid is trying to act like he knows the hood. At least Eminem is white trash trying to act like black trash. Spike has a lot harder time pulling it off. I have to tell you though, that when the wise-a$$ New York know-it-all takes of his mask and starts talking smack like all the other New York wise-a$$ know-it-alls, it was so great to see him being dragged by his ankles through the building screaming and begging for his life. We should do this to the whole city, one person at a time.I see why Hitchcock was so brilliant. He did not hold his audience in contempt and he did not keep things from us so he could feel superior and in control. So if you can put up with all the ghetto talk and the trickery and getting jacked around by someone teasing you, well, this is a pretty cool movie. Watching it the second time is much better. You know when Spike is jumping around in time and you know that the scriptwriter is going to trick you a couple times. Its hour and 51 minutes into the film before you see the robbers little construction project and you start to realize that the robbery is still in progress, although you are never really sure of anything since Spike has jumped the time line so much.I think the movie was saved by the actors, Denzel, and Jodie, and that fruitcake cop that slapped the Chinese kid in Boondock Saints, perhaps the most embarrassing performance by an actor in the history of this galactic quadrant. At least in this flick Spike kept him away from the Pacino pills that make you foam at the mouth and chew bites out of the scenery.I also love how Spike tries to make a statement about excessive violence in the kid's video games, in the same movie where he puts a gun to the bagged head of a hostage and blows her brains out. Oh, I see, when computer programmers do it, it is exploitation and objectification of your culture. When you do it, well, that is art. Yeah, hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.Oh, credits role and they show a clapboard and outtakes over the credits. Great, see Being There for how a director can rob his actors of an Oscar by showing outtakes at the end of the movie.After the second viewing, I am sitting here still wondering what the heck the bank robber was doing. Did the Wiesenthal Center pay him to go steal the jewel and expose the bank president? Why did he not take the diamond? Did he get other diamonds, like the one he gave Denzel as he walked by? Who the heck paid for this robbery fiasco? Oh yeah, does anyone know why they dug up the sewer line? Did they send jewels down it or what? --",Inside Man

Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found ""CHAOS"" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and ""Chaos"" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch.

The cast was top shelf and I truly enjoy Spike when he's not trying to force a cultural message down my throat.Movies tend to be predictable. In many cases you know what's going to happen, the story unfolds as you figure out how. In this case all you know is people are in a bank and a robbery appears to be in progress.As the story unfolds, you wonder why are they there, how will they escape and what are they after. It's this fans opinion that those questions are never truly addressed. To me that made this film and ""Inside Joke"". Somebody out there must have got it, but for my date and I, we left unsatisfied.Denzel was funny, but could have been funnier with a better scripted character. Jodi Foster looked a career best as a character that made little to no sense and Christopher Plumber had what is most likely the most believable character in the movie.Clive Owen is a season actor who is gaining fame domestically, but I can't say that I was overly impressed with his character.I wouldn't recommend this film.

Like ""clockers"" or ""the 25th hour"", Lee is able to work with some great actors on someone else's screenplay, leaving him to direct a film that rings true in all the details and textures of New York, and New Yorkers.

238,janos451,Spike Goes Hollywood. Again. Rejoice!,5,21 March 2006,"""Inside Man"" is great fun. As you must know from the extensive advertising campaign and marketing blitz, it's the story of a bank robbery, which is not really a bank robbery. What? Who? Why? See the film, and find out the somewhat disappointing answer. But getting there, for two hours, is entertaining and fun.But no more than that. Yes, you've got Spike Lee's caustic humor and a few fascinating characters, but it's not a thinking person's thriller - just a thriller, albeit one that makes bathroom breaks difficult to find.Denzel Washington, playing the chief police negotiator, is at his best, as the very human, street-smart, and persistent detective. Something is wrong with Jodie Foster's high-powered ""arranger,"" something not quite right in her portrayal of the mysteriously powerful woman, who fixes things, at a price.First-time script writer Russell Gewirtz does well, Matthew Libatique's cinematography is superb; he is responsible for Lee's ""She Hate Me"" as well as for ""Gothika"" and the ""Phone Booth,"" and he does a simple-and-effective job here that's admirable.PS: Two first-class movies now have come and gone, disappearing almost instantly. Catch up with them on DVD: Tommy Lee Jones' ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" and Sidney Lumet's ""Find Me Guilty."" Yes, the latter just opened, but it's going away already. Such a shame.

239,HiddenVoice,One of the most entertaining films I've seen in a while.....one that doesn't fool around and cheat us.,8,3 August 2006,"Upon its release I was skeptical about it.The film had the same old story about a smart guy robbing a bank with dumb people.But it was something really fresh and new after watching it on DVD and I regret not watching it in the cinema.And tell you the truth ,it was really the most fun I've had watching a film which doesn't play around,dragging you all the way and finally gives you an ending that makes a fool out of you and cheats you.This one has it all.Smart,clever plot.Well written dialogues,superb direction,juicy acting, and a rather thoughtful view on the society that doesn't appreciate diversity.A Bank robber,who is very specific in his actions,plans the perfect bank robbery.He isn't in it for money or anything,he's in it for something else.So,he executes his plan flawlessly ,deceiving everyone.An African-American detective is put on the case and both of them begin this very ingenious cat-and-mouse game.Along the way,there are many people who want the Detective off the case and approach the robbers in a rather conventional way.But as it gets longer and longer,it becomes difficult to tell what exactly is it that the Robbers want.And then you finally get to know with an excellent climax.There are surprises here,and they are not the ones you can easily point out.Although,I did guessed some of the surprises right.But still these twists are not the ones that defies logic and make you look stupid.These surprises keeps you involved and you really have fun solving the puzzles,rather than just sitting there and waiting for the writers prove that they're smarter than the audience,which they are not.The film deals with some really important issues.Race,politics,and moral status etc.And it deals with them well,without being offensive.It's also quite funny.In between the robbery,we flash forward to see the detective interrogating the hostages,to extract some information about the robbers.Since everyone were forced to dress the same,and the precautions taken by the robbers.It becomes quite difficult for the Detectives to solve this big mess.And it's really fun to see them come up ways to solve the case.The writing is impressive.It's smartly designed and brilliantly plotted.It has a lot of fun moments and exciting plot turns.Lee is back.He hasn't been this good since,I don't know when.His direction is one that defines a man who knows what he's doing.He handles everything with awe.He makes this more entertaining than smart,and apt.He is thinking out of the conventional box.Performanes?Well,with a cast like this ,I don't even have to tell you how superficial they were.Washington and Owen are just amazing to watch.And Foster gives enough juiciness to keep you off the heist,for a while, and focus on the characters.A very good film,a fine film in its own standards.But for me,it was really the most fun film I've seen in quite a while.But I can't call it the best heist film,it sure is up there with the best.",Inside Man
240,donkrishna-dk,Beautiful Tw(he)ist,8,9 August 2019,"Great casts: Washington, Owen, Foster, with great result. The director really knows how to exploit their talents.

241,LadyLiberty,Inside Man proves a good mainstream heist film,7,26 March 2006,"The trailers for this movie opened with actor Clive Owen chatting directly with the camera and claiming he'd planned the perfect bank robbery. There are only two ways a movie can go after a statement like that. Either it will prove entertainingly clever, or it will fall flat either by telescoping plot twists or being utterly predictable. It was a true movie thrill to find that Inside Man is a terrific example of the former.Remember the last time you visited your bank? It was likely just another in the list of errands you had that day. Other people, each conducting their own business and running their own errands were almost certainly there with you, though you probably didn't know each other and you exchanged nods and smiles at best. Then imagine that ordinary scene ripped apart by gun-wielding mask-wearing bank robbers, and how you might feel shivering on the floor next to those strangers with whom you suddenly have a crisis in common.Dalton Russell (Clive Owens) and his partners have planned just such a scene, and they execute it perfectly. In a matter of minutes, the four robbers have herded bank employees and customers alike into manageable bunches and are well on their way through an apparent checklist of ""things to do to rob a bank."" But it also doesn't take long for a cop to notice something funny is going on at the Manhattan bank and to call for help.With so many innocent civilians inside the building, one of those called in is hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Frazier isn't anybody's first choice  he's under investigation for the theft of some money seized as evidence  but his commanding officer has no one else who can go. So along with his partner, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Frazier heads to the scene.When Frazier arrives, the police have the situation well in hand with blockades to keep civilians away and a mobile command center on site run by Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe). Frazier takes command on his arrival, but his efforts aren't helped by the begrudging cooperation of Darius nor by the exorbitant demands received from the robbers. His world is about to be complicated still further when the mysterious Madeline White (Jodie Foster) arrives on scene.White, who shows up in the company of no less a personage than New York's mayor himself, has been hired by the bank's owner, the wealthy Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) to minimize the PR damage that could occur as a result of the robbery. But Frazier begins to suspect that there are agendas far beyond the mere success of a robbery or the public concern of the bank's owner. As a result, he's utterly bound up in the chaos of Dalton's perfect crime as it whipsaws its course defined in part by the machinations of others.Denzel Washington is always good, and he's no exception here. What's nice is that he's allowed to be a little less serious than he sometimes is, and he carries off Detective Frazier's sass and biting humor with real aplomb. Clive Owen fleshes out his character with shades of grey that mitigate the black and white of good and bad behavior in ways that add a good deal to the plot. Jodie Foster, who is so often the heroine of a film, is a morally ambiguous character here. Though the Oscar® winner's skills can't be doubted, it was still a bit of a surprise to see just how biting and arrogant a woman she can play. The large supporting cast is also just fine.I'm not personally a big Spike Lee fan. I don't care for urban films, and I'm not impressed by Lee's politics, either. But he was surprisingly effective in his direction of this movie's more mainstream appeal, and I walked out of the theatre with a newfound respect for his abilities. The editing was superlative, particularly in its creative use of flash-forwards (as opposed to the more commonly seen flashbacks); there were a few truly creative camera angles and one inspired stop motion scene as well.While Lee ably directed the picture, a good deal of credit must go to writer Russell Gewirtz who makes his major motion picture debut with his script for Inside Man. It's entertaining; it's smart; and while it's not truly believable, it's plausible enough that audiences can be gripped by the plot and dragged along its often surprising twists and turns.As an aside, I don't typically notice the music in movies. If it's really good, you shouldn't. It should enhance scenes, not steal them. The music for the opening and closing credits of Inside Man, however, is particularly striking. It's an unusual choice to be sure, but it's somehow perfect for the job. I didn't notice a note between the beginning and the end of the movie though I don't doubt it was there; but I'm still humming the tune chosen to underlie the credits.If you're headed out to the theatre to be educated or inspired, perhaps you'll consider seeing something else. But if you're looking for pure action entertainment, Inside Man is the perfect ""now showing"" venue.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Inside Man is rated R for ""language and some violent images."" I don't agree with that rating. There's no language in the film that the average 14 year-old doesn't hear in school or on his iPod on a regular basis, and the violence is far from graphic. (The single most graphic scene involves a video game  which, when you think about it, makes quite a point in the midst of an action movie.) I think most teens will like Inside Man, and as a bonus, so will most adults. I enjoyed it immensely myself.",Inside Man
242,conannz,Too abstract to bother anyone,5,19 May 2018,There is a clever story in this film but it takes so long to be revealed it becomes an anticlimax. A bank president has done bad things and keeps the evidence in a safety deposit box. There is an awful lot of planning going on to make it look like the equivalent of a postmodernist bank robbery. The problem is no one can connect with the hostages or the robbers because they are wearing masks over their faces most of the time. The police lead investigator thinks he is in a stand up competition looking for more comedy bits for next set.In a word the whole event is kind of anonymous with very little to connect to so when the story progresses we just don't care.,Inside Man

One of the better Heist films one can watch, with an all-star cast of highly-accomplished actors delivering the goods. Recommended viewing!No ordinary film maker, Lee taps his expertise in film making, applying superior cinematography, editing, and direction skills.Headlining the film is Denzel Washington as the good guy cop, and Clive Owen as the highly intelligent robber (with the screen-play thankfully avoiding the crazy/insane cliche' Bond movie villain characterization).""Filling-in"" as good as one will find in bank robber caper films are the superior supporting cast performances of Christopher Plummer (who has never delivered anything sub-par in his career), Jodie Foster (effectively playing against her ""type""), William Dafoe (over-due for an Oscar), Chiwetel Ejiofor (perfect subtle side-arm detective partner to Denzel), and across the board good performances by the entire supporting ensemble cast.Lee doesn't try to play out the big surprise ending cliche', but instead allows one to piece things together as the film unfolds, letting us ""in"" to the narrative piece by piece. This is refreshing and elevates the film overall.Really hard to find any critical piece missing in the film. Editing and pacing excellent, and even the potentially preposterous story idea works. Yes there are a few ""identifying the magician's tricks"" moments inside what could have been a perceived as an over the top narrative, but one overlooks those because this is quite the entertaining film and it is put together so well - Witty dialogue delivered by some of the all-time great actors who were perfectly cast on their parts.Bravo to all concerned👏, and two thumbs up!👍👍",Inside Man

The story is a great one, Washington as the Detective, and Clive Owen as the Thief. Both really great actors who are against each other's throats, and the game of cat and mouse created by Owen is phenomenal. Owen steals the genre, and the bank heist is one of the most fantastic types of scenery ever shown since the great film Heat (1995).Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Plummer are also great in this film. But the film concentrates on the solid performance of Washington and Owen. If there is a film that involves Washington, then you know it's got a good story, and a really deep-diving character driven picture. It's a film that really sinks the audiences' teeth in, and every moment is really jaw-dropping and intense. And, who knows whose winning in this game of cat and mouse?Another brilliantly told thriller featuring one of the film's biggest leads to date, Inside Man (2006) is a treat for all Washington fans.

Lately some of Spike's stuff has been hit and miss, but this was excellent one many levels. Keep'em coming Spike.The film details everything from the perfectly planned Bank Robbery going wrong, to the ongoing racial tensions still alive and kicking in America. I think Clive Owen did an excellent job portraying the mastermind, and Christopher Plummer was an asset as the owner of the bank... of course we all know why we watched this movie, DENZEL.

Now he's just beginning to look like a bitter has-been with a wide variety of prejudices which he likes to spread to a wider audience.As a film, there are many enjoyable moments from a stellar cast including the ever-watchable Clive Owen and Denzel Washington. (In my opinion no film with Denzel is ever an entire waste of your hard-earned as the man has such presence and charisma).However, beyond that the plot start out implausible and descends into the totally unbelievable. It's like a cardboard box left out in the rain - it starts out looking like it's got a structure but after a while it's just a sodden mess.

Anyone watching the trailer for this movie will undoubtedly be presented with what appears to be violent action sequences. Well guess what, guys? These action sequences only take place inside Denzel's head and don't actually exist. The first hour and a half of this talk-fest centers around Denzel Washington as a hostage negotiator trying to figure out what the hell is going on inside a bank where would-be robbers have taken several people hostage. Anyone watching this movie would be left asking the same question, aside from wondering why they ever sat down to watch it in the first place. This interminable sequence goes on and on and on and plays out like an extended first act from any of a score of superior ""true"" action thrillers that have both a second and a third act. One sits there waiting for something to happen and all anybody does is talk. And talk and talk and talk. Yes, there is a twist somewhere around the hour and forty minute mark but by then the viewer only regrets wasting the time that went before. Jodie Foster is obviously in this movie only for marquee value as her role is so minuscule as to be a complete waste of her talents. Is the twist in the plot worth waiting for? Not particularly. Would I like my money back? Not half as much as the time I wasted watching this boring talk marathon.",Inside Man
249,Sweet_Ophelia,Breath of Fresh Air,10,2 April 2006,"Some may have thought that the bank heist bit had been done to death in movies, and that originality in this plot line was near impossible to attain. Along comes Spike Lee, blasting that thought out the window and dominating the box office with the tricky, slick and highly original ""Inside Man"". Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) introduces himself to the audience, instructing us to ""pay strict attention"", as he proceeds to reveal himself as a bank robber. Cut to the scene of the crime; a New York City bank being robbed by men decked out in paint-gear. With 50 hostages who have been forced to strip down to their underwear and don the exact same outfits, masks and all, as the criminals; hostage negotiators Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are called in. The bank's owner, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) is also very concerned about the heist, but for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Case has something very valuable and very personal in safety deposit box 329 that he does not want anyone seeing. In comes the ambiguous character, Madeline White (Jodie Foster) whose job, it seems, is to do favors for very rich clients. Using the connections she has built up in her unsavory business, White calls in a favor from the Mayor who gives her clearance at the crime scene to be privy to everything that Frazier is privy to  that way she can make sure that the contents of her clients deposit box remains a mystery. Now it is a race as Frazier tries to figure out what Dalton wants; surely a mastermind who has planned the seemingly perfect crime down to the finest details isn't stupid enough to think that he can demand a jet and make a clean getaway  he has other motives, but what? Punctuated throughout the film are interviews Frazier and Mitchell conduct after the robbery interviews of the hostages (and unbeknownst to them, the crooks as well) as they try to figure out who the good and bad guys are; a difficult task since nobody ever saw their faces and everyone, even the hostages were dressed just like the crooks.""Inside Man"" is a fantastic film that doesn't treat its audience like dopey fifth graders. It is slow to unravel in the beginning, as the players are introduced and the robbery conducted; but throughout the film clues are scattered for the audience to discover and later examine as the plot slowly but surely unravels. Serious props have to go towards first time movie writer Russell Gewirtz for coming up with this ingenious script, with fresh twists and jazzy characters. I look forward to tracking this guy's sure to be budding career. The script really is amazing and beautifully executed by a fairly haphazard but all the same, stellar cast. Denzel Washington plays the part of old Hollywood style smart cop, cracking some great one-liners throughout. Jodie Foster, while playing a fairly restricted and vague character, still manages to deliver a captivating and dominating performance; but really, that shouldn't come as a surprise. Clive Owen who has played the bad guy before in films like 'Closer' proves himself yet again as a phenomenal leading man; believable both as a brains and bad-ass. Willem Dafoe also has a small part as the S.W.A.T captain. One complaint is that the film is very long, with a 129 minute run-time. It becomes a little exhausting towards the end, after the slow-burning build-up to the bank robbery, all the clues are revealed in the last 45 minutes and you need to reel in your concentration. From what I have read on these boards, and walking out of the cinema; some people were a little iffy about the end and thought there were quite a few plot-holes. I personally wasn't left with any questions or complaints; I thought the film tied up very nicely. I put that down to the fact that ALL of the burning questions were answered in the last 45 minutes and it can be a little tough to be inundated with information; piecing together the puzzle while also trying to remember exactly what the puzzle was. ""Inside Man"" is a very satisfying criminal drama/mystery  and a breath of fresh air in a year that has seen 'Big Mommas House 2' and 'The Pink Panther' in the number one spot at the box office.",Inside Man
250,Vishal_s_kumar,"A thriller not to be missed, Spike Lee and Denzel Washington's strongest collaboration together.",9,12 March 2010,"Spike Lee is widely considered the most talented and relevant African American director, but many of his films lack focus. More than ten years lapsed between two of his most cohesive movies, Clockers and Inside Man. Clockers was dropped in Lee's lap by Martin Scorsese, who was too busy with Casino at the time, and Inside Man was passed up by Ron Howard, who instead opted to direct Cindrella Man. Perhaps all of Lee's films should come to him already in development by other filmmakers. In contrast to titles Lee develops from the beginning, both Clockers and Inside Man are relatively free of his overt statements on race relations, allowing him to focus on the crime/drama elements of each movie and to capture the people and places of New York as only Spike Lee can. Inside Man starts off with intriguing narration by Russell: ""My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. I've told you my name: that's the who. The where could most readily be described as a prison cell. But there's a vast difference between being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison. The what is easy: recently I planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery. That's also the when. As for the why: beyond the obvious financial motivation, it's exceedingly simple... because I can. Which leaves us only with the how; and therein, as the bard would tell us, lies the rub."" This soliloquy is followed by a well-executed and impeccably filmed bank heist in downtown Manhattan. Adding a great deal to the production is the cinematography by Matthew Libatique, who also directed photography in IronMan), and music by Terence Blanchard, who composed scores for many previous Spike Lee movies. An astute beat officer notices something wrong at the bank and the NYPD is quickly called in. The officers' personalities and dialog--showcasing Washington's best performance of the past decade--make for a lot of fun as the scenes strobe back and forth between the grave hostage situation evolving in the bank and the police presence outside. Frazier, his boss--Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe)--and colleague Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) all share moments of light banter as well as heavier exchanges. The bank robbers show an international, politically motivated agenda, forcing the cops to jump through hoops, but will the cards played by the robbers give away their hand or is it just a stunt to confound the NYPD? Spike Lee always had a knack for dialog and language. As some of the hostages are freed and interviewed by the officers, Lee's gift for colorful exchanges pays off big time. Not only is the entertainment value of the film ratcheted up and made more multidimensional by these interactions and the dialog, but the characters of all racial and ethnic backgrounds who were held in the bank show a slice of the Big Apple that tastes really sweet. Frazier is an ambitious detective, gunning for a promotion, and he knows that his advancement is riding on the investigation. As meticulous as he is in following leads and interviewing the freed hostages, he cannot make any sense of the case. The bank heist seems to involve no victims, no robbers and no stolen money or goods--at least not that Frazier has been able to find. But then he stumbles on the key to the entire case. The bank's safe deposit box, #392, has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. No sooner does Frazier obtain a search warrant to open it then he is confronted by Madeleine White (Jodie Foster), a lawyer for a wealthy, high-society client, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), who just so happens to be the founding owner of the bank. White tries to get Frazier to drop the investigation by guaranteeing his promotion, but when tested, Frazier displays more ethics than ambition. The film shifts into an exploration of good and evil. Russell's bank heist may not have been the crime it first appeared, while Case's lavish lifestyle and penthouse apartment may be at the expense of innocent victims. But will Russell escape his crime? And after a lifetime of luxury is to too late for Case to pay for his? With sparing use of nonlinear plot devices, Inside Man is a twisting, turning, entertaining thriller that lets up a bit after the heist, but stays interesting right up until the end.",Inside Man
251,abum190,"A good movie, but it should have been better",7,10 September 2006,"Because this is directed by Spike Lee, this should have been a better movie. As it stands, it is a good movie with an above-average plot that doesn't quite deliver. It could have delivered, but the screenplay reveals things in places it shouldn't reveal them and takes too long to reach its ending.However, with that said, I must say I liked the movie. The performances are great- Denzel Washington is snappy and intense in a role that requires little real acting but must have been great fun to play. He's a jerk with a big heart and brain, and you can tell Washington loves being this kind of guy. Clive Owen is appropriately firm and angry in his role as the bank's main robber, and Jodie Foster is terse and sarcastic. You never know quite who she is, which I suppose is the point.It's a very thrilling movie with some intense action sequences and some scenes that are just plain brilliant. A scene where Clive Owen's character and a kid discuss the kid's video game is so true, as is the scene where the Sikh is mistaken for an Arab. The flash-forwards to interrogations of everyone at the crime scene are helpful and allow some character to show through.All in all, the movie was entertaining but not as complete as it could have been. I like it though, and I definitely recommend it.",Inside Man
252,Kryzak,"Clever, Original, and fun!",9,4 April 2006,"I went into this moving not really knowing what to expect. From the previews, it seemed like a typical bank robbery movie, so I was expecting more of the same. Boy was I wrong! ""Inside Man"" is definitely one of the more original psychological thriller movies I've seen in a while! The beginning of the movie starts off like any other heist movie, but it quickly veers away from the standard movies in that genre after the opening scenes. I won't spoil too much of the story here, so I'll just talk about the various merits of the movie below.The acting was SUPERB! But then again, that's what one expects with acting powerhouses like Jodi Foster, Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Chris Plummer. I wish Jodi Foster's character was expanded more, as she plays the ""mysterious but powerful woman"" role extremely well in this movie. The mind games that Denzel and Clive play were very well developed throughout the movie, as each is trying to outsmart the other (well, more like one trying to figure out the other). At the end, I just wish we knew a bit more about each of the characters and see them more developed. That is the reason why I give this movie a 9 instead of 10, because it's more about the characters playing a story out than letting us learn more about each of them and who they are.I think most of the credit must be given to Spike Lee and Russell Gewirtz, the director/writer team, for coming up with such a new spin on bank robbery movies. Throughout the movie, I was just guessing what would happen next, and thinking like Denzel's detective character in the movie. The style of flashing back and forward in time was also very well done, adding complexity to the movie without giving the story away (even though it may seem like it at first).The only gripe I have about the movie is the lack of explanation of the motives of the bank robbery. Maybe it was left out intentionally to be consistent with the mysteriousness of the entire movie, but I believe it would have made the movie stronger than it is now.All in all, a great movie, so go check it out!",Inside Man
253,spooly_montana,tour de force,10,31 October 2006,"Not one to shy away from controversy, director Spike Lee takes a shot at making a heist film, doing an exceptional job with INSIDE MAN. This is the fourth film that Denzel Washington and Spike Lee have made together, alongside 'He Got Game' (1998), 'Malcolm X' (1992), and 'Mo' Better Blues' (1990). Under Lee's direction, Washington embodied the controversial and influential Black Nationalist leader, Malcolm X, earning him an Oscar nomination that year for Best Actor. So after 8 years Lee and Washington rejoin to make a very irregular heist film, alongside Hollywood heavy hitters Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, and veteran actor Christopher Plummer. The film revolves around the attempted heist of a branch of the Manhattan Trust Bank, and the ensuing hostage crisis that follows. Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) is put on the case, and wants to rectify his stained reputation after being accused of stealing $140,000 that mysteriously disappeared in a prior, unrelated case. The bank's CEO, Arthur Case (Plummer), sends a mysterious woman, Madeline White (Foster), to look after his ""interests"" that lie in a safety deposit box, deep inside the bank. Madeline's Ivy League condescension rubs Detective Frazier the wrong way, putting them at odds, as they each try to work their own agenda in resolving the bank situation. The masked leader of the group of robbers, Dalton Russell (Owen), is exceedingly calm in matching wits with Detective Frazier as they both try to stay one step ahead of each other. Leading right up to the climax, you are left wandering how this ambiguous thriller will end, and exactly where the twists and turns will lead you. In nearly three decades of directing, Spike Lee has made many memorable films, a fair amount of them controversial. But leave your prejudgments at the door when you go see this film, because it is a different type of ""Spike Lee Joint."" He had the clout of the studio backing him on this one, and it definitely shows in the scope of the film. I have anticipated watching this film ever since I was aware of it's existence some time ago, and so the question is, after seeing it, did it live up to it's promise? In one word  yes! I am thoroughly impressed with this tour de force from Spike Lee. In a genre filled with copycats and atypical holdup flicks, this one pays homage to some of the classic heist films, such as 'Dog Day Afternoon,' resulting in a cool, captivating, and engaging thrill ride. If you would like to catch some other great movies featuring the stars of 'Inside Man,' I recommend the following: Denzel Washington in 'The Manchurian Candidate' (2004), Clive Owen in 'I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' (2003), Jodie Foster (only speaking French!) in 'A Very Long Engagement' (2004), Christopher Plummer in 'The Insider' (1999), and Willem Dafoe in 'Auto Focus' (2002).",Inside Man
254,Ryan_9,Great heist thriller,8,24 October 2020,"I found ""Inside Man"" to be a great and compelling movie. It starred Denzel Washington as NYPD hostage negotiator Keith Frazier who gets himself into negotiations with master bank robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), who's orchestrated the perfect heist and has many hostages. Frazier meets his match as Russell is a very smart individual and doesn't back down. Meanwhile, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), founder of the bank recruits broker, Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to help him protect controversial information in his safe deposit box.I enjoyed the plot as it was exciting and had some good twists. It kept me invested throughout. Denzel Washington was terrific. I thought Frazier was a charismatic character. Clive Owen did a stellar job and was very good as the heist leader. He and Washington played off each other well. Jodie Foster was alright although, I wish we got a better understanding of her character's background and profession. I thought each character had excellent dialogue. Willem Dafoe (Captain John Darius) was also enjoyable despite not being as important as the main three.I liked the interrogation scenes and how they would flash forward to them. They were a good way to make us wonder who was in on the heist until we eventually found out. The green-tinted lighting helped make it more interesting. The ending was great as it was cool that Frazier matched up the voices and realized Russell walked right by him and out the door like he said he was going to do.Overall, I'll give ""Inside Man"" an 8/10. Great heist thriller!",Inside Man
255,OllieZ,Thank God,8,30 April 2006,"I have been going to the cinema lately, hoping to find a film that satisfies me, even if it is not completely original. Horror films have nearly done the job - Hostel and The Hills have Eyes were good and acceptable.Yet it is Spike Lee's new heist film that has finally satisfied me. Inside Man is a good, old fashioned crime thriller, about deceptively simple heist on a bank. I don't want to ramble on too much, but all I can say is that it gripped me from start to finish. The acting was good on all counts (Washington, Owen and Plummer being very solid).The film did drag a TAD at the end, but I couldn't care less; the film was superbly crafted and well acted. This film is not a 'twist' film. It does not rely on a twist to make you enjoy the film. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the streets, the banter and the tension of the heist.It can never be as good as Dog Day Afternoon, but Inside Man is an enjoyable crime film, albeit nothing special.",Inside Man
256,snow0r,"smart, interesting, and entertaining",9,16 August 2006,"""Inside Man"" tells the story of a bank robbery hostage situation that we've all seen done and done well many times before. However, the creators of ""Inside Man"" (the Inside Man, surely?) know this, and as a result Spike Lee's take on the heist movie has a few tricks up its sleeve.The minute Dalton (Clive Owen) introduces the movie you know something's different, and his distant yet smug tone draws you in to his perfect crime. It's a role Clive plays well: he is smart but dark, violent and aggressive yet ironically emerges as the film's moral centre, evident by not only in his motive for the robbery, but in the prejudiced attitudes of everybody else. The attitudes, actions, and assumptions made by civilians and NYPD alike (especially when Vikram, the Sikh teller, is released from the bank to cries of ""Is it a bomb?"") demonstrate the many small injustices that occur everyday, and these incidents shock the audience more than the larger scale injustice taking place in the form of a bank robbery just metres away. While the bank job is Clive's machine, most of the acting falls into Denzel Washington's lap, and he performs well as the cop trying to juggle the immense responsibility of hostage negotiation with his personal concerns. Jodie Foster also performs well as the prissy...whatever it is that she does.The plot thickens and unfolds until it would seem that no crime has taken place. Denzel is eventually told to ""bury it"", and unfortunately the final half hour of the film suffers a similar fate as the plot disappears under an avalanche of over-morality in the meeting between Foster and the bank owner (Christopher Plummer). Earlier in the film Denzel asks a cop to cut down on the ""colour commentary"" during a story, and you can't help but wonder why Spike didn't take this advice as the audience are provided with the tale of an old rich white man and his blood money while Denzel pursues his case till its closure and the film to its end. This is however all forgiven thanks to the very last minute of the film as Denzel cheekily grins at the screen, having worked it all out and come out on top.Moralizing aside, this is a smart, well-acted and entertaining film that is thoroughly enjoyable and well worth a look.",Inside Man

258,brodie_kashmir,"Gritty return of Spike, excellent performances by Owen and Wasington",9,10 July 2006,"Spike Lee returns to the streets of New York for his most recent film, ""Inside Man,"" which pits mastermind bank robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) against troubled but ruthless hostage negotiator Det. Frazier (Denzel Washington). Russell believes he has pulled off the perfect bank heist, while Frazier thinks he has Russell in the palm of his hand. Madeline White (Jodie Foster) intervenes to protect the interests of a powerful third party.With so many twists and turns thrown at you, you'd think the plot would be harder to follow than a hyperactive 7 year old after a Fun-Dip bender. But rookie writer Russell Gewirtz, writes one of the more intense and mindful thrillers of late, and is a welcome throwback to some of Sidney Lumet's movies like ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Owen slips comfortably into his role, continuing a streak of coolly calm yet stunningly brutal characters.. He brings his ""A-game"" to this film, and occasionally outshines veteran actor Washington.Washington reunites with his ""Malcolm X"" director Lee for the fifth time in 16 years to deliver another effective and powerful performance. It's a darkly intense Washington that appears on screen, which we've seen a lot more of in his recent years with ""Man on Fire"" and ""Training Day,"" and I for one hope this trend continues.Foster anchors the supporting cast around her. She plays a conniving, manipulative politico, who in the end only acts in her best financial interests, saying anything to get what she wants. But the whole time she stays at the sidelines, like a designated hitter. Coming in when necessary, but making sure not to steal the theatric thunder from Washington and Owen.The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Willem Dafoe as a stand-offish S.W.A.T. commander and Christopher Plummer as the rich business man with a terrible secret, do well to move the story along, but don't steal the focus of the spotlight from the matter at hand.Like Foster, Lee also changes it up a little, breaking from his more politically charged and controversial ""joints"" to bring us a thriller that seems an odd fit for him. Thrillers of this sort could probably be directed by anyone, and if I were a producer, I would not have thought of Lee as a potential director. But Lee has a perspective of New York City that both Lumet and Martin Scorsese had in the 70's. That's a realistic gritty version. You don't get the romantic vision on one side of the New York spectrum or the hateful vision on the other side. He brings that solid, realistic New York style that made his ""Do The Right Thing"" an instant classic 17 years ago.",Inside Man
259,sissoed,"fundamentally flawed plot, unbelievable characters, major moral blind-spots = bad movie",1,5 October 2009,"This review is full of SPOILERS and is meant for those who've seen this film. 1. Major plot flaw. The police would have identified the ""painters"" almost immediately, and this is hidden from the audience by the way in which the interrogation scenes are handled. The criminals' strategy for escape was to blend in with the other hostages and be unidentifiable. The video surveillance cameras were disabled only 2 minutes before the ""painters"" entered. By checking the videos the police would see what customers had entered the bank before then and could rule them out as ""painters."" The police could also rule-out all employees, not only because employees would be on tape, but even if not, the employees would know who of their number was in the bank at the time they were seized. This means that the ""painters"" could only be customers, and could only be among those customers who walked in during the two minutes between disabling the cameras and the entry of the ""painters."" Look at the number of customers already in the bank before the cameras went out -- a lot. Not many came in during those 2 minutes, even if some left during those 2 minutes. At most, let's say that 12 people came in during those 2 minutes, including the ""painters."" Then get physical descriptions of the ""painters'"" height, weight, sex, etc., from all the hostages. Compare those with the physical details of the 12 people. Of the 12 people, how many match each description? If one, the police have spotted a ""painter"" already. If 2 or 3 or 4, the police have a very small number of people to investigate further to expose which of that small group is a ""painter."" Moreover, every customer has to have a reason for being there: either to deal with an existing account, or open a new one. But a person opening a new account would go to an employee to start the process. So the ""painters"" each had to have already established an individual account with that bank. When did those 12 people open their accounts? The police would look at the time each of the 12 first opened an account. More recent accounts, opened at about the same date, would indicate who the ""painters"" might be. Now, why were each of the 12 at that downtown branch at that time, as opposed to a different branch or a different time? It must be, either they work nearby, or live nearby, or are running an errand where the route includes that branch. What friend or relative saw them in person before they left to go to the branch? How did they get to the branch -- walking, or subway, or taxi? How were they planning to get to their next destination? Where did they plan to go after their errand at the branch was finished? Who was expecting to see them at that place? Did anyone who was expecting to see them later that day wonder what had happened to them, or call the police to ask whether they were among the hostages? Recently opened accounts, near the date of other accounts, by people who neither live nor work near that branch, or have a plausible errand, who can't tell a plausible tale of how they got there or where they planned to go next, or who was expecting them: these are the prime suspects for ""painters."" The police very swiftly will have a very good idea who the ""painters"" are. Investigate them in detail and they are exposed; then pressure them to reveal the identities of the other criminals. This is what real police would do, but the movie, by showing the police pursuing a different, useless approach, leads the audience to think the ""painter"" masquerade would work. This movie operates on the old principle ""the criminal plot looks brilliant because the police are made to act like idiots yet look intelligent."" 2. Major moral blindness. 50 innocent citizens are terrorized, held hostage, assaulted, battered, for a day, a very significant crime, and yet at the end we are told that because nothing was stolen from the bank, the government and the police are just going to drop the whole affair. But what the criminals did to those people was a far more serious crime than any theft of bank property would have been. This movie passes-off that crime as if it were nothing, nothing at all. The terrorized hostages are pushed off the stage like so many plastic dolls who've served their role in the filmmakers' story. But those characters are human beings. The criminals, supposedly motivated by an idealistic desire to act against a Nazi profiteer, commit a horrific moral injustice on innocent people, whose rights and dignity they are blind to, in the pursuit of their own moral mission. This is a profound moral flaw in this film. The criminals are narcissists, so focused on their own desire for justice in their cause that they are blind to the injustice they inflict on others as they pursue their mission. 3. Unbelievable characters. A billionaire bank president anguished over his past exploitation of the Holocaust, but who is trying to hide his past, by hiring a real estate agent who has a side-line as a high-level ""fixer"" of rich people's problems, who is herself disgusted by his pro-Nazi past, yet takes his pay-off check anyway, and whose only attempt to ""fix"" the problem is a short and ineffective conversation with the criminal master-mind? A supposedly smart and honorable police hostage negotiator who is also the chief interrogator of the suspects, and who takes a diamond pay-off from the mastermind with a laugh, and who is completely blind to the serious crime of terrorism and hostage-taking of 50 civilians? None of these characters is believable.",Inside Man

If you do you're liable to miss something that will then leave you confused for the rest of the film. In fact, after you've seen it once you will probably want to watch it through again to check up on a couple of points. It is that kind of movie.If that puts you off seeing it, it isn't meant to. This is a good film, well-crafted and nicely directed, with some genuinely surprising twists and a decent set of performances from reliable stars like Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Jodie Foster. It falls short of being excellent though, perhaps because the pace is allowed to sag at times. It is maybe a little longer than it needs to be. And - hard as they try - none of the actors manages to create any great sympathy for their characters. Some viewers might like that, in that it allows you to concentrate on the events of the plot. Others may feel it lacks emotional depth.But overall it's a decent film, certainly worth seeing. It's one you have to concentrate on though.",Inside Man
261,Rick-34,some clever idea and great cast,8,19 March 2006,"It's curious to see Spike Lee do a straight caper movie. The movie is absent Lee's usual politics, though there are occasional glimpses of his sensibilities. At one point a Sikh has his turban taken away and complains at ends how Sikhs are not Arabs and he's tired of getting harassed all the time.Anyway, the cast is great - Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer are all top-drawer actors. Willem Dafoe has a smaller part that doesn't use all of his talents, unfortunately. The clever twist the plot adds is that the bank robbers dress everybody up in the same masks and jump suits that they themselves are wearing. So if the police raid the bank, they'll have a difficult time figuring who the bad guys are. (This isn't a spoiler - it's in the trailers.) Clive Owen and the robbers are clearly up to something that becomes apparent during the course of the film. They are particularly interested in the safety deposit box of the bank CEO, played by Christopher Plummer. Jodie Foster is brought in by him to protect ""his interests"". Her existence is amusing in that it reveals a bit about what Spike Lee thinks the corridors of white power are like. (Here's a hint, Spike: rich white folks don't swear at each other quite as much as you make them do, and in particular the word used by the Mayor to describe Jodie Foster's character is way beyond the pale. A real woman with as much influence as her character had would retaliate massively after being so described. But Spike Lee has never quite managed to capture any female character correctly, dating all the way back to Nola Darling. I digress.) The good parts of the film involve the interactions between Washington and Owen. Also, the many small man-on-the-street conversations are great. This aspect of observing street life has always been one of Lee's strongest points.It was interesting watching a Spike Lee caper film. I kinda like the idea. It's better than the formulaic caper films that are the rage, and features some of Lee's trademark shots, like when he puts an actor on a dolly to create non-walking walking movement.

However, it eventually comes to a pretty preposterous conclusion that left me flabbergasted about the motives behind the act, both in terms of the villains' targets and their escape methods.Not only did such an ending seem to be too complicated to be believable, but I was also under the impression that the movie was unnecessarily taking too long to conclude in the first place, with a lot of aimless wondering and talking going on for some twenty to thirty minutes following the main event.The characters are more or less of the kind that the viewer expects to see in this type of film and not one of them happens to stand out as a particularly interesting or complex persona.Denzel Washington's character, the detective who is leading the negotiations, turns out to be a relatively childish one, with his ludicrous conclusions and problems making me laugh on more than one occasion, and he eventually becomes the hero because the intellectually superior villains allow him to become one.",Inside Man

Anyway this is my second Spike Lee's 'joint' besides 25th Hour and I must say it's pretty striking.Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer all played their characters fluently without having any problems but Clive Owen is the one that had some minor greatness attached to him after all. His intro was awesome and I consider it to be one the film's best moments.Since all of the action evolves around the bank robbery, we are pretty sure that the only motive for doing it is money. And if we wouldn't have been questioned about the 'why' in the beginning it would have seemed even weirder as it did. No I won't give away the plot, I'll just say that I'm glad I knew very little about it. The last half an hour turned the movie upside-down three times for me.It's not without it's problems though. The problem is the films pace and narrative which are pretty 'genrey' in the first hour, but I feel that a lot could have been made better. The tension could have been screwed up tighter but you feel as if a lot is saved for the last half an hour. And yes a lot of (side) characters could have been developed a bit better. Yup, the hostage situation was definitely robbed of it's tension because of the last part. And because the robbers were too nice.Although this is a 'medium' budget Hollywood flick and by no chance an independent one, as I've said, you will be surprised. At least from that point of view.

It could be documentary psychological action oriented concentrated on an interesting criminal plan ""Dog day afternoon"" for example was mainly psychological and brilliant at that. ""Quick Change"" is an example for interesting plots.""Inside man"" tries to balance between these poles and adds some politics into the storyline. However there is no in depth psychological insight in the main criminal character. Likewise there is no real explanation of the main character's motives and intentions. So the movie is (for a while) lingering in a psychological confrontation of these characters. As there is no inner development this confrontation remains simply uninteresting.Fortunately the storyline does not insist on this element but rather explores the intricate plan behind the crime. The criminals and the hostages are dressed the same way and thus are indiscernible. So police has to sort out who is victim and who is gangster afterwards. That could have been highly entertaining. But that's the point where the side plot takes over. The owner of the bank has some dark Nazi secrets and some diamonds stored in a safe deposit box. Guess what everyone's after? Guess what the whole plot's about?How disappointing!",Inside Man
269,supah79,"Pretty dull, but above average",6,9 August 2006,"For me Inside Man was just not what it was cracked up to be. Great cast, great characters (especially Owen's and Foster's) and the film is technically sound. But the script stretches it's smartness and the film becomes dull because of it.I like filmmakers with opinions and Lee's no exception for me. I like the references to the current 'war on terror'. All hostages are suspects (like all muslims). How do you distinguish the good from the few bad? Especially the scene where all hostage are gunned down in front of the bank with rubber bullets hit home.But I still feel Lee didn't get the max out of this film and his cast. The scenes between Foster and Washington are fantastic and Owen gives a solid performance as always (though his American accent is very bad). But it just isn't enough.So, it's solid entertainment, but I hoped for more.",Inside Man
270,nived84,Spike Lee's INSIDE MAN doesn't disappoint,8,22 April 2006,"Spike Lee's Inside Man is a smart, well-crafted heist thriller led by two very good performances from Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. This is a very entertaining and clever thriller that just might require a second viewing, just to make sure that I caught everything. The film runs just a little over two hours long, yet it does seem to run about fifteen or twenty minutes longer than it probably should, but it seemed to keep me in the dark and on the edge of my seat for so much of the film just wondering what in the hell was REALLY going on that I can't deny the fact that I was pretty entertained.I've only seen one other movie directed by Spike Lee; 25th Hour, and looking at this film there certainly are some similarities. I love how Lee shoots his films all over various parts of New York; uptown, downtown, Brooklyn; he really seems to showcase the city quite well, along with the city's diversified ethnicities and races along with it. In Inside Man Lee knows that the audience is paying close attention; trying to figure out how this is all going to end, but he keeps the audience in the dark so well, yet still holding your attention to keep you fascinated and then when you think you've got a handle on what's going on he reveals the truth, and it's usually not quite what you were expecting. This is easily the most entertaining film I've seen so far this year, just passing both V for Vendetta and Thank You for Smoking by a hair.For the sake of surprise I'm going to try my best to avoid giving away too much of the film's plot or its twists. It's a much more enjoyable film to watch going in not knowing very much about it. The film begins with four people dressed as painters walking into the lobby of the Manhattan Trust Bank disabling the bank's security cameras, drawing guns and threatening to blow anyone's head clean off if they don't get their faces on the floor. The scene is riveting and exciting, the first thirty minutes or so of Inside Man is the initial takeover of the bank, and Clive Owen does a marvelous job at playing a menacing bank robbery that clearly means business; so don't mess with him, just do exactly what he tells you to and you won't get hurt. The ringleader is Dalton Russell (Owen), who hides behind a mask and a pair of black sunglasses for so much of the film I starting thinking to myself, ""Man, maybe he could have played V in V for Vendetta?"" his character is calm, cool, collective, but at the same time completely menacing and calculative. Once the bank is secured by the robbers we're introduced to NYPD hostage negotiators Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who get handed the case and arrive at the bank quickly to work along side E.S.U. (Emergency Services Unit) Captain John Darius (played well by Willem Dafoe). They all hope to get the situation revolved peacefully and quickly.The police do what they can to keep the robbers happy, and the hostages safe; they send in bottles of water and plenty of pizzas, they think they've got'em doing exactly what they want, but these aren't your ordinary bank robbers. This robbery has been meticulously and thoroughly planned out, down to the tinniest of details, and the robbers have got the police doing exactly what they want them to do; it's a fun, but equally complex game of cat-and-mouse, and we're not quite sure whose the cat and whose the mouse. The game rambles on and on, throughout the night and into the next day, and it looks like one thing is for certain; these criminals are in absolutely no hurry to escape, but why?Inside Man is a complex, entertaining and very well-acted heist flick, easily the best I've seen since Ocean's Eleven, and it's certainly been one of the most enjoyable rides of 2006 so far. It's refreshing to see something so well done, with so many good actors, and leaves you feeling satisfied. I recommend you check out Inside Man if you're looking for a thriller with as much brains and it does twists and some good performances from Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, and also need further proof that Jodie Foster can play more than just a desperate mother. Inside Man is actually worth the full seven bucks, which is amazing! Now I wonder to myself; could I pull something like that off?",Inside Man

The payoff is hardly worthy of a name, talk about mailed in performances, good thing I rented it and didn't have to fork over any big loot in a theater. In fact it is just this sort of movie that is ruining Hollywood: a camera swinging all the place, the better to disorient you, the F word instead of decent dialog, and with somebody like Lee always, always, always some insistent political correctness. OKay right from the start we knew Plummer needed something fetched from his safety deposit vault, something incriminating: all right. Stupid from the start. Why did he hang onto it. And if so why put in an unsafe place like a safety deposit vault, how about some vital rabbit hole on his country estate. This will definitely be my last Lee movie, and thank goodness there were not many before it. Fortunately I just got through seeing the Matador, as a reminder how good movies can get.",Inside Man

There are so many unbelievable, improbable scenes that just cannot happen and make a heist successful. Are you telling me that the Police cannot figure out who sponsored the bank robbery ? What kind of robbers would siege in the MTB, spend 13hours in there just to breech a hole and set up a stash ? How exactly do these cons know what apparently only the chairman knows the content of his keep ? Sounds awful weird.Then, please, the whole exchange between cons and Wasington and Foster, what is this ? A soap opera? There is nothing in this movie that would make this heist in reality successful. In no way would security cameras implode, the Police would be alerted immediately by the Security company that immediately gets a signal if the Bank under heist. Seriously, are they trying to convince us that this establishment has multiple flaws in their CPU security equipments ? BS!Now many people have already pointed the inaccuracies and movie-mistakes. First the fact that the brief-case held by the Cheik priest was not carefully inspected. I can't believe a squad would not search for a device - please! This is taking us for imbeciles. Then, there is no way the bank robbers would be able to stay so long in the bank and hope to just run out the front door without being exposed! All the hostages would recognize them, the tapes would basically prove who are the thief, multiple evidence would be at hand for the Police to figure out the cons. How can four robbers, if not terrorists, could possibly be convinced they could handle so easily the entire NYPD department ? But miraculously the head chief of negotiators would call it off ? Come one, this is bad. Plus I don't see how in the end Owen is capable of so simply walking out without being busted - it just doesn't work ! It's laughable. The actors play themselves, they don't embody the characters at all, they simply reproduce their most well known mechanical mannerisms that made them so famous for throughout their career. There is very few insight and plot development, only at the end for 30seconds and very predictable. It's so poorly done, between the fast forward and the flashback, it is very incoherent. Mostly it is trying to make the cons so much more smarter than the cops.",Inside Man
274,Undead_Master,Really enjoyable,8,9 August 2006,"This was a pleasant surprise for me. It's less arty than the other Spike Lee films I've seen, and it plays more as straight entertainment without being bogged down politics or pretension. Don't get me wrong, It still has a few of his signature touches, but it's a nice change of pace for the director.I thought the first 20 minutes or so were a little dull, but once it gets going, it sucks you right in. ""Inside Man"" is witty, smart and suspenseful, with great acting all over the place.I think It ends up falling a little bit short of greatness, mostly due to the slow beginning and some tiny plot holes, but it's Lee's best film since ""He Got Game"" and I may warm to it more with repeated viewings.",Inside Man

The utter pretentiousness of this movie left me stunned.Denzel is usually hit or miss with his movies. I don't know who his agent is, but he is not doing himself any favors by starring in roles like this. The film tries so hard to give us witty banter and clever dialog and fails miserably. At one point, Clive Owen, the chief bank robber, calls the police to give them a riddle and the police fall over themselves trying to solve it. Why? Hey, there are live HOSTAGES in the bank waiting to be saved. Who cares, bring them sandwiches? Was someone drunk when they wrote this script? Jodie Foster turns up as this mystery problem solver who walks into a hostage situation to offer the chief bad guy a choice. Really? Police and SWAT teams let this happen all the time. An unknown woman, who could be a kidnapper herself: Please, go on in and do your thing.There is a disturbing scene of racism as the police steal the turban off the head of a sikh and then as he complains about racism, the police interviewers tell him he shouldn't have a problem getting a cab. I don't know what point Spike Lee was trying to accomplish with this scene but it just seemed woefully inappropriate. Racist remarks are sprinkled throughout the movie and it seems like Mr. Lee has jumped on the Crash bandwagon. Not a good sign of where his direction has headed.I am reading the reviews of this movie on IMDb and I can't believe it. This movie is not only bad, it would be laughable bad if it wasn't so boring. Please Mr. Lee, if your return involves releasing another steaming crap pile like this, stay in retirement. Has to be seen to be believed.",Inside Man

Spike Lee does a good job directing, i just think it's the writing. at the beginning it shows the main actor in what you think is a jail cell, but turns out to be something very different. other than all that,i don't recommend this movie to anyone. it's just another movie that could have been so much better, but wasn't good at all. Clive Owen does a good job directing, once again, it's just the writing. It's very hard to follow, complicated, and at some parts, highly funny. but, it's just plain bad.

Denzel's performance was (again) not disappointing.But besides those obvious facts, what I really like about this movie is how it shows typical NYC life, from the character interactions which I think is overall good considering it's realistic. Case in point, the fear one of the cops shows when seeing the singe's (however you spell it) turban and automatically assuming he's an Arab, since he was the first hostage to come out, and how the operation's captain played by Defoe said something about how the bank robbers has to know that nobody is going to get a plane especially in these days.Very good flick.",Inside Man
278,shadowycat,High time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect!,9,24 March 2006,"Whether I was into the subject or not, there's always a filmmaker at work in a Spike Lee film... he's one moviemaker who never loses sight of being a filmmaker first and foremost, and he's absolutely outdone himself with INSIDE MAN, a taut thriller which avoids the colloquialism that alienated mainstream audiences from some of his earlier work.If you've seen the trailer or heard anything about this pic, you have been misled. Everything I heard left me feeling like yeah, OK, I'm going for Denzel. Denzel vs. Clive Owen will be interesting.From the first shots and opening credits, you are submerged in artistic vision, and a finely honed piece of work the likes of which I haven't seen in years. I'd almost give this one a ten.. and I don't hand out tens freely. I do not want to spoil this. You have to walk in cold, and let this film grab you by the short and curlies.This is one film where there isn't a spare frame or wasted cheap shot. Every zinger zings, and there are laughs too, laughs at merciful intervals to break the tension and remind an audience on the edges of its seats that movie-going's supposed to be entertaining, dammit. The cinematography is brilliant, and the music is fantastic - true cinematic score, true genius. I can't praise this one enough.Christopher Plummer is superb, in what is (perhaps coincidentally) an ironic bit of casting. Jodie Foster rises to a challenging persona with aplomb and ease, and my only complaint of the entire exercise is that her character's name 'Madeline White' is perhaps a little cliché. Beyond that, there isn't a filmmaker alive who brings New York to the screen with anything approximating Spike Lee's vision.It seems there hasn't been a lot of junket for this one, and that Spike Lee's presence has been downplayed... as if the studio downplayed the fact that this is a Spike Lee film slightly, until the word was out that this film is over and beyond what an audience might already expect from one of his films.So... let me just say.. man o man this is a cinematic mind-blowing amazing one and a half hours... it's brilliant, tight, funny, articulate, intense, and high time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect.",Inside Man
279,joaocruzferreira,Spike Lee - The Misunderstood Genius (once again),8,15 July 2007,"In his debut directing a thriller, Spike Lee creates a movie that grabs you from the beginning and never lets go. This dazzling bank-heist thriller is so witty and unpredictable, which makes it unforgettable!In the opening minutes, we meet Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), a cool, collected thief who tells of his ""perfect"" plan to rob a Manhattan bank. It's not only for the money, he calmly explains, it's ""because I can."" Into the picture comes Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), a detective with a spotty record and an eagerness to match wits with Russell. He's clever and good at reading people. He's also smart enough to know that there's more to Russell's motives than just cleaning out a bank. Another wrench is thrown into the mix. Madeline White (Jodie Foster) is a stone-cold power broker hired to protect something in the building that the bank's board chairman (Christopher Plummer) wants to keep hidden.The action is propelled by the cops and crooks trying to outwit each other, with Foster's sly fixer along for some added mystery.The three main characters are terrific: Clive Owen has the difficult job of delivering most of his performance through a mask, but his icy calm remains eerie and powerful. Jodie Foster attacks the role of Madeleine White with an electricity that chills. She plays a cunning and somewhat evil character with such dedication. Fascinating. Denzel Washington adds some charisma to his role of Detective Keith Frazier and projects a power that is so typical of Zel.It's about time the academy gives Spike Lee some respect! 8/10",Inside Man

I was afraid I was in for another one of Denzel's macho cop outings (the African-American equal to the ever boring Harrison Ford), but was happily surprised to find him in top form, bursting with energy and life. On top of his excellent performance this is also Spike Lee at his best since CLOCKERS providing us with a lively and crackling heist flick (or is it?). This is an all around fine film giving Lee the perfect platform for weaving in some relevant and finely pointed political and racial commentary. It's also a great New York City film. Lee must be a big fan of THE TAKING OF PELHAM, ONE, TWO, THREE. It has the same vibe and what a great vibe to have. My only complaint is Jodie Foster's stilted and somewhat over the top performance...there is nothing natural about her in this role. Everyone else, including the large cast of bit actors are fantastic. I obviously highly recommend INSIDE MAN, an upbeat, exciting and always surprising night at the movies.",Inside Man

An intelligent and thought provoking heist thriller that bounces off your previous conceptions of the negotiator drama, in fact it uses the cliché's to it's advantage. The film also has the benefit of three strong leads (Washington, Foster and Owen) and two great supporters (Defoe, Plummer). Washington is very cool, foster plays against type with an icy performance, Owen is dark and very funny.

Just eliminate the bank workers, see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times.

285,saeedahmedsasoli,I really enjoyed this movie.,10,7 December 2020,"The film opens with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) informing us of his intention to rob a bank for two reasons: for money and because he can. He states that since we now know the who and the what, all that's left is the how, which is what Lee's film is all about. But for someone who addresses the audience directly into the camera, he isn't being entirely honest. For as we eventually learn, Dalton and his three accomplices are after the chairman of the bank's safety deposit box and the contents that lie within. Chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) hides a dark secret in there, and he hires a mysterious woman, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), to make sure, whether she must make a deal with the criminals or the police, that what's in his box never surfaces in public.But now that you know the basic plot, there are two minor characters in this film who are the key to understanding it. The first is a young boy, who's a hostage along with his father. It's during his conversation in the central vault with Dalton that we get the film's most telling moment. Lee begins the scene with a slow zoom into the vault, intentionally highlighting the importance of this scene. All the other hostages had to strip down, give up their keys and cell phones, and put the same painters' suits on as the robbers, but this boy was allowed to keep his PSP player and his clothes along with receiving much gentler treatment. So in the vault, he and Dalton are each sitting on a pile of money, and they begin to talk about the video game he's playing, which apparently is some version of Grand Theft Auto.I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good. The story was good and there were plenty of funny lines that I guffawed at. Denzel Washington was great as the NY cop who had to negotiate with Clive Owen, also great, who was holding hostages in a bank. Spike Lee's direction was superb. There were no throw away scenes. Take for example the cell phone scene where the criminals told everyone to dump their phones into a sack. That could have been handled very differently but it was prolonged and stretched out to provide a suspenseful scene. The incident didn't really have much to do with the main plot but it was handled so well you were on the edge of your seat waiting to see what would happen.10/10",Inside Man
286,james_norman1981,Standard twisty-turny thriller but with a brilliantly novel twist of social commentary and humour,9,27 March 2006,"This is a great movie... there's very little that can be held against it. Spike Lee has taken what appears to have been your everyday suspenseful thriller and made it into one of the best films of the year thus far. Fast moving but heavy on characterisation, thrilling and suspenseful but playful and clever, socially aware but seldom preachy and always with a wry undercurrent of brilliantly unexpected humour, all in all this film kicks ass! To sum up the basic plot: Clive Own is the man who has planned the perfect bank robbery, you know this because he tells you he's done it, the only question is whether we're hearing him before or after the heist... The principle is fairly simple. Along with three other masked associates he has developed a scheme that is supposedly full proof, involving misdirection, the creation of chaos and the possibility for great reward in more ways than one... Denzel Washington, along with the excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor as his partner, is the black detective tasked with overseeing hostage negotiations. Willem Dafoe is the put upon police captain in charge of the whole goddamn mess, Peter Kybart is the very put upon mayor of New York dragged in to proceedings, Christopher Plummer is the very rich owner of the bank with a very guilty secret buried there (he is also fairly put upon) and Jody Foster is, quite frankly, the horrendous bitch employed by Plummer to keep his secret safe. She does much of the putting onto the other characters...All the players, aside from Foster who appears to be having the time of her life playing the opposite to all those sensitive souls thrust onto her since Taxi Driver, are on very familiar territory and they clearly enjoy their roles, perhaps with the exception Plummer, thanks mainly to the numerous jokes, gags and other material they get to perform in front of, where I watched it, a cinema packed to the rafters. Whoever produced this film (Universal I think) has really gone all out to get the punters in and it helped the movie a great deal. Having a full house encouraged that kind of group bond where the jokes and situations appear that bit funnier.It could be that phenomenon which made me enjoy Inside Man so much, but I certainly didn't mind the obvious plot holes and massive leaps of faith required of our suspension of disbelief. At any one point in this movie the various protagonists would be undone by one single person failing to act absolutely according to plan... this includes both Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, whose characters are both on extremely thin ice... Owen due to becoming a hostage taking bank robber and Washington because of a recent question over some missing funds from a case he worked.However, I was totally prepared to accept the ludicrousness of the situations presented to us, which was highly unusual for me. The reason? Spike Lee. The self styled king of modern, black, American political cinema takes the hackneyed plot of just another thriller and turns it into a massive diatribe against the hypocrisy of modern New Yorkers. Instead of the colour blind, metropolitan city the Big Apple is currently portrayed as, in recent years, where films suggesting all isn't right socially are seen as either trying to blacken a good city's name or as years behind the times, Lee uses this new medium, for him, of the thriller to turn an eye on what he sees in the New York of 2006.The cops are mostly racist, bigoted and incompetent, attitudes Washington and Ejiofor's characters are not exempt from. At various points during the movie the police show extreme measures against hostages who are simply honest citizens of New York, perhaps best summed up with their taking down of a dark skinned bank teller ('My God, it's an Arab!' 'I'm not an Arab I'm a Sikh...!'). Similarly, the various women involved do not enjoy a fun time with New York's finest either. Funnily enough, though, for a man so interested in modern, ignored bigotry, Lee fails to offer any moments where homosexuals are involved in proceedings. It could be that this is deliberate and that New York really has become totally acceptant of gay men and women... or there could be another reason for the absence. Regardless, the lack of a particular branch of intolerance is in no way felt at the time due to the constant bombardment on the numerous divides that still exist between the two sexes and the numerous racial groups... as one police sergeant very aptly puts it; 'I'd rather be an old bigot than a handsome corpse...!' this said, of course, to that hero of good, honest, black characters, Denzel Washington! Inside Man is resplendent with these images, angles and wry amusement. Laugh out loud moments are plentiful and the overall story arc is quick enough to maintain an interest without sacrificing on developing an empathy between the audience and the protagonists. Lee has taken his shot at a mainstream piece of cinema and has most likely satisfied an adequate commercial cross section of the audience without alienating or betraying his political roots. This film is altogether excellent and the acting, though unlikely to trouble anyone next awards season, is in tune with the piece. Similarly we have a director reigning in his most ardent voice but not silencing it completely, allowing a very fresh perspective on a standard and lacklustre genre. This gives us a whole new look at two simultaneously over and under subscribed subjects: the thriller and the modern New York city. To my mind it was high time we had both! All in all I highly recommend Inside Man.",Inside Man

However, last is also misleading because all three were very good movies. Inside Man was directed by Spike Lee. Prior to seeing Inside Man let me give you a list of all the Spike Lee movies I've ever enjoyed watching: 1. Malcolm X 2. hmmm... ummmm... nevermind. So I didn't really have that high of expectations. However, I have to admit that this movie is extremely well made. It's evident from the beginning of the movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever. While the camera work is great throughout what really makes this movie stand out are the great performances by the two leads. Clive Owen is great as a ""not your everyday bankrobber"" and Washington is wonderful, somehow giving an incredibly fresh performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. Its an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialouge. This is just a very good movie with something for almost everybody.",Inside Man

Hollywood just made another one of these bank robbery heist flicks where a couple of perps rob a bank with a masterfully laid out plan and a group of policemen trying to figure them out. That's what you get here. It's like they're not even trying anymore. And this one's below average. The ending, which usually is when they fill you in on the ingenuity of the plan, is incredibly boring. Because they basically tell you in Scene 1 what it is. Then there's this totally pointless side-plot, which only serves to waste the talents of one Jodie Foster. Clive Owen spends most of the movie wearing a mask, which some people might agree with. Denzel puts in a routine effort, nothing more.This movie is a total waste of time and money, both for me having seen it and Hollywood having produced it. It's redundant.

290,matjpi,"If this is city hall, then I'm keeping my taxes.",2,19 March 2012,"Small details in films with a threadbare plot can sometimes redeem the overall work. Since details were clearly waved aside as unimportant, this film stood little chance.Rather than go through the film with a fine tooth-comb, which others have already done and with more skill and patience than I, I'll just pick out a few memorable parts that grated with or disappointed me.The dialogue between the Mayor (Peter Kybart) and Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) behind closed doors was ludicrous. We didn't need gratuitous insults to know that underneath her coolly demure exterior, White was largely made of tool steel. White's later comment to Frazier that her bite was much worse than her bark clearly signalled that we'd never see her fangs. And that was a pity.Foster looked sensational in a power-suit and pullback and did what she could with her lines. Her conversation with Case at the wharf was only good because two outstanding actors were involved. Even then they struggled to make lemonade as they discussed a supposed super-secret within earshot of strangers.I found the interplay between White and Case entertaining. Somewhat psychopathic high-fliers they circled each other warily. This, admittedly thin, role is a pleasant departure for Foster who frequently lands parts as the feisty (though always admirable) little battler. She has eyes that can convey almost any emotion so her most thrilling portrayal could be as a beautiful psychopath. (Hollywood please note.)Frazier (Denzel Washington) was as flawed and potentially corrupt as all the others. Perhaps that was the message but it's not comforting to see that the price of this purportedly honourable cop was just a few carats of carbon allotrope that will allow him to bed his woman with the handcuffs, again. The self-congratulatory mutual butt-patting after Frazier and Mitchell's meeting with Case wasn't funny or light, just crass and ugly.Not much to redeem this film: a promising cast for a mediocre movie with some bad messages.",Inside Man
291,hankhanks12345,Pretty good caper from Spike Lee,7,19 August 2007,"Lee is a very uneven filmmaker. Some of his movies, like ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Malcolm X"", are brilliant. Others are pretty junky. This movie is a departure from any movie I've ever seen him do, in that it's pretty much a straight caper film, and even though there are a lot of twists, it's not overly about politics, the African American Experience, or sociology.What I liked about it: - The theme music. I don't know much about popular Indian Music, but I liked the hip-hop inspired Indian song in the beginning. I'm not entirely sure what it was doing in this film, but I liked it.The Actors: Foster, Davis, Plummer, Washington - all great performances. the supporting actors were great too.The twists: I honestly didn't see what was coming until the end. I knew something was going on funny, but I didn't see it coming. Some people might not like the non-linear story telling, but it held my interest Things I didn't like: - Ultimately they didn't develop the central idea of the story too much. I don't want to give it away, but they should have played up the Plummer story more.The ending was a bit too clever.Overall, a pretty enjoyable film, and a good step forward for Lee.",Inside Man

Which totally ruins the entire start and mood of the movie, as it's completely unmatched to the films storyline.We are never explained why Clive Owen wants to rob a bank.We are never explained how Clive Owen, knows about the contents of safety box.We are never explained what Clive Owens connection is to the person he's robbing from.We sit there watching and hope for things to be explained but they never are!High profile casting with Jodie Foster (who is wasted) and Denzel Washington, who always plays his roles well. But he's dressed with a guy from the Southern States in the 50s, in modern day NYC.This entire film is patchy in its style, character development, story telling and OST.The heist itself was not extravagant.

294,Mxzplk,"""... which lives us only with the how: as the bard would say, lies the rob.""",10,1 April 2006,"The film opens with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) informing us of his intention to rob a bank for two reasons: for money and because he can. He states that since we now know the who and the what, all that's left is the how, which is what Lee's film is all about. But for someone who addresses the audience directly into the camera, he isn't being entirely honest. For as we eventually learn, Dalton and his three accomplices are after the chairman of the bank's safety deposit box and the contents that lie within. Chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) hides a dark secret in there, and he hires a mysterious woman, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), to make sure, whether she must make a deal with the criminals or the police, that what's in his box never surfaces in public.But now that you know the basic plot, there are two minor characters in this film who are the key to understanding it. The first is a young boy, who's a hostage along with his father. It's during his conversation in the central vault with Dalton that we get the film's most telling moment. Lee begins the scene with a slow zoom into the vault, intentionally highlighting the importance of this scene. All the other hostages had to strip down, give up their keys and cell phones, and put the same painters' suits on as the robbers, but this boy was allowed to keep his PSP player and his clothes along with receiving much gentler treatment. So in the vault, he and Dalton are each sitting on a pile of money, and they begin to talk about the video game he's playing, which apparently is some version of Grand Theft Auto.The video game fills the screen for 20 seconds or so as the boy explains that the goal is to steal, assault and not be killed or car-jacked. We watch him controlling the game as he places a grenade in a character's mouth and blood splatters everywhere. And since this young child narrates bloody violence with such nonchalance, it provides a sort of disturbing comic relief. As he and Dalton continue to talk, we discover that the boy completely sympathizes with the plight of these thieves, casually dropping his thought that everyone's got to get paid somehow. Again, we laugh, but we're uncomfortable with ourselves for doing so. The second scene involves the brother of Frazier's girlfriend, who's a crack head bum. At the end of the film when Frazier returns home, we see him sitting stoned on a sofa.So what is Lee saying with these two? The young boy and the brother represent the common scapegoats for the ills of contemporary American society: thugs and drugs. But real corruption and true evil come from seemingly good individuals whose high moral standing is due to their wealth covering up a past of transgressions. Such is Arthur Case, who has a secret to hide from many years ago and has spent his whole life as a great philanthropist, atoning for his sin. For decades he has been safe, and now he pays Madeline to keep him that way, but Dalton Russell, like an avenging angel, is here for justice.What results is a film that sets up a clear distinction between who is good and who is bad only to deconstruct it. After all, this is a heist film, so you don't even have to be told this; whoever is doing the robbing is bad, and those trying to prevent it are good. But what happens during the film is that the good/bad polarity breaks down: as we learn new facts, we realize that Dalton, the criminal, is good, and Arthur Case is really the evil person of this film, although his concern is for preventing the crime. So there is an interplay between the apparent and the real.But it's our strong reluctance to accept this change where Lee convicts us; we want to believe that the kind, elderly Arthur Case has paid the price for his sin and been washed clean. We readily condemn crimes like bank robberies and substance abuse, because those crimes are observable behaviors. But Lee wants us to see that it's the hidden crimes, the long-repressed wrongdoings of wealthy and respected individuals, that are much more disturbing. And with Arthur Case, he not only got away with something, but has profited off it his entire life.But this calls into question just who is the titular ""Inside Man."" Perhaps it's the most obvious answer, and it's Dalton because he's the one inside the bank committing the crime. But I don't think this is so. Notice the absence of the indefinite article: it's Inside Man, and not The Inside Man. So then the film could be a playing out of an inside/outside opposition, where Arthur Case represents crimes on the inside and Dalton, those outside. If that's so, then we have a strong statement about the power and wealth of the upper class - that deceit in the heart is equal to or often worse than any outward criminal behavior.Personally, I want to extend this a bit further, stating that Lee wants to go inside man, that is, humankind, to reveal the stereotypes and prejudices that we hold. To illustrate, the film gives us the perfect example; a Sikh bank employee-turned-hostage is one of the first that Dalton releases. However, once outside, the police harass him, beat him, and highly insult him by taking his turban and assuming he's a Muslim terrorist. So that's just it: we don't even always look at people's behavior. We only have to see what they are wearing or other surface qualities, and we form broad generalizations and stereotypes that keep us perpetually outside and disconnected, not only unable to recognize the good in others, but when appropriate, the evil.",Inside Man
295,mysteriesfan,A promising but failed movie,3,21 March 2007,"I went into this movie with high expectations. The cast and director had done some outstanding work in the past. The plot sounded interesting, with ample chance for rich story and character elements. I came out more disappointed than in any movie in years. A borrowed ""bank heist"" premise and a few gritty, stylized, or eccentric touches and small-scale human-nature observations do not add up to a good movie. This is true no matter how talented, intelligent, and otherwise successful the people involved. I cannot join in a chorus of empty praise for what is so clearly a failed film.The storytelling was slow-paced, uneven, disorganized, and uninspired. Long before the film finally dragged to an end and revealed the secret of the heist, I had stopped caring. When the drawn-out movie was not belaboring dense details that did not add up to anything larger, it was veering into thin, superficial subplots -- ones that were either boring or far-fetched and sensationalistic -- with even more superficial characters, dialogue, and interactions.None of the characters were worth caring about or had any depth. They were mere stick-figure plot devices. I have never seen Denzel Washington look bad until this film, or play a less coherent, less impressive character. Other characters were cardboard villains, perhaps with some shock-value traits pasted on for effect, even down to the gray-haired establishment type who appeared briefly to spew obscenities every other word. Jodie Foster made an interesting ice-cold, high-society ""fixer,"" and Clive Owen a smooth, cool, wily robber, but their thin, flat characters were mere injected devices for unbelievable actions and story lines. Despite their talents, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were able to add nothing, with stiff performances in empty roles. An air of pseudo-sophistication threw a wet blanket on all of the performances.As a commentary on society or human nature, the film's observations seem trivial. As a crime drama, the police work could not have been less impressive or the dramatic presentation less suspenseful. The rushed attempt toward the end to tie together plot threads, finally create some dramatic momentum, and belatedly manufacture heroics was confusing, contrived, unrealistic, out-of-place, and ineffective.Quite frankly, the disparate elements of this uneven film did not come together to tell a meaningful or entertaining story on any level. It was a major disappointment. The movie does not deserve all the strained, lame, and sometimes outright embarrassing attempts to portray it as a ""masterpiece"" or to make excuses for it.",Inside Man
296,jhuni_x,I am confused.,5,2 February 2010,"Was this movie supposed to be exciting? For me it was too predictable, they said outright that Dalton was not the type of person that would hurt or kill people so I didn't really feel any suspense or surprise from that point on.Who exactly is the protagonist of this story? Was it supposed to be Dalton and is he supposed to an admirable character? Just because he didn't kill anyone doesn't make him a good person, and it doesn't make his whole bank robbery forgivable. He stripped people down, kept them from their families, and frightened them. Besides that he stank.Also, what is with this movie's name? Who is the Inside Man? Is the point that you cannot identify the inside man? Is the inside man the person who told Dalton about box #329, if not who the heck told him about that top-secret safety deposit box? Either way, was this whole perplexing affair meant to leave me in a state of utter confusion?Moving along with the story, Dalton robs the bank and the police essentially do not offer any resistance. They said ""you won't attack because we haven't killed anyone."" Does a robber all of a sudden get the right to hold hostages just because he leaves them alive? Why didn't the police resist the robbers more often and earlier?Okay, so the police finally decide to invade the bank to save the hostages, even though they knew the hostages were aware of their operation due to a cleverly placed bug. The robbers then join together with the hostages and they leave the bank together, that way the police cannot distinguish between the hostages and the robbers.What I can't understand for the life of me though, is that once the police had the robbers in their custody, why couldn't they identify them using all the voice recordings, camera footage, and cell phones they had?!?If the police were competent they would've used Speaker Recognition software with recordings of the robber's voices to identify the criminals. Moreover, factors such as employment status, height, weight, skin color, and gender could be used by the authorities to ascertain the corrupt culprits.One of the most confusing things is the fact that the main robber, Dalton, somehow got away from the police. Even though he talked to that child about his PSP game, yelled loudly at the hostages, had several conversations with Frazier and White, and he basically led the entire operation. Based on this, don't you think the police, or at least Frazier, would notice the absence of the main perpetrator? They even indicate in the ending segment of the film that Frazier recognized Dalton's voice. Why did he recognize it so late?!Speaking of that, are we supposed to believe it was a complete coincidence that Frazier and Dalton met up? According to the movie, Dalton wanted to leave undetected so he obviously didn't plan on Frazier being there. It is hard to believe such a coincidence would actually occur.Maybe if this film had a take home message that would make it pretty good, but I haven't really figured out what I am supposed to get out of this movie. Don't rob banks? That probably isn't it, after all their robbery succeeds. Buy property when there is blood on the streets? Or is it the other way around? Either way they only spend like two minutes talking about Case's former affairs with the Nazis, there is no buildup and no visuals of the event, so for the most part those scenes are easily forgettable. In conclusion, don't watch this movie, all you will get out of it is confusion.",Inside Man

300,petep,A safe bet for any fan of the genre or cast,8,21 April 2006,"I think Inside Man hit all the right notes. It's essentially a standard hostage situation thriller, but just really well done. There are a couple surprises in the plot department, but it's nothing too absurd. As Jodie Foster's character jokes, there aren't really nuclear missile launch codes sitting in one of the bank safety deposit boxes.The film opens the same way I think the trailer did. Clive Owen stares rather intensely into the camera and gets our full attention. He's becoming one of my favorite actors. But he and a few others stage what is to be the perfect bank robbery. He has a plan for everything. What he doesn't expect is someone as smart as him on the outside. That would be Denzel Washington, who plays a detective arriving on the scene as the lead hostage negotiator. I believe I heard that Washington put on weight for the role, to look more like an ordinary guy. He wasn't though. Despite facing charges for some missing evidence, he's a rather exceptional detective and is a worthy adversary for Clive Owen's extremely calm bank robber. Jodie Foster enters the picture as well as... well, I have no idea whatsoever what she does. She specializes in protecting people's interests I guess. This would include the owner of the bank under siege (Christopher Plummer), who has something inside that he doesn't want the thieves to stumble upon.I love the cast. In addition to who I already mentioned, you have Willem Dafoe as the head of the SWAT team and Chiwetel Ejiofor (who I'll always know as the operative from Serenity) as Washington's fellow detective. And despite how annoyed I am with Spike Lee over that ridiculous Spike TV situation, he's crafted quite a good film here. The movie is quite clever, but it never goes over the top, and it doesn't dance around with pride over how clever it is. There's a genuine sense of realism pumped into every scene, and I think that's the director's most prominent signature here. Nothing truly great or groundbreaking going on with the film, but it's a safe bet if you want an enjoyable film, and I especially enjoyed the performances of all 6 leads.",Inside Man

I've enjoyed all of his movies although there were times I felt he used a soft sledge hammer to get his point across.Inside Man shows not only how transnational Lee has become, but also its almost as though a creative person suddenly has come into his own confident self. New Yorkers always believe they are the world and in many ways they should - a wonderful melting pot of possibilities.

The complicated plot ultimately doesn't hold together. But the movie has a great New York feel and when it is funny it is very funny--as when a local citizen is asked to aid the police and shows up at the scene of the emergency with a paper bag full of old parking tickets she wants fixed.Lee and his scriptwriter think that corruption is everywhere and that the rich and powerful can always get anything they want, so they don't find it necessary for their story to make sense; it is enough to say: ""See, this is a corrupt plot by a rich man. See how evil they are?"" Denzel Washington is fun to watch, as is Kim Director, in a minor role.",Inside Man
306,kingmonkey,just a bit too clever,5,19 November 2006,"An oddity, this film. It boasts a superb cast and an excellent director, not to mention a wonderful screenplay. Despite, or perhaps because of, this, the film really does not add up to the sum of its parts.The idea of a ""perfect"" bank robbery going somewhat awry is hardly new, but the twists as to how and why it goes, in a sense, ""wrong"", and who causes it to be that way creates a new dimension on the genre and makes it rather attention-grabbing. The multi-perspective approach and the focused sub-plots are also a rejuvenation of the heist movie.But for all the good points there remains a sense of Inside Man just not being as good as it could have been. There is no area of the film you could say is bad, nor one that you could immediately say is the explanation as to why it all feels rather flat.Basically, what should be one of the most intelligent films of the year ends up feeling like something ideal to watch on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon. I recommend the film for such an occasion, but I somehow doubt that this was the intention of Spike Lee when he made it.On the Spike scale, better than Clockers (what isn't) but not as accomplished as 25th Hour.",Inside Man

Inside Man is the story of a cop that matches his wits with a clever bank robber played by Clive Owen. I know it's going to sound very redundant, but this is an entertaining heist flick. Everyone may jump to call this film Spike's first ""mainstream"" film, but this is very much a Spike Lee joint. From the signature dolly shots to the social messages in some scenes, it's all here. Spike also benefited with the stellar cast that includes Jodie Foster, who looked stunning by the way, and veteran actor Christopher Plummer. Spike's work on this film showed his versatility. Most of his films are seen as indie's and to think of Spike making an action flick was too absurd, but he pulls it off here so smoothly and we could probably see more like it from him. It was a breath of fresh air after the critically panned She Hate Me, a movie that I somewhat enjoyed but wanted more out of. Inside Man was everything that I expected it to be and more.

The director does a great job of keeping the bank robbers mysterious, and their motives hidden. The criminals in this film are very smart, and use some original and ingenious methods to confuse the police. The movie maintains its atmosphere well. The script, acting, and direction are pretty good, but nothing special. The plot line with Jodie Foster's character seems unnecessary and forced at times, which is a shame as Foster is one of my favorite actresses. This movie owes a lot to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (even directly mentioning Pacino's movie at one point) but never crosses the line between homage and rip-off. With a traditional plot points combined with some unique ideas, Inside Man is a fun and entertaining crime film.I give Inside Man 7/10.

310,fahimay,A brilliant heist!,8,17 August 2016,"The intricate finesse in the enfolding of the events and the portrayal of characters has compelled me to give my comments on this movie. A perfectly planned bank heist is undertaken , right upto the treatment, segregation and attire of the hostages, which a good 45 minutes into the movie draws inexplicable motives and mode of execution.We identify Clive Owen behind his painter's suit and mask as the chief perpetrator of the heist, based on his keen gazes and imposing voice. Denzel Washington fits into his role with a tee (as always) as a resourceful detective seeking to clear his name from a possible wreck to his career. All the techniques he employ as a hostage negotiator, though clichéd and redundant leading to shameless failure, serve to unmask the true agenda of the bank robbers. But the confidence with which he gets back after he fails each attempt, reflected in his self-assured gait makes him worthy of the deserving glory in Hollywood he has.When Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) approaches Madeleine White( Jodie Foster ) to involve herself in the case, we smell a really big rat and can sense things are really not what they seem to be. When the true reason behind the heist is revealed, we digest it without disappointment as we were aware that something big was coming. The interrogation with the hostages after their release interspersed throughout the movie are quite engaging as we wait expectantly for someone to give a clue to the identity of the robbers. The final touch is when the mastermind of the operation, Clive Owen, escapes with his 'real' booty.Settle down in your couch and prepare yourself for an engaging thriller....",Inside Man
311,Miasmakoala,Roger Ebert's review was perfect. Go read it.,6,26 September 2018,"I had to check this film out after I was vastly let down by BlackkKlansman since this was on Netflix.And after a dull start, where the movie seems to introduce way too many side characters, the movie gets going. The point of the film, the bank robbery, is presented very well. I enjoyed all the bits inside the bank, and the interactions with the characters seemed very natural and it was a thrill to follow.Even though the police central command seems to be some kind of tourist attraction with free entry to anyone.And even though the police raiding the bank seem to have no idea how to raid a building after it's been taken over by armed criminals who have disabled the cameras, wired the ransom note with listening devices. The cops just go in there switching lights on and just seemingly irregularly proceed through the bank.And eeeven though all the stuff the robbers hand out, are just casually taken into the command central. Thank god they drove the robbers' truck away, I was expecting them to just casually open the truck doors. This movie has a lot of illogical stuff going on.So then we get to the point in the movie where the bank robbery is over. The payoff is finally revealed, and the rest of the movie happens. I realized that I had literally zero interest in Christopher Plummer or Jodie Foster stuff going on, anything answering the WHY did they rob the bank.Inside Man takes its bloody time to get to the end where everything is revealed, and all the secrets revealed are just dull. All the actors do a very solid work with the film, don't get me wrong. Everyone is very natural and charming in their own way in the movie. Especially masked Clive Owen, he was great.It was still an ok movie, even though the beginning and the end are significantly weaker when compared to the middle section. Especially the end.

I can't find any fault with this film and I've seen it over a dozen times, each time it entertained me. I was and have been an admirer of Spike Lee for many years. But until he made this film, I found his historical epics very formal and straightforward in their presentation.

They take only the contents of SD Box #232, ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president. This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind, or for his henchmen with lesser brains.Jodie Foster, using her political connections with the Mayor of NYC, gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages. She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand, but he ain't interested. So what's his point (if any?).My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (ace detective), and Jodie Foster, crack trouble shooter for high-powered problems.The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, ""Flight Plan"", was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films.Now my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies. I cannot disagree with her on this one ... ""A WASTE OF MONEY, AND A WASTE OF TIME."" Be forewarned. A well crafted film, fine actors, lousy script writing.",Inside Man
314,selenedm999,rawked,9,13 September 2006,"Second only to Tarantino, this is one of the best ""heist"" movies I've ever seen. Forget Clooney's Oceans crew, who are all about ""nudge nudge wink wink we're celebrities,"" and tune in to a movie where you don't know who's who or what's what until the end.Granted, I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington, and it's rare that he makes a misstep, but I'm always torn about Spike Lee. While Lee is inarguably a good filmmaker, his characters are often deliberately unlikeable, which makes an otherwise good movie uncomfortable to watch. While this movie's characters are generally unlikeable, the plot twists and turns more than make up for it. Clive Owen is slick and slimy as the main thief, and Jody Foster in an unusually glam role somehow manages to channel Helen Hunt. Foster is one of the best actresses working today, and has never been a glamourpuss, so to see her flip her ponytail and stalk around on four-inch pumps is surreal. The funniest moment was Clive Owen's interaction with the lone child, who shows him a violent video game, then tells Owen he'd get mad points for robbing the bank. Owen's response ""Eat your lunch, then I'm going to have a talk with your father about this game."" A movie buff's dream, Inside Man is slick, action-packed, and keeps you guessing.

315,TashC,What a sting!,8,18 July 2006,"Rooms full of hysterical hostages, red tape and police wrapped around the block, snipers perched on every windowsill, and an escape route that involves a 747. Can this really be the perfect bank robbery? But this is a bank with a secret. And with all the hostages stripped and redressed in exactly the same clothes as the robbers (minus gun-type accessories), soon it is impossible to tell who the bad guys are. Crack police negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) heads towards the bank declaring ""Bad guys here I come"", only he has to wade through quite a few bad guys on the outside first.The film is called Inside Man, so it is easy to suspect everyone. But those bad robbers are so smart, sensitive and appalled by the violence of video games and the good guys are so honest, hard working and dashing. We are seduced into liking them both and cannot take sides. Fortunately, there is Madeline White (Jodie Foster), who makes a very good living as ""an expeditor"", ie pay her enough money and she can fix anything. She is a right nasty piece of work - totally amoral and smug about it. Phew, we cannot like her! The uncomfortably slow siege of the bank does stretch our patience and belief that this will end perfectly. Then in an unpredictable twist, the good guys gain control, the bad guys completely lose it, and everyone else is suitably incompetent. But who are the bad guys again? No extras on the DVD.",Inside Man
316,JoeJames76,Best Movie of 2006,9,24 January 2007,"Any Spike Lee/Denzel Washington collaboration is cause for celebration, as they always seem to bring out the best in each other. This time isn't any different, but what really surprises is how well the rest of the cast carries the film, making Washington almost seem like a bit player. Owen commands the screen as the master criminal matching wits with Washington's hostage negotiator. Foster is suave and smooth in a way Washington normally is, and Plummer has a quiet reserve and vulnerability that has made some of Washingtion's characters truly memorable.It's great to see Spike removed from the political expectations that so many of his films convey, though this film does tackle a few race issues amongst the intrigue. In fact, Spike's casting prowess allows the film to be populated by a number of ethnic minorities, giving the film some added realism and tension, two elements this film has in spades.The premise is simple, as Owen and friends enter a bank and proceed to take customers and staff hostage while the police waits outside. Owing a lot to Dog Day Afternoon (which is a good thing--that's one of my all time favourite films), this bank robbery gone bad is gripping and will leave you guessing right until the last frame. Spike crams each frame with intensity and the actors are more than game.In typical Spike fashion, there are several layers to the film and the characters' motives are equally complex. He knows when to stylize the action and when to leave it raw. He pays just as much attention to dialogue heavy exchanges as he does to gunplay and smoke bombs. The result is a formulaic hostage film played out to perfection, with just enough twist and turns that everything feels fresh, exciting, and intense.Inside Man is perhaps one of the best rentals of the year, and I eagerly await Spike and Denzel's next collaboration. This one is definitely for film fans and casual movie goers alike. I don't want to say too much in fear of giving anything away, but you won't be able to tear yourself away from this film.Grade: A",Inside Man
317,anchorman360,What An Awesome Movie,10,21 December 2006,This was a very good cops/robbers movie. It was very unpredictable which in my opinion is awesome and made the movie more exciting. Denzel Washington is awesome as the cop who deals with the situation. Clive Owen plays the leader of the group of the robbers. This movie was definitely not the usual cop stops bad guy movie which is nice. During the movie Washington and his partner talk with the hostages from the bank which I hadn't seen before. I loved the ending when Owen walks by Washington and slips the diamond into his pocket and he doesn't even know it. I was surprised when it was revealed that the robbers used toy guns the whole time. I must say this has to be my favorite Denzel Washington of all the ones I've seen. A very entertaining and unpredictable movie that you should see.,Inside Man
318,tomligon,"A great New York film, a thriller with NYC ironic humor!",10,15 July 2007,"Reading the mixed reviews posted here I wonder if you have to possess that special brand of irony with which New Yorkers are imbued, a sense of humor in the face of disaster or the threat of it anyway, if you're going to 'get' this movie. Spike Lee and his phenomenal cast (besides the incomparable Denzel, Clive, Jodie and Chris, there's a rich gathering of NY character actors and 'real people') deliver the tragi-comic nuances of an adventure where perception is continually being altered by circumstances that look one way while the full dimensions of the actual reality hide in plain sight until the very end. The dialogue is as savvy and witty as I've heard in a long time. I think a really big clue to appreciating this film is the understanding that everyone, no matter what their pay grade (Foster refers to Washington's as a means of putting him in his place--she changes her view completely by film's end), takes actions according to their perceptions and everyone therefore can fail to see what is directly in front of them. Everyone makes what in movie plot terms are stupid mistakes, but what in real life terms are manifestations of a tragic flaw in consciousness. And people can wise up sometimes, as some do in this film.I recently watched the film again, and what fun it was to see the set-ups realizing exactly what they meant. Or at least I had a better idea! Great film, don't miss it.Followup on this comment:I should also have mentioned Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe, also outstanding.",Inside Man

I know he's a superb actor, since he plays the greatest villain of all time in Serenity, but now he's just a ""yes, sir, good idea boss"" character. Denzel Washington plays the standard competent cop with integrity, and Clive Owen plays the standard brilliant icy-cold mastermind.

I particularly enjoyed how the film unfolded and that we're never really sure whose side to be on.Denzel Washington's cop under a cloud is the obvious choice at first but its hard to resist the compelling anti-hero in Clive Owen, who at last has a role he can sink his teeth into (he sucked in ""King Arthur"" but then so did the film).Once underway, we're introduced to Jodie Foster's well-connected ""bitch-manipulator"" and Christopher Plummer's ""fat-cat"" characters who add extra spice into the mix. The script is generally excellent and the story resolves well, treating our heroes and anti-heroes appropriately.Overall, a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable film!",Inside Man
321,tingnting,Wait for it on DVD,6,28 September 2006,"I was disappointed with this film because I expected great things from the incredible cast list. This movie is extremely slow-paced and won't keep you on the edge of your seat.A bank robbery turns out to be more than just a bank robbery. It's apparent right from the beginning that there is another motive for the bank to be hit other than money. The director uses too many clues to hint to you that things are not what they seem, eventually making the predictable twist even weaker than expected.Considering that there are 3 Oscar winners in the movie, the performances are not very memorable. Denzel's lines are not strong enough and his character lacks charisma. Jodie Foster steals the show with only a few minutes of screen time and Christopher Plumber is a pleasure to watch but doesn't have enough screen time to make it a strong performance.As for the main actor, Clive Owen, his character is so boring I almost fell asleep...and my friends actually did.This movie is being compared to Dog-day Afternoon, but Owen is no Pacino.Wait for it on DVD.

But the actors seemed uninspired, just going through the motions. Personally, I think Denzel turned in a better cop portrayal in ""Fallen."" The interwoven, high contrast interrogation scenes from afterwords were distracting, and got old fast. Also it seemed like the movie was dragged out, as if you were not only supposed to know that the hostage situation was taking a long time, but you were also supposed to experience it.With the exception of Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor, all the big name actors seemed to only have cameos. I realize this wasn't so, but it seemed that way. And what was the purpose of Jodi Foster's character?

323,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Inside Man""",7,30 July 2006,"This is probably the first Spike Lee movie I have ever seen and I must say this was a very good and very tasteful movie. Denzel Washington. Clive Owen. Jodie Foster. Spike Lee. What a combination. A great story. A great twist. A great crime. The story is simple, yet it's not. The story is like this: ""Hello, my name is Dalton Russel, pay strict attention to what I am saying because I chose my words very carefully, and I never repeat myself..."", That is what crime specialist Dalton Russel (Owen) says after he plans to rob one of the most high security banks in NYC and walk right out the front door. Dalton and his crew go into the bank disguised as painters and hold up the place. That is where the story begins. Hostage Negoitiater Keith Fraizer(Washington) is called in to try to save some of the hostages. Meanwhile Madeline White (Foster) has been blackmailing the owner of the bank Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Meanwhile the police are circling the bank and no one will escape. Denzal Washington is main person in this movie and he carries it very well. The other leading man, Clive Owen, also carries the movie perfectly as the villain, Dalton Russel. The movie overall is very good and has many good twists. Pay close attention or you may miss the point.3 out of 4 stars",Inside Man

325,solanki17,Lee in Fine form along with Denzel & Co,8,29 March 2006,"Spike Lee & Denzel Washington these two movie heavy weights have collaborated on numerous occasions (4 to be precise), the most powerful being Malcom X. Having loved that I had high hopes for this movie, and thankfully I was not in the slightest disappointed. In fact I'd even go as far as saying the movie exceeded my expectations. It has a fantastic cast, one of the strongest the director has ever had at his disposal. With the likes of Denzel, Jodie Foster & Willem Defoe plus Clive Owen its quite an achievement for the director to get such powerful performances from each of these actors.Denzel plays the role of Detective Keith Frazer who is in charge of negotiating with Bank robbers lead by Clive Owen who have laid siege to a Manhattan Bank. The film follows the complex mind of a criminal in Owen and the thinking behind our heroes motives to save the day (Washington). There is some clever screenplay where the audience is shown flash forwards in the Movie of the 2 detectives interviewing each of the bank hostages. This also means the audience always know the outcome of the movie form the start, but the way Spike Lee uses this to his advantage is pure genius. He keeps enough twists in the story, always predictable but delightfully impressionable upon the overall storyline. The characters are all interwoven in a great storyline, Jodie Foster plays cold as ice bitch hired by the bank owner, who will do anything for her pay cheque and to satisfy her employers. Never being much of a fan of Miss Foster I was very surprised at her performance, but this could largely be contributed to the superb script & narrative handed to her.The film, mind you, does have a few floors. The pointless background to Denzel's character (girlfriend, relationship issues & brother in law problems) does not really add to much and could have been toned down. But the story is also peppered with light hearted comedy moments, especially when New York's finest are asked to solve a simple riddle which they do, but still end up arguing about it !! You'd expect any film by Spike Lee to touch on some racial issues, and he doesn't disappoint his fans including some post 9/11 and sexist undertones. The scene with the Sikh Hostage a highlight of this. He also manages to make New York which we have seen in many movies over time seem different every time you see it through the camera lens. Much how Michael Mann uses LA as his homage, Lee will always credit the Big Apple as his background. The film looks beautiful and plays even better.I maybe biased as Spike Lee is one of my favourite directors of all time, but with an ensemble cast of actors, some of whom I ain't even a fan of (Foster), this movie really does a great job of executing a fine script originally intended for Ron Howard (of Apollo 13 fame) to direct. We can only thank god that never happened !! GO SEE IT",Inside Man

Unlike MI, however, the many fast-paced plot twists and turns make sense. There are pauses for social lessons as Spike Lee can deliver them. The cinematographer takes our eyes on an architecture tour of exteriors and interiors. Denzel Washington is superb as a underpaid, middle-level detective with enough sense to know that he is being conned all the way around, by his city as well as the ""perps."" Clive Owen is fascinating as the cool and cerebral mastermind. Memorable performances by Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer, too, as steely cool aristocrats. The plot structure is made more complex with flash-forwards, but they can be followed. We never find out how this plot came to be hatched, but we can surmise when we discover all the conspirators.

The slick music, script, and actors. I am endlessly entertained by such films, and happily they are produced each year. This is one of the better if not the best heist flick I have seen in recent years.Acting: 8/10This has an A-list cast containing Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe, and the over-rated Jodie Foster. Denzel gives an entertaining performance as the alpha male of the police, serving as detective and negotiator for the violent group. Willem Dafoe gives a fine performance, though his character is not quite worthy of such an actor. Jodie Foster does OK, but I don't think she is worthy of million dollar paychecks and her Oscar. In comes Clive Owen as my favorite performer/performance in the film, giving a slick and too cool for school performance as Dalton Russell. Owen gives one of the better performances of the year so far. Writing: 10/10A plot with twists, a story with turns, cool dialog and often times frightening suspense keep you entertaining and wondering what will come out from around the corner. And usually it is a new twist that will excite any movie buff.Directing: 10/10 Just as slick as the script, Lee pumps plenty of soul, cool tricks with camera and sound, making the images on screen entrancing. Special effects: N/ANo CGI, no makeup. Simply a film made of suspense, not of eye candy. Cinematography: 10/10THE best camera work I have seen this year, mixing fun tricks with hand held movement, it keeps you hooked into the action as if there in the crowd.

It was like a classic old movie with a modern look and feel to it. And yes it is fantasy, and thats why it is a movie and not real life. And one should go in and just relax and let oneself be in the movie. If I had to find negatives: 1) Jodie Foster is too obviously trying to say: ""I have aged but I am still sexy"" ... That felt a little needy. 2) Denzel Washington: We all like him. But is he acting? or is this himself. He appears exactly as he always does: Confident, on top of things and always keeping a good sense of humor.

330,krigler,an entertaining heist flick,8,3 March 2006,"Note: I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. ""Inside Man"" starts out as a no holds barred, high octane action-thriller, and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy, tongue-in-cheek heist movie, reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little over-plotted, but that comes with the genre - the expected twists and turns are all here, thankfully mostly in non-expected ways. Contrivances abound, and we don't really learn the background of the heist (ie. how the robbers learned about their target) but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization - save for Denzel Washington's ambitious policeman hero, who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""Serenity"" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay, most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind, although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I'd say this film is harmless fun, not your usual Spike Lee fare, which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the back-story at some heavy issues of the past, but it's nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flash-forward scenes, hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It's used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie, it is never boring for a moment, what's more, I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax, I was wishing it would go on.

334,GWilliamLocke,Lee Finds Another Way to Prove His Brilliance,8,23 July 2010,"Inside Man features an incredible cast, a great - but not perfect - crime thriller script, amazing cinematography and a World Class director named Spike Lee. On paper it's a great film. If you see clips of some of the should-be classic scenes, you'd think this was one for the ages. It's not. There are just too many problems. Problems, sadly, that could've easily been avoided.That said, Inside Man is a pretty good film. Not the classic it should've been, but a solid film that appeals to both the cinephile set and the everyday popcorn movie goer. Lee, who didn't write the script and only casually adds his signature fingerprints, here comes off as a real movie maker, Inside Man maybe being the movie we'll look back on as proof of his ability. Where fellow auteur types of his generation such as Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino seem unable to make anything other than signature films, Lee has done much for his legacy by proving that he can skillfully - and successfully - make someone else's movie.And damn if Inside Man - which stars heavyweights Denzel Washington and Clive Owen (as well as a great supporting cast and the unnecessary presence of Jodie Foster) - isn't the by-far most commercially successful film of Lee's career, bringing in almost $200 million at theaters worldwide. To put that into perspective, Lee's films average $20 million. The concept of an auteur stepping away from his usual style to make a Hollywood picture, and then that film making 10 times more than the average of his other films, would be a great topic for a paper. Hell, it'd be a great idea for a topics course at a film school. I'd say that it's a shame, but, for what it is (an instantly entertaining bid dollar film whose only real creative touch is a small storytelling device), it's about as good as they come.Now, how about those above mentioned problems. The usage of music, for starters, is embarrassingly unfitting and bad. Just plain bad taste. Also, Denzel's lead is a bit too clichéd of a character. They made lots of good movies anchored by characters so obvious in 40s, 50s and 60s, but not much since. Needless to say, Denzel's Detective Keith Frazier is a snore despite the actor's every effort to bring him to life. Another major problem is the Jodie Foster character, who is just downright out of place and almost unnecessary. We know why she's there, and it makes sense, but I get the feeling that some of the scenes that would've held her storyline together were cut or written out. Her presence will likely leave you scratching your head. And last but not least we have that story telling device we mentioned above, which is best described as a ""In Medias Res"" style, with Owen's character teasing us from the first frame and interrogation scenes edited here and there. It's not a bad device  it just doesn't work nearly as well as the writer, director, producers and cast probably thought it would when they were in production. Sometimes that happens in movies. Often, especially when you attempt something as ambitious as In Medias Res.Inside Man does succeed, however, thanks to how well its made (especially the non linear editing, which is almost next-to-none), how nicely Lee injects style points here and there, and how downright memorable and well executed a handful of scenes are. But what, you ask, is the movie really about? Well, it's a heist movie. It's about some people robbing a bank and a very paranoid man who really doesn't want something he has stored in a safe deposit box to be uncovered. It's about a detective's last case before retiring and it's about a brilliant criminal. I don't want to say too much more, due to how the story is told and how easy it can be to kill the fun of a heist film by trying to describe the action. To me, Inside Man is about its director. It's about Spike Lee, who uses the film to remind us that he's one of the very best of his time.",Inside Man

336,TheFluffyKnight,The perfect heist. But the perfect heist movie?,7,19 October 2006,"I've read a few reviews and general opinions on Inside Man, and it would appear that most people don't get the film, or at least they don't get it the way I did. The general consensus seems to be that Spike Lee has crafted an entertaining but flawed heist movie. But to me, that's all wrong. Spike Lee, to my eyes, has thrown the usual concept of building up detailed backgrounds on both the cops and the robbers, and instead has written an essay on the perfect bank robbery.The movie opens with Clive Owen's Dalton Russell giving a soliloquy from what appears to be a very small room. But as we find out, ""there is a vast difference from being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison."" This monologue turns out to be the key to the whole film. Russell tells us that he has, in the events about to fold out on screen, planned and executed the perfect bank robbery. Why? Because he can. ""And therein, as the bard tells us, lies the rub."" The rest of the film follows both Russell and hostage negotiator Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) as they play in a battle of wits, where the prize is, seemingly, the lives of the hostages. Other characters come into the fray: Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), the bank owner who's past (most people would have you believe) is integral to the heist; John Darius (Willem Dafoe), in an understated role as the officer in charge of proceedings; and Madeline White (Jodie Foster), an enigmatic business woman who's role is never explained, and doesn't need to be. The robbery itself includes such eccentricities as dressing up all the hostages in the exact same outfits the robbers are wearing (making the planning of a raid later on in the film rather difficult for the police) and broadcasting an Albanian president's public address when the police try to bug the bank.But all these little details do is disguise the robbery's true purpose: to be the perfect bank robbery. This fact was most evident, for me, in the film's music (by Terence Blanchard). Most of the time it's reminiscent of a Seventies' cop show, orchestral mixed with guitar riffs. But there are times when the music will swell, and the audience is confused as to what the meaning of this is. To my ears, it all became clear when we are shown a shot of Owen standing in the door of one of the bank's vaults. The music swells to almost epic proportions, and we are unconsciously told that there is something more than money going on.I won't go any further into the inner workings of the film, for fear of spoiling it for you. Safe to say that there are a few more surprises other than the ones listed above, and Spike Lee, it would seem, couldn't help sliding in some social commentary; at one point a Sikh argues with police that he is not an Arab, after they remove his turban for ""safety"".The film, of course, is not without its flaws. The ending is a little too drawn out, as it tries to wrap up story arcs that could have been left loose and still given the film a satisfying conclusion.

I mean, how would case be made against this banker just based on a ring. Flawless interpretation made by Christopher Plumber an Judy Foster, they're both amazing. Regarding Denzel Washintong, I think that his character, in my view, was very expected. I would love to see him in other type of characters.",Inside Man
338,El Gato-4,Intelligent thrills,8,22 March 2006,"A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble: Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However, don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film. He brings a re-invigorating approach to what, in other hands, would be a tiresome rehash. That liveliness seems to have worked on him, too -- this is his best film in several years.",Inside Man

The grip of movie is so good that you won't even leave the theater for the intermission or bathroom break.I am a big fan of Mr. Denzel Washington and have seen some of his brilliant performances and this one in the movie ""Inside Man"" is also one of them. He always manages to impress me.I haven't seen much of Jodie Foster but can surely say that this movie doesn't absorb her talent or can say not properly used. But i liked that she did good job in that not so appropriate length of character.Clive Owen either is one of the star performer of this movie about whom i haven't heard much but with this performance i can tell that i'm not forgetting him for long time.I have seen some of the movie related to this ""bank robbery"" genre but this is one of the unique one and can be casted as also the best of them.Telling about the plot without disclosing it is not possible.So i would like you people to watch this movie and i can assure you that this is one movie you'll surely like.",Inside Man
340,gregory-anderson-2,Fun?,6,17 April 2006,"Spike Lee clearly had fun making this film. More fun than I had watching it. Still, that is a testament to how much he enjoyed making it, because Inside Man, for the most part, is playful entertainment.To see Washington and Owen battle wits is to see an uncomfortable nemesis. Rather than a gritty, wordsmith negotiator, Washington is a second-hand Shaft with the uniform of a pool shark.Lee spikes the characters with his customary colour-conscious commentary  understandable ,though, and effective. Morality elsewhere in the film, however, is playfully dubious. And seeing as the premise of the film shows hinges itself upon the inequity of ill-gotten gains, the ending usurps itself.I ask myself, why write spoilers for a comment? But I must say this. One man happily possesses traceable Nazi treasure - after being illegitimately promoted to First Grade Detective Inspector - and a man who has dedicated his life to benefiting society is to be socially annihilated for the same action. Clearly not a morality play, this film should be watched in the background to something else.",Inside Man
341,hobbes3,Almost perfect caper film,9,18 August 2006,"Well written, well acted (not to mention well cast) film about the perfect bank robbery. The dialog crackles and Denzel Washington's characteristic intelligence and intensity is evenly matched to that of both Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. Once you've seen it, you'll want to see it again to find out why you never saw the end coming! I was hooked from the opening scenes and for most of the film I believed the title had a different meaning than it turned out to have. This is Spike Lee's most mainstream film and is also one of his best. Highly recommended. For those who enjoyed this film but are unfamiliar with Clive Owen's work, I also recommend ""Croupier.""",Inside Man

We know it, but the police hadn't seen this movie at the time... The robbers kept the hostages in separate rooms and shifted them around leaving plenty of opportunities for them 2 switch roles from robber to hostage, therefore all the customers and bank staff on the pre-robbery video cannot be safely eliminated...plus however many people may have come into the bank in the period between the cameras being disabled and the doors being locked. Painters' overalls are baggy enough to hide most people's physical differences so the elimination of suspects on such a basis is far from full-proof.The robbers didn't commit any outright crimes. They feigned two beatings to further integrate two of their number with the hostages. Kidnapping without ransom demands or an assault becomes illegal detention. The fact that the matter was allowed to slide by a ratings conscious Police Captain pressured by people able to have corruption charges dropped against one of his detectives and exert influence on his own career is credible to this viewer.Questions which we didn't see asked such as who was reported missing, how people got to the bank, did they have an account there? etc...have too many variables and are questions that people engaged in such meticulous planning necessary to pull this type of robbery off should be prepared for. Is it credible that a policeman would steal, as Denzel's Detective character does? Life and history point to the affirmative, but because it's Denzel he didn't really steal the jewel, it was dropped into his pocket by a thief and belonged to a war criminal...fair cop?",Inside Man

Not this time. Thankfully, the story in Inside Man is a plain, simple and neatly executed heist film.Yes, there are some political overtones but when the story is rolling, it's that much easier to buy the political side of it. This is the best Spike Lee joint in a while.The jury's still out on Clive Owen - can't make out if he's a good actor or not. Jodie Foster was under-utilized. Denzel was irritatingly over-playing everything in sight (why did they give him an Oscar?). I would've picked Jamie Foxx over him for this role ANY day.

I have never seen any of Spike Lee's previous films, but I am familiar with his earlier work. This film is very mainstream. One thing that amazed me was the dialog. It seemed very natural, like I was eavesdropping on real conversations, especially in the interrogation room. The film can be confusing as the audience, like the film characters, are trying to piece together what is going on. I thoroughly enjoyed Denzel Washington's performance. I also found Terence Blanchard's musical score very riveting.I did not like Jodi Foster's character, but I do not think her character was suppose to be likable. She plays a woman who knows how to get what she wants, and her services are in high demand. Not a big role, but memorable.",Inside Man

The ""minor "" roles all pulled out the stops, not to be missed, and don't walk out until you see the credits run , a twist in the last minute keeps you involved. Possibly Owens best screen turnout to date and the two cops have some great lines in humour and put down. Plummer does well and the almost film noire lighting of some stages of the movie are excellent and well chosen.

The accents are close to awful (Clive Owen...wow!!)
The music does not fit the imagery and feels wrong
It's a fantastical story made to look like real lifeBUT - There is a cool and interesting plot to be enjoyed. You just have to hang in there and know that it does improve...it just takes 30 minutes or so to really kick in...Silly...yes...but entertaining and certainly deserves some respect for the clever(ish) plot.NOTE: Why some people feel inclined to highlight how great an actor Clive Owen is in this I do not know. Definitely one of his WORST acts I have seen. Clive Owen has a terrible accent and has no weight or presence for the role he plays! Jodie Foster is annoying and is not explained well enough to deserve any respect. Denzel Washington was good though...nowhere near a realistic portrayal but still, he kept the movie going!",Inside Man
347,pwteatros,It never comes together,5,1 May 2006,"This movie never comes together. I think the problem with this movie is that the story is actually very basic, very tight and very logical. There are no great surprises or smart comments or shocking discoveries. It is about a guy who has watched previous heist movies and is now doing one himself. Period. But the movie is directed as if the whole thing was bigger than that, with these angles and shots making you feel that you are about to be dazzled by what you are about to see. But no, it is an intimate, small, cute entertaining movie. Yes, it was a delight to see Jodie Foster play the beautiful manipulating minx, but most anyone in Hollywood could have played that role. Denzel's sidekick is a very well known actor in the UK and was vastly underutilized in this film. Mr Washington was playing the same character he has played in the past what 5 films? In my humble opinion, it was boring to watch him do the same thing. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Inside Man

Third, the line between the good and bad is very faint and do not expect to see good guys and bad guys clearly marked. Things are shown like in real life. Nothing is where one might expect it to be...or maybe is exactly there. It depends.
Finally, the cast is very good, the actors play very well and the director is a master. All this added makes for an excellent movie to see on a Saturday night.

I waited for 4 long months for this, and I thought that maybe my expectations would be too high. Turns out, my expectations were not high enough because the film was amazing and brilliant.Plot: Just when you think you got it all figured out, you don't. ANd then when you REALLY think you got it all figured out, you realize that you REALLY don't. In fact, once the ending credits come, you still probably don't know what just happened. Its simplistic at times. Its complex. Its confusing. Its brilliant.Acting: Well, the marketing for this film relied heavy on star power. You know why people go to see films with certain actors? Because those actors are DAMN GOOD actors. And none of the actors disappointed here. Dafoe and Foster did as expected, and Washington and Owen continue to amaze me. Owen steals the show(as he usually does).Directing: This movie is just another statement showing that Spike Lee is indeed one of the best directors alive today. Once I heard ""Chal Chaiyya Chaiyya"" come on in the opening credits, I knew that Spkie was going to give me something special. Everything...is just so beautiful. That's all I can say.The only weak point for this is that it starts to drag at the end and there are a occaionsal plot holes but they are REALLY small. But other than that, this is probably the best heist film since Dog Day Afternoon(which ironically is mentioned in the film).9/10.

As in, how did Clive Owen's character know about the bank founder being involved with the Nazis? The whole purpose (it seems) of Jodie Foster's character was to indicate how secretive this information was.. so how did Clive have access to it? How come the guy who played the mayor swore like a 5 year old child knowing he was going to get in trouble for it later? (horrible scene that one he calls her the C-word). I had ""where's my fast forward button"" on this more than 5 times which means the pacing was really off - Chaiya Chaiya got me all pumped but then for some reason because of the obvious ties to India, I kept expecting the security guard with the turban to have some pivotal brain child of the whole thing revelation? Nope. Just a killer song in the wrong movie. The rest of the score was like... I can't even remember it. If you ask me a week from now about this film, I'll start singing that awesome song but the plot was BLAH.

353,zephyr24-1,Perfect insight,9,7 April 2006,"Spike Lee's Inside Man may seem like just another cop and robber story until you see the story unravel on screen. Robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) has planned a perfect heist that has put career cop Keith Frazier in a fix. Amidst intense negotiation between the two, power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) enters the picture proving herself to be a better negotiator than Fraizer. But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex. As the story unfolds, each turn becomes more unpredictable.Clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity. Displaying a level of cool collectedness, Owen was convincing as the potentially violent criminal with a broader agenda in mind. Denzel Washington turns in an equally sublime performance playing the detective who's trying to serve justice while battling investigation for corruption. Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.Jodie Foster's Medeline White may just play a supporting role but it's no doubt that the actress can handle any role with aplomb. Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.Spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non-stop action and suspense. It cleverly plays out and eventually leaves the audience dazzled and in awe. (A)",Inside Man
354,mlouns,"Above average heist movie, but flawed",6,15 October 2008,"Inside Man tries hard to be a smart, thinking man's heist movie. It does contain some clever ideas, but it has enough flaws that it does not leave you completely satisfied on further reflection, the way a truly brilliant bank robbery film would.Much of the plot centers on a cat and mouse game between Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Dalton Russell (Clive Owen). Russell conceives of a brilliant bank job that he believes will succeed. Early in the film he takes hostages, and Frazier is called on to free them and to nab Russell and his accomplices. Meanwhile, there are other things going on outside the bank that Russell is not aware of, which is where Jodie Foster's character comes in.A lot of the tricks in the robbery (slowly revealed over the course of the film) are indeed brilliant, if perhaps all are not entirely plausible in real life.The letdown comes from the non-criminals. First, Frazier repeatedly acts in ways that seem quite hard to believe from a trained hostage negotiator. His first verbal exchange with Russell is not at all the measured way of establishing rapport that you would expect. At times Frazier shows flashes of brilliance, but equally often he ends up looking like he is out of his depth, needlessly gambling with the lives of dozens of people for no real gain.Jodie Foster makes a brave effort, but her character is just not very believable. Due to the fairly cheesy lines and situations she is involved with, she ends up looking more like a plot device than an actual person.In the end, the film is certainly no turkey, but there are better caper films out there with better scripts.",Inside Man
355,katrowellpa,Inside Disappointment,5,9 April 2007,"I am a big Spike Lee fan, and I will be the first to tell you to skip this movie. From the moment it started, I was just totally not drawn into the plot at all--I couldn't even really figure out what the plot was. The actors in the movie are great, but they were all wasted in their roles--Willem Dafoe was wasted as a cop and Jodie Foster was certainly wasted in her tiny little role. Denzel Washington could not even pull off his character, whatever it was supposed to be, the hat-wearing, cool as a cucumber detective. There were a few references to Denzel's character's girlfriend and the issue of whether or not he would get married again, but I didn't care, because there was no real character development in this movie. The plot was incomprehensible and boring. It was really a self-indulgent movie that went absolutely nowhere. I am not even really sure why I bothered to watch until the very end--I think I kept holding out hope that there would be some big revelation at the end or some justification for watching/making the movie, but there never was. Let me also say that the actual plot of why the bank robbery occurred was really stupid and disappointing.

In short, it was delightful.The plot is paper-thin - I mean really, you can figure out the ending easily halfway through, if not much earlier. But that really doesn't matter since it's simply a medium for this incredible cast to exercise their acting chops under Spike's lighthearted hand.Everyone looks like they're having a blast in this movie, including Spike Lee who, from the very first shot of Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller coaster, paints a loving picture of his home town. Denzel and Owen are both in fine form, reveling in every line of their little cat-and-mouse game, Christopher Plummer looks every bit as dashing as he did in the ""Sound of Music,"" and Jodie Foster, having grown even more beautiful with age, is positively magnetic playing an icy cold woman of influence.Go see this movie now, or at least be sure to rent it when it comes out. While you may find yourself wishing the plot had a bit more meat on it's bones, you'll certainly savor every line this cast lavishes over your plate. Mmmm...dialogue",Inside Man
357,ninjathesecond,Made no sense.,5,4 June 2006,"This rough story just had nothing to it. First, in walked Denzel, with an ego so big, I was surprised his head fitted through the door. He mostly played the part of a hostage negotiator, even though he wasn't a hostage negotiator-if that makes any sense.Not far behind was Jodie Foster, who looked seriously wasted. Like she had a big-time drug problem, or was totally anorexic, or whatever it is that the Hollywood elite get up to. She was probably brought in to help break up the story into bite-sized chunks, or scene switching, as it is known. But her role was so flimsy, you could have cut her out of the story all together and it would have made no difference.The story itself revolved around a gang of bank robbers, who raided a bank, but stole nothing?? Apparently, this was done to draw the police's attention to a safety deposit box, which held evidence linking the bank's boss to Nazi dealings, during the second world war. What the exact nature of the dealings were, was never revealed. The bank robbers must have been very righteous and honourable people, risking a lifetime of imprisonment simply to get the truth out. Why they couldn't have gone to the police, got a search warrant, and disclosed everything, is beyond me. Instead, they beat, humiliated and stripped the hostages, who amounted to nothing more than innocent civilians, and probably traumatised them for life. It is difficult to build sympathy with the public, no matter how righteous your cause, by degrading helpless captives like this. I fully agree that Nazi collaborators should be exposed and punished, but victimising the most vulnerable people in our society, namely the old, and children. Yes, a young child was also in there, is difficult to swallow. It did not seem to fit in with the honourable intent of the bank robbers, to tie, drag and traumatise these people. Overall, not a bad movie. Could have been better with more thought.",Inside Man

You agree to a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" when you go to a movie, but still within it's own rules the film must have some kind of logic. I certainly couldn't accept that this robbery could take place or for the reasons way Spike Lee would have us belief it did. I was looking at my watch a good half-hour before the show ended. The acting ranged from unexceptional to awful and the cinematography was much the same. Some of the lines in this movie actually made me cringe. Jodie Foster's role was arbitrary and pointless.

If the mayor and the bank president and the discrete Jodi Foster character are all 'compromised' then it should okay for bank robbers to be our heroes. And when they remember to give the good, honest cop a big diamond for his wedding ring, we can almost swoon. For here is this movie's answer to the world's problems: We can have fun and use our intelligence to make movies that even corrupt bank presidents and corrupt mayors will like. Okay, well, we can't base an entire economic system on it. But it had us charmed. And in the end, we don't quite have enough good news lately.

360,gala0008,Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat,10,9 April 2006,"Seeing the previews for ""Inside Man"" I knew it would be a thinking man's movie. Watching Dalton Russell hold up the bank, one is never entirely sure of the motive behind the robbery. Watching Detective Keith Frazier handle the situation leaves the viewer to think ""What would I do in that situation?"" Watching Arthur Case pine over his situation leaves one to wonder what his big secret is.Many may claim the story is simple beyond explanation but I feel they're the people that don't wish to admit something so simple was concealed so cleverly. Granted questions were left unanswered, such as why Russell wanted to expose Arthur Case's secret or how he found out about it in the first place. But one must not overlook the fact that not all questions are answered in complicated situations like these. Case never learned why Russell was looking to blackmail him (other than the possibility of monetary gain) and maybe we weren't meant to either.The only real problems I have with the movie is that Jodie Foster's character can get a little annoying at times (being a smart alack in most of her on screen time) and it was a little confusing at first when they kept jumping from the action to the post-heist interviews. Regardless of the flaws, however, this is still a movie well worth watching and gripping till the end.

361,juvenalxx,Superb filmmaker,8,15 August 2006,"""Inside Man"" proves that Spike Lee doesn't need controversy to be a superb filmmaker. He takes a tight, twisty, genre screenplay and gives it at once a weight and a lightness that shows him to be a consummate storyteller. He brings an attention to detail, a focus and a knowledge of film convention tinged with both reverence and a sense of humor that he puts into service of the story to great effect. The film reeks of the joy of storytelling.He has the benefit of an A-List cast -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer -- that not for a moment seem to be slumming in a ""heist movie"". They exude a love of acting without a trace of self indulgence.The film does lose pace after the release of the hostages, but that is in some ways inescapable, given the plotting (which I don't go into because playing along with the puzzle is one of the joys of the film).The negative criticism of this movie seems to me to miss the point of what the movie is: a game that draws the viewer in, not through violence, although there is some, but through the threat of violence.In earlier films, Lee showed his skill at the display of technique; here he proves equally adept at hiding it.",Inside Man

The twist in this movie is one I haven't seen before, and drew me in to watch it when I was temped to let it go for better things to do.Owen's performance was the highlight. I thought Denzel was good (his usual), but Foster's performance was a little uncomfortable, moreso to some of the horrible lines she had to deliver.

However, last is also misleading because all three were very good movies. Inside Man was directed by Spike Lee. Prior to seeing Inside Man let me give you a list of all the Spike Lee movies I've ever enjoyed watching: 1. Malcolm X 2. hmmm... ummmm... nevermind. So I didn't really have that high of expectations. However, I have to admit that this movie is extremely well made. It's evident from the beginning of the movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever. While the camera work is great throughout what really makes this movie stand out are the great performances by the two leads. Clive Owen is great as a ""not your everyday bankrobber"" and Washington is wonderful, somehow giving an incredibly fresh performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films.

It even includes a morality play, plus a bit of the obligatory action (to keep the gun-blazing-addicts happy) ... but not too much, thank goodness. The director has the right balance of everything throughout, including the use of some interesting unconventional visual and audio techniques.I normally don't like Denzel as an actor -- he is way too smarmy -- but this movie doesn't need him to be overly serious, and it suits him well.

To make it worse, this film is additionally pushed by Spike Lee & Denzel Washington fanatics.This film has many problems: the script is awful, without any tension or suspense. Denzel plays the same over-the-top super-cop as many of his movies before (I won't watch Denzel movies in the near future). Jodie's character is laughable, she just doesn't add anything to the movie except her name. Chris Plummer has the most notable moments in the movie but he also suffers from the bad script.The music score is unnerving and way to much in most of the scenes.

I'd say, at least, half the movie was blurred and out of focus. For example, when the pictures were laid out on the table, they were 'washed out' so bad you couldn't make out who was in most of them. There were scenes, where the camera was jerking so bad, you couldn't tell who was doing the talking and they were standing (or walking) next to each other.The movie did not waste time 'exploring' everyones personal lives. I like the story. The plot is good. Yes there are 'holes', but considering the crap Hollyweed has been putting out the lest few years, I can live with this. At least it isn't a chick flick - like 'V' for vendetta.This could have been such a good movie. It's to bad it was ruined by a lousy camera crew. This is may main beef with this movie. Even I could have done better than this.Clive Owen - Lead bad guy - played his part well. What can I say about Jodie Foster. She is one of the few women that should not run around in a short dress. Got legs like a man. She didn't seem comfortable playing the part of a sophisticated woman.....no I don't like Jodie Foster. As a woman she sucks. No pun intended.I am giving this movie a low rating, for the lousy job by the camera crew.",Inside Man
367,howard78,One of the worse movies I've seen in recent years. Simple awful.,1,11 August 2006,"Where to begin? Well, the best part of the film is the A.R. Rahman song that plays throughout the introduction and credits. It is simply superb. From there, the movie slides downhill rapidly. The dialog is gratuitously laced with 4 letters words, dull and implausible. Everyone is compelled to be vulgar in this poorly made movie. We have the usual pointing out of post-9/11 bigotry and abuse of 'people of color'. The big-name actors performances are wooden, stilted. ALL of them. And, a few of those big names CAN act. They just are not inspired to do so in this bomb. The direction is mediocre throughout and often poor. It reveals how Spike Lee is a 'made man' in Hollywood who can seemingly do no wrong even while producing pot-boilers such as this. The musical score we are tortured with throughout the film is one of the worst I've heard in any move, anytime. Terence Blanchard hasn't a clue as to how match the score to what's going on during the film. Honestly, this score is embarrassingly bad. My wife asked me how the movie could be released with such trite, canned music. I guessed correctly that the composer must be a friend of Lee's. Really---the musical score is atrocious. I humbly ask Blanchard to watch any episode of Lost Season 1 or Field of Dreams to learn what GREAT music can do to enhance a film. I could go on and on and say more. This film isn't worth watching and it isn't worth writing about. Really. It is THAT bad.",Inside Man
368,Patricia756,"Intelligent, slick, entertaining",7,30 April 2006,"Mr Spike Lee never disappoints perhaps because he isn't in the business of making masterpieces, films to be put high up in the history of cinema; jet he will certainly be remember for the guy that made so many good, real, solid, well directed, recognizably personal, entertaining, moving, engaging films and wasn't rightfully appreciated by the Hollywood establishment. He stays true to himself and even when he is more 'commercial' he does it with cleverness and style. That why I like him and I will keep going to watch his films: he has never missed, not ones and I don't think he ever will, he is much too clever to make a mediocre film.",Inside Man
369,abajoue,Savvy and suspenseful heist flick!,9,30 June 2006,"I am not normally one for cops-and-robbers movies, but the impressive cast of ""Inside Man"" made me decide to give this movie a shot. I am really glad that I did. Spike Lee really shows his penchant for making an impressive heist flick, in addition to his already admirable body of work in other types of films. ""Inside Man"" was a sophisticated, fast-paced and smartly-told heist movie that really did justice to the genre. Denzel Washington played the lead role of the perceptive (if slightly jaded) police-detective Keith Frazier, to understated perfection. Denzel is a natural at this type of role, and it is a pure testament to his incredible acting ability that he manages to make it seem fresh every time. Watching him match wits with Dalton Russell (played ""to a T"" by the perfectly-cast Clive Owen), at every turn kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Owen deftly avoided turning his character into a one-dimensional thug, bringing such nuance to Russell that, by the end of the movie, we didn't want him to get caught just as much as we wanted Frazier to get his man. The rest of the cast only served to further enhance this movie, in particular, the inimitable Christopher Plummer, who brought a sort of iconic quality to the sinister, villainous Arthur Case. As with all movies of this sort, some viewer suspension of disbelief was required, but to belabor those few instances would be mere nit-picking, given the overarching strengths of this movie. ""Inside Man"" gave the viewer a candid look of the inner workings of the minds on both sides of the heist puzzle without resorting to cheap or obvious plot devices, putting this movie a cut above the fray of would-be bank robbery movies. Of course, it would not be a ""Spike Lee joint"" without some sort of socio-political message, which came in the form of the Holocaust sub-plot within the movie. But, rather than making this the main focus (which would have been another type of movie altogether), Lee used the Holocaust undertones to provide some ""back-story"" for the characters (an element which is usually sadly lacking in heist movies), and to raise the stakes of the cat-and-mouse game. ""Inside Man"" easily made its mark as one of the more intelligent, contemporary heist flicks to grace the cineplexes in a long while. If you're a criminal-suspense aficionado, you'll love it; and if you aren't, you will be by the end of this movie! Highly recommended.",Inside Man

371,gcats-1,Dirty secrets of the past should not be kept in bank safety deposit boxes...,8,6 January 2008,"At the outset what appears to be a normal bank robbery is far from the truth. Soon enough the viewer realises that nothing is what it seems. A star studded cast spins a riveting web of intrigue, financial manipulation, greed and political manoeuvring. Spike Lee in directing the film has correctly placed Clive Owen in the centre of this web with his portrayal of the calculating methodical bank robber who is out to take advantage of a wealthy bank owner's secret past. Christopher Plummer perfectly portrays the wealthy bank owner in his pathetic plight to hide his greedy, shameful past and the inevitable revelation of his true greedy nature. As the film progresses Spike Lee brilliantly keeps the viewer immersed in his seat as the web is spun tighter and tighter stifling the bank owner's futile attempts from escaping from his past. Amongst the intrigue Jody Forster adds to the deceit and manipulation beautifully with her high society spin doctor role as she tries to take advantage of the situation whatever it maybe. Denzel Washington, the Detective who has to solve the case, beautifully portrays the cynical cop who with hidden vision unravels the truth for the viewers as he uncovers the truth with his ability to read between the lines. A great and exciting film with all the actors perfectly suited for their roles and excellently complimenting each other perfectly right to the exciting revelations at the end!!",Inside Man
372,Commoner,Entertaining Movie,8,29 July 2007,"I enjoyed the movie. I recorded it and had to go back over the ending a couple of times.Denzel did a good job playing the sleazy detective with a dated pencil mustache.Jody Foster is such a good actor that you wish she had a bigger role. She has all those moves that make her performances seem so real. With just the narrowing of her eyes and firming up her mouth she tells you she's irritated. No loud exclamations, no bulging eyes. Just simple indications.It was pretty obvious why the robbers dressed the hostage in painter's clothing like theirs. Spike, who is a fairly competent director goofed here. He gave away some of the cleverness of the ending. He should have waited to change the hostages clothing until the hostages were let go. I knew too early what was in store with the hostages. Spike Lee forgets about the little nuances and busyness and his movies suffer for it.He needs an assistant to pick up all the little details that make a good movie into a better one.",Inside Man
373,ritzl,At Last!!,8,2 April 2006,"Finally, what I have been looking for in a Spike Lee film. Nuance and texture, coupled with a not so deterministic result.To me, Spike Lee has always announced the result early on in the film, and then filled in the gaps. I am not sure why this happens, but it seems to be the case. Perhaps he has been limited by something. I don't know. I do know that I have always looked for something more than the visual wrap-around of the simple message in his films. This film combines what he has always brought to the table as far as novel/interesting/visual storyline, but adds complexity and acting subtlety to the mix. Great job!! except for the one ""odd"" shot.Original and kept me thinking!8/10 for originality and nuanced direction.",Inside Man

I must admit it is a great work,Inside Man
375,SdwOne,A Cool Bank Heist Thriller with Balls!!!,9,25 March 2006,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good movie and without a doubt, 'Inside Man', fits that bill perfectly.I was half expecting a film in the guise of the Usual Suspects / The Negotiator / Your Usually Run Of The Mill Good Guy Verses Bad Guy Ilk But as the various film synopses indicates, not all is what it seems and the multiple twists and counter-twists to this film, although seen before in other films, still manages to retain a sense of originality.However, one thing this film is really great in and, I suppose, adds to its uniqueness if I can put it like that, is that it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. There are plenty of some truly funny moments in this film, which in no way diminishes the tension that runs throughout. In fact, I would describe this film as a Black Comedy / Crime / Mystery / Thriller Although there is some drama in this film, to me it was perhaps its weakest point.Not that that is necessarily a bad thing. Be prepared for a mixed bag of goodies, in which most if not all aspects are played out well. The characters are well characters aren't really that important in this film save that of Denzel Washington's. He's excellent as the bamboozled detective, always one step behind Clive Owen's cool, calculating and clever 'villain'. But even though you may think this makes him the underdog, it doesn't. Without giving the plot away, rest assured that the good guys win and the 'bad' guys. Well It's best you checked that out for yourself.As for the other main characters, they do well to keep the movie interesting and moving at a good pace. Jodie puts in an effective performance as a shrewd negotiator, Chiwetel Ejiofor complements Denzel's character well, especially in the humour stakes and Dafoe, although underused in my opinion, does his best as a SWAT operative, which to be honest, doesn't really give him much to play with in this low action flick. But to be honest, action and in depth characterization isn't the main focus of this film. Not that it needs it mind. It's cool, funny, entertaining and does exactly what it says on the tin.As I mentioned earlier with regards to humour, Spike is using some of that dark humour that runs through this film to make his political points. Of course, latent issues of racism are addressed, but don't worry, they're not rammed down your throats and the fact that he's using comedy to, as it were, sweeten the pill, you'll be entertained at least if not informed. Without going into details, be prepared to witness a surreal, bloody hilarious but highly poignant outlook on ultra violent video games and the effect it has on young minds and of course, the post 9-11 sense of paranoia currently in America that seems to indicate that all people from HUGE swaths of the Asian continent, are somehow bomb-wielding suicidal Arabs.Actually, just like is darker, more excessive film 'Bamboozled', Spike seems to be using humour more frequently to make his political points, poke fun at his ultra right-wing bigoted enemies, whilst giving his liberal allies a right laugh. And based on the seeming success of this film, lets hope that this continues.Well done Spike. This film, if nothing else, should at least silence the critics that accuse you of only making films that are serious and / or deal with racial issues Actually Spike, you did make a film which tentatively dealt with some of those issues You just did it in a thoroughly entertaining way BRAVO!!! Thoroughly Entertaining 9 / 10.",Inside Man
376,CapRising,"Great Style, Zero Substance!",4,7 January 2007,"If not for Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Spike Lee and the soundtrack, this one would have gotten a much lower rating from me.No need to worry about spoilers. In order to put in a spoiler, you have to know the ""surprise ending"" of the movie. This one had a surprise ending, I ... think ... but you can turn me upside down and shake me and still get no intelligent guess as to what it was.The feeling of having wasted two good hours that could have been better utilized rearranging my sock drawer overpowers the experience of enjoying the great looks and acting of Clive Owen and trying to follow the little plot twists in the hope of getting a decent payoff at the end.It's watchable, heck yes, but if there's anyone out there who comes out of this thinking ""Eureka,"" I'd love to hear what it was you found.

This is a good movie but I want better than good from Mr. Lee and this cast. The acting is fine although Mr. Washington is too familiar (didn't I see this guy in the one with the terrorists in New York and the one with him in a Hawaiian shirt in Florida), Ms. Foster is set cleverly against previous type yet distracting because of that in a way Mr. Washington wasn't distracting against type in Training Day, and Clive Owens seems wasted in the few moments we actually see him. The heist hook is clever but not fully explored, the few action sequences are nicely Hollywood and the plot keeps engorging but is ultimately a bit too flaccid to be penetrating.

Was expecting a tense, intelligent thriller, something a la 'The Usual Suspects', though that was probably expecting a bit much. When you look back, what the hell actually happened after the initial hold up and capture of the hostages. The cops flail around outside for what seems like an eternity while the audience, who have coped on ages before what Clive Owen actually has in mind, twiddle their thumbs and wonder what IQ is required to get into the police force.

There are enormous plot holes everywhere and even what isn't peppered with discontinuity is essentially a load of old cobblers, as we like to say here.This movie has been murdered in the editing suite - by whom, who knows? It all reminds me of the disaster that was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, although I expect no-one punched the director this time. At least Clive Owen managed to actually do some acting for a change. He's come on a lot since starring in Sin City.

I love movies and love Cinema as much as anyone else who is a member here but this film up to the point that I saw was just like any other bank robbery film you've ever seen. There is nothing to it. There are robbers, there are hostages, there are negotiators. Nothing else apart from the bank owner sends Jodie Foster in there to get some of his belongings out.You really never care about any of the characters in a movie and that always makes a movie harder to enjoy. The storyline (up to where I saw) was slow, boring and uninventive and I knew I wouldn't be able to stay away.I work at the Cinema so saw the ending two days later and have to say there was nothing overly special about that either.

382,smart_harsh,Excellent Movie.,9,4 January 2009,"Inside Man, at first seems to be another run of the mill movie, which tries to bank upon good cast and one of evergreen plot in the industry, a plan for perfect bank robbery.It has everything that bank robbery movie need, the cast, the gang, the weapons, the hostages and definitely the plan, but it's the last one which makes all the difference.Clive Owen plays the robber, who sets the tone of the movie upfront with the stunning starting scene. Denzel Washington plays the cop who is looking for one case to prove himself; Jodie Foster is the power broker.The script is very well executed with almost no flaws in it, it's the plan of the robbery and the treatment given to it by the director makes the movie must watch for everyone. Movie has an instances on the problems faced by minority group in US especially post 9-11, it also uses the novel method of story telling wherein it jumps to the near future to link the story i.e the interrogations sequences of the suspects shown during the hostage drama.Spike Lee pulls out an absolute thriller in this motion picture.

""Inside Man"" is that great kiss.It takes a premise as old as celluloid; a bank heist, and toys around with it and even at times laughs at itself. The writing is taut, the acting and direction is supreme. Spike Lee has achieved a rare thing: a commercial action movie that ask questions and makes the audience think.Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster are sensational as to be expected, but the other various actors in the role as hostages and robbers alike are just as wonderful.If I had to voice one complaint it would be that the movie goes on 15 minutes longer than it needed to.",Inside Man
384,DJExcen,Politics Disguised,9,1 July 2007,"I have been a fan of Spike Lee's films for many years, and his latest offering did not disappoint. His message was not as obvious to suburban W.A.S.P. America as his previous offerings, however the critical shots in the film were just as striking as the lynching scene in Do The Right Thing or Edward Norton's rant in 25th Hour.The plot was straightforward for a heist film, with the entire cinematic value being placed in the current political moment. The scene where the bank is cleared out evokes the problems of identification faced by Security and Military personnel. By not making the people readily identifiable, Lee manages to evoke a sense of identification with any group easily identified, and thereby discriminated against, for having a unifying physical characteristic. Rather than focusing on the problems specific to the black community, Lee manages to transcend his past as a filmmaker without being overly heavy on the social preaching.Overall, the film was well-executed. Jodie Foster was underutilized, but then again, is she ever over-utilized in a film? Regardless of your personal feelings toward Mrs. Foster's acting, she was one of many talented actors giving incredible, impeccable performances. If you enjoyed Denzel Washington in Training Day, you're going to find his performance was not as good, but definitely more satisfying. The balance of acting and racial undertones make this film far more interesting than typical popcorn, we-gonna-steal-stuff celluloid.I give it 9 Safety Deposit Boxes out of 10.",Inside Man

391,denn_2003,"Complete waste of talent, time, money",1,18 April 2006,"Movie: There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie. Its truly awful. Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick. Characters/Actors: Denzel has done ""EXACTLY"" what he does in every movie, so no surprise there. Here is a little mind game for the readers. Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies. Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard, whatever. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was I think in ""Beyond Borders"". Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in ""Sin City"". Surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles. He is in desperate need of a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She has done better. She has had better roles. It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot: Plot was not confusing, in fact, I could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner. I mean come on, ****SPOILER ON THE WAY----> I am sick of the un-necessary Haulocast and the Racism token. The movie is about bank robbers, why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone? NOT ME. Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages? Riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about US police force and security here. Nobody could find out where Clive was, I mean they didn't find anything different with that room. Who're we kidding? Conclusion: Sure, go watch this movie, if nothing, you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was.

393,Villa2416,Excellent Film.,10,28 March 2006,"Now this movie was right on the money. As a retired NYPD Detective, I found it very accurate as to the goings on. Especially when Willem DeFoe as the ESU Captain discusses the situation with Mr. Washington. I have been in some situations like this and the actions were very true to life, however, I saw one problem. Although Mr. Washington was a hostage negotiator and a Detective, he wouldn't have been able to order Sgts and supervisors the way he does in this movie. Mr. Spike Lee has been watching how the NYPD operates. The story was unusual but interesting throughout. Mr. Plummer plays a great part as well, and to tell you how he is involved would give up the plot somewhat. As the movie unravels, one can actually start to understand what is happening, to a point. Mr. Washington plays the part well, and his supervisors are confident to a point. The character Mr. Washington plays is up against a wall throughout this movie, which makes for great suspense.

394,theshadowoftheghost,Great thriller.,7,27 January 2012,"This is a good title, all in all. It plays itself just right in thriller terms, being quite reminiscent of Phonebooth or perhaps The Negotiator in pace. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it tries to tell us that story in using forks in the road we haven't often been down. It's final twist is smart, if not slightly expected, but will leave many satisfied with a good ending. Washington is his usual self, great acting, but it's nothing we haven't seen him in before. Owen again, pretty generic, but no one is hit-and-miss in this film, everything plays out consistently and there are enough comic moments to ensure an ease from the tension and strife. I sound clinical, but really, this is a good film, definitely worth watching. It doesn't have that special something that Phonebooth or The Negotiator does, but it is a good attempt at a keep-you-guessing thriller. 7/10 from me.",Inside Man
395,nilsslarss,prickled ears,8,6 April 2006,"What I really enjoyed about this movie was the dialog and repartee. Hollywood never seems to worry about dialog, so it was a joy to listen to these characters talk to each other. Two dialogs stick out: the one between the Sikh and the police, and the argument after the quiz. A lesser director would have left them out, together with the concentration on detail such as the protocol concerning police reaction. However, somewhere along the way, Lee lost his touch, and the last part and the ending were a disappointment. Besides the dialog, the acting was also brilliant. Denzel Washington is in a class of his own; the interrogations were masterly; and rarely has an actor laughed as well as he did after ""sticking his shoe up the white man's ass"". I even liked Jodie Foster (no whiny voice with pinched nose) ...Racism: I have been surprised to hear people thinking there is reverse racism in the movie. Just because the hero is black and the corrupt people are white; usually the hero is white and the corrupt people are white. So it was one little change. Anyway, the character who came off worse was that loud-mouthed boy with his barbaric computer game.Holocaust: As a German I am a bit sensitive about the Holocaust being used as a shorthand for a quick emotional sensation. Too many movies deal with the terrible moral choices people had to make at the time and with the aftermath of suffering in a way that is very superficial. I hope this is one of the last movies that does so. Titanic managed to get in a survivor who was over 100, so the last Holocaust survivor/evildoer in a movie may yet be to come (Evildoer: ca. 2020; victim ca. 2030: damn, that's longer than I thought!) There are plenty of other moral dilemmas and ways of suffering and getting corrupted in this world. Please use them instead. If you want to make a movie about the Holocaust, fine; if it is a cheap thrill, leave it out!",Inside Man
396,green_winger,Great Movie to Watch Unfold,8,8 April 2006,"I enjoyed watching Inside Man. I thought it was an overall great movie with direction from Spike Lee getting a thumbs up and the all star cast of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Clive Owen playing characters brilliantly.Washington's character was my favourite, his personality combining a passion for his work and very witty remarks. I think Denzel really plays his roles well and there was no lacking in this movie.At times, Spike Lee can be a little annoying. I don't think he can really quite get the dialogue right with white people, but most of his shots were done very well.The movie has many great plot twists which are a privilege to watch unfold.I give Inside Man an 8 out of 10. If only we could fix the few weaknesses than the film would get an easy 10 out of 10.",Inside Man

398,parker1177,"enjoy the cool, smooth ride.",7,24 March 2006,"""Inside Man"" stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster  all bringing their A-games and mustering up all the movie star fire power they can. They are joined in able support by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Christopher Plummer, consecutively one of my favorite young actors and one of my favorite old-schoolers. Director Spike Lee has ventured outside of his familiar and crafted a very interesting and entertaining bank heist/perfect crime caper. But there's a lot more going on here than the meets the eye. With a deft screenplay by newcomer Russell Gewirtz, Lee delivers a crackerjack action drama that also serves as a gentle treatise on how we treat each other in this country. As a plus, Spike sells this message subtly this time out and not in the usual ham-fisted style that he has employed in the past.The film begins with a tight medium full on the mug of Owen, explaining that he is Dalton Russell and hinting that things are not always as they seem. This monologue segues into a sight of four people dressed as painters entering the lobby of Manhattan Trust, a Wall Street branch of a worldwide financial institution. (Think Citibank/Citigroup with charitable do-gooder Chairman Plummer as a Sanford Weill wannabe.) The robbery is underway, hostages are taken and the crime becomes a highly scrutinized red-ball media event that drags on for the better part of a day. The bank robbers seem to stay one step ahead of the police department at every turn, but what exactly is going on here? Washington plays NYPD hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier. He heads the operation to make contact with ringleader Russell and insure the safety of the hostages. Frazier is newly promoted and somewhat immersed in a corruption scandal. He sees the siege as an opportunity to prove his worth, make the grade and clear his name all at the same time. Two-time Oscar winner Washington gives yet another unimpeachable portrayal that does not disappoint. (Has this man ever given a poor performance?) His Frazier is charming, stalwart and quite droll. His presentation of this man in above his head is never stronger than when he has absolutely no idea what to expect next. Washington can always cut the dashing figure, but his best work occurs when he is brought low and his characters are forced to rely on something besides their physicality and allure. As expected, he serves as the principled center to this labyrinthine tale of greed, morals and corruption. Washington's work here continues his celebrated successful collaborative relationship with Lee.Casting Clive Owen as Washington's adversary was a sharp and necessary move. It takes an actor of serious fortitude, appeal and strong sense of self to stand toe to toe with Washington and not crumble in Denzel's wake. As the mastermind behind the break-in, the winning Brit more than holds his own in scenes with Washington and Foster, who plays mysterious power broker Madeline White. There is an intelligence and determination behind those icy blue eyes of steel. He's an enigma, a genius criminal literally sitting on top of a pile of money that's his for the taking, but with no clear exit strategy. It is a masterful confluence of direction, writing and acting and the audience is rewarded with a modern deluxe throwback to the golden era of Sidney Lumet movies. You get the sense that everyone involved couldn't wait to show up for work, tell this story and create these scenes together., Jodie Foster makes another appearance as a supporting character. She is quite compelling as White, a Machiavellian fixer with seemingly no humanity inside herself whatsoever. As she clomps around Manhattan in designer shoes that seem entirely too high and uncomfortable for her (), she exudes authority and avarice. And it's a delightful irony as she is decidedly so much physically smaller than all the big studs around her. There are a couple of chilling scenes with Plummer where's she appears to have ice in her veins. She's not alone though, every character has their own secrets and agenda and it's simply a matter of waiting to see what happens when irresistible forces collide with immovable objects.Spike applies his singular vision throughout the film and never at the sake of his audience's enjoyment. He says what he wants to say about race, religion, money, history and morality in this country, but this time without the screaming. There is the expected marvelous camera-work and clever imagery which as always in the case of a Spike Lee Joint, is accompanied by the plaintive wails of a standard yet sublime score by Terence Blanchard. There is a scene where Washington and Ejiofor turn a corner in a hallway and advance upon the camera at a brisk walking pace. Lee photographs these stunning examples of Beautiful Black Men so lovingly and at such an angle it gives one pause and truly takes the breath away. And Lee knows how to film New York City in such a way that the metropolis itself actually becomes a character in the film.It is by no means a perfect film but it is highly entertaining and worthwhile. The narrative still does come across a bit murky in the third act and there are some lags in action, but these are minor complaints. Go see ""Inside Man"" for the performances, the script, and the opportunity to see a seasoned vanguard director stretch his wings within an entirely different form. Welcome to the mainstream Spike",Inside Man
399,minidodo,"Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster in a Spike Lee Heist film!",3,15 April 2009,"And the major self hype in the beginning of the film.But does it really live up to the expectations ? My answer is a big NO. First of all, it extremely self congratulatory - ""I planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery"". No, not in my opinion. dozen's of lives were put at risk. The plan was hardly fool proof.Denzel Washington's character pays undue tribute to the robber - ""Exactly where he wants me with my pants around my ankles"". Not really - why would he have such a defeatist attitude ?The main trick is similar to V for Vendetta - so it's nothing new. And it's hardly impossible to not isolate people who might have been involved by simple questioning - just ask who all opened an account in the bank recently or look for solid reasons for them to be in the bank. And Denzel's boss says that no crime was committed. Really ? what do you call holding 20 people hostage for hours ? Jodie Foster's character tries to be Wolf of Pulp fiction; without the same conviction, just the same (over)confidence.Overall this movie was just a well made set of loopholes. While you may not feel bored due to the fast pace and witty dialog- but in the end an average viewer, not in awe of the big names, would feel a bit high and dry.",Inside Man

Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster are perfectly cast in each of there respective roles. The story of a wall street bank heist and the battle of wits between the respective parties will have to sitting on the edge of your seat and asking for more.

401,saintcecilia,Great cast and direction fighting against a truly bad script,5,30 November 2006,"First of all, I have to say I have never seen a Spike Lee film that I didn't like. There's always something interesting to look at or think about. I also always like to see Denzel Washington being directed by Lee - Lee seems to bring some quality out in him. In this film, it means Washington manages to make his rather drab character interesting. And Clive Owen was good. There was a lot of comment about how he spends most of the film with his face almost fully concealed. Well, as Johnny Knoxville has demonstrated, it is possible to convey emotion while in a HazMat suit (Jackass fans will know what I mean) and Owen does admirably here. And a brief mention for Chiwetel Ejiofor, whom I last saw in ""Serenity"" to great effect, who makes a fine job of what is basically an ""I'm with him"" role.Then there's Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer. Just goes to show even consummate professionals cannot turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. The scriptwriter had one brilliant idea, then he cobbled together bits and pieces to pad out the film.If you think I've misjudged him, can you answer these questions for me? Why would Plummer's character have kept such damning material at all, let alone in a safety deposit box at his own bank? Didn't he have a safe at home? And how exactly was Foster's character supposed to deal with this situation ""discreetly"", with the villains holed up in the bank and the media and the public watching every move? Don't tell me nobody knew who she was and, believe me, police are the biggest gossips in the world. Now, if she had organised her own team of burglars to break in and quietly lift the documents while Clive Owen's bunch were looking the other way, that would have made some sense.And, lastly, can we have a moratorium on Nazi subplots? The way things are going, the next generation may grow up, thinking the Holocaust is a mythical events and the Nazis no more real than Robin Hood or King Arthur. The Chief Rabbi of Britain wrote about the ""instrumentality of the Holocaust"" and how it is so often used as an shortcut to add a frisson of real evil to otherwise mundane situations. There are lots of other ways for rich men to be wicked without invoking the Holocaust. Scriptwriting is supposed to be creative - so create, imagine or just look at the front pages of the daily newspapers, if you must. More than enough material there without invoking an event which caused the suffering and death of millions of people.",Inside Man
402,Sulaco72,Dumb movie.,2,6 January 2008,"This is a dumb movie. Maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much, but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn.I didn't have any beef with the acting, but I thought the characters were awful. The movie starts off with Clive Owen's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is, and how he planned the perfect bank robbery, something he frequently reminds us of later. Oh yeah, he also tells us he's in a prison cell, although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor. Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong, and you're long gone before the police show up. But Clive Owen's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours - for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell. He also has to control hostages, negotiate with cops, and most fantastically of all, perform a This-Old-House job on the bank's stockroom and hide out there for a week (I hope he brought enough food, and a bucket to pee in) and then sneak out again. Yeah, that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me, Clive! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so.And then there are the many unexplained details: Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages? Who the hell is Jodie Foster's character, and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn't have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because ""it's above his pay scale?"" How dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery? How did the robbers slip away, and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week? How did they find out about the bank chairman's past, and the number and contents of his safe deposit box? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops? Since when do they make toy AK-47s that look real up close? How the hell do you bug a pizza box, anyway? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours, undetected? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond?None of these questions are ever answered. There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off-screen, but I never felt that way about Inside Man. It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie, or these questions never had any answers in the first place, and that's weak. Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster's character, who won't disclose what she does, but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is. We're just supposed to take her word for it, I guess.The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel's ""taxi cab"" and ""pina colada"" gags, and at the kid's outrageous video game. Other than that, this movie has no redeeming features.",Inside Man
403,theSecretAlchemist,a decent by-the-numbers heist flick,7,21 April 2007,"Inside Man is a decent enough film to rent on DVD on a wet Friday. The main intrigue comes from figuring out who the bad guys were. All the other sub-plots - where Owen disappeared to, how Washington will win his power game with Foster, what order Dafoe will give when it all goes pear-shaped - are either telegraphed early on or lack dramatic tension. Also, pay too much attention and some glaring plot holes reveal themselves. But, there is some crisp dialogue, a few laughs, and the always (well sometime, in the case of Owen) charismatic cast to enjoy. Apart from a couple of asides about colour-prejudiced comments, the only thing that tells you this is a Spike Lee joint is the credit roll. Intriguingly, there is one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when a female-specific (in the US of A, that is) expletive is aimed at Foster. Lee has been eloquent and accurate in his condemnation of Tarantino's over-fondness for using language that discriminates against African-Americans: all the more the pity, then, that he chooses to so clumsily deploy similar language tactics for gender bias. I get the feeling Lee made this film to prove a point, in order to show that he can be a decent genre filmmaker, on a par with Soderbergh in Out-of-Sight mode. Well, he made his point. I for one would like him to get back to doing what he does best, making polemical films about issues that matter.",Inside Man
404,stevehadd,"Good start, but meanders towards the end",8,31 March 2006,"A fantastic cast has been assembled for the heist movie, and the plot is very good. It is somewhat let down by the fact that the tension never builds properly, so there i no real pay off or climax. Maybe thats good, but with sort of movie, it is about who knows what and who's ahead of the game, so it really should be shorter and more tightly focused. For instance, Jodie Fosters character is kind of in no mans land (good performance from her though). She is supposed to be playing some important role (we think) but never does anything. Use it or lose it! The movie has all the elements of a great heist movie, but the uneven pacing lets it down compared to a film like Oceans 11.",Inside Man

406,spockwillow,Interesting concept ruined by inability to add and an awful ending,3,8 September 2006,"Interesting concept of a bank robbery as cover for something else. Denzel decent as usual but character is shallow. Defoe nicely acted, as usual in this case, for a decent paycheck. Foster as the fixer - she must have been unhappy with the final edit as I trust most of her lines were on the editing floor. Christopher Plummer as the bank Chariman is not old enough to be believable. This is 61 years since the end of WWII and he was suppose to be a big banking wheel in Germany during the war so he had to be at least 35-40 then given the hierarchy at the time. Therefore he would have to be 95-100 years old in this movie. Granted he looks old but not that old!!!! Finally the ending was not an ending. Spike is an OK director but please don't try to be something you are not and give us some ending that leaves us guessing.

407,junk-mail-4,A classy Spike joint.,7,10 December 2006,"""Pouring new wine into the bottle of the Western, Peckinpah explodes the bottle"" Pauline kael once remarked of Sam Peckinpah. Spike Lee doesn't quite break the aged bottle of the heist picture, but he shakes some dust off. And I reckon Bloody Sam would have liked what he poured.Not in terms of violence. It's a little hectic, but there's no bloody showdowns. But there's an old time slickness about the shooting, a polish and finesse that todays crop of hacks couldn't touch with their epilepsy inducing ADHD shooting styles.That said, the stylish touches manage not to weigh down a brisk, thoughtful, and above all original script. You think you know where it's going, you even guess some of the twists, but like any devoted student of film history Spike manages to send the viewer down a few blind alleys, a few dead ends, and some ultimately rewarding unexpected detours.Denzal Washington is, as ever, pure class, making it look effortless in a way De Niro once did, but without piling on the worthiness or shedding a touch of light humour. Clive Owen is solid, more then able to hold up intervals that may have lulled under lessor directors. Jody Fosters role, effectively a cameo, felt like stunt casting but was a nice touch (a somewhat out of character role for Foster, in line with her more recent voyages of discovery). The whole cast were up to Spike Lee's normal high ensemble standard, no one underused or underplayed, no one trying to run away with the show.Well worth two hours of anyones time.

Denzil Washington is a cool hostage negotiator and Clive Owen is doing his very good cool calculating thing as the villain. It is wicked to see William Dafoe and i wish he had more scenes and Jodie Foster appears as well. There is a very well pitched humour about the film which had the audience laughing frequently but without producing an oceans 11/Guy Ritchie sort of predictability that is so common in these kind of films at the moment. Also present is the ubiquitous Lee political comments which some people find annoying but i think he makes valid points and it is another element that elevates this film above the usual releases. All in all this is definitely one of the best films i have seen for many months and i would recommend it highly (i don't normally bother writing comments). It is great to see Owen in this film as he is a fantastic actor and he seems to constantly be appearing in great stuff (sin city and closer for example) and Washinton has long been a favourite of mine.",Inside Man

The rest of her role is more or less a cameo. The camera style or better the post processing of the interrogation scenes was a little bit too much.

Not that i wouldn't have wanted it to be the perfect bank robbery, but i couldn't help thinking why didn't the police dig deeper into the backgrounds of all the people involved with it. It is unlikely that the ones involved would have had an account with the bank and if they did, some or the other employees would remember them. This could be a way to filter out the accomplices. And also would have been the first the first thing i would have done in Denzel Washington's shoes.

413,mbl102,Bad Weed,5,30 July 2006,"What can go right and what can go wrong? What we have have here is a failure to co-habitate. This one is a test in taking the bad with the good.A bank robbery is in progress, but we soon realize that there is much more then just a heist happening. We see, in flashbacks, that the robbery has already happened but the police don't know what really went down. They are asking questions of the witness' that tell us the police know nothing. It is eventually revealed that this is no regular run-of-the-mill bank robbery. Indeed much more important thins than money will be removed from this bank.This Spike Lee joint has an interesting concept and a wonderfully executed script. The outstanding camera work of Matthew Libatique (even though his opening shot in ""Requiem For A Dream"" is also of a roller-coaster) is consistent throughout the film. Russell Gewirtz's intriguing script is brought to life by superb performances. Clive Owen plays the man inside the bank. Christopher Plummer plays the man inside the mystery. Denzel Wahington plays the man trying to get inside the other character's head and Jodie Foster plays the one trying to sort out everyman's problems.In the end, this film is a question of morality. In the end we have to decide who is right. They all use deceptive tactics, but are their motives honourable? Do the ends justify the means? This makes for an intriguing plot that keeps you guessing.So those were the things that worked so what went wrong? To start, the music didn't suit the feel, theme or flow of the movie. Terence Blanchard's score sounded like the discarded theme song from ""Night Court."" It was extremely distracting when a dramatic moment began and the music was screaming for Crockett & Tubbs to come and save the day. But what this film needed the most was a script editor to save the day.Too long we get it, they are after something else. Now let the other characters know. Stop hinting at it, because the natives are getting restless. I had already guessed Chistopher Plummer's big secret 20 minutes before they even mentioned it. Why? Because I had 25 minutes before that to guess.The biggest celluloid crime committed here is the waste of a marvelous performance by Jodie Foster. I understand she's mysterious. I've clued in she's got connections. I got the hint that she's cool, calm and collected now let's do something with her interesting portrayal.At the end of the movie I walked out moderately entertained. Spike Lee is a great film maker so it wasn't unwatchable. It just was not up to his usual standards. But this is one Spike Lee joint I will not toke again.",Inside Man
414,lookingforgoodfilm,Very enjoyable fluff.,8,28 November 2006,"Although I found it a little long, the performances of Denzel Washington and Clive Owen really make this film sing. Jodie Foster I was less crazy about- I had a hard time believing that she'd just keep on smiling no matter what potentially dangerous situation she was in.The music and photography seem a throwback to the 70's, which I didn't mind. The plot punishes all the right people, and the screenplay is very smart. The woman who played Denzel's fiancé seemed a bit of a fantasy figure, never really wanting anything but sex- but I didn't mind that!And of course, Spike Lee's signature 'he's walking but he's not and I'm getting dizzy' shot is in the mix as well.A fun romp if you're in the mood for a bank heist film.",Inside Man
415,PatrickRijnders,"With Inside Man, Spike Lee has crafted a very original and exciting thriller.",8,14 March 2006,"Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6, Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing, Clockers and 25th Hour, it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.This all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. I was a little disappointed however with Jodie Foster's role. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.With Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie. I enjoyed this original approach very much, even though he does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.",Inside Man
416,Mark-Rhoads2,Time Line Does Not Work in 2006,8,9 April 2006,"Inside Man was an interesting idea for a plot but the screen play really did not have an ending. Maybe they will finish it in time for DVD release.We see hints in the film that Christopher Plummer was involved with Nazi war crimes or at least stealing the wealth of Jewish families to start a bank in 1948. Say what?How old would this character Arthur Case have to be in 2006? World War II ended 61 years ago next month. Assume Case had to be at least 25 to 30 when he was a banker dealing with Nazis. Is the character supposed to be 86 to 91 years old? At that age, he is still serving as chairman of the board of a Manhattan-based bank? Is this not a bit of a stretch? Christopher Plummer the actor is about 77. He was only ten years old when the war started in Europe in the fall of 1939 and he would have been 16 when it ended. If the movie is supposed to be set in present day New York, its hard to see how that time line is supposed to be believable. Except for the ring maybe, why would the diamonds be only traceable to Jewish families in 1939 if they were the source. Were the stones used as collateral for loans to start the bank since they were not sold off?Every actor in this film was good and they all gave good performances. But after all that, I think the audience has a right to expect a stronger ending that fits the plot line. This is as yet an unfinished symphony. Maybe it was rushed into theater release before it was ready?",Inside Man
417,Brude_Stone,"Excellent movie, among Lee's best in many ways.",9,4 April 2006,"It was promoted as a straight-forward, slick-as-can-be bank heist movie in the trailers (and it is that) but it also ranges over themes that are much more serious and very unexpected. Even though I knew there was ""more to this one"" from vague comments I'd heard in the press, opening paragraphs of reviews I avoided reading, etc., I still didn't expect where it was going at all. The script is tighter than a drum and motivations of all major characters are both deep and well drawn and thus always believable. As an excercise in scripting, it's really one of the more remarkable pieces I've watched or read in a long time. Lee is easily up to the task and manages to make the movie both the slick, clever and exciting heist thriller you were hoping for as well as a movie with real depth and heart far beyond what would normally be expected from the genre. The movie doesn't look very much like a typical Spike Lee movie, though there are the occasional graces that remind you of who is calling the shots. Every actor in the film hits the perfect note for their roles, even the minor players who have few lines and brief scenes. One of my favorite small roles is a construction worker who briefly helps the cops with some information they need that could be key to helping deal with the robbers (this isn't a spoiler). Just how the guy swaggers over to the cops' mobile command vehicle was so perfectly pitched, so true to life as that of a proud New York working-man, I knew instantly who this guy was because I'd met him a hundred times on the streets here. It's that kind of attention to detail that helps make this story really live on the screen. It's an incredibly impressive movie.",Inside Man
418,derbyhandicap,It was alright.........................,6,26 March 2006,"The performances were solid, supporting to lead the characters were outstanding and showed much depth (even Willhem). The scenes were well crafted and the 'look' of the film was quite intense. However I did have an issue with the story and the back and forth, cute to clever scenario. I wished the film was able to dwell into the direct relationship between Clive Owens' character and Christopher Plummers.' I felt there was more to be said to the reasoning behind his purpose. Maybe a second viewing could perhaps answer this. A sequel would help, but I hope that is not even an option. It's a character driven film and a little bit more. I still would recommend this film, it's a change from all the splash and squash were delivered down our throats by the chimps in tinsel town.",Inside Man

He was wimpy in Derailed with Jennifer Aniston and got on my nerves. I like the hero type character I guess who keeps a cool head. The cool headed bank robber Clive deserves a thumbs up for sure. I love Jodi Foster who was a cool cucumber as well here. Christopher Plumber was amazing as always. If he is in a film, I will be there to support it. Good choice.The suspense music I did not like and was laughable. I liked the part where the little old lady refused to strip . That was very funny. It was humorous in some instances. Clive was very handsome here so we can forgive him for his brutal image he was trying to achieve.Mr. Washingtom gets better with each film!! He was the shining star here!!! I really enjoyed his character- the flawed cop.",Inside Man

The biggest reason is because we don't know the robbers motive and backstory - this really harms the movie. It was so disappointing for me. I didn't root for anyone and I'm left without knowing the point of the movie. Additionally, unless I dozed off, I didn't understand why they were digging a hole into the concrete floor - what was the objective of this and why didn't the police find the hole in the floor? I personally didn't like the mood of the movie, nor did I feel that it was well casted - William Defoe and Denzel Washington just didn't sell for me. Finally, I feel a little obtuse here, but I didn't understand Jodie Fosters character in this movie at all.On the upside, I did enjoy the plot twists. It had potential.",Inside Man

Denzel Washington plays a Detective brought in to negotiate with Owen. Willem Dafoe plays a small role, and is great as always, and Jodie Foster also has a role. Even though Lee did manage to breathe life into this dead genre, the film comes off as seeming like it was too clever for its own good.The end twist is the biggest one I've seen in years. Nevertheless, when it's finally revealed you are left feeling that you got duped by a director trying to outsmart you.As far as the acting goes Denzel, walked through his role & the secondary story lines about Denzels character were unnecessary.

What makes it so special is that the bank robbers have a pretty cool plan to get out.Clive Owens and Jodie Foster star. They do an okay job, but the script didn't exactly give their characters an opportunity to really shine. Their characters weren't dull, just not very special. Denzel Washingon however was really fun to watch as a New York detective.Many people complain about major plot holes, but there really aren't any major ones, just small things.

The movie felt like I was watching a great t.v. show and not a movie. Which may explain why everyone seemed so comfortable and remained in their seats even during the credits. Felt like I was sitting on my living room couch with a bucket of popcorn. Something about the way they shot the movie and the background music that gave it a t.v. feel. Denzel did a wonderful job bringing the character to life and Jodi Foster was good herself. But I have seen Denzel and Jodi do more powerful roles.The movie really did have an interesting plot and I still have questions about what happened. I didn't figure out all the twists to the movie and I think that's why the movie was so good to me. I'm still trying to put the pieces of the plot together.For the entire movie I thought Dalton Russell was played by Nicholas Cage until I saw the credits. Clive Owen sounds JUST like Nicholas Cage.

Although you might think there is nothing more to be filmed on that topic, you better think again. However, I do have one, little objection, maybe the movie is progressing too slow, although that could be intensional, so that the audience could understand it, due to it's complex, but truly fascinating story. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a relaxation after a hard day, but do not expect anything of a style of ""The Dog Day Afternoon"", because it is not that kind of movie, it does not have a moral lesson, or something like that. From my point of view, it is made just for entertainment, and if that really was Spike Lee's intention, then he has succeeded. Have fun!",Inside Man

Detective Frazier is called in to negotiate, but things are not what they seem. He quickly realizes he is not up against any ordinary criminals. This is exacerbated when a fixer is called in to help diffuse the situation.One of Spike Lee's most well executed films, Inside Man is a great addition to the heist genre that ranks right up there with Dog Day Afternoon.

""Inside Man"" is intentionally bizarre, progressively confusing the viewers more and more until the final fifteen minutes in which all of the peculiarities are wrapped up into one cohesive (and humorous) whole. This movie is for the intelligent viewer, who is willing to pay attention to every detail. Even the title gives away a major part of the plot, but what precisely that part is remains unknown until the very end of the movie.The one detail that could have been better explained is the exact significance of that ring to those people, and what leaving it where the cops would find it achieved, but even that is reasonably obvious.",Inside Man

Aside from the usual: great acting, directing, story-line, etc. I wanted to comment that although at first I found the music to be a little overbearing I soon came to appreciate it as an exciting part of the film which somehow reminded me of another action flick but I can't recall which at the moment....perhaps a Harrison Ford film. I disagree with those who felt the F word was overused or unnecessary because in situations like that with supposed characters like that it is inevitable in a New York world. I was glad to see Chris Plummer still in the game - I can't help wishing he were {still} a younger man and had many years ahead to delight us...yet, here's hoping we'll see more of him.

When Clive Owen and associates take over a New York bank, everything seems to scream bank robbery, but everything isn't always as it seems. Denzel Washington plays Detective Keith Frazier, who is currently under suspicion for police corruption, involving money theft. Frazier gets a chance to redeem his name when the proposed negotiator can't be found. He is sent in charge of the negotiations, and prepares to make this a quick and clean fix with no casualties. As the story unfolds the confusion surrounding this bank robbery surmounts, and Frazier begins to see the ingenious strategy by Dalton Russel (Clive Owen). Things take even a stranger turn when Christopher Plummer, who plays the bank owner en-lists Jodie Foster to retrieve documents from a safe box in the bank, which could be harmfully to his reputation. Deceit and corruption are rampant, and leave you guessing until the final conclusion. A great film by Spike Lee well worth watching!",Inside Man
432,Mikie1974,Inside Man,8,1 April 2006,"""Inside Man"", a Spike Lee joint film, is the story of what appears to be the perfect bank robbery. It is up to a hostage negotiating detective (Denzel Washington)to resolve the situation. While working with the head of the gang (Clive Owen), the detective's instincts begin to tell him that there is more to the crime than stealing the bank's reserves. When a corporate fund raiser (Jodi Foster) becomes involved in the investigation on the behalf of the bank owner (Christopher Plummer) who is worried more about the contents of a mysterious safety deposit box than the money in his bank, the facts begin to fall in place for the detective.The film is an entertaining adventure that contains Lee's patented look at the race relations issue at a subdued level. The dialogue is excellent and the plot is well executed. Washington's performance is sensational, giving the audience a character that is interesting as well as entertaining. Clive Owen is brilliant in the combination of head bank robber and corrupted vigilante. The supporting cast of hostages/bank robbers add a touch of hilarity and realism to the film. Christopher Plummer is excellent, playing the villain that has wrapped himself in good deeds to hide from a past driven by greed and wealth painted in blood.The only disappointment is Jodi Foster. The audience sees her as an opportunistic, favor swapping heavy that has no depth. There is no back story given or implied as to why people in high power positions bow to her whim. Her occupation and character are not well defined. Although she is needed as a link to key elements of the story line between robber and detective, she lacks the compelling aspect of a character that makes people sit up and watch a film. When Jodi Foster is on the screen, the rhythm of the film wavers and loses focus.""Inside Man"" is definitely worth seeing. The intricate story line about a heist inspired by historical atrocities is fascinating, while Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's charismatic performances shine.",Inside Man

This movie is somewhat hard to follow and I still haven't figured out what line of work Jodie Foster's character is in. At any rate, this is a great story of--well--a bank robbery. A perfect one. I can't tell you who why or how, but just know that you will probably enjoy it. The soundtrack was a little strange and there were numerous ""F-bombs"" like there are in so many of Lee's films, but it was scripted well and every actor was cast perfectly for their respective roles.

It's almost as if the director was marking time waiting for the credits to roll around. What this film is completely lacking is any kind of drama, tension or emotion and that makes for poor cinema. We are never really engaged beyond waiting for things to get interesting, which sadly, never happens. What this film does have is some good ideas and plot devices but the director (and lets be under no illusions here - in the case of this film the fault lies purely with Spike Lee) wastes them with leisurely, lacklustre plot development and timing.

He comes out with the kind of acting that has made him a house hold name. His supporting cast helps the movie role right along. Clive Owen plays the kind of thief every other movie looks for in their movie. He is calm cool and collective the whole way. He will be if he is not now going to be a house hold name also. He needs a couple of movies like this to get him there. This movie was well written. It takes you from beginning to middle to end without skipping a beat. This is a must watch.

438,JohnBlane,Conflicited Opinion,7,26 January 2020,"This film is a superb bank robbery film, it had me hooked in the first half. But then it dropped off a lot. This is genuinely one of the least climatic films I have seen. Christopher Plummer's character has a massive secret, one he can't tell anyone about, and you're hooked. You want to know why these guys are robbing a bank, you want to know why they're stalling. There are loads of interesting details scattered throughout. Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch - as per usual. But the second half of the film lags, overdrawing on things we already knew, and pulls in all the wrong directions. Sometimes you would rather it be an ambiguous ending, or at least have some mystery. Instead, we have a bit of a letdown on what was really in the safe, and that's it. I would've preferred for it to be like the business case in Pulp Fiction, where the contents are never implicitly stated. And Jodie Foster's character is just too convenient, she's never fleshed out well enough for the audience to take her seriously. Rather she's just the lady who 'knows people'. I was left wondering the entire time how she got to this massively high status. In all other aspects, it is great, it just could've used some tweaking.",Inside Man

While the ending was a bit unsatisfying, the rest of the film was enjoyable. I contribute a lot of this to Spike Lee, the film was shot very well and had a certain style that kept the movie interesting. The actors did their job excellently and gave the movie a realistic feel. The script wasn't that strong but it wasn't weak and it was enough to keep me interested. There were certain holes which are examined in other comments but they don't really subtract from the film. It's a given that in a movie like this there are bound to be a few holes and if you aren't too critical, things should be just fine.All in all, I gave this movie a solid 8. Though the movie wasn't written very well, everyone else in the production did their jobs quite nicely. Definitely worth renting at Blockbuster.",Inside Man
440,chcamp,a Spike Lee surprise,8,20 March 2006,"It's a bank robbery film. A very good bank robbery film, to tell the truth. But the reasons to go to a movie theater and watch THE INSIDE MAN are miles away from the history of a audacious plan to steal a bank. It could be the history of everything you can possible imagine, but its the grouping of Denzel Washington's, Clive Owen's and Jodie Foster's talents that make this film amazing. Of course, it's a Spike Lee joint as we didn't see for a long time. There's no racial speech, there's no political point of view trying to be hammered into your head, it's just entertainment as the audience deserves. Clive Owen has a plan: with three associated friend, he will steal a fortune in a bank  just because he can. Denzel is the detective designed to negotiate the hostage situation and Jodie Foster is a cold woman with a mysterious job: solve her client's problems at any cost, with no questions. The point here is that Clive doesn't want only the money, Denzel is not the infallible negotiator we expect to see and Jodie's client is the owner of the invaded bank. Talk more is spoil the nice surprises of the plot. It's not DOG DAY AFTERNOOM  and there are a few holes in the plot - but it's much more than we are seeing nowadays.",Inside Man

So...he keeps it. Come on!! Anyone with half a brain would have burnt it immediately! Bizarrely, some other reviewers in here have also noticed this yet still gone on to give the film top marks ( one person even says this was the best film ever *despite* this terrible plot flaw!! ) Aside from this...who is this guy leading the heist and why does he know so much about Mr Chase's past? If Mr Chase is aware that someone out there knows about his terrible past then surely that's even more reason to destroy the evidence? The whole story is so frustratingly vague, like reading a book with half the pages missing. Aside from this, none of the characters are at all fleshed out and the film totally lacked tension.

They do want both the diamonds and the documents! Lee takes the opportunity to comment as always about prejudices, racial issues, (latino, Arabs and afro-Americans),and this is really a new yorker point of vue.Best quote is during the Sikh's character police hearing: "" I am Sikh, not Arab!""

443,moonstarly,pleasantly surprised... sometimes,7,11 January 2007,"I'll be honest: ""Inside Man"" is not Oscar-worthy. But neither is it fantastically horrible. It's one of those movies you borrow from Netflix (because hey, why not?), enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, and forget you ever watched two weeks later.""Inside Man"" has three things going for it: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and a complicated (if not a little convoluted) plot. Washington excels as the fast-talking, fast-thinking main character. I'm sure he has more than twice the lines of everyone else in the movie, including Clive Owen. Mr. Owen has not impressed me with most of his previous work (perhaps with the exception of ""The Closer""), but his complex character and the way he fleshed him out was fascinating to me. The plot, though filled with holes, is interesting and complex enough to keep everyone guessing almost to the end. I also liked the subtle things the movie had to say about race, gender, and age relations.On the downside, there's Jodie Foster. Though I usually enjoy her work, she was completely wrong for this part. The most annoying part of her performance is her odd hand motions, which I suppose were part of her character...? I thought her inclusion in the movie was somewhat unneeded.I was also extremely offended by the use of the ""c"" word... completely unnecessary and cringe-worthy, especially coming out of Christopher Plummer's mouth.

444,mmeltzer-1,cat meets cat across the bridge of retribution,7,7 April 2006,"""Inside Man."" Okay. Admittedly I thought about exiting Grauman's Chinese in the middle of the ""to assault, or not to assault"" scenario revelry, but I held on. Afterall, Denny Z, Plumer and Dee'Foss were doing some ensemble terrific at this game of cat and cat. The story had not really sunk in for almost twelve hours until I looked deep into the, ""What was Dee'Foss doing besides being cute"" thing, (I had immediately wondered if her character was hip enough to bring latex gloves for her captors to frisk her completely with. (Either JF's rilly uncomfortable in heels the way say Tina flaunts them, or she put some punctuation to that untold revelry all on her Ivy league own, bless her heart.)) Then the cultural archetypes began to fall into place. Clowen performs a nice classical chorus to his role of mad world's eccentric, and it's more memorable than one might imagine at first glance unless you are immediately grasping the point of view. I greeted the opening oreotorio with an, ""Yeah right asshole. You are as 'bout a limp a poetic warrior as the political science professor who never leaves the page,"" attitude. The ""if you're so smart how'd you get in there"" punch came back at me like the queen of spades after losing the first heart on the previous trick. So my point of view has been working the dial since, and the world is as mad as I fear. JoDee nails the ilk of that cream of pure opportunist, the ones that make affirmations to themselves in the mirror of their morning ego. There are too many, like Apple software developers, not everywhere, but enough to intrude on system clarity. They think you are sleeping when you are just too exasperated with them to care.....at that particular point in time, eh Mr. Mastermind, Eh!ChrisP plays unction to the privileged hilt. Though it is more subtle, the excuses are the same, 'Young and easily persuaded.' ""Hey Officer Krumke don't be a Square.""We know DenZ's Detective has opted to play the system in this affair, that he got ""persuaded"" to do so, but his character is clean of anything behind, to need to atone for, and therein lies one of the differences between the ilk of the overly privileged and the work minded ilk. When there's blood in the street it's mostly cause someone who's a hungering for something they cannot really identify has incited a firestorm of baser instincts within or around themselves. Those who fire first are the most convinced, the overly loyal or them who deeply don't know what else to do, but have shouldered the means to do so. It's the capitalist intrusion into the social facet that makes fodder of us all on both sides of the line. To the sponges go the spilled and the spoilt and the spoiled. Jodi Foster's character is so leveraged into the spoils system that the notion of a hard days work is anything that is not directly involved in cashing a check. Make sure there's enough latex to go around. So, embrace this film. See the world through its character's eyes. The film, without overstating, repeats what it thinks is important, and the actors give us a way in. Oh, and note the Director.

The pace is non-stop and it is not your run of the mill movie thriller. It keeps you guessing until the very end and the end is a doozy. Denzel is as always, superb, and as the charismatic leader of the bank robbers, Clive Owen dominates the screen. In supporting roles, both Jodie Foster and Willem Dafoe stand out in a very solid cast, and as the head of the bank (with a whopper of a secret) Christopher Plummer has never been better. I found it rather ironic for an actor who is probably best known for his portrayal as Baron Von Trapp in ""The Sound of Music"" to be playing the character he does in this movie (and you will have to see the movie to see what I am talking about!).

448,brokenimage227,spike's version of the perfect heist,8,1 April 2006,"Inside Man is a really good ""popcorn"" film by a great filmmaker. it's by far Spike Lee's most mainstream movie ever, and there were moments where i couldn't help but think the guy was slumming a little to clear his head and financially compensate for She Hate Me (though not a bad film in itself though). the upside when directors, writers and actors stoop a bit to do material they're more than capable of rising above is that there usually ends up being a new life breathed into conventional stories and plot lines, almost reinvigorating the cliché of it all, and i think that everyone involved succeeded in making Inside Man exactly that.the whole ""perfect heist"" bit is played out for sure, and there hasn't been a whole lot of success in making it interesting again. De Niro and Norton couldn't make The Score anything more than barely average, and even Mamet's Heist was lacking. but spike injects character, exaggerated as it may be, into the well worn vein and directs a first timer's script with a comfortable echo of all the films that define the great parts of this sub genre while digging a few of his own tricks out of the bag. there's some startlingly dark and light moments contrasting competently throughout.regardless of the material he's in, Denzel can't be bad (possible exception of The Mighty Quinn), and when he's rejoined with his old director partner Spike Lee, he shines. his street genius detective Keith Frazier plays on one of Denzel's best personas, the cocky bastard who chews his way through anything in his path. when Frazier's mind is really tested, you can hear the wheels getting ready to spin out of his head. it may seem like another version of the same performance you saw in Training Day and He Got Game, but he does it so deftly it's dazzling every time the rest of the cast varies a little in what they offer quality wise, but for the most part they're perfect for their parts. Jodie Foster and Chiwetel Ejiofor in particular, as a concise and ruthless stockbroker and Denzel's wry partner respectively, are aptly tuned to their characters, hamming it up in the best way. Clive Owen was a little inconsistent, but nailed it in all the right places. i am a fan of Spike. i respect his headstrong tendency to create the works as he envisions them, even when they fall short of a coherent statement (Bamboozled, She Hate Me, Girl 6). aside from that though, i love the way his films capture NYC in such an intimate way. when a director is so devoted to a locale, his affection burns through the screen and infects the viewer. it feels like he doesn't dress the city up or down in a bogus way, but enhances, even romanticizes it where the moment is right. Inside Man isn't a masterpiece by any stretch, but it does hold a respectable place in the broad work of someone as accomplished and bold as Spike Lee.",Inside Man
449,raeb,What was the point?,5,15 April 2006,"I didn't go to see this film with any expectations. I got to one of the free preview screenings, no idea what the film was about. On the whole I found the film quite enjoyable. It was very well acted.The only probably I found was that the plot does not stand up to scrutiny. If you allow yourself to be swept away by the slick production and big name actors then you almost miss that the plot is convoluted and doesn't actually make sense in places and is wholly unbelievable in others.As the film progressed I found myself not liking or caring about any of the characters. Denzel's character seemed like an idiot to start off with. I'm not sure that the character wasn't an idiot. Heck I didn't remember any of the character's names five seconds after I stepped out of the cinema.The film did appear to pay homage to other films but it could not decide what it wanted to be - crime thriller, political thriller, comedy, action adventure, 1940's detective story. Its all well and good to be genre breaking if you actually are doing something original. This wasn't particularly. It's just the same old thing we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing that makes this stand out above those is the director and big name cast.Moving on to the plot - it really became confusing when I started to think about it. Firstly - How did Clive Owen's character know that Plummer's character dealt with the Nazi's and kept evidence of this in an unmarked safety deposit box? Why didn't the police find them when the hostages where released? I don't see how they couldn't have found him, they would have gone over that place with a fine tooth comb.How did he manage to walk out from the basement of the bank with no one stopping him? Surely there would have been security and the video cameras would have been working by this point.Why didn't Plummer's character empty his safety deposit box after the robbery? The more I think about it the more annoyed I get that this film made it to the big screen but is so riddled with plot hole. If this was a boat it would have sunk by now because of all the holes.The film looks good and has very good performances but do not attempt to delve below it's glossy exterior. If you have two hours ten minutes to waste by all means go and see it but do not whatever you do start thinking about the plot.",Inside Man
450,d4wn0ff473,Unfortunately disappointing,5,3 April 2006,"Unfortunately I found myself drifting during this movie. It was not hard to follow, in fact from within the first thirty minutes I had figured out the entire plot line, and had lost interest in what was happening on screen. The overall message of the movie is very good, but gets lost in poorly cut scenes, and scenes that are repeated. The campy music doesn't help the mood of the film either. Spike Lee attempts to recreate a campy heist movie, but only comes close to it, and then falls off the cliff before barely saving himself at the bottom. One of the major flaws in this movie is that There is too much open to the viewer to attempt to figure out for them selves after the movie ends. He leaves you nothing to figure out, and spoon feeds you everything important without even asking you if you wanted to eat first. Half the fun of a heist movie is having to figure out how they planned the job, and what their motivation was. Since you find out what their motivation was a quarter of the way through the film you lose interest in the main plot line, and stop caring about what is happening. For die hard Spike Lee fans you should see it he has his usual cuts, controversial dialog, but for the average Heist movie buff stay away, and wait for DVD its really not worth seeing in theaters.",Inside Man

You are a very beautiful woman, you are a great actress: find a good film as leading role and win another Oscar! You can do it! By the way, the film was average: not energetic, not emotions, pretty smart plan but... I wonder if the bank robbers had a change of clothes... because the police could find who they were, just giving the clothes to the proper owner. Who had no clothes (apart from the coverall) belonged to the band (apart from the diamond-Jew guy)! The actors were all good, but the story was left uncompleted, too many holes. Why Danzel W. gave the bugged pen to J. Foster and no story followed? Why the ring was left behind if there was no use of the Nazi document? gaps holes and a lot of questions!",Inside Man

How many movies have i seen in the last 20 years about busting the ""secret NAZI"" as if i have ever met one. I found this plot so ridiculous its beyond belief. Bank robbers who are not bank robbers yet are, and fake a killing of a hostage. That was dumb. Then there is Plummer playing the part of the hiding Nazi collaborator. That story has been done enough. I get the point OK. Nazis are bad guys. Tell me something i don't know. Spike has done some great movies. This does not cut it.

454,movieman826,"Denzel is great as usual, Spike lee sucks as usual.",8,24 March 2006,"I give this movie a six because of the two poor stars Denzel and Jodie who did what they could with this mess of a movie. The plot is surprisingly smart, I will give it that much, but that much only. As with ALL spike lee movies the trends continue. The opening and closing song is weird as all get out, and does nothing to set the tempo of the movie or have any meaning at all. The pace of which spike makes this movie is exhausting and boring. It seems every second is a shot of more cops on the seen, or of irrelevant surroundings. The worst element of the movie is the continuing and COMPLETELY unnecessary racial slurs that are found in ALL spike lees so called films, against Arabs,Mexicans, and others(in this film). It seems Spike lees never ending bitterness with society will never cease from his films, and we are left to suffer. More than a half hour of ridiculous shots could have been cut, add a little excitement, and maybe people will wake up for the surprisingly good ending.",Inside Man
455,Satchmo_on_Satchmo,Spike Lee: the sound and the fury,5,5 August 2007,"So, audiences and critics alike seemed very happy to judge this movie as Spike Lee's finest. What a laugh! I mean, there's some intelligence here, without question, and humor too. But, Spike Lee's best? What happened to Malcolm X? Do the Right Thing? Clockers or even Bamboozled? See, the main problem with Inside Man is that the film's turns aren't half as dramatic as the film's makers want you to feel they are. Lee simultaneously draws upon and contrasts the film against old heist classics such as Dog Day Afternoon. As a result, we get a film with edges far, far more interesting than its basics are. We get the Sikh bank worker who complains about his rights being violated and the young boy with the ultra-violent video game that the character Dalton (Clive Owen) is shocked by, and so on. At least the film's denouement is full of interesting bits that help compensate for the heist portion's ineffectiveness. Nonetheless, this is Inside Man: confusing, uneventful, and not half as important as it would like to be.",Inside Man

Throw a few explosions at them, and some whacked out main character that solves his problems with fists and they rate it a ten. And you get extra points for CGI it seems.This movie was great! It reminds me of some of the old detective fictions that were made in the 30's and 40's like the Maltese Falcon, and then later on in the 70's Chinatown. No, Denzel didn't use a gun and blow stuff up ever chance he got, but he was intelligent and methodical in solving the case. It was actually quite nice to see Denzel finally step out of his role as the 'angry black man' and do something different. Until this point, I was convinced he was quite one dimensional.This movie moved us through the 3 stages of a detective fiction very fluidly. It also managed to do it in a modern context. While using all the new tricks of film and the technology that we have developed, the film still adhering to the classic detective fiction motif.The filming was excellent, and the director managed to get tons of great shots in that helped to set the tone for the movie. The closeups on the characters, the rackish angles that cause uneasiness, and the double focuses helped to present us with a story and feeling that is really unsurpassed by just about anything that has come out this year. AND BEST OF ALL IT IS AN ORIGINAL MOVIE, NOT A Sequel, A COMIC BOOK, OR A REDO! Thank you Spike Lee for doing something real and different!",Inside Man
457,yossarian2852,New look at Genre succeeds,9,3 April 2006,"I found this movie very surprising and interesting. It kept me guessing throughout as to the ending and the motives of all involved. Denzel, as usual, was outstanding. When a movie sends you back to IMDb to check the screenwriter and check the rest of their work then someone did a hell of a job. You could nitpick here and there but ultimately it was a very entertaining movie that was well worth the time and money. Spike Lee is a polarizing figure to some but you have to give him credit for making quite a few movies that were important, riveting, and entertaining. He is very talented as far as getting good work from his actors. I look forward to watching him confound his detractors for many more years.",Inside Man
458,mdassen80,Very good plot. But big continuity faults.,7,19 April 2006,"I think the plot was very original. It's certainly not ""just another bank robbery"".Denzel Washington's performance was good. He played an officer that used his humor on the job. Although the movie could have been better without one or two continuity faults. Normally I don't notice them, so I guess they were big ones.The most irritating one for me was: - Robber was holding someone on gunpoint, and threatening the hostage. - Next frame, the gun was down his side again.Conclusion: My advice is to go and see this movie. I'll probably buy it myself on DVD, because of the good plot.",Inside Man
459,RioRep,Thriller with too many hole plots,6,26 March 2006,"I just don't like when I go see a thriller a find out that the plot has so many holes. If you can't explain a story why bother making it? But the movie captivates my attention due to its good acting, even though I felt that Jodie Foter's character was a good one and was under utilized. I left the cinema with so many questions that went unanswered. Why would a guy keeps proofs of his past which he's ashamed of? And why keep diamonds along with the proofs? How did the thieves know that these proofs were in the bank box? How would Denzel's character be able to frame the bank owner just with the ring, since it's not clear they'd go public with the proofs? And if they are, why give Denzel the ring? It seems to me that their goal was to make the owner pay for his collaboration with the Nazis.I give it a 6 because of the actors and because the movie in most parts is entertaining.

The big part of the story can be predicted from the start. Sometimes things are just too obvious. The end of the hostage taking is so predictable that you could be blind and figure it out just by listening to Gewirtz, and finding out that things will be just like you predicted. Not at all what was expected from their trailer promotional blitz. I am giving this a 6 only because I have seen worse.

Alas her part is not very exciting - it is superficial, barely sketched character with no depth, personality or history. Denzel Washington has much bigger role but seems miscasted - his part has zero opportunities to demonstrate his athleticism and attempts to give him some personal history are very amateurish. Overall impression - muddy writing - chopping story into small flashbacks and potential future results is gimmicky and does not contribute much to suspense, average acting (even given the mediocre parts), completely improbable ending (first thing cops would do is to bring bomb sniffing dogs that would easily detect hiding person) and weird and forced storytelling. You will watch it and you end up feeling like you truly wasted two hours - and you might as well have rented ""Jesus Christ - The Vampire Killer"".",Inside Man

The first 15 mins set of at awesome speed, then it almost grinds to a halt, the story is dragged out and the film is VERY confusing, leaving things unexplained, and having very inappropriate funny scenes. Living in Glasgow Scotland, iam not sure how the race issues are in the united states, but spike lee almost shoves them down your throat in this, and places very OBVIOUS token race stereotypical characters in their supposed rightful places. Someone else mentioned it on the IMDb review of this film, why the hell were they digging that hole, maybe I just missed it, but its the simple things like this that were NOT explained. The film is so slow in parts, you are left with nothing to do, but guess the inevitable escape route of Clive owen's character, the big twists people spoke of just never happened, and the film ends so abruptly its almost insulting! I had SO many questions about this movie it just failed to answer, I have to say the heist movie has been done 10 times better than this, with lesser known actors, William Dafoe was playing a roll the tea boy could have played, he is 1 of Hollywood's best, and so under used in this its laughable.

I will agree it was a good movie.....just not great. To me the movie dragged, I was hoping more would happened, and when the ending came, I was dumbfounded. Some parts I agree were cool, the acting was great, but not powerful. Some people compared it to ""Dog Day Afternoon"", I disagree.

Denzel could play Bivouac, another Vulcan (Tuvok's uncle) and Old Bill Shatty could play himself again.I will go on to say that Denzel was very superb when I saw him speak to Mr Shatner once when I saw them together.

Superficially this is about everything the film is trying to tell. But deep down it is trying to scratch much more serious issues like racism , holocaust , 9/11 syndrome ,the influence of gangster rappers and violent video games to young ones of the society.But from my point of view the film cannot executes these ideas as well as Dalton Russell executes the heist.Nevertheless the remaining part of the film is exciting and easy to watch thanks to Spike Lee.I personally love the chaotic rush when Dalton release all of the hostages and the remaining members of his gang out of the bank.The fascinating cast of Inside Man makes the film more enjoyable.Clive Owen is really in the character of Dalton Russell.After his monologue , I was convinced that this Dalton guy is not like any other thief and has a greater motive beside money.Denzel Washington also did a real good job but Jodie Foster is sensational.What an acting.From my point of view she is the best thing in this movie.Normally I'm not really fond of Jodie Foster but she is really sensational.I would never think that she is capable of acting so mysteriously.The eerie smile of hers explains the powerful position of her character.The way she is acting convinced you that her character is at the top of the game.Great acting.Final thing; about the perfect plan.I don't think it is a perfect plan.I think it is just a simple plan.

467,alpapad,Not your std Bank Robbery,7,19 August 2006,"Spike Lee peppers a standard master-mind bank robbery story with his socially-conscious director's eye - and the result is well worth seeing. The camera is a bit more focused on creating atmosphere than just shoving the action in your face, and characters are not what you would expect from a std production. Let's just mention black detective K.Frazier(D.Washington), with a dirty mouth and masterfully bordering on caricature (but since it is a black director shooting this, nobody will complain about political correctness!). Passing but clever and humorous social commentary on America's preconceptions works well with the action.

Performances are excellent.It is a pleasure to again see an excellent ""older"" actress in a major role. It is also good to see the excellent African actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, from the excellent Dirty Pretty Things, is still obtaining opportunities to act.No Oscar-worthy aspects that are present in Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Four Little Girls or the unfortunately ineligible When the Levees Broke, but excellent.",Inside Man

Honestly some of Spike's best work. Inside Man... the film - the latest release that we are blessed to receive from the man who I hold in such high regard is a great film. We have here a clever script, a good story and some astonishing entrance-scene shots to a film I have seen in quite some time. So what's all this hoo-haa about this being a Spike Lee Joint or not? So many people have been adamant that it isn't, but I have to dig the proverbial knife and twist it into those who think they know so much but rarely do produce the goods to show that they have knowledge of ""Spike Lee Joints"". This IS a ""Spike Lee Joint"" for two main reasons: 1. it was his work and 2. it was his WORK. 25th Hour was not a Spike Lee Joint as is everyone's perception of the phrase, but a lot of people certainly categorize it in such a way. What everyone considers a ""Spike Lee Joint"", I admit, has a slightly different look and feel to this all, but for a while now he has gone slightly more main-stream with his choice of topic. But more to the film here: Denzel was good, Clive Owen was bland (purposefully), Jodie Foster was her usual charismatic self and Chiwetel Ejiofor was and is proving to be quite a force to be reckoned with. The bit-parts played by Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe were also a wonderful inclusion. The film had it all: Scenery, Great Acting, Great Camera-Shots and a great soundtrack.

Instead I will just say what a fantastic movie this is! The story is gripping from start to finish, the acting top notch and Spike Lee's direction is a pleasure to watch. This film is a wake up call, showing that every film doesn't have to look and feel identical.Perhaps the best thing that can be said about this movie is that there is not one single cliché in the whole movie. Characters never say or do anything that they would in every other movie made in the last ten years. So many times in modern cinema, if they were to pause the scene you could finish the end of the character's sentence or complete the ending. The dialogue rings true in every instance and the plot and characters are both highly intelligent and compulsively interesting.This movie is a ride that you don't get off until you're fumbling for your car keys, replaying the plot in your head. I found myself giggling with delight as I watched the story unfold with so much expertise that it made me ask why the hell can't there be more movies like this? Spike Lee has made films of this quality before but never with so much pure enjoyment to be had. This movie shames every other movie made in the last few years and is the sort of movie that should be winning all the Oscars. It's original, smart and doesn't take ANY cheap tricks which spoil most movies.While I've seen some other good movies in the last year or two, this is the first film where I've walked out of the cinema wanting to walk straight back in.

I really enjoy watching Denzel do his thing in front of the camera. But he didn't have the magic like I saw in Man on Fire. Maybe it wasn't him. Possibly, it was direction. I could really see him being left to figure out this character on his own. That's all well and good. He has his trademark style. And it does work. I think Tony was able to bring something extra out in him though. I felt like Jodi was there to give her lines and pick up a check. I love Chris Plummer. But I found him far more entertaining as a Klingon... Storywise, I thought it was good. The edit though just had it jumping back and forth. And ultimately, I felt that the cut was the biggest let down... Plot holes abound, anyone could easily infer what was missing... Music? I was confused. Where was Sean? I kept feeling like I was supposed to be watching a James Bond film. Listen to it again. Straight out of a Bond flick, w/ the exception of the occasional gangster tones and brass. Either way, the images didn't live up to the grandeur of the soundtrack... Technically, it was okay. I felt like the cameraman was playing around w/ too many looks. They were nice. But they were never consistent. Too many buzzed shots. Sound and post audio were fine. The transfer looked fine. Art was great.All in all, just not my movie. Plenty of people liked it.

473,david__T,Good - but not that good,7,15 August 2006,"I went in to this film with high expectations due to the cast and whilst their performances were fairly good, the film as a whole was not as great as I'd hoped. As a hostage movie I found The Negotiator with Sam Jackson far more entertaining and the start of Swordfish with Hugh Jackman far more exciting (the worlds largest walking claymore mines). I found the story interesting but once I got the gist of what was going on I just found myself wanting to get to the end, not really caring what happened along the way. As a bank robbery movie I found the whole process of Oceans 11 and Heat far more interesting and cerebral. I won't give anything away and talk about the ending, but when it comes, considering the fairly slow build up, it is one of those ""oh right"" moments but it doesn't hit you like the ending of Planet of the Apes or The Usual Suspects. So to summarise, an interesting journey, but not one to add to your DVD collection for repeated viewing.

Every time I thought I had figured out what was going on, something changed. Some of it was predictable, but as a movie-going experience, it was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon. There were a few clever bits, and some hard to fathom, and some just plain hard to follow. Dialogue was decent if not sometimes stilted. Jody Foster's character did not fit in fluidly with her ""I've got something on everyone under the sun"" machismo. It was hard to understand her character--a little too black and white. Denzel is always great, but had many predictable lines. Between editing and dialogue, it was sometimes a little too clever for its own good. A plot this complex invites the audience to become a bit picky on believability issues. My first objection was why the NYC Police were running the show when bank robberies fall under federal jurisdiction. Where was the FBI? And why was a substitute, detective second- class, who was already in hot water with his dept. running the show in the biggest crime scene (at least in manpower) to hit New York in at least a month.

Great, surprising ending as well.Clive Owen proves once and for all, that he can carry the leading character in a blockbuster movie. He gets an A+ (and even outplays Denzel Washington)as a bank robber with a hidden agenda.I don't know what it is about Spike Lee, but he just seem to get better and better, and it really suits him not to fill his movies with morals ALL the time.

Is there no tragedy in human history or at present other than the Jewish holocaust that is worth presenting or is it mandatory that every movie that is going to talk about any human atrocity MUST talk about only the Jews from the Nazi holocaust? First of all, there have been many a tragedy in human history (and present) and this is not the only one to make multiple movies around each year. Secondly, even in the Nazi holocaust there were 6 million OTHERS than Jews who are deliberately and strategically absent in all these movies. PLEASE READ ""THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY"" as it very nicely explains all the facts and politics behind this exploitation of Jewish misery by the right wing (to the extent that I find myself reacting to the mention of it instead of the sadness and disgust one should feel at such a human tragedy, just like 9/11 being exploited by the U.S. govt. makes it difficult to remember the tragedy and not only react to the political exploitation of it).",Inside Man

Jodie Foster's character is very narrow-minded and lacks depth , Willem Dafoe plays very small role (even though he is one of the best in Hollywood) and Denzel plays as he does in his 95% of movies.But, the plot-twists are pretty new (not all of them), the music is good and Clive delivers a good acting. The script is occasionally smart but the dialogs often failed to impress the audience. The plot development is at a good pace and keeps you engaged and tensed, the ending tries to give you satisfaction and elevation which it does for a while , but after thinking a bit harder you realize that nothing was clearly solved or fully done during 128 minutes.Might help you to kill time, but do not expect an intelligent , smartly written thriller with shocking plot-twists and unique ending.",Inside Man
484,canon-stuff,Inside Man gets an outside audience.,8,26 March 2006,"It's nice to see Spike Lee back in film-making. It's even nicer to see he can actually do a mainstream film without shoving the race card every two minutes like he does in his repertoire. Also, it shows he has the skill to handle a big budget movie with skilled actors in every type of character role.The Inside Man is a movie with a typical bank robbery plot but the scripting, camera shots, dialog and unusual plot twist in the end gives this movie a big thumbs up. Intelligently written, fast paced real life dialog, cutaway shots, and duel cameras on actors from both directions highlight this film and creates the intensity required in a small space thriller. A lot longer than it should at 129 minutes, Spike Lee's skill as a director pieces together current and flash forward scenes right from the get go to hook the audience in what should have been a typical 'bank robbery go wry' second rate TV movie.Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, et al, portray characters who get caught up in a bank robbery at Manhatten Trust. A bank that is chaired by CEO Christopher Plummer who has a secret to hide and hires Jodie Foster to diffuse the situation and get that secret out of the safety deposit box before the robbers snatch it. Apparently, he helped the Nazi's during WWII against his own people (Jews) and used the blood money to set up the bank. The downside is he could be charged with war crimes and lose everything if the evidence is found. Hence, the power broking from Foster on his behalf of Plummer's character ad Clive Owen's Dalton Russell, the bank robber. Denzel plays the second rate cop who is forced to handle the hostage negotiations because his predecessor suddenly isn't available. Willem Dafoe plays the head of the tactical squad used to bring the muscle to stop the robbers. Clive Owen does an excellent job as the masked hidden bank robber who is always one step ahead of the detectives (mainly due to a hidden bug).Overall, it is an excellently executed affair on what would be a typical bank robbing plot. Much of this is due to first-time screen writer, Russell Gewirtz, and the unexpected twist in the film's climax. Spike Lee's experience as an indie type filmmaker can be seen with his unique piecing of the script through flash forwards mixed in with current plot development. His skill as a director in use of camera angles, dual cameras, motion shots, cutaways, and spacing of time kept the film intriguing and suspenseful in what was a dull bank setting. It's best to see this film in a wide screen cinema to get a sense of what Lee is trying to accomplish rather than viewing the future DVD.

489,tslateone,Unrealistic plot and characters with virtue signaling war crimes,1,24 December 2020,"Based on some of the reviews that range from incredible to bottom of the barrel I look at it from another perspective altogether. The problem here is that it is clearly a lame plot but tries hard to be realistic and at the same time virtuous.The guns are obviously fake, far too light-weight and never go off, knocking out bank cameras that are set 30-40 feet high with a hand-held laser and hitting the tiny lens with accuracy, 30-40 hostages acting way too scared of 5 robbers that are clearly a group of misfits and not hardened criminals, one shrill leader in Owens who has to drop the f-bomb 100 times a minute to be believable (not), you can clearly identify the ""thieves"" under police interrogation even though the police were played for dupes the whole time, the laughable fake hostage killing and the worst is that somehow after all of this the robbers get away scot-free and Owens hides inside the bank behind a fake wall for a week undetected(Heat/thermal detecting cameras anyone?).The clear acting winners are Jodi Foster, Plummer and Washington. Foster gets top honors because as the most believable and wanted everyone to hate her which takes all of 30 seconds into her role to achieve.The real problem is the virtue signaling from Hollywood where we are being led to believe that the evil caused by Christopher Plummer during WWII has been assuaged by a holier than thou bank robber, which is claims he's not at the end but that was In fact the intent. In other words, two wrongs make a right, the evil Plummer's deeds are momentarily revealed, a cherished heirloom turned over to the War Crimes division and Owens bands of misfits are now Robin Hood's merry men and one lady.It's a very touchy subject that should not be treated cavalierly by anyone let alone Hollywood and as anyone knows that cares to deal in truth the vast majority of new Euro wealth since 1945 is securely stashed away in secrets lairs and the most in Swiss bank accounts which so far the so-called neutral Switzerland retains a stranglehold on its ill-begotten gains which caused misery for millions. It's no secret that the Nazi's sold Switzerland looted Jewish, Dutch and others gold to pay for its war machine where the vast majority remains today.This is the second of Spike Lee's movies I've seen where he takes a direction that even though the subject is a mine-field he tries to wash away the evil perpetuated by the central character as minimal compared to the wrong-doings of the villain. In this case, Owens terrorizing bank patrons is outweighed by shining briefly a light on a Nazi War Criminals past all the while absconding with a massive diamond haul which he had no right's too either.Another misguided Hollywood virtue signaling movie where the true evil of humanity is a punch line. If they had stayed away from Nazi war crimes and the holocaust they perpetuated on millions just to virtue signal, then it could have been an average movie ignoring the amateurish bank robbers.Basically the ends justifies the means, in this case sorry no way, not even close.",Inside Man

His philosophy seems to be to replace quality dialog with gutter language. The premise of having the hostages dress like the crooks showed promise, but the actual script fell FLAT.

494,dewdoxx-1,"What more could a motion picture ask for? A palatable plot line, for starters.",5,5 May 2006,"Heist, dangerous weaponry and a venomous woman. What more could a motion picture ask for? A palatable plot line, for starters.Dalton Russell (Clive Owen, Derailed) wants to pull off the quintessential bank robbery--no, the perfect bank robbery. The scene is set in downtown New York's Manhattan Trust; Russell's gang waits for the perfect opportunity, when the bank is chock-full of hostages and the crew can slip in under the guise of paint workers. In typical Hollywood fashion, a uniformed police officer suddenly appears out of nowhere (poof!), casually strolling by the bank. As he peers in, he is greeted by the barrel of Russell's gun, which sets the stage for the rest of the two (feels like hundred) hours and nine minutes.Cops then surround the bank, led by Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington, Man on Fire), an ambitious fellow who has a checkered past stemming from a drug bust with missing loot. His sidekick, Detective Bill Mitchell played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers), acts as a springboard for Frazier, which provides some sniping comic relief.The story slogs ahead, merely passing with time. There is a lot of activity inside the bank, but nothing really happens within its formulaic plot scene and structure that one hasn't come to expect. To try and pick up the sagging middle, Detective Frazier challenges Russell, and, for a minute, adrenaline starts to resuscitate the character-driven storyline. Unfortunately, the plot device turns out to be little more than a trap door that leads to a garden-variety of nothingness. Clive Owen, as Dalton Russell, manages to keep his cool throughout the movie, even though no clear motive is ever offered on his behalf. The obvious choice would be money, but even that remains largely unaddressed by the end of the film. Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer, The Insider) delivers in his sinister role as the owner of the bank. He gets wind of the robbery and calls in glammed-up, corporate-shark Madeline White (Jodie Foster, Flightplan), an attorney with a set of brass ones--both on top and on bottom. Foster's character is svelte and polished, which she hasn't been on the big screen for quite some time. Of course, given her talent, she still manages to instinctively pull off the role of a ""bad guy"" as if she was born into it.Inside Man has the signature of a Spike Lee Joint (25th Hour) written all over it. Lee addresses some racial stereotypes, and the tricked-out camera zooms (with the help of cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Requiem for a Dream) are practically a fingerprint for the accomplished director. Denzel Washington fans won't be disappointed either, even though this movie doesn't stretch his acting abilities in the same way that Training Day, Malcolm X or Man on Fire did. It just doesn't have that kind of intensity, and even the all-star cast is not enough to patch up the holes in this sinking ship.Furthermore, if you're a connoisseur of a solid heist movie structure that delivers on queue with a few twists and turns behind door number three, you might want to stay outside, man.",Inside Man

Gone are the times of Lee's glory days with cheesy puzzles for the audience to figure out the killer in the nineties when that was socially acceptable, therefore Inside Man is a more darker, politically serious film that grips the audience with the relationship between both the ol' cop and robber. Denzel isn't getting any thinner or younger, but manages to hold his own as the smart, witty detective surrounded by his bumbling lieutenants and marriage crazy girlfriend. And if these problems weren't bad enough, he has a masked, husky voiced Clive Owen to deal with as well. Out foxing him at every corner; Lee has deliberately made Owen's character all most impervious to any of Detective Frazier's (Washington) offers, only heightening the suspense between the two. The script is monumentally clever, taking the audience through a series of rhetorical questions and enigmas for them to figure out by the end of the feature, and unlike every other crime drama, this one actually makes sense. I mean anyone can escape by building a secret room behind a wall in the bank and living there for two days on nothing but a tiny rug sack full of clothes and water. Okay, perhaps the ending is a little far fetched, but it makes sense in principal; not everything has to be extremely realistic ya know. A part of you is on the German-artifact stealing Clive's side, due to his extreme wit and severely cool personality; he's just an instantly lovable character. It will make you want him. Even men.

503,URBANCOW2001,First really worthy film of 2006,10,27 March 2006,"""Inside Man"" is a terrific film and a reminder that Spike Lee is still one of the best filmmakers in town. The film starts off as homage to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ends up a clever and entertaining heist drama like ""The Hot Rock"". First time writer Russell Gewirtz daft script sets up what would be a predictable scenario and turns into an intelligent caper with colorful characters and feasible situations. It has a nice 70's feeling to it and relays on the plot and characters to move the story instead of the overblown ""Bad Boys"" action mentality. Some people may find it anti-climatic but I think it works perfectly keeping situations at a low-key pace and the outcome is satisfying. Many may wonder why Spike Lee would direct a film he did not have a hand in writing; but after seeing the film you can understand because the script is that good. Another thing in Spike Lee's favor is him being a New Yorker; other than Sidney Lumet (in his prime) there are not too many directors who could capture that city and flesh out its character(s). The cast is perfect with Denzel Washington in fine form as usual, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, and the wonderful Chiwetel Ejiofor who has a great interplay with Washington.

And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble: Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However, don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film.

The characters of Dalton Russell and Keith Frazier make this a true cat & mouse game in which one is never sure if the mouse is too cool to be caught. Best left to the viewer to determine who is truly the bad-egg.Overall, another stellar performance from Denzel Washington, with great support from Clive Owen and Christopher Plummer. Was somewhat disappointed at Jodie Foster's character and felt that she overdid the cocksure nature of Madeline White. A little too grating and annoying for my liking and far from her best performance(s). The direction is interesting and varied with the typical Spike Lee trademark of the ""moving-non-walking-person"" - however some of the panned shots are nauseating and just that little bit too long.Overall though, a film that should please most who watch it. ****** For those who like the heist genre, a strong recommendation would be Jean-Pierre Melville's, ""Le Cercle rouge (1970), starring Alain Delon.

His intro was awesome and I consider it to be one the film's best moments.Since all of the action evolves around the bank robbery, we are pretty sure that the only motive for doing it is money. And if we wouldn't have been questioned about the 'why' in the beginning it would have seemed even weirder as it did. No I won't give away the plot, I'll just say that I'm glad I knew very little about it. The last half an hour turned the movie upside-down three times for me.It's not without it's problems though. The problem is the films pace and narrative is a bit slow in the first hour, but I feel that a lot could have been made better. The tension could have been screwed up tighter but you feel as if a lot is saved for the last half an hour. And yes a lot of (side) characters could have been developed a bit better. Yup, the hostage situation was definitely robbed of it's tension because of the last part. And the robbers were a bit too gentlemanly.Although this is a 'medium' budget Hollywood flick and by no chance an independent one, as I've said, you will be surprised.

Most of the reasons, for those who's like to know, come from the fact that it's directed by Spike Lee, a man not completely at home with doing Hollywood mainstream pictures. As a result nothing is really as it seems in Inside Man, nor really does the film know what it is. Is it a thriller? Is it a drama? Is it a racial/political dissection of society today (a subject it bizarrely delves into)? In fact Inside Man is rare breed of cross-genre cinema. Still with us? OK.When a group organised robbers (led by Clive Owen's Dalton Russel) attempt to take over the New York trust bank, inexperienced detectives Frazier (Washington) and Mitchell (Britain's Chewiel Ejoifor) are sent to try and relieve the situation. Soon there's more to the robbery than it seems, as bank owner Christopher Plummer (the captain from The Sound of Music) discovers the robbers may be after one of his gems locked deep in that very bank. So he hires the suitably deceitful Madeline White (Foster) to sort things out.Yet as the plot twists and turns, nothing really happens to make the heart leap a beat. The excitement level remains pretty constant and although we have flashbacks, flash-forwards and even some flash-bang grenades, it's seems so clever it can't really get off the ground. However there's much to take away from Inside Man. The performances on the whole are spot on  Clive Owen  a particularly changeable actor (great in Closer, rubbish in King Arthur) particularly underplays his part to perfection. Jodie Foster is also superb as the mighty Manhattan bitch who's back-room deals and subtle conniving tries to outwit the brains of the aforementioned Owen. Denzel Washington, while never going lengths to add anything to his part, is also fine as the NYPD man making sense of the situation.The plot, featuring everything from Albanians, boob sizes to Nazis (yes, Nazis) is clever to a certain point, but starts to lose much of the groundwork it made towards the end. It rollicks its way through the first hour and a half before screenwriter Russell Gewirtz seems to have made a hash of a potentially great conclusion (e.g. what happened to Willem Dafoe?). And yet it seems Spike Lee maybe trying to make a point, be it political or ethical through Inside Man. He frequently points out stereotypical racism (arabs are terrorists, etc) or even that there's more to life than money (Washington's Frazier says from the start that the robbers don't want cash  ""Who ever heard of a bank robbers escaping on a plane with fifty hostages? This ain't no bank robbery!""). If there was a subplot to be found it's dissolved by the cluster of events in the story. Owen points out at the start ""pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and never repeat myself"" and that's exactly what you've got to do. The events go so quickly that you'll be forgiven for losing track early on. However, if you do keep track 'til the end Inside Man is a rewarding, if bewildering experience.",Inside Man

When the cop pulls of a mask of a guy and see's he has dark skin he goes OH MY GOD ITS A F'N ARAB!!! And he's taken down/beat up. Yes, this can possibly happen, but I highly doubt they would.And how about the ""video game violence""? Ooo video games cause people to be gangsta killa's eh? Too many points were trying to be shown, and they were shown very poorly.I was highly disappointed with this film because the fact that it's been advertised as having huge twists and turns, and there's hardly anything at all to make your mind freak out.... just a mindless heist film with a poor script.Oh yeah!

So though at first it it is good to watch, one eventually longs for it to cut to the end. Best seen it on TV so that one can fast forward through the repetitious sequences.At the end it is never clear why Jodie Foster character was in the film ( except to give her a salary) or how Chris Plummer could have been a general during World War 2 and then still be running a bank in the year 2000.There are too many lose ends so that after the end the viewers ask themselves how it was supposed to end.

When they were on the ground after they rushed out of the bank, none of them can be identified to the audience as being on one side of the ""crime"" or the other. The audience is surely searching each person in a painter smock to find Owens' character.What, Denzel doesn't count hostages when he gets the tour of the bank in the middle of the night? Clive Owens' character walks out of the bank basement in the middle of the day wearing sunglasses? And is going to smell terrible and still manages to bump into Denzel's character? The antagonist banker character does not look old enough to have been involved in the Nazis at an age where he'd be a businessman? What was his occupation with them anyhow?Strange that the final twist involves Frazier presumably giving his fiancé a diamond that would have belonged to a family that died at the hands of the Nazis.

519,RArmida,"Kinda Like ""Quick Change"" W/O the Laughs",8,28 March 2006,"Slick heist film with hints of Hitchcock's cat and mouse and Bill Murray's Grimm in ""Quick Change"" without the laughs. A great film from Spike Lee who keeps the action in front of the camera and the viewer's eyes on the characters faces. Superbyly cast with Denzel, sans strut but jauntily taunting the audience with the deft handling of a hat, the cool Clive Owens who manages to play the heavy without all that rage we've seen so often as to become boring, and as the consummate power brokers a very thin but ever so lovely Jodie Foster and 'when for the love of mike will he stop making movies', Chistopher Plummer.The word and gun play aren't spectacular but the film keeps you involved in trying to figure out what is going to happen next even though much of the plot is transparent. Spike gets off a few zingers about the police, racism and stereotyping and kid's video games but adds a black perspective in Denzel's professional and personal lives.Catch this one on the big screen as some of the dark scenes will be lost on your home entertainment center, its a good one.",Inside Man

521,theone2088,Extremely Well Shot,9,25 March 2006,"Admittedly, I walked into ""Inside Man"" with skepticism. I am no film buff; nevertheless, I was pleased with this movie.Something that jumps out from the screen is Spike Lee's talent. He shoots every single scene with a uniqueness that is rarely seen in this type of flick. The most natural movements performed by the actors are made special through Lee's eye for camera direction.On the note of the thespians, the acting in ""Inside Man"" was top notch. Although I often doubt the range of Clive Owen's acting, he was certainly made for this role. However, Jodie Foster seems miscast. Having been in countless films and earning her reputation as a good actress, her talent is underused. She is much more suitable to be a main character as she is too memorable to be a supporting character.One awkward problem in the movie is some of Lee's preachings that are fitted into this film. I do agree with much of what is said in the film such as violence being exposed to young children and also much of the racism that is still evolving in our community. However, at a moment or two, this heist flick seems to be preaching to the audience while the audience did not ask for it. Though, this is not too much of a turn off.What is remarkable about ""Inside Man"" is the startling human nature of the characters and plot. The classic merciless hostage situation is dodged. What makes sets this film apart from the average heist flick, without spoiling the movie, is pretty much summed up in Denzel Washington's eloquent words from the trailer, ""this ain't no bank robbery!""",Inside Man

That word may mean too much to some but if you watch this movie you will stay seated to the very end and be immensely entertained. I hardly think any movie is worth 10/10 because there is always mistakes. But the score I gave Inside Man is easily a strong one.The acting is top noticed and the writing and directing is tight. of course the movies borrows from some but no way do see the plot twists and turns till the very ending...and you still may not get it.All the main and supporting characters interaction fun, serious, and not forced. You believe these people in their roles become each character acts differently and the cast is so multi-racial its hard not identify with anyone.

But ,bottom line, a really well done, well written, superbly casted and directed film. Most impressive was a really excellent supporting cast, including a brilliant job by actress Florina Petcu as an Albanian ""Major Babe"" who translates language of the old glory days in Albania and the voice of Enver Hoxha to be heard in a totally integrated U. S.A, a true blast from the past! Jodie Foster was remarkably well cast as the ultimate power woman.

She even felt that if she stopped to ask me what was happening, she may miss something. It's the type of film you may well need to watch twice to check for plot holes or to make sure that what you thought should have happened, was actually a possibility, even though what did happen, was completely feasible.

But the Closed circuit television tape would clearly show everyone who entered the bank that day, so everyone would be able to recognise themselves and be recognised by others from these pictures, entering the bank. The robbers entered the bank dressed as painters and can thus be separated from those who entered the bank dressed normally. Only the inside man could not be identified as a robber as he was on surveillance tape entering the bank normally dressed. The con would thus only have worked if the robbers had all entered the bank dressed in normal clothing, but they didn't did they.

I do have to give credit to the only man who can look like Nicholas Cage/Bill Murray for his spooky portrayal of a desperate man. I think Spike Lee went out on a limb to do a real action flick starring more than two mainstream Caucasion movie stars. I applaud him for that.

Lieutenant Columbo, the cheaply dressed yet extremely intelligent detective from the LAPD's Homicide Division, arrives to investigate Jerome's murder and instantly suspects Santini.

Four years of a liberal arts college and their conscience wouldn't make it through a murder! I believe this movie is about the fear of guns and violence, not their exhibition. It's about a group of bored, greedy white people desensitized by childhoods not as stimulating as the sci-fi adventures they obsessed over in middle school and after their BAs didn't get them their dream jobs the first or second run-around they took up with a genius, demented Clive Owen to become first-time offenders in a very big way.Then they got away with it!

Fear and intimidation are.Love that Spike Lee movies have these dozens of ideas to talk about. Clive Owen's weirdness is too great to avoid in this film.

The local police departments have ancillary jurisdiction. The FBI was nowhere to be seen in the movie. Banking transactions involve interstate commerce, placing bank robberies under federal jurisdiction, hence the FBI.Who is Madeline White and why is she so powerful? This is not really necessary to know, but leaving it completely unexplained makes it weird and a bit unbelievable. I thought using Owen, Dafoe, and Foster for these roles was a waste of money. These roles are so minor, they could have been played by ""cheaper"" actors, except for the box office draw.I like Mr. Owen, he is a pretty good actor when he is not performing from behind a sock mask. In this movie it could have been anybody playing his role and it wouldn't have mattered. He is facing the camera for merely minutes. I was offended by the ""pimpish"" stereotype of Mr. Washington's attire. It detracted from the character. What's with that hat? and the big ill fitting suit?

544,vattiyoorkavuvysakh,This Bank Heist Is Surprisingly Entertaining,8,11 August 2011,"Inside Man,directed by Spike Lee is a slick,witty and surprisingly well made thriller.Making the most of its worn out and familiar theme,the end result is a satisfying and entertaining watch.When a group of robbers under Dalton Russel(Clive Owen) successfully manages a local bank heist,its up to Detectives Keith Frazier(Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell(Chiwetel Ejiofor) to make matters straight.When the robbery turns out to be a hostage situation,the detectives are forced to agree to the demands of the thieves to avoid possible casualties.Apart of the engaging thrills that movies of this genre usually offer,what I liked most about Inside Man was its humor.Even though few in number,some hilariously funny moments crop up unexpectedly at several instances that you would be laughing out loud impulsively.The plot twists never appear contrived and the initial Deja Vu is immediately taken care of by the clever and witty writing which ultimately emerges as the real winner.The intelligent script is further backed up by equally adequate performances.We do not see much of Clive Owen's face but his screen presence is enough to keep you engrossed.Equally good are Denzel Washington as super cool detective Frazier,Chiwetel Ejiofor as his partner Mitchell,Willem Dafoe as Captain Darius,Jodie Foster as the high profile and powerful fixer Madaleine.Christopher Plummer as the bank's founder and chairman deserves a special mention as he shines in the film's best comic scene.Inside Man is a movie that works tremendously despite its familiar plot.If you are willing to ignore its length which I personally felt was a little bit long(2 hours and 7 minutes),the film remains engaging,witty and entertaining throughout.So if you are yet to watch the movie,go to your local DVD shop,rent the DVD,sit back and enjoy.Satisfaction guaranteed.VERDICT : 7.5/10",Inside Man
545,padcast,One of the best movies i've seen lately,9,21 March 2006,"Saw this movie in yesterdays sneak here in Germany.Although you have seen hundreds of movies about bank robberies this one is definitely one of the best.It starts very fast, gets you right into the action and stays thrilling all the time. Only Jodie Foster's part seemed a little boring to me considering that till the end you don't get to know what her job really is. At least i didn't get it.A nice twist at the end forms the perfect ending of a bank robbery which is so much more.Weren't they digging a hole? What happened to that in the end?",Inside Man
546,Big_John,New Twists On Old Ideas,7,31 March 2006,"'Inside Man', the new Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington, Jody Foster, Clive Owen and Willem Dafoe, adds new twists on old ideas. Overall, it is an entertaining bank heist film.The actors played their roles by the book. The real credit here goes to Spike Lee. He adds mystique to the story by incorporating post heist hostage interrogations throughout the film. In doing so, he reveals a plot point that ordinarily would act as a spoiler but instead plays well into the drama.Aside from the bank robbers, there is an additional character with a nefarious past that has an interest in the goings on. This was the only real disappointment for me. The nature of his past initially seems as though it will be the emphasis for more conflict but it never comes to pass. Even though there is an implied resolution, that particular storyline falls flat. It would, however, be fodder for a sequel.The most intriguing component here is Jody Foster's character. She plays a sort of back-channel power broker. I couldn't help wondering if there is really a broad enough market out there for the type of service this character offers. Ms. Foster did well enough in the role, wearing a Bruce Willis type smirk through many of her lines. But the character is interesting enough to carry an entire film.If you like the bank robber genre, this film is worth seeing.Grade: B",Inside Man
547,bri_tdot,Very Entertaining Heist Film,8,24 March 2006,"All in all this movie was thoroughly entertaining. The heist plan was very ingenious, most of the main actors turned in great performances (particularly Denzel and Owens), the soundtrack was great and the movie was genuinely funny at times. In the age of the ten dollar movie, this was totally worth the money.That being said, there were a few things that knocked this movie down a few points. Firstly, some of the dialogue sounded very forced and unnatural (but surprisingly this only seemed to happen in the first half of the movie). Secondly, some of the ethnic characters which Spike Lee used in an attempt to show the true spirit of New York were clichéd at best and stereotypical at worst. Thirdly, the second half of the movie also seemed to be more interesting visually as Spike Lee employed some interesting camera work to give the movie a slightly different feel. Although the camera work in the first half was pretty solid, the movie could have been even better had Lee used some of this innovative camera work throughout the whole thing.Anyway, the bottom line is, go see this movie, you'll certainly be entertained and it'll definitely be worth the ten bucks.8/10",Inside Man
548,dimigriek,A not so typical Bank Heist,7,22 March 2006,"I saw this movie in Antwerp on ""de nacht van het examen "" yesterday. The story is about a typical bank heist with many familiar clichés. A mediocre director wouldn't be able to make such a joint as interesting as Mr. Lee does.I must confess I was slightly disappointed, because we've all seen this bank stuff before. However, this movie doesn't focus on the bank job in the first place. I believe it is merely there because of recognition and certain expectations.The social themes are important ( real issues about all layers of society, which is often very confronting ), like all Spike Lee joints, and besides that the movie is stacked with exciting scenes, twists, delicious humor, great performances ( Denzel Washington & Willem Dafoe did a great job )and a dazzling score from Terence Blanchard ( impressive orchestral music with Eastern accents, comparable with the ""25th hour"" score ).I was also struck by the cinematography, which offers impressive images of New York and is often quite inventive. The close camera-work really creates the feeling that you're part of the situation.I really recommend this movie, because it has enough power to get you satisfied. There were many many moments that I thought : THIS IS GREAT CINEMA! And that's what it is, not a masterpiece, but great cinema with a lot of interesting aspects.",Inside Man

550,Quintablo,Such awesome potential... wasted (possible spoiler... i suppose),6,30 March 2006,"Look, Denzel Washington was insanely awesome. Clive Owen was brilliant, and Jodie Foster was Jodie Foster (superb). The premise was excellent, but the writing and directing failed badly. The scenes were sooo slow, and it's not like it had to be, because there was nothing to think about in between. None of the characters have any good motivation, the ending is sketchy, and there is no real satisfaction to be found. If Denzel Washington wasn't so entertaining, I would have fallen asleep; and this is from a serious moviegoer (the newest Pride & Prejudice seemed like a non-stop twist every second thriller in comparison). I wasn't too keen on the meaningless racism with no theme or point either. Crash, this isn't. Props to Denzel (you earn the 6 out of 10 by yourself), Clive, and Jodie.

552,davem_04,This Movie S.U.C.K.S.,1,1 April 2006,"I don't know who wrote the other comments for this movie but I have a sneaking suspicion they work for the studio that produced the movie. Why do I say that? Because this movie was terrible.Somebody somewhere wanted to make a New York heist movie, and they got their hands on this weak script. So, as they do with all weak scripts, they threw money at it. They gave it a big budget, a well-known director (Lee) an A-list lead (Denzel) and a few of ""thespian"" secondary players (Foster, Dafoe and Owen) in hopes of making this ""joint"" classy.They failed miserably.Instead what you get is a jumbled heist movie with a racial commentary. Think Crash meets Die Hard meets the Negotiator.The dialogue is trite, and the plot really doesn't go anywhere. The actors' performances are as follows: Denzel is the same character in this movie as he is in 98% of his other movies.Dafoe is in it for the cash (nothing wrong with that, he's a cool dude).Foster needed a gig where she wasn't protecting her daughter from kidnappers.Owen is also in it for the cash (nothing wrong with that, he's a cool dude).And Christopher Plummer is the exact same guy he played in Syriana.The music score sucks, and the sub-plot with Denzel and his wife is useless and boring. What do I care about this guy's personal life? If I'm watching a movie like this, I want suspense and possibly some 'splosions, not a love story that goes nowhere.Then there's the whole Nazi diamond thing they stole from Marathon Man. The antagonists of this film, if you boil it down, are Nazis. Nazis. Seriously, when a New York heist movie that takes place in the present has to rely on Nazis, and not neo-Nazis but the ones from World War II, then something is seriously wrong. It worked in Marathon Man thirty years ago. It doesn't work here.In addition to all this awfulness, the movie does not want to end. You're sitting there waiting for it to end and it just drags on and on. Watch this movie when it becomes a movie of the week on television a few years from now.",Inside Man

Don't waste your time seeing it. This movie was pretty much an insult to William Dafoe, I mean, if you could give a man the worst script in a movie, they sure gave it to him, give him him a Grammy at least.

556,joeditt,Double fun,10,31 May 2009,"Hadn't heard of it, few days ago watched the announcement that it was to run yesterday at prime time, expected some nice above-average stuff. Completely wrong! I enjoyed one of the most intelligent crime thrillers I can remember. Containing enough action and truly dangerous scenes, but not trying to sweep boredom away with floods of blood. No, instead tickling both my cognitively operating and my jitter-causing nerves - dancing question marks here, frightful moments there. Lots of either.The end is ... naah, I wont tell - worthy finishing such a great story.Fortunately, I'm a night owl, and my fav station of Austrian public-law TV (ORF 1) reruns most of what's shown from 8 to 12 p.m. starting between 0:20 and - in case there's an extra night movie or something else between - about 2:30 a.m. This time, it was (after 8:15 p.m. for the first time) 0:20.But how can a solved riddle be entertaining, that shortly after having learned what it was all about? Oooh, it can, and how, thanks to Spike Lee and his team. No, I didn't watch a crime thriller of the usual sort (nont only because it wasn't quite usual at the first time) - I watched 118 minutes (hmmm ... and ORF NEVER interrupts movies or TV screenplays with in-between ads!) of intelligent, hilarious sarcasm. The whats were banal and ticked off now, the whys were known, but watching others - quite convincingly astute folks - guessing and being mislead, concentrating on the subtly woven context and the sophisticated, foxed orchestration - and then watching all the play being performed this way of all possible modes only because of a simple ... um, human need made it a second and totally different, almost greater pleasure.But don't forget it is about crime.

Nothing happens, and at no point in the movie do you believe anything is going to happen. Another curious problem is the movies'focus, we are pulled into a sub-plot regarding the bank owner, Nazi wealth, his personal high powered negotiator and the mysterious contents of a safe deposit box. This sub-plot petters out like a dud firework, the contents of the box are revealed too early and are not worth the effort anyway. The stars potter around looking for something to do, e.g Owen spends about 4 minutes just staring at the bank vaults contents with his back to the camera, wishing he were in another movie.The only way you know the director wants you to feel tension is with the ludicrously over the top thumping score. Nothing much is happening on screen yet the movie music is doing back flips and somersaults; a police bus putters to a stand still at the scene whilst the movie score pounds and wails to a crescendo, Denzel pours himself a coffee and the orchestra nearly catch fire.I could go on about the movies many faults, but I did watch it to the end hoping against all hope that the tedium would end with a final surprise pay-off.

A box normally requires t key to open a box, one by the box owner, Mr Case, and one by the vault banker person.

The movie sets the siege situation up nicely with fine acting from Denzil Washington and Clive Owen as the cop/robber protagonists. There's also fine support acting from Christopher Plummer as the bank's owner with a decidedly dodgy past and a superb turn by Jodie Foster who nearly steals the movie as a hard as nails bitch who is determined to get what she wants out of the situation. The movie rattles along at a pace and certainly keeps up your interest into how the robbers will get out of the bank when it is surrounded by New York's finest.

571,Wheezer-1,A crime film that will have you cheering for the bank robbers,6,13 March 2006,"Let me start off by saying I am not a Spike Lee fan. That said, this is not your average Spike Lee movie.The premise off the movie is a group of bank robbers led by Clive Owen under the alias of different versions of the name ""steve"" pull off a bank heist taking hostages. Denzel Washington comes to save the day as the chief negotiator who is under review for some embezzlement issues. The usually smart criminal throws the dumb cops on several wild goose chases scenario plays out in full, but is beefed up with an extra storyline including Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer.Although the movie is smart it just fails on every single level. Not once was I able to take the police officers seriously because they were all making painstakingly stupid decisions and Denzel's incurious cop persona.The composer from the music must suffer from a form of ADD. The music leaps genres in a matter of cuts and takes you completely out of the movie experience.The last complaint is the ending. The movie just drags way too long in the end and when you finally reach the conclusion it isn't baffling at all. You knew it would happen. You knew it a mile away because that is the only smart way to end this dragged out mess of things.The plus side of the movie is that Clive Owen and the bank robbers are highly enjoyable to watch. Its fun to see how they work and how they treat all the hostages. Maybe thats sick of me, but when Denzel keeps cracking out stupid jokes and all his cohorts force acting their laughs watching Clive Owen bully people around is far cooler.Congrats Spike Lee and Denzel Washington.

I expected more suspense or something to give it some IMF. Wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year but wasn't the best. All in all Denzels performance was good as usual but the rest of the actors were nothing great. Spike Lee uses a lot of racist comments about certain races which I found not to my liking but when it came down to the Nig*er word he made all sorts of sneaky little ways of people not using it which I thought was quite weak because when you down other races and leave your own out it makes you look weak.

Yeah, rob a bank and our genius plan: let's use toy guns because REAL guns might go off and hurt someone. Besides, we robbers are just political activists (all actions, no matter how obscene are good if politically driven) that want to expose corruption at high levels and get a little money in the process. So they end up with some diamonds. hooprydooo! The reward for their efforts is simply not worth it. Oh but the owner of the bank is a dirty Jew who used the Nazis to get rich. For SHAME! So?The problem is the movie is not as smart as it thinks it is and you can see what is coming years in advance. The characters are all stereotyped and the acting is...eh.I just can't help feel bad for Clive Owen. I liked him so much in Sin City. He did a good job here too but the more I think about it was seriously under challenged. And what is it with Denzel Washington? He plays the same guy in every movie he is in; the only thing that changes is the name and the job. Jody Foster's character annoyed me as I am sure she was supposed to. But she annoyed me because she was a little too over the top. Too condescending. I understand that that is exactly how she is supposed to be but like everything else in the movie it was just, just...wrong.Look, if you have got nothing to do, want to kill some time AND have the money to spare this movie isn't such a bad deal.

For example, at the beginning of the movie you're almost positive the villain is gonna be Clive Owen, but as it turns out, he's more of an anti-hero.

576,c-morrel,good but not great,7,2 June 2006,"...Good but not great...main thought..as often these days,i wish i was an editor ..it's just too long...""hellaccious cast"" right enough ..but there's enough material here for a tight ,hour long ""Hustle"" type T.V. outing...and /or a superior post 9/11 ""NYPDBlue"" type series...granted it might have to be Dennis Haysbert, not DenZEL..and Marg Helgenberger,not Jody Foster...but so it goes. Spike Lee was at pains to point out the homage to ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and in case any slow-witted film fan misses it ""Dog Day.."" is name-checked along with ""Serpico"" and ""Kojak"" ...the film that i had in mind most though was ""Quick Change"" the great Bill Murray comedy where he pulls a bank heist dressed as a clown( a central idea from which is employed here).Best aspect of ""The Inside Man"" is the great dialogue,laced liberally with the sort of gallows humour that Denis Leary's T.V. show ""Rescue Me"" employs so well..along with judicious use of location, this is where the authentic ""post 9/11"" feel plays it's part.The big ""political/race"" bit is Christopher Plummer's dark secret ...and that really is the whole point and conclusion of the film...but it keeps rolling and leaves things so open ended in the last scene that you almost expect ""to be continued"" to flash up...The film about the Levees being blasted...now that i want to see...Chris Morrell",Inside Man
577,serenity0323,Inside Man,6,10 April 2006,"Great job by Washington, as usual, and an overall average film. Not nearly as huge of a let-down as Lucky Number Slevin, but Inside Man was not all that intriguing itself. It has huge build-ups and some really suspenseful moments, but the ending leaves you feeling a little cheated.By all means, see the movie and judge for yourself - It just didn't deliver what I expected from it. I am most definitely not bashing the plot; you will be on the edge of your seat until the ending begins to be revealed. At that point you may feel like shrugging your shoulders and muttering ""eh..."". Washington does a great job of portraying his role, but you may feel a little resentful of his character's extremely bold/holier-than-thou attitude halfway through.",Inside Man

Clive Owen and his band of thieves is what really made this such a good movie. His personality is so well played,which indicates that he is the perfect man for this movie. I was so thrilled while watching this movie that i just want to see it a second time. This movie has a lot of great actors, and a lot of twists and turns. All the things you need from a great movie. Definitely a must see for all you movie watchers out there. this movie was a long one. this gave me all the more reason to watch it, and love it. and any one who has not seen this movie is really missing out.",Inside Man
579,Pixie28,Good but not great,5,20 April 2006,"Despite being a highly anticipated film from Spike Lee, i found myself slightly disappointed about the lack of cleverness and the obviousness of the supposed twists. Clive Owen definitely deserves some positive encouragement though, as the bad guy who you despise and fear at the beginning but can't help respecting and cheering for as the movie progresses. Jodie Fosters performance as the expressionless, emotionless private investigator (if thats what you want to call her), left me feeling a little empty and her role in the film could've been completely removed without anyone noticing. Chiwetel Ejiofor deserves a mention as despite his obvious lack of lines, his part in the good cop/bad cop scenarios leaves you wanting to see more of him and hoping for his sake (and yours!) he'll get to say something! Overall this movie has it's moments and the overall idea behind it is superb but it lacked the momentum and spark to make it a truly memorable movie.",Inside Man
580,lister_twister,There goes two hours ten minutes of my life I'll never see again,2,25 March 2006,"This week me and a couple of friends went to see the newly released ""Inside Man"" at my local cinema. They loved it. I on the other hand didn't. Now, I am not the sort of person that writes these revues but the way my friends hated me for not liking it really made me want to voice my opinions. I thought that ""Inside Man"" sucked frankly and the only reason why I gave it such a high mark was because I think of myself as over critical and any mark I placed would be unfair. At the beginning of the film I was exited as it got into the plot line quite fast and the small monologue from Clive Owen was quite good, but it just went down hill from there. I thought that all the characters were very clichéd, the screaming women screamed too much and the bank robbers were trying too hard to be, well, hard. The story line was nowhere near as complex as it should have been (warning if you still want to see this film, I am about to spoil the ending so don't read the next part) he was hiding behind a wall! What mastermind thought that one up, and personally I would have thought a bank employee of at least a year would have noticed that the storage wall was smaller than before. And another thing, if they moved the storage shelves forward how did they fit them all in again? I mean think about it! And if Clive Owen's character had thought of a excuse to tell the policeman, then the millions of cops wouldn't have turned up and they could have taken more than a hand full of diamonds that, by the way, would only fetch one hundred thousand pounds at most. And yes, I know that wasn't the point of the film as they couldn't be done for anything as the safety deposit box wasn't meant to exist blah, blah, blah. (if you skipped the last bit it's safe to read again) But the thing that annoyed me most about this film was the acting; it was awful. The extras were rubbish they didn't act like hostages at all; they were more like people that were going to be late for work. And finally we come to Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster. Now don't get me wrong, I mean I liked Denzel in ""John Q"", and ""Man on Fire"" was great, and I really liked Jodie Foster in ""Panic Room"" but they were staler than week old bread. First I will start with Denzel who has become type cast as one of those hard but smart, rough, tough, ""I grew up on the street"", black guys (I mean to cause no offence but if I have I am extremely sorry) and that didn't work. Instead he made the character look like a fool although he was meant to be smart (I'm really sorry if I caused offence again, really I am) and this sort of confuses the story line as I couldn't get why people thought he was so smart (sorry). And then finally there's Jodie (good in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" although Anthony Hopkins was rubbish) her character was meant to be smart as well as witty and sly. But guess what? That's right, she wasn't. She murdered that character. My summary is, that I would never see this again even if you paid me, but I have seen worse. There goes two hours ten minutes of my life I'll never see again.",Inside Man
581,gargamel-n-azreal,Complex but rewarding story,10,26 March 2006,"It was difficult to figure out the guts of the movie. In a sense, all were against Denzel and the mass won even if he knew there was something amiss. I think at the very end, he must have had some respect for the staged operation since a it would require painstaking practice and planning to pull such a crime off. In the movie, nearly everybody involved, right from the CEO and Jodie Foster (as a liaison) of the bank to some of the hostages. It was a clever plan to confuse all the hostages and to stage executions on video tape. The movie was great. It would be hard to imagine how much that money is needed to influence people in situations of chaos and desperation as the federal police cars, the city mayor, but the story does not detail the planning involved.",Inside Man

I think everyone who loves suspense movies will love this movie. I thought that Clive Owen did a wonderful job and Denzel was amazing too. It had so many twists and turns I loved every minute. It didn't take long to get started too which was a good thing. This will probably end up being one of my favourite movies ever! After i saw it I was so hyper and excited about it when I got home I put on a hoodie and white t-shirt then i pulled it over my face and put on some sunglasses i was just that crazy about it.

Spike Lee, has made some good movies over the years, but sad to say this is not one of them. 'Inside Man' entertains in part, but never really finds it's feet. There were many things I didn't like about this movie, but mainly just the obvious plot-holes, and bad pacing/editing. The movie also dealt with the underlying racism within New York city, in an obvious, crude way- Which didn't help or have any relevance to the story. Who knows, you may like this film. I have read many IMDb reviews over the years before heading to a movie - and found those reviews to be completely misleading. So see this movie, just don't spend $10 doing so.",Inside Man

When Clive Owen and his gang are entering the bank the are dressed like they are entering a contaminated area. Fully dressed with masks and all. The guard at the top of stairs looks at them and does nothing. Like he's used to them. Strange, while he doesn't even ask the Clive-gang about their intentions etc.The bank is situated in a huge building, which is at least 15 stories high. Strangely the whole movie is situated on ground level. We have to assume, that there are no more people in this massive building and the front door is the only way in and out?I do think CCTV is a kind of technology which is relevant in the guarding the safety of banks. Even CCTV which will monitor the entrance of banks. Nobody in the movie suggests to take a look at CCTV records, to see how many and how they entered the building.Still, a movie I recommend, don't get me wrong!",Inside Man

All my friends were also very satisfied with the movie. I believe this is one of the best performances I personally have seen by Clive Owen. And before you ask; Yes, I have seen ""Sin City"", ""Closer"", and ""King Arthur"". The soundtrack did also have it's unique twists. The song in the beginning was sort of remix of a traditional tune from India. Although the majority of viewers don't often buy that style of music, I did notice a lot of people affected by the catchy tune. In the theater people were tapping there feet to the rhythm, on the way out people were humming the tune, and out side the cinema there was actually two girls singing the tune to each other. Thats the first time I've seen that happening. Way to go, Spike Lee! Bringing the world together.",Inside Man

Yes a couple of jokes, no absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes, it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us. IF someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell, it could just make my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted, and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid...its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy...",Inside Man
587,hnotk,Schizophrenia at the Multiplex,6,2 April 2006,"""The Inside Man"" boasts some great lines and some stinkers. Thrilling scenes and quite long stretches that'll push you to the edge of sleep. Distinctive characters and ludicrous ones (Jodie Foster does what she can with one of the latter). Inventiveness and cliché.Just when it your rattles your preconceptions, it settles you back down with Denzel doing Denzel, take eight (great actor, shame about the parts), and Christopher Plummer doing late-period Christopher Plummer (even greater actor, shame...). Just when it dazzles you with virtuoso film-making, it makes you tear your hair out -- it certainly seems to have made Denzel tear his out -- over an absurd McGuffin and more holes in the narrative logic than there are in the case for invading Iraq.Spike Lee has tremendous visual flair. And he has come up with an ingenious solution to the problem of explaining the many hard-to-fathom plot details: he doesn't bother.",Inside Man
588,JewishPrayBoy666,Let down,7,2 April 2006,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until the end. They build up this great story and there is all this tension and then...it ends. I felt cheated. I mean until the end the movie was fantastic and then to have something that simple was a let down. The best example I can think of is to compare everything until the end as Ocean's 11 and the end be called Ocean's 12. Anywho I still think you should go see it just don't be surprised at how much of a letdown the end is. Another bad things is they build up non-essential characters and I think that wasted time which could have been used to work on a better ending. Besides all that I like the cinematography and thought they did a good job as far as special effects goes.,Inside Man
589,bnye,"Good movie, but................",8,3 April 2006,"The trailers for this movie got me out of the house, which doesn't happen very often, but because of Denzel W. and his last 3 or 4 movies this movie seemed very promising.This movie is interesting, but very slow paced and caused my wife and others in the theater to lose interest half way through the show. I was waiting for some Denzel Washington magic, the great acting was there, but the bad-ass take names was restricted due to the plot of movie and thats what me and I'm sure everyone else was expecting. I wanted/needed a little more info on Denzel's character as well. It somewhat plays a small role with the interactions of Jody Foster's character. To me if a movie is going to show and bring people into the main characters personal life then do it. Otherwise its pointless.This is why I don't go to the movies very often, the trailers lie and so do the critics that say something like ""Jody Foster is at her best"". When her role in this film was an average role, nothing to spectacular to act and average actress could have done just as good. I'm not trying to take anything away from her, she is a good actress, she just had an easy part to act. Still this movie is good, but sell the movie as it is. Don't make it sound like its another ""Man on Fire"" when its not. Don't tell me there's many twists that will have me on the edge of my seat, when actually there is one twist and it was given mid-way though the movie.

590,ian-1026,"Lame, lame, lame!",3,15 April 2006,"Just saw this movie last night after recommendations from this site. Boy did I make a mistake there! I'm sorry but anyone who enjoyed this film has to be kidding.This film is garbage. Predictable ""twists"", and flawed in so many ways regarding the plot, this movie offered nothing. It was about 2 hours long but after the opening 15 minutes I was bored.There are no ""heroes"" in this film. Denzel Washington, playing the detective on the case conforms to your typical cocky and sexist New York officer. In one scene, we have the detective and his buddy leering at a woman's chest, due to it's ampleness when they are questioning her. That got a few giggles. That was the level of the humour.The Indian guy who gets pulled in for questioning and protests about his turban being confiscated and being called an Arab by one police officer is just silly also. It just doesn't put people of Indian descent in a good light, and just re-enforces this stereotype that these people are different to us normal, rational people, and are a bit strange.We have the ""likable villain"" (Clive Owen's character). How can someone who takes hostages be a likable person, although you're encouraged to think of him this way due to the underlining story. And without giving away the story, how was his decision at the end realistic, and the reaction to his decision by his cohorts for that matter? There's one scene when the detective learns of the horror of a new event and in his shock the director chooses to show a close up of him and make it look as though he is pulled to the scene without his conscious effort, or will. As though he was possessed or something. It was laughable.This film in essence was predictable, boring and implausible.

This movie SUCKS and I know I'm in the minority in saying that, as far as the comments here go. I went looking for good suspense and came away asking, ""Was there even a point?"". Denzel marches around like a good detective should but ultimately does nothing to solve the mystery, except interview some previously held hostages... who also, not coincidentally, add nothing but some different accounts of a robbery that doesn't even happen. Jodie Foster smiles a lot and perfects the Miss-know-it-all role, yet knows nothing more than Denzel except that which her boss, Christopher Plummer - the lone shining star in the film - reveals to her. (Denzel, of course, is tipped off by the bank robber himself... knowledge which ends up serving no purpose.) No one in the packed theater laughed more than five times, 3-4 of those being mere giggles. And the absence of laughter was not due so much to the presence of suspense as it was simply due to the complete LACK of it. One person I know was sleeping. The person in front of me had her head slumped over, resting on her knuckles. Twists? Yes, but they're minor. Oh and the movie has plenty of the f-bomb and G-d -- if these words are a regular part of your vernacular, then by all means spend the $8/8.50 or whatever and 2.5 hours to see this movie.

592,robt-nash,Great Movie,10,4 April 2006,"Is it only me but does anybody think the there were more than four people involved in the heist? I think there were, at least, four other accomplices involved (The rabbi, the rack, the kid who wouldn't wear his mask, and the old lady who refused to take off her clothes). Here's my reasoning: At the end of the movie, after everyone was questioned, Denzel Washington said that all the kidnap victims vouched for each other. This was not a bank robbery but an attempt to unmask the bank president who became rich on the backs of the Jews during WWII. Maybe I'm over thinking this but I think the original crew needed the accomplices to throw off the police which would explain why the rabbi and the old woman would go along, knowing that it was never going to be a bank robbery.

I suggest anyone who likes any kind of fun, action movie see this movie. I left the theater, both times, saying that I was going to buy this movie! Spike Lee always amazes me with his talent to take a typical movie situation and turn it into something fresh and exciting.

The song heard in the opening credits is from one of the most famous Indian movies of all time, and international hit musical, and dramatic political film loved by more fans than critics dare to measure. The song is written and composed by musical director A.R. Rahman, who orchestrates solely ""Bombay Dreams,"" in fact that exact song is in Bombay Dreams. Nonetheless, those who do not understand the song, will not get the beauty, those who do, love it. The words of the song are in Urdu poetry about Love, God, Worship, and Obsession. Words that would put Shakespeare to shame. Now, although I do agree it is out of place, I can see what motivated Spike Lee, and the music director to opt for such an exotic upbeat song. In a country where people tend to lose culture, America, (people lets not deny it, you know what I'm talking about) Hollywood is attempting to expose the audiences with a little foreign, or not so foreign culture. Spike Lee is trying to tell you to turn to the person next to you and ask ""what language is this?"" and ""Where is this song from?"" Those who asked benefited from it, those who did not remain confused or ignorant still to the fact. If people on the west coast or Tri-State had problems understanding the meaning of this song as a symbol, then God help those in the ""good 'ol mid-west.""

I normally very much enjoy Jodie Foster in her roles, but this one did not ring true for me. Perhaps she was not given enough information about the character to play it convincingly? Some very surface factors about costume for this character made it not ring true. Jodie Foster can't walk in spike heels. Neither can I, but she was walking in a very awkward toes pointed out manner throughout the movie. This stance helps you keep your balance while wearing such shoes but does not make you look as though you are accustomed to such footwear. Her suits did not fit as well as I thought they should for a woman with such influence, power and money. The sexiness factor was a little over the top for me, with the high heels and the greasy, tanned legs. While I know that women with power have more latitude in flaunting their sexuality and having it come off as power rather than tawdriness, somehow this didn't work. Is this the director's fault? I can't believe Jodie would not correct these things! And last but not least, I agree with another comment: Jodie's character would not let someone call her a ""****"" without dire consequences for that person.

600,AloeusArcas,"Conclusion of Movie, unrelated to central theme (prop",6,13 April 2006,"Brief Summary: This movie is stale propaganda, whose central theme (bank robbery) is spoiled by the much to often underspoken messages of zionists - having an inability to understand that history is in fact, history. This is similar to The DaVinci Code coming out on Easter weekend, the biggest Christian holiday.A potentially great movie spoiled by a conclusion which has no interest to the viewer beyond that of unspoken propaganda to most, and a central message to few. In a nutshell - Bank Founder did business with Nazi's and now owns banks. Bank Founder has documents that show evidence of this in a secret lock box. Bank robbers break into this lock box to expose the truth that the Bank Founder did business with the Nazi's. End of movie reveals a swastika on the secret documents in the lock box. One of the last scenes is of a Rabi smiling in a car as the robber gets out of the bank. The rabi gives the viewers the impression that it was him who was behind the whole plan. During the entire movie this Rabi has about 2 lines. Beyond the zionist motives which are to (seek JUSTICE), the robbers use plastic guns, almost to say, 'Hey, we are peaceful people, who just want justice to what has happened to us in the past, and oh, we didn't even use real guns to get what we wanted, justice. And oh, the way, if you did something in the past that effected us, well even 50years later, we will catch you, and punish you.""I say get over it. Every race and religion has history of torture and injustice, no one more than the Africans, but you don't see 1000 movies released a year about the slave trade. Don't bother seeing movie in the theatres. The movie is entertaining however if you are like me, someone who enjoys movies with conclusions that are central to their overall themes, then this movie is not for you.

In contrast to Summer of Sam and 25th hr, this is a feelgood film, at least in the sense that the good guys are rewarded, and the bad guy (there is really only one here) is headed for the precipice. But that's just a scaffold for a complex crime grafted to a simple moral story. Or at least it would have been simple (the Holocaust was an affront to humanity, and don't forget who took down the world trade center), if Spike Lee was not the premier black filmmaker of his era. What kind of wheaties does this guy eat for breakfast?

Well directed by the marvelous Spike Lee. Nice shooting, beautiful performance by every one, smart sarcasm, light sense of humor and above all, amazing script.You can watch a lot of bank robbery movies, but the way the movie starts, with a bunch of painters getting inside the bank, just simply take over and hold hostages and then dress them all the same; that wasn't something you see every day. Then, the purpose of the robbery, wasn't clear until the end of the movie, which made it even better.What gave it the better taste, when finally the swat team decided to break in and take hold of the situation, so every one gets out all dressed up the same, you can't tell the difference of who is who, that was one nice trick, even the hostages them selves couldn't identify or even notice. Of course, not to mention the ending, when we see Clive Owen coming out from the bank a week after with all the diamonds in his bag, that was one big scene that changed everything about this movie.I would give 10/10 for the performance of Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Go see it guys, it's worth watching.",Inside Man
605,mini_mal_here,Poor attempt at a thriller,2,25 April 2006,"I only given this movie two stars because I was misled by the movie theatre where it was described as an 'Action thriller'. I was disappointed to find that this was not the case. It was more like a confused-crime-drama-struggling-to-be-an-action-movie.I found it unrealistic. A SWAT team would have swarmed that building in less than a 24 hours by getting in through the top of the building or the windows at the top floors. The bad guys would have been easy to pick out because they would be the ones with the guns. And also some of the characters used were too generic, and some parts were over-dramatised because of a lack of tension in the movie. Although the concept was good this is clearly a wasted opportunity by Spike Lee, and a waste of a paid ticket for me.However, I've given this movie an extra star for some of the surprises and twists that came out of it.",Inside Man
606,onnyizwan,Inside Man very entertaining but not original,8,15 May 2006,"I never expected that Inside Man would be a thoroughly entertaining movie but it was. Spike Lee did well to convey a thrilling drama and at the same time inject some comedy in there as well.The movie tend to sometimes have that kind of friendly, TV movie feel but thanks to Denzel, its worth every cent to watch at the cinema.Good as it is, i also notice that the plot isn't entirely original. It has some cues of the 1990 movie ""Quick Change"" which stars Bill Murray and Geena Davis. It has a similar bank heist plan but of course, cannot come close to the kind of wit and humor displayed in Inside Man.Can we see more of the same from Spike Lee soon?",Inside Man
607,crossbowmd,Cheeee-Zheeee,2,27 May 2006,"I have never seen any of Spike Lee's prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster's work, and have several of their DVDs. I was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie. If this film is any indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to ""get a job"", and stop wasting the time and talent of others. I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I'd seen. I can only assume, from their sappy lovelorn reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. I only paid $2.50, in a ""Second Run"" theater, and still felt I'd wasted my money.The IMDb ""Trivia"" page says it all.......* ""Shot in 39 days"" -- How can you expect to shoot a big budget ""Blockbuster"", (as the media hype promised), in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all.* ""Ron Howard was first going to direct the film..."" -- He may have done this project some justice, given more time to do so, of course. Though the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. OK! maybe not. I'm sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful cliché's, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations, that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!) * ""Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks."" -- And it showed! Her portrayal of a ""Fixer"", who makes people's problems go away, was as unbelievable as the script she was given. Did she even want to be there?Other Peeves: * How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank, and he'd better keep away...or else? * When ""Detective Frazier"", (Denzel Washington), comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have ""led"" a cop, (much less ""let"" a cop) back out to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? * Det. Frazier later claimed, to have given the robber ""every reason to shoot me."" Why, then, in their brief struggle, didn't he even try to expose the robber's face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take ""Steve, Stevie, Steve-O"", (the robber's accomplice), so long to come and help out? * I understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and didn't want anyone harmed. But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't. To them it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys stepped outside to ""pick up the pizzas?"", were they not taken down. (first of all, how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lee's version of NY City, or SNL's?). Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. If not, there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!)* What police department in this country, would have allowed Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), to just waltz right into the bank, and discuss a matter with the robbers, that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority, no governmental credentials; and besides, this was after all, ""already"" a hostage situation...add one more?* Why wouldn't the Bank CEO, (Christopher Plummer), just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds, he could have sold.* Who was that ""schmuck"", (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent, that, conveniently, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was ""100% Albanian"", but yet he himself couldn't speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Ex-wife! What a ""schlump"" she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable. * When interrogating suspects, why did Det. Frazier, continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist?, (i.e. - telling the elderly woman she could go, and then she couldn't, then could; then couldn't?) Give me a break! * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites, couldn't deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? * Near the end of the movie, a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid out for ""a week""....where did the materials come from? (the drywall & studs). It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself. The bank employees hadn't complained about the smell, all week long? Hello!* After such a debacle; since the documents ""had"" fallen into the robber's hands, what kind of ""references"" was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO, seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail, due to her failure?* And last, but certainly not least, What's with the ""Electric Glide"" that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his ""resolve"" to bring these guys to justice? He looked, rather, like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent a bowel movement! ""Cheeee-Zheeee""!!!! Other than the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and overall pitiful directing......yada, yada, yada. Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!.",Inside Man

With all this and an impressive cast list, how could it not entertain? Well it didn't. A major disappointment. The first 5 minutes are probably the best in the movie and that's not a compliment. From there the story is slow and stays there. I found myself trying to force interest in the characters and storyline, but at the end I was left with a feeling of emptiness and confusion.

The R rating shouldn't keep you away. It's only because they say f*** a lot and I think the reason they do that is to add to the realism and just because they wanted it to be R.

612,kahd76,A fabulous way to spend 2 hours!!,9,10 August 2006,"Inside Man, starring Denzel Washington and directed by Spike Lee is a taut suspense movie in the best way. The plot always moves forward, and while I spent much of the movie wondering how it was going to end, I never imagined the way it actually did end. To reveal more would be wrong--this is a movie to been, not told about.Spike Lee, in my opinion, makes a departure from his obvious, more political work. I expected good direction and got it, great performances (ditto), but the nature of the film and it's attraction to the director were a mystery until I saw it. There are little ""Spike-isms"" in the dialog that are appropriate and apropos. Jodie Foster has to be seen to be believed and Denzel Washington as always is fantastic.This is a good movie.

614,gordylaugh,"Horrible Film, Worst Spike Movie ever",1,5 August 2006,"This movie is absolute disaster. From horrible acting, to horrible dialogue, to confusing by confusing scene. Clive Owen who is an incredible actor, does an absolute horrendous job portraying a villain, most non-threatening villain I have ever seen. Kill somebody already!!! This film even makes Denzel look bad, and that is hard. Hearing Denzel say the lines from that miserable script makes his performance reminiscent of Halle Berry in Catwoman. The humor attempts throughout make my eyes roll and stomach churn. The fact that almost nothing is explained as this so-called plot line rolls along, left me and everyone with me wonder what the hell was happening. Each scene seems simply pieced together with no continuity. Also, the scenes where Denzel and his partner question the suspects look almost improvised, as if the actors just got together with a general concept and tried to make a scene that would fit the movie. If these guys had actually tried to rob a bank, NYPD would have taken their asses out in a hot minute b/c these ""robbers"" are jokes. The hostages show almost no fear and when they do, they have nothing to be afraid of. Even the little boy is not even threatened by the robbers. If they had a bomb, I could understand the police standing down. But with only a few robbers, they could have easily resolved this so-called ""hostage"" situation. And why the hell did Willem Dafoe agree to be in this movie? His character is pointless. Almost as pointless as Jodie Foster's. Denzel and Clive are too chummy with each other to decipher who is in control. Or how about their random fight in the bank. Stupid. Evidently a script written by a first-timer. Nothing creative, nothing inventive. Too many ""F"" bombs for no reason. Attention Spike Lee: please go back to making good films like Malcolm X and 25th Hour. THIS Ain't NO BANK ROBBERY!!! No, its an awful film.",Inside Man
615,BigPapi06,"Good cast, terrible writing *SPOILERS*",2,10 August 2006,"There's already a post about the worst scene in the movie. I'm not going to argue it, that scene was terrible (Denzel being ""sucked"" to the front door of the bank). But what about the preceding scene? The camera a top the mobile command post pans to a seemingly all glass section of the bank just in time to see a hostage take one in the grill? Was I supposed to think I was watching a video game? This execution scene (albeit a fake one in the movie) was horrendous.On to a couple other scenes...1.) I've got to address the Albanian language scene(s) First off, could these sharp NY detectives REALLY not tell that was a recording, regardless of the language? I don't speak Albanian, German or any other language they suggested - but with say, and 8th grade education, one should be able to distinguish a recorded communist speech and bank robber banter. It was one voice going on about - Accuracy really sticks its head out in the next scene. The NYPD (with all its resources) decides to ask the crowd outside the crime scene to id this ""mystery"" language by broadcasting the language over the command post loud speaker. Within 10 seconds a brilliant construction worker notes that this language is Albanian. Denzel: ""Are you sure it's Albanian?"" Worker: ""Yeah, it's Albanian - from Albania.""WOAH! Really? The Albanian language is from Albania? I better notify the UN! We've got a developing situation! Believability was out the door at this point in the movie, but this dialogue gave ""Inside Man"" a one way ticket to the Razzies.I could go on, but for the sake of the average American's attention span, I wont.

The first 5 minutes or so there are lots of shots, telling us where the story will be told and also what the social/economical issue is that drives it. A shot of colorful, more rundown houses stands in contrast with a very vertical and pompous building. It's money versus spirit - poor versus rich - black versus white -or is it? There are many shots in the movie that refer to September the 11th and to generalizations regarding race in a more subtle manner. In one shot, Frazier and White stand in front of the American flag where the stars have been replaced by the Statue of Liberty and the faint shape of the Twin Towers, the stripes by the words 'WeWillNeverForget'.

618,ksouplines,Inside The Inside Man,1,27 August 2006,"Ed Note: Before I begin let me say that I have always been a big Spike Lee fan. No I have never sat through an entire viewing of ""Do the Right Thing"", have never watched ""Crooklyn"" from beginning to end or some of his other works; some of which have been praised and lambasted in equal or unequal doses. So what is it about this guy and films like ""X"","" He Got Game"", and ""Get On The Bus"" that make me respect and admire him so? Could it be a small time movie maker fighting the good fight against the big boy Hollywood studio? Or is it that he, Mr. Lee, dares tread where so few artists seem to go in any genre; tackling primarily the issues of race and poverty. When I read in the paper that Mr. Lee had gone mainstream with his film ""The Inside Man"", and that mostly critics were raving, I was more than a little intrigued. This is what I found Inside:Inside Man starring Clive Owen, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster is described as a bank robbery caper. The film opens with a Clive Owen monologue that the viewer is supposed to pay strict attention to. Next up is two NYPD detectives (Washington and Co.) who appear to be more in line with some of Mr. Lee's more memorable characters in his previous films, in other words, losers. Hey but wait a minute, these two black cops get handed a big case and Washington is in charge. An African-American detective is going to break the case and we're all going to go home happy right? Not exactly, super intelligent criminal mastermind Owen is going to embarrass the NYPD while trading some very believable dialogue with Washington, while super intelligent, connected, affluent, (did I mention attractive?) power broker Jodie Foster really takes care of the grown ups work. Wonderful elements of this film include a certain absence of over the top violence and objectionable language, despite some sexual language and adult themes. And what Spike Lee film would be complete without his signature cameo,his black and white elements, and his interviewing the main characters in some context, in this case the bank robbery hostages after the fact. Oh and of course we must not forget the trademark ethnic discrimination scenes of a Spike Lee movie; the cop who mentions the word spic but notoriously uses the word African American, the poor Middle Easterner who gets treated like an Arab terrorist for being in the bank etc., all this I expect from Spike Lee, good or evil. One thing about Spike Lee films though, they usually are cohesive, with a beginning, middle and end that are believable on some level. If this is Spike Lee mainstream then I refuse to swim.Forget that Mr. Owen is the smartest man in the room; we still don't know why he targeted this bank, or this man(Chirstopher Plummer), unless he has personal or professional involvement with the bank's chairman. The only other thing that makes sense is Owen is on some social crusade, and if he is, as he reminds us in the movie, ""then the money shouldn't matter"" (Please!!!). Next up is the super suave Ms. Foster, not only can she make mayors and judges do her bidding, she can promise Washington a promotion if he just knows his place. Throw this wonderful cast together in a stew where we the viewers are asked to believe that one of the most influential banks in New York is not wired well enough to know a man is living INSIDE, without water, air and decent plumbing, I think I'll stay OUTSIDE the mainstream just for a little while longer thanks",Inside Man

By design, the film has no dramatic tension. We know in the first 10 seconds that the bad guy gets away with it. We are further informed through ""flash forwards,"" that all hostages survive the bank robbery. There are two prime issues that no one has addressed for me (not even Spike Lee and Mr. Gewirtz his screenwriter). Specifically: (a) Who was the Inside Man? Was it Case (the Christopher Plummer character)? The rabbi? The employee who lied about his cell phone and was severely beaten? The kid who would not wear his hood? Heck, was it the 8-year-old with the video game; (b) How did Dalton(Clive Owens' character) select box 392? Did Case hire Dalton? As the sole purpose of the heist was to get the content of that box, was it dumb luck or was Dalton clued in? If Case is in the Inside Man, why doesn't he get his own incriminating evidence out of the box (shouldn't he have burned it a long time ago?).

627,bryan-j-fraser,The clues are there to be found,9,29 October 2006,"My solution to the Inside Man: Frazier's first dialogue of the film, ""If this 140 grand doesn't show up somewhere soon things can get rough. Eventually it'll go away. Then I'll make first grade."" Does he know something is going to change soon?  Frazier's boss was on vacation. Interesting scheduling for the robbery.  ""I'm not calling him yet, it doesn't feel right."" How does Frazier reach this conclusion immediately when he arrives at the bank?  When White and the mayor drive up to the bank unannounced, why does Frazier immediately get into the vehicle?  ""Come on in."" Why does Dalton so easily entertain a new plan from White when his original plan is working right on schedule?  ""I'm making detective first grade. Things aren't all they appear to be."" The most explicit line of the movie indicating that Frazier knows more than he tells.  Frazier attempts to stop the storming of the bank at the last minute. When Darius overrules Frazier's demand, Dalton curses and is forced to release the hostages immediately. This appears to be the one element of robbery plan that deviates from Dalton's timing. When the hostages are all lying on the street, Frazier is looking for one he can recognize. Why is he doing that if he has never seen any of the robbers' faces?  Frazier and his partner enter the bank exactly when Dalton is ready to leave. How can this timing be so exact? Why does Dalton risk walking past an experienced police detective while looking so suspicious (ball cap, sunglasses and large satchel)? Why doesn't Dalton just wait in the storeroom until Frazier is gone?  After removing the diamond from his pocket in the last scene, Frazier exclaims, ""Son of a bitch."" Was this his realization that the man he bumped into was the robber, or simply surprise that Dalton had given him the diamond?""  And finally the strange case of Peter Hammond. Peter is the bank employee who attempts to hide his cell phone and gets beaten up by Dalton. We first see Hammond just before the robbery begins having a hushed conversation with the ""Rabbi"" who is later revealed as one of the conspirators. We also learn in the final bank scene that he is a bank officer with authority to access the safe deposit boxes. When the robbers collect all the cell phones, the female robber immediately identifies Peter for not dropping his phone in the bag. Are we to assume that every other one of the 50 hostages placed a phone in the bag and only Peter did not? Hardly believable. Peter was singled out too quickly and conveniently. And why is a bank officer's ring tone set to hip hop? It is clearly not his real phone. And finally, why does Dalton beat up Hammond when he is so careful not to harm any other hostages? This whole episode was a setup to provide Peter with a cover to divert suspicion away from him.My conclusion: Hammond is the inside man. As a bank officer with access to the safe deposit boxes, Hammond is clearly the source of information regarding the secret of Box 392. Frazier, Dalton, White and Hammond have conspired to plan this robbery, each for their own reasons.",Inside Man

629,mudders,Don't expect a Hiest film,9,28 November 2006,"(may Contain a few spoilers) It's a very nice treat when you watch a film with little prior knowledge of and come out feeling thoroughly satisfied. This was one of those films.First of all I don't see this as heist movie with a twist, that element sits in the background and is merely the vessel for Spike Lees typical message - to demonstrate many the prejudices, stereo types and removal of liberties that many see have affected all of our human rights within the free world over the last decade. Except this time it is not restricted to a minority, but everyone who is a potential suspect. Guilty until proved innocent.Many of Lee's films normally shock, have an opinion and do not sit in the mainstream 'thriller' category. This movie demonstrates his work to the mainstream and pounds you with prejudice observation, ignorance and society's ills that you see day in day out and don't think a second over in real life, crammed into two hours it actually shocked and surprised me  by using a very casual nature - and I do not shock very easily. EVERYONE is a suspect, the Sikh guy released early assumed to be an Arab by the policeman pointing a gun at his head, the released hostages cuffed up and led away on a bus reminded me of Guantanamo footage - it is full of similar examples. It even demonstrates loss of innocence; portrayed by the 12 year old playing his GTA style PSP game which Dalton disapproves of.Direction is first class, with snippets of genius - coupled with an absolutely outstanding soundtrack. None of the actors excel, but then there is no requirement for them to do so, the film is set in a very short time frame so therefore doesn't require a great deal of focus on one character. Although there is no denying that Owen and Washington are the main players here. Owen is his usual cardboard self and his skills aren't taxed, thankfully for him - though he really should insist on not having to do that awful American accent in his films. Washington does rise above the others if only because his character requires it. Side roles by Dafoe and Foster are an excellent compliment to the story; no one needs to steal the show because that would dilute the film.Sure realism isn't high on the agenda of the film and I found the plot pretty predictable, simplistic, sentimental and often unrealistic with many holes. A real police operation would be run differently and not as ad hoc and reactionary BUT that is not what this film is trying to do.Loved it 9/10.",Inside Man
630,dalysteve,Comments,5,16 December 2006,"Denzel Washington carried this movie and it was quite good. It did feel like a throw back to the 1970's with the purposeful lack of finality with the bad guys winning in the end and a lack of completion to the plot. One obvious and ugly negative was when the former Nazi, (Christopher Plummer), reveals to Jodie Foster's character that he offered up his Jewish friends to the Concentration Camp in exchange for money and jewelry, a photo of George H.W. Bush, his wife with an unidentified person comes into focus in a picture just behind him on a nearby desk. A few seconds later as he continues to confess his horrible deeds and omissions, you see a picture of Margaret Thatcher with another out-of-focus person, both presumably the former Nazi character himself. Perhaps someone can send Director Spike Lee and Writer Russell Gewirtz a recent history of World Affairs. Bush 1 and Thatcher helped end suffering in eastern Europe by patiently bankrupting the Soviet Union and liberating eastern block countries. What a subtle, cheap and boorish disservice to two patriotic and honorable citizens of democracy. More of the same of uneducated, emotional Hollywood types.",Inside Man
631,irrieyouth,There are many questions to be answered (maybe a spoiler),8,27 December 2006,"Inside man was very engaging and interesting. It keeps you guessing from start to finish since there are many unanswered questions. Denzel delivered a compelling performance. However you are left with a bit of frustration at the end of the movie, not only because the ending was extremely abrupt and unexpected but also because you will find yourself wanting answers to an abundance of questions. Who really is the inside man? Is it Clive?? Why weren't Jodie Foster and the bank owner convicted? Why did Denzel have a persistent cough? How did the bank robbers find out about the history of the bank owner? These are only some of the many questions you will have. Aside from these nuances, inside man is actually a great watch. The suspense helped to move the movie along quite well and the characters were very believable.",Inside Man
632,TruthHammerCritic,Typical action move with typical twists. Jodie Foster was horrid,4,6 April 2006,"Inside man is a fun movie with great camera work and an excellent soundtrack. The plot, however, is a now-typical Oceans-11 type robbery with now-typical twists and now not so amazing ways to plot and execute a robbery.The feel of the movie was very distinctive and good. I enjoyed Denzel Washington's character in this more than any other Denzel movie I have seen. The video filters and the depth of dialog amongst the main characters gave the movie an very real was good. The problem with this movie was Jodie Foster. She had a difficult role going in (an over the top surreal negotiator/talker), and she didn't do much of a job. EVERY time she was on screen it reminded me I was watching a fake movie. Her character should have been scaled back without the stupid cocky Hollywood lines.This is a difficult movie to rate because it has several A+ elements, a B- plot, and an F performance from Jodie. Overall 4/10.",Inside Man
633,blerta12,Excellent Movie,10,13 February 2007,"Well the movie was excellent. Great actors, Great play. I just wont to make a comment on a special feature inserted in the movie. It is about the Albanian president voice and the lady who played the Albanian lady. It was good to have Albania mentioned in it. Yes it is a small country and in many other places Albania is famous for negative examples. But, believe me, Albania is a small country, with fast development and great people. I could see in the movie that the Albanian lady was played but a non Albanian girl. We do not speak English like Rusians do. We are very good at Foreinger languages. And we try to be correct (like paying bills for examples or fines). And the lady was dressed as a prostitute. No, not all girls of Albania dress like that. It is just a small percentage of it, mostly young girls. If it is possible i would like to talk to the director of the movie. He can write me an e-mail in my e-mail address: blerta12@gmail.com. Thank you and have a very nice day, Blerta.",Inside Man
634,weslstan,Great!,9,19 March 2007,"I just loved this film, it had great energy from the word go. The casting was superb especially Clive Owen and Spike Lee did a great job directing. Most importantly though i think the storyline was really watertight and was'nt at all predictable which is usually the downfall of a lot of films nowadays. I felt Jodie Foster could of maybe played a bigger part and there could of been more attention payed to the robbers as opposed to the cops especially towards the end. But these were noticeably the only downfalls of the film. I don't usually rate films this highly but i felt after watching it that Spike Lee and the writer really pulled it out of the bag on this one. Go and see it!",Inside Man

I didn't realize it was a Spike Lee production and had no predetermined idea of his type movie. I do now and will never see another of his films. Terribly disjointed plot. Every camera angle and scene is an ""issue."" Whether it is rough police handling of suspects, insensitive treatment of minorities - all too hard to handle. There is no real script - just an attempt to keep the audience ""off balance."" That's easy - the script is all ""off-balance."" The ending is solidly hollow. What a Waste of Time!!

The storyline is totally predictable to anyone who has ever seen any other bank robbery / heist movie. The characters were poorly thought out by someone who totally lacks imagination. It is a pity that a great actor like Denzel Washington appeared in this piece of garbage , but I guess he has to pay his bills . The one great thing / highlight of this movie was the fact that second rated ( or is that over rated ) actors like Clive Owen's face was for most part of the movie covered up .The fact that this movie's DVD sales were poor are proof that some people still have standards.Please , do yourself a favor and avoid this movie .

638,bill-1963,Who was the Inside Man? Possible spoiler,10,28 July 2007,"I believe Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) was the inside man. Why? Because Dalton Russell, bank robber (Clive Owen) planned the perfect heist. Part of his perfect planning included determining what would the hostage negotiator do ... what would he/she do next?Denzel fell right in line throughout doing everything the bank robber planned / hoped for.Thus, Denzel was the inside man, unknowingly. As a result of his predictability, the bank robber used him as his inside man throughout the entire robbery, to bring about the perfectly planned result.Was Denzel a good guy? Yes, for 99% of the movie. It was in that last minute (the 1%) where he slipped over to the dark side.",Inside Man

William Dafoe could have sent a cardboard cutout of himself with balloon dialog for all that it mattered. Jodie Foster was grossly miscast. The great acting by DenzelWashington and Christopher Plummer wasn't enough to hold the movie together. Foster looked as though she was always waiting for someone to tell her what was going on. The back and forth time line looked as though it was borrowed from Denzel Washington's great movie ""Man On Fire"" but it didn't work and wasn't used effectively. It could have been a great movie but it wasn't. Spike Lee is overrated.",Inside Man

In the pick up scene when Owen was walking out of the bank, the ""Rabbi"" was in the getaway car! Unbelievable and you could have missed it if you blinked! The last scene of the movie almost escaped me but at the very end before it faded to black I got it. When Owen walked into Washington on his way out of the bank I didn't think anything of it. Then when Washington's character flashed back to that scene at the end of the movie after discovering a loose diamond in his jacket pocket I got it. Owen dropped the diamond in his pocket deliberately so that he could propose to his girlfriend. Owen & Washington's characters had discussed that situation in the confrontation in the bank earlier in the movie! Kudos on an amazing screenplay. It takes a lot to impress me and you've done just that!",Inside Man
641,sseal2001,my answers to the holes of the plot,8,29 July 2008,"well..... this is my 1st comment at IMDb.... and b4 watching the movie i read the comments some viewers made about holes in the plot... like how the robbers know about the locker when only Mr.Case knew it.... what i m telling is purely based on what i thought... near the end of the movie we can see that the Jewish man asks about the ring... well he must have known about the family or the owners of the ring (that's why he was so eager about it)(Mr. Case himself explains this to Jodie foster how he betrayed the family)and cud have traced Mr Case's loot(since he must have also known his misdeeds) and by logical means(if hes a Jew he must have a lot of it)he narrowed upon the bank that Case opened. As for which locker... its told by the detective that.. 392 was off records since 1948.. so suspicion occurs.. so the robbers also got that this way..and they at least knew what they were looking for.. so they did it quickly.. but that too took them a lil time.. thats why we don't see the robbers to go directly to the locker and do their job.. instead they were constantly buying time...As for the movie.. its good to watch(gave 8 stars).. good robbery.. good plot.. good confusion..with a wee bit of Indian connection.. ya the Sardar is there.. but I'm still wondering why the ""Dil Se"" song???",Inside Man

It pulled me in from the start, and then I felt like I was waiting the whole movie for something to happen, for something else to keep me interested. I felt it really dragged in the middle. And then the end of the movie didn't do much for me either. The ending doesn't blow you away like you are hoping it will. Inside Man just never built up to anything and kind of left me disappointed.Washington and Foster aren't anything spectacular, just kind of blah in their roles. I do have to give it to Clive Owen though. He has that dark and likable bad guy thing going. Overall I thought it was entertaining but lacking.",Inside Man

I also cannot believe that the police declared the search for the robbers over without detecting the false wall (did they even shift the stuff on the shelves like the dell boxes? Come On!). I'm only giving it 5 out of 10 for the suspenseful setup and good performances by a stellar cast. Good buildup that ends in a huge disappointment.

In that specific order. The script is cleverly written and the dialog just plain fun, but you have to listen closely.I've been a Washington fan for some time and for the past 5 or so years haven't missed a Clive Owen film to-date. Owen's professional choices in roles just get better and better with each role. Jody Foster is right on the mark.

It is remarkable how such a talented cast is wasted with such uninspiring and one-sided characters. I think there lies the main problem about this film.
The audience fails to sympathize with the characters which are more of caricatures; the good cops, the smart thief, the mysterious woman and so on.On the other hand, I found interesting the subtle way this movie broaches the subject of racial racism and human rights.In general, you 'll have a good time watching it but don't expect anything unique.",Inside Man

Not because he is the living definition of a independent filmmaker who inspired other indie filmmakers to have the balls to go and make their movies without the iron fist of a studio. Not because for 20 years he has consistently put out films that embodied his distinctive voice. I'm a fan because Spike has never stopped being Spike!For those of you haters who have no idea what it's like to do your art for a living and put work out for the world to review, slander, hate, love and talk about. I have a word of advice. Put up or shut up.This movie was solid from the opening credit sequence, to every signature Spike shot. I was impressed with the Cinematography of Matty Libitique, the acting of each star, the eclectic music and the overall movie. Although it's not a great film. It is a victory for Lee and the entire crew. I'm glad it did so well at the box office. The rest of you can eat a fat one.This was a Spike Lee joint. like it or not.",Inside Man

It was OK, but not what I expected from someone like Denzel Washington or Jodie Foster. There was a lot of pointless foul language, like the scene between Foster and the mayor of NYC. I never felt like I was on the edge of my seat, nor were there any big surprises. There was also absolutely no clue as to the motivation of the Clive Owen character in his vendetta against the Christopher Plummer character.

654,jsujantogt,Jackpot!,10,1 April 2006,"This movie is the movie I've been longing for for a while. I don't go to watch movie in theaters as often as before. Now, I prefer to wait and watch it all on DVD. What made me watch this movie at a cinema?? My favorite actor, Denzel Washington.I watched this trailers many times before it hits the cinema. I know that this is gonna be a hit for me when I see the cast and suspected that the movie will have a good plot. A kind of movie that would entice me. The only thing that got me thinking was the Director, Spike Lee. This is not a movie that I'd expect from Spike Lee but I got to say that he did well in his new category.Being from Indonesia, having friends who idolizes Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise etc. I never really have one actor that really hits me as a real good actor until I stepped on Vancouver. I started watching my first Denzel Washington movie and I thought he's a pretty interesting actor. I started watching his other movies and I knew straight away he's the finest actor Hollywood has. Also, I noticed that Denzel don't just choose any acting roles. All his movies are either very meaningful and his action movies has good plots.Remember the Titans, John Q, Man On Fire, The Siege, Out of Time are some of his many good movies. The only movie I don't like was the remake of The Manchurian Candidate although Denzel puts a strong performance in front of the camera too. Good supporting role he played in Atwone Fisher.Anyway, back to the movie: it will make you laugh, wonder and think. The suspense is fun as the humor in the movies. The thing I want to warn you all is the strong language they use in this movie that gives it an R rating. Also, the movie made fun of some other old movie which I'm not gonna spoil and some of you might not notice it anyway. Sikhs might find a scene to be offensive but I know my Sikh friends actually enjoyed the scene. Anyway, the plot, the laughters, the strong performance of the cast will let you leave with fulfillment + enjoyment of watching the movie. I know everyone in theater does!I give it a 10.",Inside Man

656,bronesket,The Heist of the Century,10,13 November 2012,"I have always had a soft spot for a good heist movie. So as soon as I saw the trailer for Inside Man, I was immediately hooked. Inside Man is an amazing film, and this was accomplished by the extraordinary opening scene, the unique way the story is told, as well as the great acting.The plot is very thrilling and is sure to keep you hooked. Inside Man is a heist movie, which follows Dalton Russell and his crew as they attempt to rob a New York bank with several hostages. However the movie also follows the perspective of the hostage negotiator and man in charge, Detective Keith Frazier. The movie begins with Dalton Russell, narrating to the audience how he recently planned and put into motion the perfect bank robbery. After the introduction ends the movie quickly gets the plot rolling by jumping straight into the moment Dalton Russell and his crew takes over the bank. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as Detective Frazier tries to catch the bank robbers. Which may not be as easy as he first intended as Dalton Russell makes sure to make it difficult. The opening scene of Inside Man is quite brief, however is sure to have the audience hooked within minutes. As Inside Man begins, Dalton Russell begins speaking directly to the audience. Briefly introducing the key elements of the plot being the who, what, where, and when, leaving only the how and why unanswered. Throughout this scene although introducing the plot, the mystery created by his speech gets the audience's brains to begin naturally asking questions and more importantly wanting answers. This is merely what sparks the audience's interest, and one of the major factors which continues to make this film great is the unique method it uses to tell the story. Rather than simply telling the story straight through with an established back story early on and possibly a flashback here or there, Inside Man does something somewhat different. Inside Man continuously transitions between two separate times. Half the time Inside Man following Dalton Russell as he robs the bank and Detective Frazier as he attempt to rescue the hostages. The other half of the time is spent further down the road as Detective Frazier and his partner attempt to put the events of the bank robbery together as they question all those held hostage. The acting in Inside Man is also quite phenomenal. The main character, Dalton Russell, is played by Clive Owen. Clive Owen nailed every single part of his role in this movie, from when portrays the intelligent Dalton who is very precise and calm, to the parts where Dalton gets a bit short tempered and snappy. Denzel Washington, who played the role of Detective Frazier, does an impeccable job of portraying his role as well. He really captures the role of being the detective who is very strong willed and passionate about his job; Always going above and beyond the expectations to get to the truth. As far as big name actors go, Inside Man also contains Jodie Foster as the strong willed Madeleine White, as well as Willem Dafoe as the police captain, Darius. These big names however should not completely over shadow the supporting actors, as they are just as important. Their flawless job of capturing the people who live their everyday lives in New York City, is what truly brings the setting to life and pulls you into being right there in New York City.Overall Inside Man is an exceptional movie and is definitely worth watching. If you're one who enjoys a great heist movie, Inside Man will surely make its way into your collection.",Inside Man
657,tadzio4u,Spike Lee talks about what we see and (especially) about we don't see,9,18 March 2006,"INSIDE MAN is a two-way experience, working on very different levels that complete each other. First, it is a heist movie in its classical form, with the bank robber wanting to execute the perfect crime whereas the hard-working policeman tries to catch him. However, there's more in this excellent film from Spike Lee than meets the eye.Lee and the extremely well-written screenplay fill the bank robbery with clever metaphors and comments on the situation of American society right now, moving from Sept 11th (which was also very present in the previous film by the director, the spectacular THE 25TH HOUR) to the quality of 50cent songs. Enter Jodie Foster, in a little but shining role that has the juiciest part of the cunning remarks Lee and the script make on the situation of America nowadays.However, there's no better symbol used by the director than the one of the bank robbery itself, which makes us harder to see who the bad guy really is, and watching the scenes in which it is hard to tell who the thieves are and who the hostages are, it is hard not to think of the search for people to blame.Thematically rich, INSIDE MAN reminds me of the also brilliant A HISTORY VIOLENCE, since it seems to be talking about one thing when in fact has other plans for the audience. At least those who want to read between the lines. And having a cast of such quality (Jodie, Denzel, Clive Owen - even if he wears a mask almost the whole film, Christopher Plummer throwing in the mud his THE SOUND OF MUSIC days - you'll see why - Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor) certainly doesn't hurt.INSIDE MAN is a two-way experience.

658,dizzybroadway,Surprisingly brilliant!,8,20 March 2006,"it was surprisingly really, really good! Probably the most unpredictable thriller to come out of Hollywood in a long time. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington are brilliant, but for me Jodie Foster steals the show. One of her best supporting roles to date. I was a little surprised when i saw it, thinking it was going to be another one of those boring American thrillers, but i was happily surprised to see a complicated, intelligent film with some interesting political undertones. One thing i would say that really annoyed me about this film was the incredibly irritating music in the opening credits. It had absolutely no reference to the film and it felt really out of place. At times the sweeping camera shots get on your nerves, but when you get into the film, the exciting and interesting plot helps you to forget all about it!",Inside Man

Something it did so badly my friends all commented that it was worse than an episode of NYPD Blue. - Rehashed plot. In fact there wasn't an origonal idea in the whole film. Almost every scene brought critisizms as to what film it was (poorly) trying to copy. - Lack of tension. Its a hostage situation, yet there is no build of tension to a climax. The go in, do their stuff, and get out, all goes according to plan. - Muddled style. It goes from interviews to first person voice over to street style without relevance. - Lackluster ending. It ended as the rest of the film was going... without any kind of emotional gratification whatsoever.2 stars",Inside Man

I must say though, it was a little slow going, but the whole robbery was brilliant. Denzel Washington is a great actor. This isn't one of his best, but it is still a good movie. And Clive Owen was AMAZING! I haven't seen him in many movies, but this one is by far the best one of his movies i have seen. He plays a very intriguing character. It's kind of debatable if it's worth going to see in the theaters, but it's definitely worth seeing at the dollar theaters or renting.

It was difficult to suspend my disbelief while watching this awful movie. Denzel Washington is a bad actor in this movie, in fact, he acts the same in all his movies, he's an overrated actor. Jody Foster is another overrated actress, who acts the same in all her movies. Spike Lee should open a rib joint, instead of another ""joint"" movie.

I'm no fan of Denzel Washington to say it mildly, but I enjoyed this movie very much. I felt it was a brilliant parody on the genre of hostage movies and Washingtons career in general. Unfortunately, this probably wasn't the intention of Washington nor that of Spike Lee. There's a bunch of stupid jokes in this movie which made me feel like I was watching a comedy and the ending was so corny that it had to be intentional. My vote of seven is because I enjoyed the movie very much for what it was. The fact remains that I was meant as a serious hostage movie and it fails miserably at that.On another note, was the director drunk when he picked the music for the opening and ending scenes?",Inside Man

It was watchable only for the unintentional humor and as far as 'clever caper' movies go I like to think of a movie like The Usual Suspects or Seven as being great entertainment. Spike Lee gives me a headache with his Michael Bay induced jerky camera movement to over-hype the action and the completely stereotypical portrayal of the 'normal' New Yorkers in the movie were hilarious, overdone accents/attitude galore. I love Willem DaFoe and this was just a dumb roll for him...Denzel is his usual awesome self and the only reason to watch the flick.*****S p o i l e r s******* What was up with the construction worker's super hot Albanian wife? That looked waaaayyyy out of place. When Denzel tells Willem D. ""Don't go in! They've been listening to us!"" and WD responds ""Too late! We're going in!""....good grief...The whole former-nazi/anti-Semitic angle in movies to portray an antagonist has been so over-done it has lost it has effect.

669,kwaman,Why not view footage before.....?,7,27 March 2006,This movie didn't have as many plot holes as I thought it would. But one really did stand out to me. Expsecialy since there was this whole thing about all the surveillance and everything. It would have made sense for the police to consider all of the footage before the surveillance cameras were blinded out. The robbers all came in after the screens went black obviously besides Clyde's character. They could have viewed who was in the bank before than and accounted for everyone except for the robbers since they were never captured on tape. Would make the most sense??? I was also thinking they could check who actually banks there. But the first thing mentioned would get right to the point. I was thinking about that towards the end of the movie. It seems like everything else was thought of except for that Jblack,Inside Man
670,ginnamus_prime,bob on!,9,21 March 2006,"Well, as is always the case when I wanna see something for quite a while, I anticipated that it may be a bit of a let down. Dint take long into the film to realise that that was a stupid thing to do, Spike Lee wouldn't let me down. This film was an absolute breath of fresh air. Had both the slick and well thought out characteristics of most heist movies but with the personal touches of a vintage Spike Lee film. This gives a fairly recognisable situation within Hollywood films but with real character and feeling. All the characters were interesting and individual; from the leading roles down to the characters there for only one scene. The ability to use say Jodi Foster's star persona of the ""tough, independent woman"" kind of role and turn that to the ""tough, independent 'heartless, stone faced' woman"" kind of a role is an example of the touches of character that give this film its energy. Its mild social commentary (The racist NYPD and elements of corruption in the city to give just two examples) was evident enough to make a point but not too much to seem like it was preaching. This is usually the best way to get this kind of message to the people that need to hear it. I would have given my rating between 8 and 9 to be fair but given nothing in between to choose I believed it deserved the benefit of the doubt to be rounded up rather than down. For me, this further strengthens the view that Spike Lee is not only talented enough but diverse enough to be one of the great directors.",Inside Man

672,ajlamy-1,What a really surprising movie,9,16 April 2006,"This is a movie that never ceases to surprise the spectators, leading them to expect a somewhat different bank robbery but, a bank robbery anyway. This is the merit of the screenplay and ho the events and information are brought to us from the beginning up to the last scene of the film. Together with the mastery of the film making, this makes a superb entertaining movie with several subjects that really give substance to the characters and, in an easy approach, take you to several key points: The relationship between a big banker fortune and the opportunity the second world war provided by the NAZI holocaust of the JEWS and subsequent robber of their possessions. In this particular case, the Banker was a friend of the Jew colleague that was put to death, that he could have prevented but chose not no, keeping the jewels of his friend (and his money). How the past came looking for this Banker, but, surprisingly, in a very different look: not the pure revenge on a war criminal but disclosing him as such and getting rich in the process, not by robbing bank notes but famous and much valuable jewels. Good and evil are here relative: the good ones get rich after an extraordinary well designed robbery, the cop gets a promotion and receives a gift from the robber that understood how this cop loved. The Banker uses power to use a Broker specialist in helping cloudy business people doing their businesses and the city Mayor who has to pay some favors, in order to wash away the object of the assault. Good and Evil, crime and punishment: not in this movie. The film lives fully on the story and does not reach the past except for the Banker to acknowledge the robber information on him. No flashbacks, waiting for the next event, some clues on the nature of the gang leader, some comic pieces coming out of the Albanian speech, the Albanian girl and some corruption disclosed when at the Embassy someone wanted money to do a translation. Denzel Washington working fine his character between his personal side and his professional side, Clive Owen a surprising robber creating the faked environment for us and for the police. Jodie Foster showing a very ironical broker. Cinema is entertainment. This film is intelligent entertainment and deserves to be seen and really enjoyed, giving a thought to the subjects it carries.",Inside Man

I watched a preview screening in London,last night, and I must say that it was a strange experience.The movie has many twists,turns ""some"" good performances, you'll find yourself laughing and curiously intrigued in others as the story evolves, in Spike's Lee style. The story as a whole is quite good, the way it is told is different from what you'll see in a while to come. ... It's not your every day , run of the mill heist movie. The story opens with a awkwardly yet meticulously planned bank heist. Denzel Washington is brought onto the scene as the experienced negotiator to deal with the hostage scene. And from there is where the movie tasks you on a ride ,with twists , turns and speed bumps that will have your head spinning wondering what's coming next. See this movie. All is not as it seems.

674,eddds,Spike Lee strikes again,6,4 December 2015,"The quality of the writing saves this from being another good film ruined by the untalented Spike Lee. He does manage to get a few of his idiotic signatures into the film: the shot of the dim bulb future brother in law passed out and gripping a 40 of ""tha bomb"" malt liquor with the bomb fin cap in place, and a scene in which a central character takes a bumpy ride toward the camera on a wheeled platform with a constipated look on his face.There are also a few ridiculous shots of cops holding their rifles in freehand aim on the bank for minutes on end for no reason. Try holding a rifle on a target freehand with no rest for the weight of the weapon for several minutes and you'll see what makes these shots ridiculous.This is a good film despite the fact that there's a talentless midget directing.

675,nicholasprice-69617,Not Worth A Purchase!,5,23 June 2015,"Spike Lee puts together a fairly serious but also very playful take on a bank heist which turns into a hostage situation, with all persons involved in the situation (police detective, brokers and the bank robber) trying to negotiate their ways out.It's a film which sees Denzel Washington (Detective Keith Frazier) and Clive Owen (Dalton Russell) bring their sarcastic, comical and undeniably cool characters to the table which we see in Training Day (2001) and Shoot 'Em Up (2007).An unusual score from Spike Lee once again, accompanied with a vague plot and a lack of tension for such a serious situation, personally highlights a fairly average Denzel Washington film here, which is hard for me to say, as such a big Denzel fan.Undeniably there is still good quality acting from the 2 time Oscar winner as expected, and when accompanied with an all-star cast including the likes of Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and the then up-and- coming Chiwetel Ejiofo, it is still an enjoyable film. However, it was far from the brilliance that I was expecting.Recommendation: Glad it was on TV and I didn't spend a penny on this - but if you want a fun, tongue-in-cheek Denzel film one night, then may be worth a watch!",Inside Man
676,davidullmann-13778,Save a few hours of your life,1,9 March 2016,"I signed up for IMDb so I could specifically review this movie and save humanity the torture that is this this ""film."" Without mentioning all the numerous holes, the main problem with this film is it's pace, or lack thereof. Quite simply, it was just a plodding movie with a slog of a soundtrack. I felt like it was in slow motion. There would be time when the camera pans for no reason, or the camera stays on a subject for no reason. Also characters were introduced at awkward moments and then not allowed to develop. There was zero way to care about any of the characters. Which would be fine, if it was the type of explosive action film that is comfortably one-dimensional and superficial. Except, this film does asks that you empathize with its characters, but gives you pretty much no way to do so. As such, the characters were left to be caricatures of themselves, pointless and lackluster. Overall, the ""film"" could barely keep my attention. It's just flat-out boring. Compared to other heist films it is probably slightly below average, as too many of them are horrible, anyhow. Please save a few hours of your life and do anything but watch this junk.",Inside Man
677,dcb2124,Would have been better if someone else had made it.,7,26 March 2006,"Unfortunately, everything in this movie that is not part of the actual heist is unnecessary and cheesy. Namely, Christopher Plummer as the rich evil white man, the completely extraneous characters and scenes (I'm thinking of Denzel Washington's girlfriend, the young boy with the violent video game). And of course, Denzel Washington's stupid hat.Not that it is unnecessary in a heist or thriller type movie to portray the human sides of all the characters. But if you're going to do it, don't make them caricatures, especially Jodie Foster's character. Rather than being convinced to think about the personalities and inner workings of some of the characters, the only effect achieved by Lee here is irony and eye rolling.And not to mention that Spike Lee can't seem to make a movie these days without sticking a fairly heavy handed message into it. Video games featuring gang violence are bad. Okay. Chris Plummer was into shady business practice and should be held accountable. Alright. What does that have to do with anything in this movie? I thought maybe this time Spike Lee was taking on a different genre and thus would spare us the preaching, but I was amazed that he managed to tack on messages even in a movie where there is no conceivable reason for it to be there.That said, the movie is very entertaining. Clive Owen is genius in this role. As a heist movie, the movie is solid. The actual plot is surprisingly realistic for a movie that claims through Clive Owen to offer the plan for the perfect bank robbery. The cinematography is one the strongest points of the film. The shots of the police work offer a lot of shaky, hand-held shots for a pretty rough look speaking to the chaos that occurs outside the bank, whereas inside the shots are smooth and controlled, suggesting the control the robbers have over the situation. The editing and switching between timelines does a great job of keeping the audience guessing at what even happened in the bank, making the visual portrayal of the movie excellent.Pretty funny, although it seemed at times the humor was misplaced, and just as with the much of the rest of the script, you may wonder what the hell you're supposed to be watching.Overall: Good camera work with pretty good performances and good plot make for a very interesting and entertaining heist, but script as a whole is cheesy and sophomoric and nothing besides the heist is worth paying attention to. Would do well to be stripped down to bare bones of the script and remade with a different director.",Inside Man
678,rgood88,Spike Lee The OVER-Director,3,3 April 2006,"I was so excited to see this movie. The advertising set us up for what could have been an epic film.... too bad it did not live up to the expectations. To make matters worse, the story line supported the advertising and was so promising. This shows how a director personally can kill a film.You get this project with the right support and this is a 10. (I wonder what the original script was like before Lee was involved). However, with the OVER-director involved we have to sit through so much over-direction, political bull along with so many meaningless scenes. Who wants to watch a 15 minute scene of the robbery set up all with hand held cameras moving all over the place. I thought I was watching the Blair Witch Project .... 30 seconds would have been enough to give us the picture and the feel for the action. Next, at every turn, Lee throws in how racist Whites are and how bitter he is.... Can't we just watch a movie for entertainment. Finally, how many times did we have to sit through scenes that meant nothing.... they could have cut 30 minutes and we still would have walked away with the same impression.... disappointed a good idea turned into such a bad movie.My one question, why does everyone praise this guy?",Inside Man
679,kmt71093,Great Movie!,10,24 March 2006,"I thought Inside Man was a really great movie!! In the movie Clive Owens really did plan a perfect bank robbery......making all the hostages wear the same jumpsuit etc. There was some violence such as people getting beat up. Also, in a video game the little boy was playing there was violence. There was also many curse words. Inside Man wasn't a happy, prancing bunny movie but it wasn't a movie where somebody's getting shot every 2 minutes. You'll have to go and see it to see how everything works out. My favorite character is an up and coming star, Samantha Ivers playing Nancy Mann, one of the hostages. In the beginning of the movie she's the one standing on line in the bank talking really loud on her cell phone and you can follow her throughout the movie from that point.

I was continually guessing and continually wrong. Denzel was excellent as was Jodie Foster. Amazing movie! It actually cracked my Top 25. As good as the movie was... technically I was disturbed by sound volumes in certain parts of the movie. Dialogue was low volume. The action scenes were incredibly loud. This could have been just the theater that I was in. Some things were a bit confusing it took me awhile to figure out the cut away scenes (was this actually happening or imagined).Once again if you don't see the movie in theater's I believe your missing out on some technical elements that add to the film. But none the less this movie is a no miss.,Inside Man
681,LezH,A popcorn and thinking-cap night out...,8,1 May 2007,"Other reviews have done the plot outline, which is not easy without including spoilers. So I'll take that as read ...Despite the few (but important) questions 'Inside Man' leaves unanswered (particularly concerning Christopher Plummer's backstory and motivation in keeping a certain crucial article - and Owen's apparently intimate acquaintance with both!), the political issues it unnecessarily raises (the birth of black gun crime; the vulnerability of ethnic profiling to prejudice etc.), the occasional straining at the leash of credibility, a couple of short dips in the tension, and the seemingly obligatory foul language (but hey, you're not a grown-up if you can't say f**k, are you?), this is a very intelligent, pacey, stylish and tense heist movie; the best I've seen for a long time.I can't understand why the distributors (or whoever) put their product out of reach of a large potential audience by not moderating the language to some extent (and does Jodie Foster have it written into her contract that, in her films, the C word must be used?). But I guess they know what they're doing? I wouldn't take a younger teenager to see it for that reason. But then, they probably wouldn't take me either!Whilst it is plot driven - and that, extremely convoluted and fast-moving, with flash-backs, flash-forwards and cutaway scenes - performances from the 'bums on seats' brigade (Washington, Owen, Foster, Plummer, Dafoe etc.) range from good to excellent. Washington, particularly, is in the zone and it doesn't hinder him that he has such good words to work with. But I was also extremely impressed by the acting of the lesser lights; some of the turns of the hostages were brilliant ...I can't think that, unless you're a super-bright fan of the genre (I score one out of two there!), you would pick up on every detail the first time round: my third viewing revealed stuff I'd previously missed evoking a satisfied 'Ahhh!' (but also raised other inconsistencies I'd not noticed before). That being the case, some of the other reviews don't quite gel with my view of things, particularly that the plan went out of control. It didn't. Owen, the mastermind, certainly had to make the occasional adjustment but in answer to his open question to the hostages 'Is there anyone else here cleverer than me?!' the answer has to be a smug 'No!' - though his ego did nearly get him into trouble once or twice.Except for the above reservations, I rate this as way above average for the genre from the first terrific title and music sequence to the final, er, terrific title and music sequence.",Inside Man
682,thebeautifulend,Spike Lee + an intelligent heist film? Don't worry.,9,22 April 2006,"Inside Man, by Spike Lee, is by far one of the most impressive theatrical experiences I've attended all year. I can tell you this because going to the movies has not yielded many quality experiences. From the moment it begins, there is clearly an urban vibe; the shots of Manhattan, not to mention the movie being billed as ""A Spike Lee joint"" give it a grittier tone. Do not let these minor touches fool you; as the movie progresses, it helps to not go in with preconceived notions of the typical Spike Lee movie. Denzel Washington plays a hostage-situation negotiator, Clive Owen the antagonist, and Jodie Foster the mysterious femme fatale who seems to know much more than she lets on. All of these roles are carried out with overwhelming class and finesse, a true work of art to see all the pieces in motion. Spike Lee's direction helps to execute scenes that clearly convey to the viewer what they are intended to show, and all these elements come together to create a great piece and an especially sweet outing for fans of ""heist"" movies.One area you could expect to see that is almost expected of a Spike Lee movie is the social commentary; the almost constant references to racism and racial hatred are almost to be expected and are delivered with the grittiness you come to expect from Lee, from the almost abusive but certainly overbearing incapacitation of a Muslim-American (including the removal of his turban, a severe insult to the Muslim-American community) to the references to Usama Bin Laden and flagging taxi-cabs, Lee does a passable job of portraying the Muslim-American as the new Black.Aside from minor problems with the acting (Jodie Foster's character seems a little subdued for her taste, but the differences are subtle) and the almost inevitable racially stunted social commentary, Inside Man comes together as one of Spike Lee's finest.",Inside Man
683,ellestark,Inside Man will keep you inside the theater more than once.,10,22 April 2006,"For a Spike LeeJoint, it wasn't surprising that Denzel was a lead in the casting. I was, however; very surprised that Clive Owen agreed to bless this movie with his acting presence. Owen was the only reason this movie was a ****10***instead of an absolute snooze. The plot is the best anyone should expect from Lee. Cut and dry with a few very minor twists that attempt to lead the viewer toward a different conclusion. The story was hardly ""original"". Hats off to the cast 100%. Now, the good part. Despite Lee's B movie talent as a director and producer, he was an A list genius in choosing the cast. Washington needs no praise. The Oscar winner has once again proved his ability to adapt to any character. Clive Owen has yet again brought his highly under-appreciated talent from the UK to the US. If he were a one man show for the entire 2 hours, there isn't a person in the the theater that could have been disappointed. Owen's face being covered for the majority of the film had zero impact whatsoever on his believable character and capability to ""bring it"". If that doesn't scream Acadamy Award, I don't know what does. Owen, and Owen alone made this movie Excellent. Jodie Foster's role was a waste of time and would have shortened the flick without disappointment. Fabulous actress, but no need to be written into the script. Although, it was a pleasure to see her, it was a needless waste of money. What we need to recognize in the ""Hollywood"" boredom of the same faces the majority of the time, (only because of an Oscar nod) is that once in a great while a nomination actually makes sense to the rest of the world. Owen's nomination in Closer was a movie that we could say, ""Oh yeah, I know that movie."" Instead of ""Huh? Never heard of it"" Fortunately, some of the best director's of our time have taken note and he has been cast in numerous films. Unfortunately, time and time again he has to make it his own in order for it to be worth the $10.00 at 7pm on a Saturday night. (Look at ""Derailed"". My oh my, Jennifer Aniston?????? The girl from ""Friends""???? Enough said.) ""Inside Man"" is the result of Excellence due to brilliant acting and casting.

The story is its strength and it's complicated. Keith Frazier, or Denzel's character, has depth and charm. The master mind of the heist has his own stoic charm and is certainly enigmatic. Some of the police officers seemed like they walked from their beat to the set.What I found most interesting were not the plot or characterizations but the style of the directing and the interactions between characters. Several scenes are burned in my brain. One with a hand print, one with a shadow, and another with a syringe-- You'll see. There are at least three scenes between officers that would make great 1.5 minute movies. These could be played as conversation starters for discussions about race in America today. It's not just the exchange of words. It's the looks they gave. I love that kind of realistic silent conversation that takes place in a millisecond of pause.I don't understand why Spike Lee used what I took to be Bollywood music (and perhaps some Arab sounding music?) through the opening and closing credits. I guess it saved money... I have to admit it made me jive in seat abit. Catchy tunes, even if they weren't in English. But did that have some kind of tie-in to the story? Was that a statement about where money is going? Or who is righting wrongs? The theater I saw Inside Man in was 95% filled, with about 25% African American patrons.

689,trompeta109,"Very, Very Good!",9,4 April 2006,"This movie kind of surprised me as to how well it was put together. I knew it was going to at least be OK, because of the cast, but because it was a Spike Lee movie I didn't expect it to be exceptionally good. But boy it was! All of the pieces fell together at the end, and I was extremely impressed. I haven't been a big fan of Spike Lee movies because of his ""special"" effects, but he seemed to have toned this one down in that regard. Of course, there were his moments in the film that you could have done without (because it just looked kind of stupid), but overall it was great.The casting was perfect, as well. Clive Owen was PERFECT for his part. And Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington were fabulous, too. And I tip my hat off to the person(s) who came up with the plot and planned the whole thing out. It was very satisfying to finally have a movie like this that filled in every gap and left nothing unanswered. Even the most minute details were explained in the end. This is one of those movies where every time you watch it you pick something else up that you missed the previous time. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who thought they were interested in seeing it, because that probably means, if you are like me, that you will love it, as I did. A great movie and a must-see for all thriller lovers!",Inside Man
690,karimayed,can't miss one single moment,8,8 May 2006,"I think ""Inside man"" is a great film. It requires a great deal of attention, because the development of the plot (the spy-pen, the diamond ring...) makes it necessary to ""sew"" together the different events which are presented one after another without any help from the director (at least in my opinion). From my point of view, this film contains also a clear hint to the war in Iraq. Just after the whole group of hostages rush out of the bank, the police instinctively shoots against the guilty people as well as against the innocents, because they're all the same for them (they are all dressed alike). It is a behavior that has been reported to happen in Iraq. Moreover, there is a moment in that scene where the daddy holds his kid in the same position as the famous photo taken in Iraq, with the hooded prisoner holding his kid on his lap.",Inside Man
691,s_jordan,This movie was OK,4,9 April 2006,"This is not one of Spike Lee's best efforts, but it was entertaining. I think the plot was well written but not edited very well. We wont be seeing this one at the Emmy's. Denzel Washington over-acted a lot in this one, but Clive Owen played his part well. The plot was done with good twist's to keep us off track, and it did! I don't think anyone will be able to predict what is really happening. Don't worry, I wont tell what happens. This one is worth watching despite my critique. The movie house where I viewed this movie was fairly full and after it was over I noticed a lot of people chatting about the film and seemed to have enjoyed their night at the theater. Hey, after all....that's what it's all about isn't it?",Inside Man
692,fehm-1,Is Spike Lee a racist?,6,30 April 2006,"First of all I have to admit that I like Spike Lee movies! I think I don't need to explain by using bromides that he has style in directing movies. He is a kind of independent, new-wave, art-type of director who happens to be Afro-American which even makes his works and issues more interesting (that's true) and etc,etc...Once one of my friend (who happens to be Jewish) suggested me to watch Lee's movies carefully, so to pay attention to the little details and yes it is true(!!) he is an anti-Semite!!! In all of his movies there is/are some Jew character/s who are real typical stereotypes! All of them shown as evil, scummy, disgusting dorks who don't care about anything but cash and just got out of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. I don't know if the famous director got beaten up sometimes in Brooklyn by Jews, but I wouldn't even care. I'm sure he loved the Jewish characters in Passion!By the way, Inside Man wasn't that bad as an average hostage movie with Denzel Washington, but unfortunately one of the main actor was Denzel Washington!",Inside Man

It was.A good *intelligent* movie, that kept you guessing and kept you riveted to the story. The movie keeps you wondering (something Hollywood seems to have forgotten makes a movie enjoyable) what's really going on. I fully expected a typical hostage/bank robbery, yadda yadda, and Inside Man is far more than that.It's been a long time since there's been a truly enjoyable clever movie. This is one. Both Clive Owen and Denzel Washington give great performances. I'm not going to say anything about the story itself, go see it. It's definitely worth it.",Inside Man

The whole way through I was guessing and wondering what was going to happen, which is what I found amazing about this film.The casting for this movie is also a big plus. The phrase you get what you pay for really shows here. With Denzel Washington and Clive Owen being as strong as they are in this move they can really push expectations. Though not really seeing a need to have Jodie Foster's character in the movie, she does well.From watching The Bone Collector, Training Day, Man on Fire and now this Denzel without a doubt is simply one of the best actors out there.",Inside Man

You really have to watch it carefully from beginning to end or by the end of the movie, you will be totally lost...like ""hey what happened!"" Most, if not all the actors and actresses were great! It's really cool how they constructed the movie, how near the end, the bad guy introduces himself and basically lay it out for the audience of what went down. You would be amazed! And the method of going back in forth between past and present (If you know what I mean) is interesting, which is why you MUST watch it carefully. They had some great lines too! It's great how they mixed in some jokes with the serious work going on. As for the title, I think it's an interesting fit to the events in the movie...who is the Inside Man? Betta watch it!",Inside Man

It left me breathless and still talking about it. A definite MUST SEE. Bank robbers are probably taking notes as well. I was trying to solve the whole movie as it was played out and was delighted to learn that I was not even close. I cannot believe that the writers who created this story can have so many twists and turns. Of course, I wasn't clear on why they dug that hole. Was the sewer the clue? I enjoyed how each characters comments comes together in the end. I must see it again so I can catch what I had missed before. It is and will be a CLASSIC.",Inside Man
698,togerard,Spike Lee does it again,8,22 March 2006,"From the start the public gets a serious hint (a bloke in a cell) that it will end all wrong. The only question remains...how...Then the story starts.. It is shown how a group of people infiltrates a bank and hostages everyone(story well known and too much movies about that...)Soo what about this movie makes it so special? First of all Danzel Washington does a great job. He represents the maybe unexperienced, but clever guy of the corps(like in every bank-robbery movie there is only one of that kind). Second Jodie Foster gives the movie a mysterious - I know people with power that can hurt you real bad - touch . She plays kind of a problem solver that people (only very rich ones) can hire to solve their dirty little problems. This time she works for the founder of the bank. Her mission is to get the content of a safe before the bank robbers get their fingers on it...Clive Owen is without doubt the most brilliant actor of the movie. He first represents the evil...but after some while he starts to show his human side, a metamorphose that he performed extremely well.Although Gewirtz managed to give the story an unexpected swing, a big part of the story can be predicted from the start. Sometimes things are just too obvious. The end of the hostage taking is so predictable that you can go to the toilet for fifteen minutes and after that things will be just like you predicted. Only one little detail gives the movie the descent end that it deserves.",Inside Man

God, over and over and over.
Add some french horns and tubas for political intrigue and violas to demonstrate undercurrents of corrupt power.
I get the sense that the music is trying to bridge a gap between east and west in a post-9/11 world, but really, what does the opening Bollywood music have to do with anything in this movie? It is really out of place, really grating and repetitive, and when I hear it I just want to shout along derisively so hard that my gums begin to ache.
I'd rate this movie higher, but the music obliterates my willing suspension of disbelief and causes me to focus on the confusion it instills.",Inside Man
700,martina-ivy,Absolutely Wonderful!,9,9 April 2006,"I saw this film tonight at the cinema and WOW! What can I say, without doubt, this is one of the best suspense/drama films to have come out in a long time! From beginning to end, it keeps you guessing, teasing you with events and bits and pieces of plot that get you wanting more and more! The story unfolds at a wonderful pace, giving you hints and clues in all the appropriate places, but still managing to keep you guessing right up to the end.What I found so appealing about this film was that, not only is the plot-line great, but also very mysterious and difficult to interpret while watching. The acting is another highlight; the angst between Denzel Washington's and Clive Owen's characters is immense, and really adds to the sense of tension and drama.When I saw the trailer for this film, I couldn't help but think 'great, another one of THOSE films,' and only had a slight interest in seeing it, but after hearing of such critical acclaim I thought I'd give it a try and it is well worth it! Overall this film is cool, calm, collected and very slick. The only let down that can be mentioned is some of the camera movement, the 360 degree panning around a room may cause slight dizziness! But more importantly, this film is absolutely wonderful and while tension and suspense are the main object of the film, it even has a few laughs! Well worth seeing!",Inside Man
701,dlebecki,An amazing film,10,14 May 2006,"I just loved the film. I am still thinking about it and would gladly see it again. It is sizzling with social commentary and historical allusion. Spike Lee is definitely a great and thought provoking film maker. I see the film as a great story from which Spike Lee makes a cinematically great film with a great musical score and great performances. And at the same time he uses the film as a vehicle to focus his audience's attention on social, racial, and historical issues which interest him. to conclude in my opinion Spike put a lot of thought and insight into the film and i think he deserves to win an academy award for the inside man.",Inside Man

I was late from work, so I rushed at his house, and we we're nearly to late..Just in time we were about to see on of the best movies, where Denzel Washington occurs in! And one of the best movies for 2 years.The story tells about a bank being robbed, in a really unique way. The tools they use, and the way how they confuse the outside world is brilliant! Also the plot is very sweet. You have no clue where the movie is going and what is about to happen to the bank robbers. It is a movie with an end you hardly can't expect. It is different of all others movies with such a plot.Very good acting by Denzel Washington. But maybe even better by Clive Owen. He makes a stunning acting performance in this movie. Definitely worth to look even if you don't like these kind of movies. In my opinion it's even worth a top 250 all time movie!",Inside Man
703,eyetie,Plot holes the size of man holes,3,17 March 2006,"Saw this last night at a preview showing and, while it'd be an amusing independent movie, it's a complete travesty as a mainstream studio film. All the stars bar Kim Director are wasted (she's the only one to make bets use of her chief asset, which isn't her acting). None of the actors are going to win a razzie but they all probably phoned in their performances via their agents' PAs. Jodie Foster (and her role) are especially wasted as they are only on screen to unveil an unlikely subplot involving Nazi collaboration, a subplot which points to the biggest failings of the film: the huge plot holes. I don't mind a film which makes you think but this one will make you invent half the plot just to understand where the film starts off. SPOILERS The questions which come to mind are: how did Clive Owen's character come to know about Arthur Case? How did he know the exact location (an unlisted deposit box in one of the bank's branches)? Why does he care? How does he know about the security system in the bank? How did he know how to rig a bug in the messageboard? How did he monitor the bug given he had no audio equipment with him? How did he drown out the pizza box bugs by playing Enver Hoxha into one of the bugs?Hope someone else enjoyed it more than me.",Inside Man
704,jiro_wa,Not just a typical movie with some stars in it,9,26 March 2006,"In short, this movie is a blast amount others. It's not just like ""Fire Wall"" only having a star, Harrison Ford summoning you to go see it. In starring, ""Inside Man"", for sure, is really smart. Jodie Froster and Denzel Washington, they already the ones can attract you to go in the theater, but especially the last leading role, Clive Owen. I've fallen into the movie since I saw the trailer. A short soliloquy of him would do the huge gravity of the movie already. ""Because I can""(seems like Clinton) This can deliver the power of it. What some more? The background music of it. Actually, this movie only has one ""official theme music."" It's like some kind of middle-east style music. It's will make you feel like you are watching ""Syriana,"" pretty doesn't fit a crime drama takes place in New York City. From the beginning Clive Owen gets his van in Coney Island, picking up his partners and drive toward Wall Street. It makes you feel that this movie won't be like any other crime drama. At least Spike Lee doesn't want it be. Beside the well starring and funny-fitted music, the most outstanding of it is the screen write, like it's dialogue and ""cold jokes."" Again, not like ""Fire Wall,"" Lee doesn't just grab three stars and tell them let their faces be seen in the picture only. The dialogues from them really make ""the characters have character."" Everyone in the movie is attractive through the chemistry of it. Also the jokes form it. All the jokes happen smoothly. From the old lady doesn't want to stripe off, you will have an idea that this movie not just having a great star attraction, also a nice black comedy. One scene had done the nice combine of ""characterized character"" and ""cold joke."" It's about the forth interlude that Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor having ""individual interview"" of all the hostages/suspects, that they are interviewing the ""big tits"" woman (by the Asian guy). The camera supposedly that takes Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor in a really tight shot. And Chiwetel Ejiofor just can't take his eyes from ""them."" From these reasons, that's for sure it is an ultra-standing movie amount others.",Inside Man
705,yozimba,"Well Done , , , but . . .",8,26 March 2006,"Inside Man was well done but left some unanswered questions. Other than the identities of the robbers, we still really know little about them at the end. If we had more than a cursory sense of who these people were and what motivated them to do what they did, I would have rated the movie higher. Other than that, Denzell was Denzell . . . which is always great, as was Jodie Foster. The kid who played the bank guard's son (whose name I didn't catch at the end) was good too. Plus, the movie flowed. I did not even realize that it was over 2 hours long until I left the theater. It never seemed to bog down, except maybe a little at the end when Denzell was putting everything together. It was different from the movies I am used to seeing from Spike Lee. I hope he does more like this one.",Inside Man
706,magistrate2003,Definitely not up to par with other Spike Lee movies...,3,26 March 2006,"Three story lines and not enough tying them together, ""Inside Man"" was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical ""super-detective"" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as ""evil genius"" and ""criminal mastermind"" (both not the same in retrospect). Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. Yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden ""ah-ha!"" or summation of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, no where near Spike Lee's normal level. I have to completely disagree with the so-called ""professional critics""... this is not the movie they play it up to be.",Inside Man
707,SloanePenny,It'll be great on Cable TV,6,21 March 2006,"This is not the best work of Spike, Denzel, Jodie or Clive, but still this film is worth a look. I decided to see it because I am passionately in love with New York and thought a native film maker would give the city the loving care it needs.While I cannot say I was disappointed in the overall film, I can say that this film barely used more than a handful of NYC's locations. In it we saw a few Manhattan sites: inside the Wall Street area bank, the streets outside the downtown bank, the spectacular offices of the bank's chairman, inside the apartment that the Denzel character shares with his incredibly attractive on-screen girlfriend and a fancy restaurant in midtown. That's it.A basic bank heist film, Inside Man lacks the complexities of a ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" but does deliver on some of the basic insecurities of a post 9/11 city in transition, including the otherness of anyone who appears to be Arab (and this case a Sikh gentlemen), the lack of resources afforded the NYPD (who are left to search through a crowd to determine the language someone is speaking) and the fears of those who are comforted by a street sign (in this case the backdrop of an outdoor board that cries out 'we will never forget'). Still on an up note I will say that in INSIDE MAN, a. Denzel Washington proves he has the comedic chops to stand up to anyone as he delivers line after hilarious line that leaves the audience chuckling out loud and that b. Spike Lee and Jodie Foster have the guts to portray a woman of a certain age as she is - Botox free and full of normal, pretty wrinkle, unlike her contemporaries the Desperate Housewives.If you are looking for SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, look elsewhere. INSIDE MAN is not as good. If you are looking for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, look elsewhere; this is not as good. If you are looking for MALCOLM X, look else where; this is not as good.But if you are looking for a fun little date movie or a great cable find, tune it.

The story could have been so much better, but it looks like at the end, the last 30 minutes, they were bored with making the movie so they quickly made a foolish end.The beginning and the middle part of the movie was excellent. It was full of mysteries, and that's the reason why the movie kept me intriguing, just until the end, when the truth comes out. I was really disappointed and got the feeling: is that all, and what about......? where we don't have an answer because it just ""dissapeared"" The story had much potential, but they screwed up by making such a foolish end and mistakes throughout the story.Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie, but at the end, I had en empty feeling and was disappointed about the mistakes they made in the storyline.",Inside Man

It should only be so easy. The only disappointment is Jodie Foster, who is so plastic she does not ring true with the other characters. Her part is small enough not to mar the film. There are more ethnic references in this movie than there are ethnicities in NYC -- starting with a song from the Indian musical ""Bombay Dreams"" that sets the tempo for the film over the opening credits.

Jodie Foster is comfortable in her role as a ""bad person"", but one cannot help but like her deviant character. She is at her sexiest ever. Spike Lee's direction is slick and compelling (although some people do not like the jarring camera movements at times), so it is nice ""eye candy"" as well.

But, leaving the theater, I was disappointed because Mr. Lee seemed to be more interested in flaunting his moviemaker chops instead of insuring his story worked and because Jodie Foster inexplicably tanked her role. The biggest hole in the story is, if the police had matched up cell phones and/or clothing with hostages, the perps would have been easily exposed. At the very least they would have weeded out 99 percent of the genuine hostages, leaving a very small number to deal with. How to explain Jodie Foster's terrible awful acting job? At no point did she seem authentic. It was a parody, an extremely poorly done parody, of the fixer character.

720,shawnconway-1,One of a Kind!,10,18 April 2006,"Spike Lee's, Inside Man, has got to be one of the greatest films I have seen in a long time. It was an amazingly brilliant film! From the very beginning, it had captured my attention.The beginning opens up with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) revealing his plan to rob a bank. He explains, very tactfully, how this is going to be the greatest robbery to ever exist, and how he will actually get away with it, and ""walk right out the doors"" with the money. He appears to be very cocky, yet very smart. As the movie then brings its credits up, they come up as combination locks, which told me right off, that something was locked up and will probably be revealed.Dalton Russell and his accomplices enter into a Manhattan bank disguised as painters. From the very beginning of this heist, you see the elaborate planning that went into this ""extraordinary"" robbery. As they gather everyone in the bank as hostages, they make all fifty of them put on the very same painters outfit as they were wearing. A New York cop, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), is put in charge of negotiating this hostage situation. By this time, the Manhattan Trust Bank is surrounded by the NYPD, but it doesn't seem to bother Russell at all. In fact, he actually takes his time. This film is not entirely chronological. We randomly see scenes of Frazier and his partner, Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), interviewing each of the hostages at the end of the robbery.The situation gets even more complicated when the chairman of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) has something in a safety deposit box that he doesn't want anyone to know about. Arthur Case calls on Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to fix his problem. She amazingly makes her way into the bank to ""negotiate"" with the perpetrator, Russell. The plot gets thicker, and soon Frazier realizes that he is missing something in this ""puzzle"".Without ruining the ending, I will say that this movie has many twists and turns, enough to keep you thinking throughout the movie. This was a very thought out movie, and I would highly recommend it. I was thoroughly impressed with everything, including the actors, camera angels, and Lee's love for adding such reality to his films.",Inside Man
721,pcrlarsen,Not Impressed,5,30 March 2006,"I will admit, I left the theater somewhat impressed with the movie, but looking back, this movie is a 5 at best. I felt like the seriousness of some scenes were completely out of place with the comedy relief of others. The movie is also filled with clichés that make the writing look cheap.I do agree with others though that Jodie Foster is great in this. Her character is good and its a nice change (albeit a subtle one) from her typical roles. Denzel gives a solid but uninspired performance. I think the best actor in the whole movie is the one you can't even see (don't want to spoil it so I won't say who it is).",Inside Man
722,fryejl,Confused... not by the movie...,3,30 March 2006,"I'm confused how so many people can call this movie ""unpredictable."" I have a spoiler for you, it's over two hours long and could have told me the whole movie and wasted less of my time in about 35mins. I walked out knowing only slightly more than what I saw in the previews. This is not because I didn't understand it, it's because nothing happened for an hour and a half... You can't spend 1.5 hours on character development, and 5 minutes on the climax and not tell the ""Why"" of the movie.. Withing 15 minutes, it was obvious the bank robbers had an agenda other than the money. Typical Spike Lee movie... Two hours of racial connotations, with a plot no where to be found. None of the important questions I had going into the movie were answered. It's disappointing to watch good actors do well with their roles, but be so limited by the story. Denzel, Clive, Foster, Dafoe all did great with their roles. The movie was just very disappointing.",Inside Man
