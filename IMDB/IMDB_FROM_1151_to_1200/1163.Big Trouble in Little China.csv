0,MartinHafer,"Sort of like ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""...but with a truck...and Chinese demigods.",7,4 August 2019,"""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a perfect film is you want an action picture where you don't need to think too much. This is NOT meant as an insult...sometimes you really want a movie like this. The plot to the film is a bit like ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""...combined with a martial arts movie...an odd combination to say the least!When the story begins, Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is driving with a Chinese-American friend in Chinatown. Suddenly, they find themselves in the middle of a Tong war...with hatchets, guns and mayhem. The 'good guys' appear to be winning when suddenly, several demigod-like characters arrive....with mystical powers and like the worst of the baddies in Shaw Brothers martial arts films. Jack and his friend manage to escape...but Jack loses his truck and the bulk of the film consists of the good guys infiltrating the baddies' hideout to extricate kidnapped women...and Jack's truck.If you are looking for realism, do not watch this picture. It's all very tongue-in-cheek and silly...and Russell plays a tough guy who really is in way over his head. Very enjoyable...not especially deep.",Big Trouble in Little China
1,bkoganbing,The Girls with the green eyes,6,19 October 2016,"Big Trouble In Little China casts Kurt Russell as your average working man truck driver who stops to help a damsel in distress Suzee Pai who is the fiancé of Denis Dun, Russell's friend. She's kidnapped and he loses his truck. Later on investigative reporter Kim Cattrall is kidnapped as well. Both of these women happen to have green eyes, in Asian women that's like finding the proverbial four leaf clover.Some very ancient, like 2000 year old ancient spirit needs a green eyed girl to make him mortal with a body so he can taste human pleasure again. Dun wants his girl back and Russell wants his truck back so it's into the mysteries of the inscrutable east searching for both women.John Carpenter reunites with Kurt Russell who starred in his Escape From New York. This time without eye patch and in a much lighter vein Russell looks like he's having a great old time as the ostensible hero of this piece. He has very little patience with all the rituals and rigmarole the Chinese martial artists are going through. But the other worldly creatures are a bit much for him.It looks like John Carpenter was in many spots doing special effects for the sake of same. That's all right as this a comedy. Poor Kurt he's trying so hard to learn the players in Chinatown. Someone should have handed the poor man a scorecard.Big Trouble In Little China is fast paced and easy to take and a lot of fun for the viewer.",Big Trouble in Little China
2,Leofwine_draca,"Noisy, brash, effects-filled '80s extravaganza",6,8 November 2015,"This outing from famed horror director John Carpenter starts out promisingly enough, with a kidnapping at an airport and a nice tough-guy turn from Kurt Russell (who else, when Carpenter's involved?), complete with swagger. However, twenty minutes into the film, it becomes very silly indeed, and obviously aimed at children. The film that came to mind while I watched this was STREET FIGHTER, if that gives you any idea of the style of action taking place here.The special effects (of which there are hundreds) are admittedly very good for the time in which this was made. The baddies here are the least threatening in Carpenter's filmography, Chinese blokes who gurn occasionally in their bid to terrify. The action is kept light, although due to a couple of nasty bits this film was unfortunately rated 15 in this country - a shame, as the film would appeal most to young teenagers.Aside from Kurt Russell and Dennis Dun, who have a nice sparring chemistry in their buddy-buddy relationship, the cast is bog standard. Along with the bad acting of the Chinese heavies, we have Kim Cattrall as a forgettable reporter, Victor Wong doing his patented 'wise old man' schtick and all manner of other nobodies and expendables who kind of hover around in the background. There are plenty of one-liners for Russell to spit out, but anyone expecting even a semi-serious film will be disappointed. Take this one as an out-and-out comedy and you might just enjoy it.",Big Trouble in Little China
3,SnoopyStyle,fun kung-fu action adventure,9,25 March 2015,"Egg Shen recalls the extraordinary events in San Francisco's Chinatown. Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a brash tough-talking truck driver. After a Nothing-or-Double bet, he drives Wang Chi to the airport to pick up his green-eyed fiancée Miao Yin from China. Wing Kong street gang from Chinatown kidnaps Miao Yin. Lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall) catches Burton's attention at the airport. She's there to pick up Tara but she knows something about the gangs. The guys go back to Chinatown and run into an all-out fight between the good guys Chang Sing and their enemies Wing Kong. Then the three storms Thunder, Rain, Lightning, and Lo Pan (James Hong) arrive to massacre everybody. Reporter Margo (Kate Burton) is looking for the story. David Lo Pan is looking for a girl with green eyes to marry.This is a fun smart-spoof kung-fu adventure from John Carpenter. Russell and Cattrall are camping it up as much as possible. Russell especially is hilarious as the arrogant know-it-all white guy. He's a bunch of laughs with his brash talk. Cattrall is dead-pan fun as she machine-guns her lines. The movie is just a load of funny wild non-stop adventure thrills. It is imminently rewatchable and hilarious.",Big Trouble in Little China
4,claudio_carvalho,One of the Greatest Action and Popcorn Movies of the 80's,8,12 October 2003,"The truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russel) arrives in Chinatown, San Francisco, and goes to the airport with his Chinese friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) to welcome his green-eyed fiancée Miao Yin (Suzee Pai) that is arriving from China. However she is kidnapped on the arrival by a Chinese street gang and Jack and Wang chase the group. Soon they learn that the powerful evil sorcerer called David Lo Pan (James Hong), who has been cursed more than two thousand years ago to exist without physical body, needs to marry a woman with green eyes to retrieve his physical body and Miao is the chosen one. Jack and Wang team-up with the lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), the bus driver and sorcerer apprentice Egg Shen (Victor Wong) and their friends and embark in a great adventure in the underground of Chinatown, where they face a world of magicians and magic, monsters and martial arts fighters.""Big Trouble in Little China"" is one of the best action movies of the 80's. The director John Carpenter deserves an Oscar for his filmography. It is amazing how many great movies John Carpenter has offered for us, lovers of action / sci-fi / horror movies. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" combines action, comedy and magic and in Brazil has been presented many times in the afternoon / popcorn session of TV. Kurt Russel is great in this type of movie, and Kim Cattral (the ex-Lieutenant Klingon of Star Trek and the nymphomaniac Samantha in ""Sex and the City"" ) is gorgeous as Gracie Law. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a great entertainment for the whole family. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Os Aventureiros do Bairro Proibido"" (""The Adventurers of the Forbidden Zone"")Note: On 14 November 2014, I saw this movie again.

5,kosmasp,Fantastical Adventure,8,12 March 2021,"Another one of the Carpenter classics (perception wise that is) and another one added to the list. I had not seen this until the other day and have to admit it was quite the fun ride. The two main characters really elevate the movie experience and really do the best to make this as fun as possible.That doesn't mean this is without flaws. Quite the opposite is the case, the pacing may be too much for some, the coherent level may vary and you may get confused more than a few times. But the movie has enough charme to get you over any of that. It has enough crazy ideas and enough of buddy comedy and enough of mythology to get your juices going.For some so much, that they might be angered I only gave this 8 - but for others this may feel as too high a rating. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a try. The effects especially (because pre CGI) have aged very well, this can be as camp as you want it to be. Entertainment all around",Big Trouble in Little China
6,gavin6942,"A Strange, Yet Wonderful, Adventure Film",7,3 June 2013,"An All-American trucker (Kurt Russell) gets dragged into a centuries-old mystical battle in Chinatown.I really do not know what to make of this film. It has martial arts, gun play, some spiritual and mystical aspects... the plot is constantly fast-paced, with no time for a rest between the bizarre moments and scenarios the leads find themselves in.Some of it seems a bit odd -- the romance between Jack and Gracie comes off as forced and far too quick, but given the fun nature of this movie, that really should not be a big surprise. Jack goes from being an outsider to fighting in the trenches within minutes without much coaxing.The ""green eyes"" subplot was also strange. If the idea was a Chinese woman with green eyes, I see how that could be rare and cause the villain to wait thousands of years. Yet, it seems that the Chinese part is optional, as Gracie (very Caucasian) gets caught up in things, too. Green eyes in white women is not hard to find...",Big Trouble in Little China
7,lee_eisenberg,John Carpenter may have reached his apex with this movie.,10,21 June 2005,"Okay. The title should identify that this is not a serious movie. And believe you me, it isn't (I mean that positively). Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, a truck driver who sounds like he spends all day watching reruns of sitcoms and Sylvester Stallone movies. Then, when Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall) is captured, Jack and several other people have to go underground in San Francisco's Chinatown to try and rescue her. Down there, they find evil sorcerer Lo Pan and his empire. From there, the movie is basically a litany of various forms of ass-kicking. My favorite scene was the fight scene where everyone is just flying at each other.""Big Trouble in Little China"" is completely silly - and rather ridiculous - from beginning to end, but the good kind of silly and ridiculous. If nothing else, the whole thing is worth seeing just to hear Kurt Russell's hilariously sarcastic comments.",Big Trouble in Little China
8,jboothmillard,Big Trouble in Little China,4,10 March 2016,"Directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York, The Thing, Starman), I had heard the title a few times and I knew the leading actor in it, I didn't know what to expect, but I hoped for something fun. Basically truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) and his friend, restaurant owner Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), go to pick up Wand's fiancée Miao Yin (Suzee Pai), who is arriving from China, at the airport. Chinese street gang the Lords of Death try to kidnap another Chinese girl, intending to sell her as a sex slave, she is being met by her friend Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), but Jack intervenes and the gang kidnap Miao instead. Jack and Wang track the gang down to Chinatown, a funeral procession is taking place, a fight breaks out between ancient societies the Chang Sing and the Wing Kong, ""The Three Storms"" (Thunder, Rain, and Lightning) appear and slaughter the Chang Sing, Jack trying to escape runs over powerful and legendary sorcerer, and the leader of the Wing Kong, David Lo Pan (James Hong), but he survives and is annoyed. Wang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet Gracie, Wang's friend Eddie Lee (Donald Li), and magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a sceptical Jack is told about the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought to America, and they devise a plan to infiltrate a brothel they believe Miao Yin is being held, but the Storms make off with her. Trying to rescue her, Jack and Wang are subdued and taken to Lo Pan, in the form of a crippled old man, Wang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a special green-eyed girl, like Miao Yin, to marry, and to sacrifice, to break the ancient No Flesh curse, put upon him centuries ago, when he used to be a great warrior and a powerful wizard, by the first sovereign emperor Qin Shi Huang. Jack and Wang's friends attempt to rescue them, they are also captured, and Lo Pan notices that Gracie has green eyes, he decides he will sacrifice Gracie, and he will marry the unwilling Miao Yin. Jack and Wang get advantage of Thunder and manage to escape and free many other women being held hostage from their cells, they go to see Egg Shen, and get help from the Chang Sing to enter an underground cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters, each of the group are given a potent potion by Egg, during the wedding ceremony a fight ensues, Jack misses it because he accidentally knocks himself out. Rain is killed by Wang in a sword duel, Jack and Gracie try to catch Lo Pan, he is killed by Jack with a skillful knife throw, Thunder becomes enraged, inflates to an enormous size and kills himself exploding. Lightning corners Jack, Wang, Gracie and Miao Yin in the corridor, which he makes it collapse, Egg drops a stone Buddha statue on Lightning to kill him, and rescues the four with a rope, the group find Jack's big-rig truck and escape back to Wang's restaurant. The group celebrate Lo Pan being defeated, Wang and Miao Yin are ready to get married, Gracie's journalist friend Margo Litzenberger (Kate Burton) has paired up with Eddie, and Egg decides to go on an overdue vacation to China, Jack does not start a new life with Gracie as everyone expected, he hits the open road, unaware a stowaway is underneath, one of the remaining monsters. Also starring Chao Li Chi as Uncle Chu. Russell is likable enough as the tough trucker who initially inept and doesn't want to get involved but gives in and becomes the hero, but I have seen these sorts of films before, the fusing of martial arts and a western adventure story doesn't quite gel, most of the fight scenes are dull, and the special effects are reasonable, but there are ridiculous parts, the man growing and exploding is particularly odd, this may be a cult classic to many fans, I just think it's an alright fantasy action comedy. Okay!",Big Trouble in Little China
9,ccthemovieman-1,A Tongue-In-Cheek '80s 'Classic',9,22 June 2006,"This is one of the wildest stories ever: a cartoon come to life and a mixture of an old-time serial with modern special-effects with bold colors all the way through.This movie is pure tongue-in-cheek. One just has to take nothing seriously in here and just go along on the wild ride. From the nonsense mystical Chinese sorcery that is taken so reverently, to the American hero ""Jack Burton"" (Kurt Russell) who displays the fearless macho man, to combatants flying through the air (this was 15 years before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was filmed), to one exotic character and situation after another - it's all absurd fun.Russell plays his role to the hilt, playing his favorite kind of role when he was younger: brash, bold and an ignoramus who fears absolutely nothing. His lines are deliberately corny and one can bet he had a lot of fun making this movie. He even gets in a few good comedic lines. His partner, Dennis Dunn, is a likable guy with a devilish grin on his face and Kim Cattrell plays the more modern damsel-in-distress role to the hilt, too.They could have lightened this up a bit on the action - it gets to be too much at times - but the movie is just slightly over an hour-and-half. It still wore me out the first few times I saw it.All in all: ludicrous fun, a kind of Indiana Jones in Chinatown adventure flick.",Big Trouble in Little China
10,rmax304823,The Yellow Peril.,4,31 August 2012,"I guess it's not surprising that this kiddie-level action/fantasy came up with a median score of 7.2 stars, coming as it does from a country whose film industry is chiefly aimed at aficionados of cage fighting and air guitar contests.It's not entirely lost. Kim Cattrall is always easy on the eyes in a modelesque yet slightly exotic way. She has the highest flaring malars of anyone on the screen since Gene Tierney. And I like James Hong a lot. At the time he was Hollywood's designated Chinese guy and had some fairly varied roles, from comic to treacherous, the 80's answer to Richard Loo.I don't think it's worth going on about Kurt Russell, an everyman truck driver, and his young Chinese friend who get swept up in Tang wars and wizardry in San Francisco's Chinatown. Most of the movie was shot at the studio but there are some location shots of this colorful neighborhood, where I spent many days tingling with pleasure while mapping the inclination angle of the streets and taking beer breaks in The Happy Buddha.""Ready, Jack?"", asks Russell's Chinese friend, Wun Hung Lo. ""I was BORN ready,"" replies confident Jack.Near the beginning there is a fight between two gangs that is emblematic of the whole. One gang is carrying a casket through the streets, dressed in plain white muslin. (They got that part right.) The mourners encounter a rival gang, dressed all in black and accessorized by scarlet turbans and sashes. A terrific donneybrook ensues, during which the mourners in white begin to don dark clothing, which is a mistake because then they all begin to look alike.I admire the way these martial arts contests are conducted. A fighter doesn't even have to look when he strikes out with a punch to an enemy standing next to him, or even slightly BEHIND him. Chop! Another unconscious body. The fight is ended when three or four wizards descend from the sky and are surrounded by scintillating neon-blue auras that zap out in tendrils and cause harm to those who threaten him. Russell and his friend witness this dramatic display and are, well, frankly surprised, but manage to put it all behind them quickly. Magic or no magic, Russell wants his truck back.But why go on? The movie seems to have a good deal of popular appeal, although it seems to me to be no more than strictly minor entertainment.",Big Trouble in Little China

12,BA_Harrison,Not as good as the films that inspired it.,6,16 July 2011,"Kudos to John Carpenter for being one of the first Hollywood film-makers to recognise the sheer awesomeness of Hong Kong fantasy movies, but I really wish he hadn't done so with such an erratic and cartoonish effort: technically, Big Trouble in Little China has a fair amount going for it—a sizable budget, impressive effects from Richard Edlund, elaborate set design, and stunning photography by Dean Cundey—but the script is far too scatter-shot and the style employed goes way beyond mere B-movie tongue-in cheek cheesiness and well into hammy territory.Carpenter has proved himself to be an talented film-maker, certainly a master of atmosphere, but I've never considered action to be one of his strong points; Kurt Russell can be a cool and charismatic lead, but here he comes across as a bit of an ass-hat thanks to his overly cocky yet totally useless character. With neither director or star playing to their strengths, some of the cast delivering particularly painful performances (Kim Cattrall is appalling), and the plot careening all over the place, Big Trouble in Little China is far from the unmissable cult classic that many would have us believe it to be.Fortunately, the film does whip along at a brisk enough pace to ensure that it never bores, there's the occasional quotable line of dialogue and decent special effect, and Carter Wong kicks ass, but it cannot hold a candle to the 'real McCoy', incredible Hong Kong supernatural martial arts flicks of the 80s such as A Chinese Ghost Story, Mr.Vampire, The Seventh Curse, Encounters of the Spooky Kind, and Zu Warriors.6.5/10: a valiant attempt but too flawed for me to round it up to 7.",Big Trouble in Little China
13,Quinoa1984,"a little goofy, as off-the-wall as can be, but also- for the right viewer- just the ticket",8,6 April 2006,"Big Trouble in Little China is a movie that is perfect for me IF I'm in the right kind of mood. Sometimes I turn the channels and see this on and can't bear to watch it if I'm on one of those overly 'bad' days. But if things aren't too bad, and nothing else is going on too troubling in the world, this film does the trick entertainment-wise. In some ways it might be director John Carpenter's most shamelessly entertaining genre flick, with it's hero (Kurt Russell) a truck driving near sailor-mouthed (at least has the attitude to a T) guy getting involved with a strange martial arts fantasy plot. Going into the film you should know a little background, like how the original title was going to be the sequel to the first Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai picture. It's almost too off-the wall at times, with some wild supporting characters thrown into the mix. To talk about the plot of the film might be moot; it's suffice to say the film works because a) Russell is at his best in one of his few Carpenter collaborations, with enough male swagger for any beer-drinking guy; b) the special effects and fight scenes, even by today's standards, are not that bad and even have an effect where a little-kid voice inside keeps saying ""so awesome""; and c) as escapist entertainment, you could do a helluva lot worse.",Big Trouble in Little China
14,Coventry,Irresistibly silly B-movie Magic,7,21 July 2008,"""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a bit of an outsider in John Carpenter's overall versatile repertoire, but it may simultaneously also be his most accessible and amusingly grotesque achievement. Basically and with a slight bit of imagination, this could simply be described as a cash-in on the Indiana Jones success formula. You know: adventurous movies where the actual plot and coherence of the script are secondary to the continuous action scenes and ingenious stunts. But, since John Carpenter is a skillful and multi-talented movie narrator, his contribution is so much more than a cheap and exploitative imitation, notably a widely imaginative spectacle with witty humor, eccentric situations and a thoroughly irresistible B-movie atmosphere. Even though I just finished the film, I can't give you a proper summary of the plot (I wonder if anyone can) but it all doesn't matter that much, since the emphasis here lies on geeky Kung-Fu battles, ancient Chinese myths and black magic and  most importantly  the stereotypical all-American hero character and his glorious non-stop self-mockery. Kurt Russell, in his third successful collaboration with Carpenter after ""The Thing"" and ""Escape from NY"" is simply sublime as the sleeveless shirt wearing trucker Jack Burton who suddenly becomes involved in a network of abduction, gang wars, Oriental black magic and monstrous entities; all happening underneath the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown. One moment Jack's gambling with his Chinese pal Wang, the next he's up to his neck in big trouble, as it turns out the notorious Chinese sorcerer Lo Pan kidnapped Wang's fiancée in order to uplift a 900 year old curse. Jack and Wang team up with the few remaining reliable people in Chinatown, among them a sexy female attorney and a geeky tourist bus driver, and set out to clear the sewers from all supernatural demons. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" offers non-stop undemanding pulp entertainment and popcorn humor, and that's really all you can expect from a commercial 80's film hit. There's a nice and wide selection of comedy here, from deliberately over-the-top macho one-liners (""This is gonna take crackerjack timing!"") to downright slapstick situations (Jack firing his gun into the ceiling only for the plaster to fall on his head and causing him to miss the fight). The entire cast give away wonderful tongue-in-cheek performances, Kurt Russell on top, and John Carpenter's direction is as adequate here as it is in grim action flicks (""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Escape from New York"") and disturbing horror movies (""Halloween"", ""The Thing""). The typically 80's synthesizer soundtrack is awesome and the special effects team clearly had a blasting good time as well, coming up with all sorts of flamboyant hocus-pocus gimmicks. By no means is this a film that will ever top my personal list of all-time favorites, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who enjoys an good over-sized portion of 80's B-movie nostalgia.",Big Trouble in Little China

16,hitchcockthelegend,Ol' Jack always says... what the hell?,8,13 September 2010,"Out of 20th Century Fox, Big Trouble in Little China is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell, Kim Catrall, Dennis Dun, James Hong & Victor Wong. The adaptation is by W.D. Richter with the screenplay from Gary Goldman & David Z. Weinstein. Dean Cundey photographs and Alan Howarth doubles up with Carpenter for the musical score.Truck driver Jack Burton (Russell) agrees to take his friend Wang Chi (Dun) to pick up his fiancée at the airport. Little does he know that he is about to get involved in a supernatural battle between good and evil beneath San Francisco's Chinatown district.A box office failure upon its release, and known to be the moment when John Carpenter gave up on Hollywood, Big Trouble in Little China has gathered ""cult"" momentum over the years and shows up rather well these days. Blending Chinese mysticism with chop-schlocky adventure, Carpenter's movie is at once daft but also a ball of energetic fun - propelled by a handsome, but inept action hero. Carpenter had always wanted to tackle a martial arts movie, and here he gets to do it whilst laying on the comedy and playing with effects work as his movie mostly comes alive in a magical underworld of monsters, magicians and sexy green eyed women.It's evident now that the film was ahead of its time, not from a technical viewpoint, but from the point it tried to Americanise chopsocky. This is some time before Chinese style wire-work and mythology became common to Hollywood, one has to believe that Tarantino was nodding approvingly around about this time. It's also worth noting that although this ""American"" movie has an American beefcake as its main protagonist, it's the Asian Americans who actually are the heroes of the piece, with Dun's sidekick the stand out hero as Russell's Burton bumbles his way from one sequence to the next. It was a bold move by Carpenter to structure the narrative this way, something that annoyed the executives at Fox and kept the paying public bemused. It's easy to see why the film failed, contrast it with the similarly themed Eddie Murphy movie, The Golden Child, from the same year, which was a box office success. There the public got what they wanted (or what they were used too), the standard American hero fluff where Murphy saves the day and gets the girl.Carpenter dared to be different and clearly had a lot of fun along the way, as evidently did his cast. It may have taken a decade of VHS and DVD releases to prove he was right, but right he was, Big Trouble in Little China is a damn fine popcorn movie. Russell plays it meat head style, with swagger in tow and tongue stuck in cheek, nicely toned physique for the girls to enjoy, and making vest wearing cool two years before Willis did in Die Hard. Cattrall is wonderfully alluring, red lips and green eyes shimmering bright in a world of colour; and boys do look out for her wet scene, it's wolf whistle time! Dun is likable and athletic, while Hong as Lo Pan gives the action/adventure genre a truly memorable villain. The film is briskly paced and not found wanting in the set piece department either. Not all the effects are high grade stuff, but in a film with such zestful comic book traditions at heart, it hardly matters one jot. With a great home format package doing it justice, Carpenter's movie is now, at long last, getting the appreciative audience it fully deserves. Amen to that. 8/10",Big Trouble in Little China
17,Scarecrow-88,"The Scarecrow reviews ""Big Trouble in Little China""",8,23 July 2006,"Some films move so fast plot holes and incoherency can be less focused on. Carpenter's film is so energetic and fun, it is such an example. It is loaded with Chinese Black Magic mumbo jumbo and supernatural shenanigans, but if one can accept it on it's own terms might just find themselves loving it. It pretty much doesn't catch a breath as we watch Kurt Russell's trucker Jack Burton get immediately mixed into an old gang war led by the mysterious Lo Pan(James Hong)who desires the green eyed love of Wang(Dennis Dun)to become mortally young and all powerful. His supernatural cohorts have specific powers and are named ""the three storms"" as they are able to crush anyone who gets in their way. One has the ability to increase his body mass, another is able to build electricity from his hands, and another is able to move really fast. Each cause Wang and Jack problems when the poor trucker loses his truck during this blood feud that ignites in Chinatown. Kim Cattrall plays newspaper reporter Gracie Law, looking for a story along with her partner Margo(Kate Burton). Soon even Wang's pal Eddie(Donald Li)gets involved. But, during their trials at trying to free Wang's green-eyed love, they will have to enlist in Egg Chen's service..a wise old sorcerer played by the always reliable Victor Wong. The film is loaded with martial arts action and wild special(and make-up)effects and old Chinese lore. If one can indeed shut their brain off and not take this film at all seriously, this film is no doubt a blast. Kurt Russell and his cast bring such an enthusiasm to the proceedings and that electronic score from Carpenter is great.",Big Trouble in Little China
18,Hey_Sweden,"Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?",8,8 September 2013,"In terms of pure entertainment, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" may be one of director John Carpenters' all-time best films. It's a lively, hilarious, rollicking fantasy-action film combining martial arts, Chinese mysticism, and humour into one irresistible B movie with extra cheese. The dialogue is often quite funny, especially as spoken by Carpenters' frequent leading man Kurt Russell, who delivers one of his most enjoyable performances of all time. If the film isn't making you laugh out loud, it should at the very least be putting a couple of smiles on your face.Kurt stars as swaggering truck driver Jack Burton, who gets caught up in strange events as he witnesses the abduction of his good friends' bride-to-be. The force of evil behind it all is over 2,000 year old spirit David Lo Pan (James Hong), who's been living under a curse. Fortunately, Jack's got some formidable allies on his side, including his buddy Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) and amiable old sorcerer Egg Shen (Victor Wong). For his purposes Lo Pan must wed Wangs' lady Miao Yin (Suzee Pai), who's got a feature quite unique for a Chinese girl.Carpenter is in fine form, crafting a fast moving bit of escapist fare that is wise never to take itself too seriously. One of the brightest touches is playing Jack Burton not as a hero (although he *thinks* he's the hero), but the bumbling comedy relief, with the supposed ""sidekick"", Wang, in full heroic mode. Carpenter works with his production designer & cinematographer team from ""The Thing"", John Lloyd and Dean Cundey, and the two of them do some excellent work. (Unfortunately, this turned out to be the final collaboration between Carpenter and Cundey.) Carpenters' own electronic score is fun, and he also composes the catchy title song with his band The Coupe de Villes (also including his friends Tommy Lee Wallace and Nick Castle). The visual effects by Richard Edlund are quite good.Kurt clearly is having a high old time as Jack Burton, delivering his various one liners and other bits of dialogue with relish. Kim Cattrall looks gorgeous (as does Ms. Pai) and is able to divulge a lot of exposition in a breathless way. Dun is very likable as Wang, as is Wong as Egg. Hong is a delightfully flamboyant villain. Kate Burton, Donald Li, and Chao Li Chi are good in support, and familiar faces such as Jerry Hardin, George Cheung, and Al Leong have some great small roles.Lovers of B movies should get a kick out of this. If one has any doubts as to whether to give it a chance, just do what ol' Jack Burton does, and say ""What the hell."" Eight out of 10.",Big Trouble in Little China
19,preppy-3,Just great comedy/fantasy,8,26 December 2002,"Big budget comedy/fantasy from John Carpenter.  The plot is kind of hard to summarize--Kurt Russell (doing a very funny imitation of John Wayne) gets involved with Chinese ghosts, sorcery, white slavery, warring gangs...you name it.  The plot moves VERY quickly...it does make sense, but you have to pay full attention to every single line of dialogue and fill in some of the blanks yourself.  The screenwriter, W.D. Richter, also did the screenplay for ""Buckaroo Banzai""--if you can follow that film, you'll follow this. 
The acting, with the exception of Russell, isn't that good, but who really cares?  There's virtual non-stop action (love the sequence where two men are flying through the air while having a sword fight), great special effects and some hysterical one-liners from Russell.  Basically, this is a real fun action movie.  Universal didn't know how to sell this film so it was a critical and financial bomb but it's acquired a following on video.  Try seeing the letter-boxed DVD.  Well worth seeing.One warning--Despite the PG-13 rating there's a lot of casual violence and quite a bit of swearing.  This perhaps is not a film for little kids.",Big Trouble in Little China

He has Directed a lot of Entertaining Movies, mostly Outside the Hollywood System and has Always been Comfortable Making Low to Mid Budget Movies with that Carpenter Vision. He has made Sure Enough Classics, a Few Mediocre (although His Cult would never admit it) Movies, and a Handful of Bad Ones (Blasphemy).This is One that when First Released was Unfairly Maligned, Dismissed, and Outright Blasted by the Critics. It was Ignored at the Box Office and was a Big Flop. But the Director Never thought He was in Big Trouble. He just Continued Making Movies as if Nothing Ever Happened. This Film is Part of the Carpenter Canon and has become a Cult Favorite.It is a High Energy Hoot of a Movie. The Director's Homage to those Mystical Asian Movies Full of Sorcery, Fun and Fantasy, Combined with an Over the Top Take on Marital Arts and Monsters.

21,poolandrews,Hugely entertaining fantasy adventure.,7,27 June 2008,"Big Trouble in Little China is set in San Francisco where truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) meets up with an old friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), together they go to the airport to pick up Wang's bride to be Miao Yin (Suzee Pai) but she is kidnapped by local Chinese thugs. Chasing them into Chinatown Jack & Wang discover strange supernatural forces are at work as the 4000 year old evil sorcerer Lo Pan (James Hong) needs to marry & sacrifice a green eyed girl in order to appease the Gods & become flesh & blood again. With the whole world at stake Jack & Wang team up with good sorcerer Egg Shen (Victor Wong) & his men to save Miao Yin & put an end to Lo Pan's evil once & for all...Directed by John Carpenter who also helped compose the music score this fantasy adventure film wasn't well received at the time of it's initial release but I think it's a terrifically entertaining mix of ideas, themes & genres. The script by Gary Goldman & David Z. Weinstein is notable for how many different genres it takes inspiration from & have fun with, from western to horror to sci-fi to fantasy to action adventure to martial arts to comedy to monster film & Big Trouble in Little China ends up being a rather unique flick although I hasten to add that it's a hugely entertaining one if you just sit back & enjoy the ride for what it is. I must admit I love it's mix of crazy ideas & themes, there are outrageous martial arts fights, monsters, secret worlds full of magic, ancient sorcerers, exploding people, eye creatures, daring escapes & a bizarre ritual in which Lo Pan has his brides to be hold onto a sword which then levitates to the ceiling where they have to touch a light shade for no apparent reason! The film moves along at a good pace & at only 90 odd minutes in length the time flies by, it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, there are some very funny one-liners & the Jack Burton character is just great & makes for a very likable hero. He gets thrown into this situation & just sort of stumbles his way through it not really knowing what is going on, he never really does anything heroic & generally ends up looking a bit daft as his oriental mate comes to his rescue on more than one occasion.Big Trouble in Little China was the fourth time director Carpenter had teamed up with star Kurt Russell after Elvis (1979), Escape from New York (1981) & The Thing (1982) & he turns in a very imaginative film, some of the fights are a little silly but the film is as a whole so that doesn't really matter that much. Overall the film isn't that violent, there are quite a few death's but nothing graphic is shown. The film is certainly very colourful although I must admit I though some of the bright neon lighting (especially around the six armed statue in the background) at the end looked a little too much like bright garish lighting from a cheap pop video for my liking. The special effects are generally good although do look a little dated these days, I have the 2 Disc special edition DVD of Big Trouble in Little China & the box states that it contains 46 minutes of deleted scenes which I never bothered to watch but since the finished film only lasts 90 odd minutes that's a lot of material that was cut as well as the ending which was also cut.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 Big Trouble in Little China absolutely bombed at the box-office big time, it made considerably less than $3,000,000 during it's opening weekend. Ouch. Having said that it's still a great film, just an obviously misunderstood one. The performances are fun with the charismatic Kurt Russell shining while Kim Cattrall is nice enough as the love interest.Big Trouble in Little China is a great film that I have always liked, it's strange mixture of fantasy, western, horror, martial arts & action adventure make it one of a kind & surprisingly it works a treat. Highly recommended for anyone looking for some light hearted fantasy entertainment.",Big Trouble in Little China
22,utgard14,"""It's all in the reflexes.""",10,22 June 2015,"John Carpenter's tongue-in-cheek classic about swaggering truck driver Jack Burton, brilliantly played by Kurt Russell. You may not have heard of Jack Burton but we are in his debt. He, along with friend Wang and a few other brave souls, faced off against the evil sorcerer Lo Pan in order to rescue two beautiful women with green eyes. What a wonderful movie this is. It's just sheer fun from start to finish. It may be my Carpenter fanboyism showing but this movie just gets better and better with age. There are so many quotable funny lines and the cast is amazing. In addition to Kurt Russell who, as I said before is just brilliant in this, we have Dennis Dun kicking ass as Wang. As is often talked about in discussions of this movie, Carpenter subverts expectations by having Dun as the martial artist hero and Russell as the comedic sidekick. Kim Cattrall is very funny as Gracie Law and, of course, gorgeous (despite those unconvincing contact lenses). But the scene stealers of the movie are Victor Wong as Egg Shen and James Hong as Lo Pan. Both men are hilarious in all their scenes. Such a great movie. About as fun as a movie can get, really. It's impossible to watch this and not smile unless there's something switched off inside of you.",Big Trouble in Little China
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""It's all in the reflexes""",7,1 May 2009,"You can't actually go wrong when you've got John working with Kurt, Victor and myths. The plot is great, develops swiftly, and the pacing is fast and non-stop without this ever being overwhelming. It doesn't overstay its welcome, either. Russell delivers one-liners, and a spot-on performance, heck, everyone who needs to, acts well in this. They also found the coolest, meanest looking Asians who could fight and put 'em in this. The martial arts are seriously kick-ass. The supernatural aspects are a perfect mix of silly and incredible, with fantastic and interesting material, done in a tone that is relatively respectful but also poking fun, so regardless of how you feel about spiritual type stuff, if you like adventure flicks(and, honestly, in almost all cases, I don't, and I enjoyed myself immensely), you will probably love this. This has highly imaginative, and quite weird, creatures and occurrences. The humor is excellent, much of it coming from the well-written dialog, the music is well-composed and fitting, and this is a smoothly blended mix of fun-filled action, horror and mystical events in a film that you can barely take your eyes off, all of this adding up to a real tour de force by Carpenter. Whoever says movies can't be creative and hold surprises... you're watching the wrong ones. There is language in this, reasonably infrequent and mostly mild, no sex and the violence is PG, whilst rather exciting and engaging. I recommend this to any fan of the director, actors and/or anyone else who helped make this happen. 7/10",Big Trouble in Little China
24,view_and_review,A great movie so seldom spoken about,9,27 January 2007,"I watched ""Big Trouble in Little China"" too many times to count. BTILC is one of the best filmatic mixes of action and comedy. This was definitely the funniest role I've ever seen Kurt Russell play, even better than his role in ""Overboard"". I think the movie was a great mix of just about everything. There was comedy, adventure, kung-fu, love, mysticism, and a great story to boot. Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) was just a plain ole, run of the mill trucker who gets thrust right in the middle of a rescue mission. The mission: rescue two green eyed women from a 1000 year old Chinese mystic who is about to sacrifice them to prolong his life. Not only do Jack and his pal Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) have to deal with a Chinese gang, they also have to deal with henchmen with supernatural abilities. And how could you not like the three mystical henchmen? If anyone has ever seen or played Mortal Kombat, you know where the idea of Rayden came from.",Big Trouble in Little China
25,morrison-dylan-fan,My first Carpenter/Russell film.,10,21 April 2013,"Despite a family friend having mentioned for a number of years that his all time fav movie is the Kurt Russell-starring,John Carpenter directed film The Thing,I have somehow never got round to take a look at any of the titles that they made during their partnership.Taking a look at a poll being held on the IMDb Classic Film board for the best films of 1986,I noticed that a fellow IMDb'er listed a film of Capenter and Russell's as one of the main movies that they would like to take a look at,from that year,which led to me deciding,that I would pay a visit to Chinatown,so that I could at last have my long over due introduction to this wonderful team.The plot:Dropping off his latest delivery in Chinatown,truck driver Jack Burton decides to pay a visit to an old friend called Wang Chi.Remembering the gambling matches that they used to have,Chi and Burton soon get back into the swing of things.Suspecting that Jack may had lost his touch,Wang offers Burton an all or nothing bet for over a $1000 that he can cut a glass bottle in two with a sword.Accepting the offer,Jack forces Chi to change the bottle that he is planning to use,which leads to Jack winning the bet,thanks to him having foiled Wang's game.Realising that he has bet more money than he actually has,Chi suddenly remembers that he has to pick up his soon to be wife from the airport.Hoping that his friend will give up on wanting the money,Burton shows Wang that he is determined to keep an eye on Chi until Jack at last has his winnings in hand,which leads to Jack personally taking Wang to the airport.Arriving at the airport hoping to see his soon to be wife ( Miao Yin) for the first time in years,Chi and Burton are instead met by a gang called The Lords of Death,who grab Miao and kidnap her.Chasing after The Lord's of Death in Jack's truck,Chi and Burton stay close to the gang,until they discover that they have unwittingly placed themselves in the centre of a gang war that the Death's are a part of.Pushing down the pedal so that they can get out of this tough situation,Jack jumps out of the truck,after he has run over a man called Lo Pan,who refused to move out of the way.Expecting to see a horribly mangled body,Burton is instead met by the chilling image of Lo Pan being completely uninjured,which leads to Pan revealing that he may not be all that he initially appears,when a green light suddenly comes bursting out of his eyes towards Burton.View on the film:Before getting to the film,I first have to give a special mention to the tremendous 2 disc DVD that Fox have done for the movie,with the second disc featuring almost 50 minutes of extended/deleted scenes,that whilst not having a huge impact on the plot,do help to make each of the characters feel a bit extra rounded.For one of the first Hollywood movies to have a strong,mythical martial arts element,the screenplay by Gary Goldman,David Z.Weinstein and W.D. Richter cleverly shows a surprisingly subtle change of narrative focus from the first 30 minutes,with the wise-cracking,one liner dropping Jack Burton initially appearing to be the gun-ho hero who has all of the answer's,only for it to be in fact revealed that Burton is taking second place, due to the mysticism route,and the location of Miao Yin being one that only Wang Chi can find.Whilst the writers do show a respectable attitude to the mythasisum in the movie,they smartly use Burton's truck as a way to run over any pompernuss that might appear,thanks to the screenplay dripping with whip-cracking dialogue and a rescuing the princess(es) scenario that allow wonderful characters from a snarling,flifty monster,to a 2000 year old half ghost/half man each being allowed to make their own big splash.Making a near unrecognisable cameo at on the opening credits by singing the bluesy title track,and being continuously backed by atmospheric synthesiser-based score,director John Carpenter showers the movie in dazzling colours,with smoke,volcanic ash and laser eyes allowing Carpenter to turn this corner of Chinatown into a tremendous light show.Along with his stylish colours,Carpenter also gives the movie a wonderfully animated feeling,that along with giving the film a pounding Action-packed mood, also allows Carpenter to slyly dip back into some Horror waters.Teaming up with Carpenter for the 4th time,Kurt Russell gives a brilliantly sharp and witty performance,with Russell delivering each of the one liners with a real with a real relish,and also showing a surprising amount of uncertainty,as Burton starts to become desperate to pull himself out of the situation that he has unwittingly put himself in,in anyway possible.Placed at the centre of the film,Dennis Dun shows that he is impressively more than able to hold his own,thanks to Dun showing Chi to be someone,who whilst having a big heart for his wife,also knows when to push his romantic feelings aside,and use his intelligence's and martial arts skills to hit each of The Lord's of The Black Death gang at their weakest spot,which leads to this being a little China that viewers will want to visit again and again.",Big Trouble in Little China

Unfortunately for the both of them, Wang's girlfriend is kidnapped, as she is a Chinese woman with green eyes, and in order for immortal LoPan to turn back into a mortal human, he must marry her. Now it's up to Jack, Wang, and their friends to save her before it's too late....Carpenter once again throws in the horror towel for this, Indiana Jones light movie, but there is still the old Carpenter trademarks going on. Firstly there's Russell, who looks like he's having a ball playing Burton.And seeing as it's an adventure movie, it's very dark, with some pretty unsettling effects with LoPan in his aged form.But despite the great effects, and good performances, it takes a few viewings to understand every aspect of the decidedly dumb plot, and sporadic narratives.Carpenter has put too many ingredients into the mix, a homage to Bruce Lee movies, Sci-Fi, a little horror, Homage to Indiana Jones, a lot is going on, and it gets a little confusing.So all in all, it's not a bad film, well worthy of it's cult status, just a little confusing, and would make a great double bill with The Golden Child.Plus it's the best film ever made about a man who explodes into a pile of salad...",Big Trouble in Little China
27,Aaron1375,A movie where the hero isn't the best fighter.,9,27 January 2004,"This is a very good and funny action movie.  My main complaints around this one revolve around the beginning and the end.  I do not think the opening scene was necessary and it took away any surprise you might have received. Wong basically shows you that the movie is more than just another kung fu movie as he demonstrates magic.  I think it would have been more effective to wait till the three storm guys showed up.  I did not care for the ending. Kurt has a great last line, but then they have one more scene in his truck that is more like the ending of one of those bad horror movies.  Other than that though this one is a really fast paced action movie.  I love Kurt as the average guy sucked in a world of really high flying karate and magic. This movie has a lot of comedy as well.  Kurt loses his truck, his friend loses his fiancé so they have to work together to get both back, plus the friend owes Kurt a substantial sum of money.  They have to go through the lair of this really strange old man whose body guards include these guys known as the three storms.  They are Rain, Lightening, and Thunder.  Their opening scene is quite impressive as they appear to be pretty much invincible.  All in all this movie is one heck of a wild ride.",Big Trouble in Little China

29,SimonJack,"Disjointed, weak farcical plot leaves this martial arts actioner mostly flat",5,14 September 2019,"One hopes that Kurt Russell was having fun in the making this film, because his Jack Burton character comes across as farcical. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a far-fetched story about dark magic and sorcery in an underground of China Town. The setting for the film is San Francisco's famous China Town. But most of the filming of that locale is clearly done on sound stages. The only real scenery of the Bay area is in the opening with Burton driving his 18-wheeler across the Golden Gate Bridge.The film is supposed to be an action, magic and comedy plot. It comes across mostly as a hokey disjointed product with lots of visual effects and martial arts, but very little substance for a plot.The screenplay is as disjointed as the plot. The film is loaded with special effects for the various magic and witchcraft scenes. The fantasy aspects lean more toward voodoo or satanic powers than magic. Russell's character almost seems out of place with the cast of Asian actors.Besides the fantasy scenarios, the film is loaded with fighting, chases, and other action scenes. The script is lame for most of the dialog - so that many of the characters sound forced or unrehearsed. The whole film could have been made without Russell's character. And that's what gives one the impression is was intended more as a comedy and farce than as a magic or fantasy and action flick. Or, his addition was thought to be the golden carrot to sell the film.But, the movie audience of 1986 weren't buying this one. It was a box office flop and barely covered half its budget in the U.S. A better effort to make this a clear cut farce of all the martial arts films might have done more to put this film over. As it is, there's not much to recommend.",Big Trouble in Little China
30,Mr-Fusion,Genre-mashing bliss,9,27 July 2014,"As much as this movie gets right, the real magic of ""Big Trouble in Little China"" lies in the star's performance. Jack Burton's straight out of an arcade game, overconfident and utterly useless in a fight, and Kurt Russell knows how to deliver his dialogue for maximum comedic effect. More than that, he takes this brash jackass character and makes him his own. He's always put out, never has a clue what's going on, but is still there at every turn to say something stupid. Watch his facial expressions; half the fun is watching Russell react to all this ancient nonsense. The look on his face during the final fight with Lo Pan (when he misses with the knife) is priceless. It's my favorite Russell performance (on a laundry list of many fine ones). And good luck finding someone else who does a better job rocking the mullet. And the Tec-9, for that matter. Chock full of gunfights, high-flying kicks and fists of fury, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is the kind of crowd-pleaser that doesn't come along often; a journey into a murky underworld of Chinese mysticism, monsters and gun-toting gangsters. The pacing is relentless and the script plays like an assembly line of one-liners. It's just an insanely quotable good time.9/10",Big Trouble in Little China
31,namashi_1,Amusing...,7,28 June 2011,"John Carpenter's 'Big Trouble In Little China' is one of the most amusing movies I have seen to date. This 1980's cult classic, is weird, lively, entertaining & amusing.Kurt Russell stars as Truck Driver, Jack Burton, who helps his friend Wang Chi, played by Dennis Dun, rescue his green-eyed fiancée from bandits in San Francisco's Chinatown. What follows later on, is a series of unexpected moments, that are executed with humor! 'Big Trouble In Little China' is not at all meant for the pseudo critics. It's for those, who enjoy cinema, even when it insults your intelligence. It's for those, who don't mind watching a villain who's 2000 years old, to begin with! This cult classic packs in several interesting moments, especially in the first hour, which is quite funny. The Second Hour goes wilder, and the culmination is well-shot. Carpenter's direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design are note-worthy. Special Effects & Make-Up are good.Performance-Wise: Russell is absolutely superb as the main hero, who hardly does anything heroic. He gets his comic timing right and entertains from start to end. Dennis Dun is lovable. Kim Catrall & James Hong are first-rate. Others lend able support.On the whole, If your willing to forgive it's escapism, then I would say do check it out.

And since it was directed by John Carpenter(""Halloween"")it had it's touch of horror in the form of magic and supernatural spells involving ghost and goblins and the fury Bigfoot creature was neat! Kurt Russell stars as Jack Burton a direct and outspoken cross country truck driver who's life takes another exit route when he intersects with people and a situation when his Chinese friend's love interest is kidnapped. Soon this journey and adventure takes a speed trip for Jack to the underground area and back alley streets of San Francisco, California's Chinatown. And in this strange world it's not normal as a cast of characters of karate fighters are blended with creatures and monsters all ruled by ""Lo Pan"" a 2000 old magician who rules the empire of souls and spirits. The action is fast and tough it's feel good fun watching Jack battle the dark domain all in the end with the grand prize being to rescue the girl. Kim Cattrall(""Sex and the City's"" Sammatha)also stars as a partner to help fight the battle she along with the kidnapped Chinese girl both have scenes of being damsels in distress in which they are tied up and gagged!

33,lasttimeisaw,Carpenter's family treat,5,14 May 2013,"A Hollywood pastiche of Hong Kong kung-fu sensation in the 1980s, which seems to be out of topicality now, directed by John Carpenter (seriously, who could predict my first entry of Carpenter's canon comes overdue thus far). But as a Chinese, soused in the over-familiar genre throughout my childhood, this Chinatown kung-fu ragbag is no place near a deferential triumph (a B movie cult status maybe) even under the pristine BluRay calibre, a fair blurb is that it is pretty fun to watch for a first-timer only. Carpenter's regular Kurt Russell is the sinewy truck-driver, a gormless Good Samaritan, being embroiled into an eye-opening underworld teeming with Chinese necromancy, hideous critters and supernormal kung-fu masters (btw, no Chinese knows anything about Lo Pan and Ding Dai, completely a concoction without any reference or so ever), and what he gets? A machine gun whose only use is to eliminate two-bits minions and a crush on the blonde lawyer (Cattrall in her prime year). The western-oriental clash doesn't work out successfully (white man has the blonde and his Chinese sidekick has his own oriental beauty, that kind of drivel etc.) one could replace its Chinese elements with any gangster clan with a grisly ghost's resurrection into flesh (why trouble being a mortal if you are an immortal?) through marrying girls with green eyes (or contact lens). The modus operandi of manufacturing an ancient Chinese looking is a big plus, all tawdry but resplendent, and destines to be destroyed by our hero and his troupe, also the makeup technique is cutting-edge (James Hong's double identities both require a makeover shift).While the storyline is evasive about any query details, we never get a hold of what is the undead's probable explanation of his existence except that he is an oriental mythology, so don't ask, just watch the little mysterious thing called ""magic"". The cast is basically a throwaway to make the story workable, James Hong's Lo Pan and his three guardians are deadpan comical and undeservedly expendable, by a preening introduction near the beginning, their payoff is too hasty to respect or digest for the sake of the potboiler heroism, such a top-heavy fecklessness. BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA certainly disqualifies itself as a Carpenter's must-see, and its family-friendly appeal also curtains Carpenter's novelty and creativity (save the surviving beast in the coda), the adventure is far from satisfactory and the mocking action sequences justly jibe with its own time, the horrible 1980s.",Big Trouble in Little China

The dialogue maybe laughable at times, but it's still intriguing and entertaining sometimes to listen to. The movie has a fast pacing, but it just seemed to be all over the place at times. Even the kung-fu fight sequences is uber cheesy and lame, but still sort of entertaining to watch. Now I can see how this movie became a cult classic, despite everything being ridiculous it's still a enjoyable movie. You can tell the cast had a lot of fun making this movie and it's fun to watch this movie and the cast doing goofy and lame stuff as well. There is a lot of supernatural elements in this movie such as magic, but fit right into the premise of the movie and even how ridiculous everything is in this.

I probably would've loved it and watched it on repeat. As it is, this is my first viewing and I still really cared for it. Not to see it half a dozen times, but maybe again sometime down the road.Not really sure which genre this was supposed to land onhorror, comedy, action, adventure, suspense, mystery, fantasyhell all of the above. But, above those it was someone watching Indiana Jones on acid and while super high, writing the script. No real complaints, it kinda stood on its own and had a bunch of cute Asian dudes.Gambler, Trucker and Antihero Jack must get his truck back, save the girl(s) and a check for $1148 (x2 or 3.) Unlike Dr. Jones, he's accompanied by many characters against a lonely old ghost/spirit/immortal and his evil army bent onmarriage. Actually, there's a lot going on here, with a ton of humor that did make me laugh out loud and many interesting ideas and characters. So many, again, this reminded me of some comedy/adventure serial that probably wouldn't have lasted more than one season and yet would be worth every episode.Not deep, lotta fun, totally 80s and certainly recommended.***Final thoughts: I do enjoy Director Carpenter's work, and I understand the era most of his films came out of, or at least, the most famous onesbut damn, that score.

Good vs. evil. Chinese mythology. Kung-fu. An American protagonist. There's quite a mixture within this concept. Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein's knee-jerk script feeds up many amusing and colourful situations from the pulpy hybrid material. This could be contributed largely to Kurt Russell's glowing, larger-than-life comic turn as a John Wayne-like truckie Jack Burton. Confident, but clumsily confused makes his character unquestionably likable. Everything that came out of his mouth (the wisecracks to the advice) was quotable and charismatically delivered. There's almost a mock seriousness to all of this absurdity. The gorgeously stormy Kim Cattrall takes the honours as Chinatown lawyer Gracie Law. The rest of the performances are over-dramatic (with the likes of James Hong, Dennis Dung and Victor Wong), but fit right in with the fun, boisterous realm created by Carpenter. Imagination fills the brightly lit set-designs (did someone steal Skull Mountain from ""He-Man"") and Richard Edlund's striking visual effects. They might look campy, but they're vividly illustrated and add to the mystical atmosphere. Carpenter's busy direction is built around the dazzling flair, up-beat pace and staged set-pieces of stylish and gung-ho stunts (with martial arts getting a good work out). He also takes time out to orchestrate the thumping synthesiser score. Let's not forget about that theme song he wrote and performed with his band 'The Coupe De Villas'. It's a 80s doozey! My only real gripe was that of the easy demise of the main villains.A terrifically entertaining, charming and adventurous cartoonish romp. You can't do wrong with the pairing of Carpenter and Russell (yes, even ""Escape From LA (1996)"").",Big Trouble in Little China
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A charmingly bizarre little gem that balances its action and comedy impeccably.,7,16 March 2018,"'Big Trouble In Little China (1986)', a charmingly bizarre little gem of a film, pits an all-American 'everyman' truck-driver against an ancient mystical warlord and is wickedly entertaining throughout, a wonderfully weird walk on the right side of silly that manages to balance its action and comedy impeccably to the point where its few flaws are almost too easy to overlook. Tying it all together is Kurt Russell, who's wide-eyed wonder and honest reactions not only highlight the absurdity but also sell the believability of the flick's fantastically imaginative fantasy elements, and it's the down-to-earth attitude that the whole out-of-this-world piece adopts that allows it to sort of transcend its B-movie status and become an extremely entertaining picture that never takes itself seriously and doesn't ask its audience to either. It's just incredibly fun. 7/10",Big Trouble in Little China
39,bowmanblue,Almost too much fun to handle,9,28 May 2014,"'Big Trouble in Little China' was not a box office success. So says both its star (Kurt Russell) and its director (horror legend John Carpenter). They blame its poor performance in cinemas on the fact that the studio behind it (20th Century Fox) 'didn't know how to market it.' And, to be fair, they may have a point.If you look at the promotional posters advertising the film, they read (something like), 'A mystical, action, adventure, kung-fu, comedy horror film.' That, by its own admission, is 'splitting genres' to the extreme. Therefore, it was kind of hard to know who to market the film at.My opinion: guys (mainly!) and generally anyone who likes a good old fashioned adventure movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's one of those typical adventure movies that the eighties churned out. I would almost be tempted to say that it was a 'family' movie for all to enjoy. However, there is one use of the 'f-word' so I guess you have to be a bit careful showing it to the little ones! I always put Big Trouble in Little China in roughly the same bracket as Indiana Jones (although the Indy die-hard fans will probably hate me for comparing the two so favourably!).Big Trouble is pretty cheesy. If you like your adventure dark and straight-laced then you may not appreciate the humour and general tongue in cheek moments. Plus it does like to break the odd cinema convention here and there. It's 'hero' (Kurt Russell), despite being obviously the leading man, is often little more than a sidekick when compared to those around him – who the film-makers take delight in pointing out at every turn! There are too many hilariously-cool moments to list, but my favourite is always going to be monster who's made up solely of eyes (he gets what's coming to him), but a close second would be a man getting so emotional and upset that he explodes.If those sorts of things sound appealing to you, then you will definitely enjoy Big Trouble in Little China and see that it's a forgotten gem of a B-movie that can be watched and re-watched and enjoyed every time.",Big Trouble in Little China
40,gbill-74877,A gleeful mess,6,5 September 2020,"From the very beginning John Carpenter delightfully plunges us into this cheesy, over-the-top mess of a film, which is a fun and bizarre mix of action, comedy, martial arts, and the supernatural. It doesn't take itself seriously at all but beware that it treads along a line of so many old stereotypes, and may go over it depending on your point of view. There's a kidnapping into a sex trafficking ring, a subterranean lair, gangs battling in the streets of Chinatown, and a sinister crime boss (the great James Hong) who seems like a paranormal version of Fu Manchu. All of those seem straight out of the 1930's, and I was wondering if I was going to be seeing an opium den at some point. Kurt Russell seems to channel John Wayne in his dialogue, but happily his role isn't entirely confined to being a white savior - though it's close, he does bumble around at times, and there are some pretty tough Asian dudes in the martial arts sequences. To the film's credit, they also speak perfect English, in fact making fun of Russell's character when he asks if any of them ""savvy"" the language. Between the bonkers, kitchen-sink of a story and all the elements that seemed a little retrograde, though, I couldn't truly love it, despite its amusing moments. In thinking about it, my review score might have been about the same even without the stereotypes, so if you like silly 80's era mashups, you might like this.",Big Trouble in Little China

I feel so bad for not liking it more! Did you know James Hong (who plays Lo Pan) is one of the most prolific actors ever appearing in literally hundreds of movies?The main character, played by Kurt Russell is an odd character as he really has a lot of both good and bad traits. He can be annoying with his constant whining, but he really does come across as a representation of the audience with how he's confused by everything. I don't fully understand the story myself. It's basically some guys rescue women from a villain. Yeah, not that unique but the way the film is actually told is really interesting.

I honestly didn't think she was gonna be ever in an action film like this but boy I thought wrong!The storyline was very boring at the beginning but then when the martial artist's of bad guys came on the scene, I was really hooked and looking forward to what happens next. You know the big boss in this kinda remind's me of Dracula in a Chinese version. Although the real Dracula wouldn't look for green eyes in a wife but pretty much blood basically!I don't know why they are making a remake of this because really, Hollywood would get a bad review of copying this but with the rock.

43,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Good, but could have been a lot better",6,4 June 2001,"BTILC went through many incarnations before it became the movie we are familiar with today. A sequel to Buckaroo Banzai, a Western with Chinese magic, re-written (against the original writers' wishes) as a modern movie, tampered with before, during, and after production. It certainly wasn't an easy project for John Carpenter. Fox had no clue how to promote the film and just dumped it into theatres for the audiences to make up their own minds. Unfortunately it didn't find much of an audience until it hit VHS (in horrid pan-and-scan format).It's a great film for kids, filled with action, humor and remarkably slick special effects. Upon watching it as an adult you'll probably be less entertained. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, a bumbling, overly-confident ""hero"" who is all hot air and swagger. He's unwillingly recruited by his Chinese friends to venture into the catacombs beneath San Francisco to rescue a girl who is about to be sacrificed to a demon in return for granting flesh and life to a 2000-year-old Chinese emperor. Wow! That's pretty out there. And the fact that the plot is so self-aware of its wackiness prevents it from getting boring. We're constantly bombarded with weirdness and surreal moments. David Lynch once said that audiences would rather be confused than bored. BTILC proves him correct.The action is a let down. There are a few bland, bloodless, badly choreographed rumbles but Carpenter's slick anamorphic Panavision photography makes the rest of the film look so good it nearly makes up for it. His score has its great moments, but is too dated. Really, this is Russell's film. As Jack Burton he's just hilarious and thankfully he's on screen for nearly the entire running time.As a cult film it surely delivers. As a studio production it's a bit of an unrefined mess. Though this is no doubt due to Fox slashing Carpenter's production schedule, causing him to quit studio films for good.",Big Trouble in Little China
44,The-Sarkologist,The closest that Hollywood has ever come to a Hong Kong action flick,9,22 October 2011,"Microsoft Cinemania '97 doesn't really make much out of this movie. My reply to that is that Microsoft doesn't know what that are talking about. In my opinion Big Trouble in Little China goes down as one of the all time classic movies.So what is it that makes this movie so great? Well, it is nothing more than a pulp action film with the redneck Jack Burton (Kurt Russel) stumbling in on a plot were Asian girls are kidnapped and thrown into brothels. What sets it apart from other movies, in my opinion, is that its use of magic, action, and that fact that Jack Burton is an outsider who really only wants his truck back (and the money that he is owed). This movie pits the average tough guy hero up against supernatural forces, and really this hero just bumbles his way through the entire movie; there is nothing about Jack Burton that makes him anything special. He is a simple truck driver who thinks he is tough but deep down he is not.Big Trouble in Little China has special effects and lots of action, but it is also laced with humour in the character of Jack Burton. He is the centre of the movie, but really the problems could have been solved with out him. Yet when one looks at the character of Jack Burton, one notices that he has something that the others do not have, and that is guts. The guy is willing to stick his neck out to take on forces that are much more powerful than he. His stubborn streak is a part of this for he refuses to believe that there is any of this supernatural stuff going on around him. Even though he cannot fight in anyway in this movie, it is his guts and his determination that provide the leadership needed.I personally don't care what anybody says. Big Trouble in Little China is a classic movie and a classic movie it will always be to me and it is probably the closet that Hollywood will ever get to making an authentic Hong Kong style action movie.",Big Trouble in Little China
45,Movie Nuttball,One of best fighting movies of all time!!!!,10,24 July 2001,"This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time.Big Trouble in Little China is a true classic and there is very few films like it. The movie is perfect in My opinion. I have always loved it. In fact, I loved it the very first time I saw it many, many years ago. John Carpenter is a genius and when he came up with this one he came up with one of the best stories and made it into movie that is so great words really can't describe how fantastic it is! What made it so wonderful is a number things! A few of the things are God, the one of a kind nature of the excellent decade of the 80s, and a great film maker! There are so many things I adore in the movie. The acting by the cast and how they make the characters they play seem so real! Kurt Russell is just fantastic in this film. Dennis Dunn also has a great performance. Kim Cattrall is also very good. Victor Wong and James Hong are just fabulous here. Carter Wong, Peter Kwong, and James Pax have very memorable roles as well. Another thing that makes this film so good is the arguably better than today special effects and Carpenter's music! The effects were so brilliant, flawless, and very realistic! In My opinion it will always look great and never seem dated out! The score is extraordinary! The score sounds epic and the music is used perfectly in the scenes! Its one of the greatest musical scores ever in My opinion! The costumes the characters wear are so cool looking and it made them have more personality! The action is superb and is really in the tradition of a Bruce Lee movie with added material if you will! I am amazed by how incredible it is. I feel this is John Carpenter's greatest film and is one of the greatest films of all time! It has so much that you could have in a movie. I strongly recommend this film for everyone!",Big Trouble in Little China
46,poe426,GHOSTBUSTERS meets A CHINESE GHOST STORY...,10,20 January 2002,"With Bruce Lee in the forefront, kung fu movies hit U.S. screens in the early '70's and moviegoing was never the same. (Three decades later, we have Jackie Chan and Jet Li and CROUCHING TIGER,HIDDEN DRAGON, to name but a few.) One of my favorites was a supernatural tale, THE CHINESE PROFESSIONALS (aka, THE ONE-ARMED BOXER, starring Wang Yu). Hunted for it on video for years (and still haven't found it). The ""craze"" eventually died down, and, for a time, there were no more kung fu movies to be found on the Big Screen. When BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA came along- out of the blue, with very little fanfare- I was shocked to discover that my all-time favorite American filmmaker, Joltin' John Carpenter, had done a kung fu movie. He has since mentioned the ""baby cart"" films as an influence during the making of BIG TROUBLE. Whatever the impetus, Carpenter's version of a Chinese ghost story, with its in-your-face fight scenes and lots of genuinely funny moments, is an all-around entertainment that deserved a much bigger audience during its initial release than it found. It's good to know I'm not the only fan.",Big Trouble in Little China
47,TheMovieDiorama,Big Trouble in Little China encapsulates B-Movie genre action albeit with laughable results.,6,28 May 2018,"Given the title, and having already witness a scene with an asian man exploding, I knew I was expecting 80s absurdity. It's all well and good, but it does come at a price amounting to more than the cost of a number 67 from my local Chinese takeaway (egg fried rice between you and me). Truck driver Jack gets caught in an ancient battle where two girls are captured because they have green eyes. Yes, that's the best I can do. There's sorcery, cheesy one liners and Raiden from 'Mortal Kombat'. A ""Chinese Showdown"" consisting on atleast fifty extras flipping on wires in every direction, as director Carpenter bathes in the mayhem for a decent five minutes. Considering he is best known for crafting some of the best horror films ever, his authentic prosthetic trademark is put to good use here. A floating flesh ball comprising of eyeballs, a hairy yeti resembling a drugged up Chewbacca and, as mentioned before, a man enlarging himself to the point of explosion. It's madness, sheer lunacy. Yet, it knows what it is. You can't class it as ""so bad it's good"" because it isn't serious, and that only adds to the charm. Acting was serviceable, Russell revelling in his action glory days whilst Cattrall adds some sass with her character. The screenplay, unfortunately, is lacklustre. Having slept on this film (not literally...or maybe), I can't remember any of the one liners except Jack frequently shouting ""Wang!"" ""Wang!?"" ""Waaaaaaang!!!!"" whilst the script negates all racial context. The story seems like it has plenty of lore, yet hardly any of the fantasy elements are explored. Simply just used for environmental set pieces. It substituted an engaging story for B-movie action. Also, some of those effects have not aged well at all...but that's a given, I don't think you need me to reiterate that for you. Did I enjoy this? Yes, unquestionably. Do I think it's good? Now that's where I question myself. Perhaps it's just not to my taste, B-Movies have never enticed me.",Big Trouble in Little China

52,Vartiainen,Nothing quite like it,7,15 January 2017,"One of John Carpenter's most famous movies and definitely a cult classic in its own right. It tells about a trucker named Jack Burton (Kurt Russell), who rather unwillingly gets pulled into an ancient conflict that has resurfaced in San Francisco's Chinatown. A sorcerer named Lo Pan (James Hong) leads a gang there and has his eyes set on marrying a green-eyed woman in order to break an ancient curse cast upon him by the first emperor of China. And it just so happens that Jack's friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) has a fiancée with green eyes.It's epically silly, but in the best way possible. Carpenter's films tend to be rather grim in tone, but this easily on the lighter end of his scale. It can still be described as dark fantasy, but it's far from horror. That being said, some of the special effects are rather gruesome, but also so well done that you cannot help but admire them, even in this modern day and era.I also really like Jack Burton's character. He is what would happen if you put a comic relief in the lead role and failed to mention to him that he's in fact the comic relief. Jack is easily the least capable person in the entire posse and many of his fight scenes end with him failing around in clueless fashion. Yet he is the main character, having a lot of charisma and some singular moments of true badassery. Russell beautifully straddles these two distinct traits, moving from one style of character to another.Is it Carpenter's best work? Nah, that still belongs to The Thing. But it is an excellent 80s urban fantasy film and very much worth a watch for all fans of the genre.",Big Trouble in Little China

Jack and Wang learn she's taken by evil sorcerer, David Lo-Pan (Hong) because her green eyes will help break him free of his curse and rule the world. Jack and Wang meet lawyer, Gracie Law (Cattrall) who also gets captured by Lo-Pan because of her green eyes. With the help of sorcerer, Egg Shen (Wong), Jack and Wang attempt to fight against Lo-Pan and rescue both women. This is my favorite Carpenter/Russell film, Russell is terrific as Jack, Hong is great as Lo-Pan, there's cool effects and Carpenter & Alan Howarth's score is excellent as usual. This was originally conceived as a western and Russell does a great John Wayne impression. I highly recommend this 80's cult classic.",Big Trouble in Little China
54,FiendishDramaturgy,Entertaining fantasy fluff,7,30 January 2005,"Big Trouble in Little China is touted as one of Carpenter's many masterpieces. In fact, it's even touted by some Carpenter fans as his best movie. I have to disagree on both counts. While it is far from a ""masterpiece,"" it is an enjoyable endeavor. But John Carpenter has done far superior work. The budget does not make the movie. (Look at ""Gigli."") Big-named stars do not make the movie. (Look at ""Gigli."") Personally, I thought ""In the Mouth of Madness"" was a much superior attempt.When a big name moves out of their usual genre into that of Fantasy, there is almost always evidence of a large-scale rally of support for this move. Stephen King strayed from his horror genre into Fantasy by way of ""Eyes of the Dragon."" That was so well received by his horror-fan audience that he did more than stray; he dove head first into the ""Dark Tower"" series. That series has been phenomenally successful. Dean Koontz strayed from his usual political-thriller formula and wrote ""Dragon's Tears."" It did not fare as well as King's walkabout, but his fan base is not quite as large. Peter Jackson side-stepped the horror genre for a horror/fantasy when he did ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy which was also phenomenally successful. Wes Craven's ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" was his attempt at a horror/fantasy/comedy which was moderately well received. I'll stop here, as I'm sure you get the general idea. Now, don't get me wrong. I believe a fan should support the work of the object of their devotion, but never blindly. A ""star"" (be they in front of the camera, behind the camera, or behind the scenes) deserves any level of devotion only if they are worthy. Only if their work is worthy. I am a Lucas fan. I've enjoyed all his movies. Yep. That's right. Every one, including the SW prequels. But I do not support his Star Wars OT money machine. I refuse to support him any further until he listens to the millions of fans who made him who he is today and gives us the OT in its original form. He has forgotten his fans; turned a deaf ear to us, and for that, he is usurped as the Fantasy King. Jackson sits on that throne today.Carpenter should have stayed more within the boundaries of horror and action with this attempt, and dropped the comedic aspect all together. It is not his forté, and it shows. I found the levity to be distracting from the work, and rather out of place in this dark fantasy. He walked up to the bell, but would not ring it. To me, that shows a lack of courage and faith in his work. Had this been darker, had he put more of himself and less Hollywood in this work, it would have been a thousand times better.The martial arts elements are obviously choreographed, but most movie martial arts are. This, however, was executed poorly, as you could virtually see the ""dance feet"" chalked on the floor. Step, two, three, Kick, two three. The villains telegraph from so far away, you would have had advance notice of their attacks days in advance. The characters are cardboard cut outs of the worst stereotypes of the 1980's. Jack Burton is a macho tough guy with little or no brains, just brawn, and not much of that, either. Gracie Law is your typical ditsy blonde with too much mouth and very little brains to get in the way. The bad guys are in a gang, the heroine is dumpy and startlingly non-sexual, and you have the ""cute"" sidekick element. You also have a decent (but anti-climactic) clash of good wizard vs. cursed/evil wizard and their respective armies (which amount to a dozen or so men). There are some monsters, but in this critic's opinion, they were hokey and unintentionally factored into the comedic aspects of this movie. I was not afraid.Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China is a shallow look into the virtual bottomless ocean that is Chinese theology, mythology, legend, and religious belief systems. It contains the elements of horror (however minuscule), comedy, mysticism, and fantasy. It is not a thinking person's work, nor is it of ""masterpiece"" quality and/or content. It is entertaining, well enacted, nicely executed, and enjoyable. But it is a popcorn movie, and nothing more. It is not epically filmed. You will not be frightened, touched, or inspired. You will chuckle, but not laugh outright. You will neither be enlightened nor educated in the ways of these ancient people. You will merely be entertained. For most movie goers, that element alone, is enough. If that is enough for you, then this movie will not let you down as long as you don't have expectations which exceed the real limits of this work.For a much better fantasy, I recommend ""The Dark Crystal,"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""It rates a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Big Trouble in Little China
55,hellraiser7,Big Underground Adventure,10,11 November 2018,"This is another one of my favorite movies of all time and my fifth favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter. One of the things I always love about director John Carpenter is how versatile he truly is, each movie he makes is always something different within the genres I love (action, sci-fi, horror, fantasy), in this one he tackles fantasy.I love the fact that this film tackles Asian Fantasy and Mythology which I don't see much in the live action visual medium or at least done well. But this film is one of the best one's in my book that to me go with others I hold in high regard (in my book anyway) like ""A Chinese Ghost Story"", ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", and ""Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain"", and on a side note ""Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain"" was one of the inspirations for this film.I love the story it's kind of a simple save the world from ancient evil along with damsels in distress motif but it's really in its execution that stands out. I really like the idea of an underground fantasy world in the modern realm; almost like with Neil Gaiman's works.Being a fan of the fantasy genre as I was a fan of ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" this film blew me away because at the time I honestly was unfamiliar with Asian mythology and fantasy, seeing this was introducing me to a whole new realm I never knew existed in the fantasy genre.The production value and special effects are top notch, it really brings to life this fantasy world, from magic, spirituality aspect, creatures, the underground palace, people flying like superman, it's something you must see to believe. Music is great as usual with Carpenter it's the kind of music I can just listen to on my iPod and play on the record player. The theme song is one of my favorite themes and I really love that music in the final battle sequence.Love the use of high wire, it's a solid example of high wire when used the right way; not to say that's special as it's been used in most of the martial arts film in Hong Kong. But you must understand something back then in the 80's we had limited to no access to most foreign market films, so the concept of high wire Fu was uncommon to us. Let alone this film sort of predates ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" which had great use of the wire effects.The action is great from certain things before like seeing Denis Dun kicking butt and Jack Burton helping (kind of). But mainly it's the final battle sequence which is one of my favorite battles of all time, it kind of plays out like a live action Shonen anime as we are seeing magic powers being thrown, wizards Lo Pan and doing battle in what looks almost like a mystical live action version of the video game ""Soul Calibur"" (ok, not exactly but if you watch the battle you know what I'm talking about) people flying around utilizing Wu Shu Kung Fu and sword fighting against each other, it's just awesome.Characters are all colorful and fun, James Wong is great as ""Lo Pan"" whom is another one of my favorite fictional antagonists. He's the typical evil wizard, warlock archetype. But what I like about him is there is this colorfulness to him where he's can be evil and a bit creepy but he's kind of mischievous and funny. He's got some good memorable lines. I also really love his minions the three storms whom I'll admit are fun but at the same time intimidating opponents, their like Shonen Anime characters as they all have powers, my favorite is Lightening obviously an inspiration for the character Raiden from ""Mortal Kombat"".Victor Wong is also great as Egg Shen sort of the good wizard and mentor figure of the bunch, he has wisdom but also a dry sense of humor and quirkiness.Denis Dun is very solid as Wang Chi, it's too bad he didn't have more. But I really like his protagonist as he's tough but has some sharp sarcastic smart-ass charisma, but he can be a bit irresponsible as he not just trying to skipping out on paying off Jack in a bet they made. I also like it when at times he gets serious which shows he can be responsible sometimes when he needs to.But of course, the character that really drives this film is Jack Burton. This is my second favorite role from one of my favorite actors Kurt Russell. Jack Burton he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists, what's interesting about his character in the film is he's not really the main protagonist, by his nature he's more the side kick, but there's nothing wrong with that at least he's helping out and doing things. What's funny about him is despite looking like the typical tough guy action hero archetype, he's not very good let alone a total buffoon.Granted he does kick a little ass, but like I said a little ass as he's not very skilled he's a little cumbersome. Though what the guy does have is a tremdous amount of good luck or dumb luck depending on how you look at it. Like overdrawing his boot knife and inadvertently leaving himself out of a battle his best friend Wang was doing which was probably for the best for Jack's sake.But I just love his persona where he's cool but at the same time, he's kind of a dork, he tries to pass himself off as smooth and cool but doesn't really succeed. He has a lot of cool lines as well as funny ones, really like some of his radio monologues at the beginning the one where he says we live in a really big universe, I believe is true.I also like how he reacts throughout most of the film, it feels like how any regular person put under extraordinary circumstances would react, there are certain and crazy things that are happening around him in the film almost more than any episode of ""South Park"" and we're kind of in the same boat he's in thinking ""What the hell"". However what I like about him is his can do attitude, despite what little he understands about what's happening and this underground world he still wants to do what's right to help his best friend, as best he can with the minimal to zero skills he possess.And of course, I really like the back and forth between both characters, which make the film almost a bit of a buddy cop film as both characters are a little on the fence with each other where one is giving the other grief intentionally or unintentionally. But like any good buddies they really do like each other and are there for one another no matter what. Though also I feel both sort of represent two different schools of action, where Denis Dun represents the old and modern-day Martial Arts action that's common place now, Jack is the more conventional old school modern action we're familiar with, it's just great seeing how both these schools work together show how beautiful a combination they can be (or also imperfect in Jack's case).Sometimes the biggest adventures can happen in the smallest places.Rating: 4 stars",Big Trouble in Little China

Little On Pork Chop Express,5,21 October 2013,"Well, strictly from my point of view, this slightly creaky Comedy/Action/Romance movie (with some wacky martial arts sequences thrown in for good measure) certainly could've been a helluva lot better than it was.Over the years I've heard plenty of enthusiastic praise for ""Big Trouble"", but, after giving it an honest viewing, I can't say that it was worth anything more than just a 5-star rating.Perhaps I was in the wrong frame of mind when I first sat down to watch ""Big Trouble"", but, thinking back now, I really don't believe that that was not the real problem here.I personally think that ""Big Trouble's"" major (and minor) downfalls rest squarely on the bony shoulders of director John Carpenter (as well as the miscasting of Kurt Russell as the lippy, self-satisfied macho-man, Jack Burton, who was a monumental bore-and-a-half).I have never been in the least bit impressed with the likes of John Carpenter as a filmmaker of Horror flicks. I've found that his efforts in that genre to be on the mediocre side, at best (yes, even Halloween). - But, for him to dare to tackle a Comedy/Romance was a certified boo-boo that came mighty close to falling flat on its supremely unfunny face.About the only thing that kept ""Big Trouble's"" head above water were the sequences involving the amusing and often over-the-top battles of wild Kung Fu fighting. And, yes, even these scenes got a tad tiresome after seeing it done one too many times.At this point I don't think that I need to re-cap ""Big Trouble's"" story-line for you. Once you wade through its excessive muck it all comes down to being just a badly-contrived ""Boy-Meets-Girl"" story that features lots of fancy, bright lights and other such embellishments to hoodwink the viewer into thinking that this film is actually something more than it really is.Yes, we are all certainly entitled to our own opinions about ""Big Trouble"", but, to be told that I must excuse this film's glaring flaws and irksome inadequacies just because it was a product of the inexcusable 80s is just not satisfactory enough for me. No way, Jose!",Big Trouble in Little China
57,mjneu59,Jake Burton: the anti-Indiana Jones,6,7 November 2010,"Meet Jake Burton: truck driver, man of action, numbskull: a long-haul trucker trapped in an irrational off-road adventure when his precious big rig disappears in San Francisco's Chinatown, forcing him to challenge an evil spirit needing only the blood of a willing green-eyed virgin to be liberated from the shackles of earthly existence. Jake, needless to say, regards it all with skepticism, and moviegoers are advised to do likewise. The film obviously is a true guilty pleasure, presenting a wild, woolly, and often deliberately stupid send-up of Saturday afternoon matinée heroics (by way of the over-the-top antics of Hong Kong action cinema), mixing martial arts, monsters, and mayhem into what one character breathlessly calls ""a radical Alice in Wonderland"". Kurt Russell cheerfully mocks his own box office machismo as the dimwitted Jake Burton (a man whose lack of imagination renders him immune to danger), and the entire package was adapted by (among others) the talented W. D. Richter, although from what is anyone's guess. Please don't take any of it seriously.",Big Trouble in Little China
58,drqshadow-reviews,"John Carpenter, Kurt Russel and '80s Action at Their Cheesy, Silly, Tongue-in-Cheek Best",7,3 October 2016,"Somehow Road House had a baby with the very campiest of 1960s Hong Kong, and John Carpenter signed on to direct (plus compose the soundtrack). Wildly entertaining, and self-aware enough to embrace the sheer lunacy of mysically-powered gang warfare amidst the nooks and crannies of Chinatown, it's no wonder this would become such a cult classic. Kurt Russel is dead-perfect as Jack Burton, the brash, headstrong, somewhat confused would-be hero who doesn't realize he's actually the sidekick. As one might expect, things get carried away somewhere between the first trap elevator and the second (must've been a deal at the villainous super-mart this week) but that's actually for the best: Big Trouble is most in its element when it casts aside mere storyline concerns, flies off the handle and embraces its ridiculous side. The plot is simplistic and the fight scenes aren't all that great - too many jump cuts and blunt-handed effects - but the mood is a direct hit and it's certainly never tame. When it comes to the final confrontation, it's more about quick reflexes than martial arts anyway. A board-dumb classic of the bombastic '80s action scene, and one of my favorite empty climaxes ever. Here's hoping Hollywood understands what made it work so well when they push out the impending remake.",Big Trouble in Little China

Kurt Russell gives what may be his best performance as Jack Burton, an on the surface movie tough guy who in reality is way out of his depth. More a master of Kung-Fool than Kung-Fu.

64,dworldeater,John Carpenter's Big Trouble In Little China rocks!,8,17 February 2015,"John Carpenter and Kurt Russell shake the pillars of heaven in their fourth collaboration in this unusual, but effective campy action classic. Big Trouble In Little China is hard to describe, but is lighthearted and action packed. Taking elements from the western, Chinese martial arts movies as well as fantasy, this film really was quite original for the time. A few years later much of the Asian cast worked on Eddie Murphy's The Golden Child. Both films have fantasy elements and both films are essentially action/comedies. While Eddie is efficient at butt kicking, The Golden Child is driven more by comedy than action. Big Trouble In Little China is hilarious as well, but has much more to offer as far as action. In today's market, this would go over huge with the comic book/sci fi movie types and in my opinion this film is much better than most of those movies. Kurt Russell is great as our very likable white trash idiot hero Jack Burton. Dennis Dun is Jack's buddy Wang Chi and is slightly more serious and more bad ass than Jack. Kim Catrall is very pretty and very funny as well. James Hong gives a real strong performance as the evil wizard Lo Pan and Victor Wong is excellent as his nemesis Egg Shen. Carter Wong, a Hong Kong kung fu star who worked on films for Shaw Brothers Studios is cast here as one of The Storms. The pace is quick and there is much great action as well as much hilarious, quotable dialogue that make this hold up as the immensely entertaining cult classic that holds up and many find enjoyable to this day. Excellent signature score by John Carpenter as well.",Big Trouble in Little China
65,I_Ailurophile,"Big trouble, big fun",10,8 January 2021,"'Big trouble in Little China' has a little bit of everything: action, adventure, comedy, martial arts, horror, fantasy, mystery, thriller, romance. It's one of John Carpenter's most light-hearted features, yet absolutely just as essential a classic.It was such an amazing cast assembled, all bringing such vigor to their roles. John Carpenter's frequent collaborator Kurt Russell is outstanding as somewhat blockheaded tough guy Jack Burton. Carpenter favorites Dennis Dun and Victor Wong, who both co-starred in 'Prince of Darkness,' appear in major supporting roles here, getting a lot of love from the camera. James Hong, prolific and charismatic, is mesmerizing as Lo Pan. Kim Cattrall's Gracie Law is perhaps one of the best roles and performances that she's ever put in. Even audience favorite Al Leong is here!There are fun practical effects, including creatures and body horror, to complement the post-production magic in this film about sorcery and black magic. The narrative is largely driven by humor, and less than serious plot points and witty dialogue. Yet the story is rock solid, with expansive lore serving as foundation. We're led to question what it means to be The Hero, compared to ""The Sidekick"" or ""The Supporting Characters""; the protagonists face otherworldly dangers to save many lives from power-hungry antagonists. Yet all the while this is, above all else, fun.'Big trouble in Little China' is perhaps a great point of entry for the uninitiated into Carpenter's body of work. His signature style and skill as a director (and composer) is readily apparent, while the horror that some viewers may not appreciate of his other films is far outweighed by the comedy sprinkled liberally throughout. It probably has the broadest appeal while nonetheless retaining what makes Carpenter's movies so special in the first place.Modern trends in cinema require most action-adventure films to make their characters as snarky and clever as they are inhumanly powerful, and their stories a mere puzzle piece in a dizzying universe of world-building. But in the face of that grandiosity and those expectations, so many forget to simply be fun. 'Big trouble in Little China' gleefully represents an era of film-making where characters can be witty, and narratives can be complex, while still being a little silly and fun.I remember a couple years ago there was talk of remaking this. 'Big trouble in Little China' is a darling classic, and it needs no remake--but I do think contemporary filmmakers, and audiences, would benefit from watching this and reminding themselves what a good movie can be.",Big Trouble in Little China
66,ShootingShark,A Mystical Action Adventure Comedy Kung-Fu Monster Ghost Story,8,19 January 2008,"Jack Burton is a trucker in San Fransisco whose friend Wang Chi's girlfriend Miao Yin is kidnapped by a streetgang called the Lords of Death. It transpires she has been chosen as the bride for David Lo Pan, an evil sorcerer who must marry a woman with green eyes to rid himself of an ancient curse. Jack and Wang, with the help of some friends, delve into the underworld of Chinatown to try and rescue her and defeat this evil menace.John Carpenter's name is hardly synonymous with comedy, but this charming, amusing, silly, action-packed, deliriously goofy movie belies that fact. It's great strength is in never taking itself too seriously but always striving to entertain, through great performances, a wild story, terrific martial arts sequences, gorgeous fantasy sets and costumes, and great characters. Jack Burton is beautifully out of whack; he's completely out of his depth, stumbling around, trying to maintain his facade of bravado, but he's totally lovable because of these faults, so he really is the hero in the end, even if his friends do all the hard work. Russell gives a fearless, hilarious performance in the lead, but the whole cast leap into the lunacy feet first and the result is magical. Wong and Hong in particular have a whale of time as the kindly old sorcerer Egg Shen and his fearsome nemesis Lo Pan respectively. W.D. Richter's script absolutely rockets along, giving the movie a giddying, agreeably disorienting pace, but in Carpenter's skilled hands it flows along evenly, with the fights and the gags timed to perfection. It's full of terrific moments and lines (""A man'd have to be some kind of fool to think we're all alone in this universe !"") and I love the way it literally dips gently from present-day San Fransisco to the magical underworld of Lo Pan's domain. It also contains one of Carpenter's richest scores, a wailing, mystical-acoustical electronic tempest which buoys up all the mythic elements and races around the action; the whole wedding / final fight / escaping sequence is just awash in fantastic music, and Carpenter even sings (he's the bass voice) on the end credits ! Sadly, this movie was not a hit on its release - it was much too satirical and wild for mainstream audiences - and was one factor which prompted Carpenter to return to low-budget independent work. However, like so many of his films, it was a big success on video and has become a cult classic. I love its sense of daring by having a goofball of a hero and mixing every genre it can think of into the same movie. It looks fabulous, and it's just so much fun to watch. If you ever need cheering up, and you have an open mind, this picture will do the trick every time. Featuring terrific visual effects by Richard Edlund, and fabulous choreography by Jim Lau and James Lew (who both play Chang Sings). Trivia - after meeting on this film, stuntman/actor Jeff Imada (who plays Needles, the hood with the knives at the airport) has been the stunt co-ordinator on every subsequent picture Carpenter has made. If movies are fundamentally meant to entertain - and make no mistake, they are - this is what so many should aspire to. Check it out.",Big Trouble in Little China
67,a_chinn,John Carpenter brings Hong Kong fantasy swordplay to America,8,24 May 2020,"Classic John Carpenter film is unlike any of his others, yet somehow fits nicely within his larger body of work. Like his other films, there is Kurt Russell, there are fantastical and supernatural elements, the story takes place in a confined location, there are hints at an apocalypse, and there is an excellent synthesizer score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth. But what makes ""Big Trouble in Little China"" different is Carpenter's dabbling in Hong Kong style martial arts, some very funny broad comedy (Howard Hawks' style of macho humor is in many of his films and ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" is something of a comedy, but it's not a broad comedy), and most notably the ""hero"" of the film is a buffoonish lout. If you aren't familiar with this classic, Kurt plays truck driver Jack Burton who helps a friend rescue his fiancée from an ancient evil Chinese sorcerer beneath San Francisco's Chinatown. The film's fantasy elements are a lot of fun, kind of a delightful Americanized version of Hong Kong fantasy films like ""Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"" or ""Mr. Vampire"", but it really is Russell's dopey hero that make the film so memorable. Kurt plays Jack Burton as if he were John Wayne and absolutely believes he's the hero of the story, except that he's a complete blowhard and perennial screw up (the studio was actually concerned about this and forced the filmmakers to reshoot the opening where Egg Shen calls Jack a hero). But in reality, it's really his little Asian buddy, Dennis Dun (""The Last Emperor"" ""Year of the Dragon""), who's the hero of the film. Though Burton never realizes it, he's actually the sidekick (he even spends one entire fight sequence knocked out on the floor), which if you think about it is a surprisingly progressive twist on the familiar film trope, the white action hero with the ethnic sidekick. The script was written by W.D. Richter, who's behind such diverse and excellent films that include ""Brubaker,"" the 1979 ""Dracula,"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Nickelodeon"" and even directed the cult classic ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension."" Another strength of the film is a terrific supporting cast. Victor Wong is PERFECT as Egg Shen, the SF tour bus driver who also happens to be a wizard (a super fun ""Sword in the Stone"" style wizard battle between Wong and the evil sorcerer is a high point). Interestingly, this was only Wong's third film, which is surprising considering he was 59 years old when he appeared in it. Another stand out is Carter Wong, playing one of the ""Three Storms,"" the thick-necked Thunder. He's appeared in a ton of martial arts movies, but none that ever hit the US mainstream. Terrific character actor James Hong, who's appeared in everything from ""Chinatown"" to ""Blade Runner"" to a ton of voice work for animated films and TV shows, also gets a juicy role as the main villain, Lo Pan. You even get memorable stuntman/actor Al Leong (""Die Hard"" ""Lethal Weapon"" ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"") as a Wing Kong Hatchet Man. And although I next watched ""Sex and the City"" it does have a before-she-was-famous Kim Cattrall as the plucky Gracie Law. The film was shot by ace cinematographer Dean Cundey, who previously worked on most all of Carpenter's prior films, but who went on to work on major Hollywood blockbusters including ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Apollo 13,"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" Despite some pacing issues and an uneven tone at times, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a unique film that will NOT appeal to all audiences (it bombed in the theater), but is definitely a treat for cult cinephiles who appreciate its quirkiness. And be sure to stay through the end credits for the song by ""The Coupe De Villes"", a band that's actually Carpenter, Nick Castle (Michael Myers in Halloween"" and co-writer of ""Escape from New York""), and Tommy Lee Wallace (editor of ""The Fog"" & ""Halloween"" and writer/director of ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"").

68,Samiam3,This movie is big trouble,3,22 September 2009,"John Carpenter has made two comedies, Starman and this. I think it is pretty obvious which is the better movie (the Oscar nomination is a pretty good clue) As for Big Trouble in Little China, I have to say that this is Carpenter's worst feature. Everything about it is either cheap, fake or ridiculous; the acting, the writing, the special effects, the sets ... There are a couple of fight scenes which are moderately well choreographed for a b-movie, and I may have laughed two or three times, but aside from that, I think this is a waste.Kurt Russell in a failed attempt to parody Snake Plisken plays Jack Burton a ruffian trucker in San Francisco. He liked to hang out in Chinatown where his best friend lives and works. And wouldn't you know it, this friend is getting married. His fiancée has flown in, so Jack gives him a lift to the airport, but before the Chinese lovebirds can even exchange a word, the lucky girl is suddenly kidnapped on the spot. As they soon find out, she has been abducted by the Chinese demon lord Lo Pan who is in search of a green eyed bride to appease the gods. With the help of an ambitious young journalist desperate for a story, and the magic of a local wise men and his bizarre brute squad, our heroes depart to save the day (and the girl)The movie zips by so fast it is ridiculous. The way in which characters are brought into the story is equally random and silly, as are many of the things they say to each other. Not remotely funny. Kurt Russell gets a few good one liners, but nothing that is laugh out laugh out loud.In terms of production values, you can never expect anything special from B-movie, with small budgets and crews, but Big Trouble in Little China looks especially cheap. Although some of the set design is quirky like for instance a giant neon Budda in a temple room, all the sets look like plasticI could continue to go on about the badness of Big Trouble in Little China, but I think I've said enough to make my point, do not see it.",Big Trouble in Little China
69,davidmvining,Side character gets pushed to the fore,7,25 November 2019,"Jack Burton has all the makings of a side character. He's showy, loud, inept, and funny. He's the kind of character that relieves tension from moments while the real hero stays steely eyed and focused on the task at hand. But John Carpenter made him the main character of Big Trouble in Little China, and it turns an adventure film into a comedy adventure film. That combination doesn't always work well (think of the decreasing returns of using Jack Sparrow as the main character in the Pirates of the Caribbean films), but here it works really well.Jack Burton rides into San Francisco's Chinatown in his big rig making a delivery. Once done, he meets up with an old friend, Wang, and they bet all night long. Wang's fiancé is coming in from China that day and ends up kidnapped by Chinese slavers in the airport. Jack and Wang go in hot pursuit deep into the heart of Chinatown where they discover the reality of Chinese black magic in the form of David Lo Pan and his three storms, three sorcerers who command different aspects of the weather. Lo Pan needs to marry a green-eyed woman to lift a curse from a Chinese god and Wang's fiancé is the one in a billion Chinese girl with green eyes. What follows is a breakneck race into the bowels of Lo-Pan's fortress filled with Chinese flavored special effects.Carpenter has always been a filmmaker who's been more concerned with telling a fun story quickly. There are few frills in the film and the movie lightly moves along from gambling to a kidnapping to a rescue attempt in a brothel to breaking into a labyrinthine fortress of Chinese black magic. From one idea to the next, the movie jumps with energy and fun, buoyed along by a very winning cast headed up by Kurt Russel as the eponymous Jack Burton with Kim Cattrall as a young lawyer, Dennis Dun as Wang, and the fantastic James Hong as David Lo Pan.Back to the idea of Jack as, really, a sidekick in this adventure. It becomes more and more obvious the deeper into the movie that Jack is an idiot. He talks like John Wayne and ends up shooting the roof immediately above him and knocking him out at one point. It wouldn't have worked with an actor with less pure charisma as Kurt Russell. He makes Jack fun and eminently watchable as we kind of forget that Wang is actually the hero of the film.It's not perfect. I find its first act a little too convoluted (kidnapping of one girl leads to kidnapping of another girl leads to brothel leads to dual attempts to get her out leads to Lo Pan) when it could have probably been streamlined. It seems obvious that the complexity of the first act is meant to get a way in for Gracie Law (who ends up as Lo Pan's second wife because she also has green eyes and passes a test with burning blades), but I think there were clearer ways to get that to happen.Still, it's a fun ride, and I can't wait for Hollywood to remake it with a bloated 150 minute epic adventure that will in no way improve on the little 100 minute rollercoaster we already have.A final note: Blazing Saddles is often held up as a movie that could never get made today because of its racial humor and intentional crassness. However, I find that less interesting than the more anodyne films that probably couldn't get made today. If a studio were to release Big Trouble in Little China as it is today in theaters, I imagine the social media outcry would be pretty strong. The main character in a story about Asian-Americans is a white guy. The primary female lead is white. Hell, I imagine that the use of Chinese culture would be considered insensitive at best and evilly wrong at worst.",Big Trouble in Little China
70,RainDogJr,The magic of the home video releases,9,21 December 2007,"Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a very rude trucker; when his best friend's fiancée is mysteriously kidnapped by a Chinese gang,he most help his friend to deal with the mysterious David Lo Pan in the underground of San Francisco's Chinatown.From this plot, the great John Carpenter creates one of the most funniest and full of action films of the 80's. Since the very beginning of the film there is action everywhere and really funny dialogs, specially of Jack Burton who seems that never understand what was really happening with the Chinese magicians. Another thing that i love is that all the Chinese knows how to fight (also Burton's best friend) so there are great action scenes. The visual part is good, i love the monsters and with the DVD the quality is much better.The cast is just great, Kurt Russell makes another similar role of ""Snake"" from ""Escape from New YorK"", in the way that both aren't the classic heroes and in this film is really funny. With the participation of Kim Cattrall (now very famous for ""Sex and the city"") and Dennis Dun, who plays Wang Chi, Burton's best friend.""Big Trouble in Little China"" was really misunderstood when it was release in 1986, it was a commercial and critical failure that makes Carpenter stop making films for the studios. So thanks god for the home video releases because now this film is a cult one.Conclusion: watch this great film, is nothing but a ""magical mystery tour"" in San Francisco's Chinatown. For me is not the best of John Carpenter but it is one of the greatest cult films of the 80's. Highly recommendable. 9 out of 10DVD: i have a two-discs edition that have really cool material like interviews, original trailers, trailers in Spanish, deleted scenes and more stuff. I love this DVD specially because is the only format that this film was released in Mexico, i think.PS: the Mexican title for this film is: ""Rescate En El Barrio Chino"", that means ""Rescue in Chinatown"". Not funny like the original but at least is not illogical.SPOILER!!!!!!PS2: I love the end, with the monster in Jack's truck is nothing but great specially for the dialog of Jack in the previous scene.",Big Trouble in Little China
71,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A very weird mess,4,5 June 2012,"It's really hard to comprehend how proficient talent goes to waste so easily. Big Trouble in Little China has a lot of good actors yet there's so much that doesn't work. Never have I witnessed such a catastrophe before in a movie screenplay. There was absolutely no continuity in the plot. And some viewers may feel totally lost half the time while watching this.The talent of this film belongs to Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall and Dennis Dun. All these actors do their job well but nothing is original nor is it entertaining. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, a selfish truck driver who has no intent on helping anyone else but himself. Cattrall plays Gracie Law, who seems to be Burton's ex-girlfriend even though they both end up together again anyway. But what really made it confusing was how on and off these two characters were. One scene they're up in each other's faces, the next they're sharing hugs. Please make up your mind people!Dennis Dun plays Wang Chi, Burton's friend who has his girlfriend kidnapped and is to be sacrificed to an evil sorcerer named David Lo Pan, acted by James Hong. Now it's up to Burton and Chi to save his girl. Another thing that just didn't match here was that Kurt Russell is the star of this film, yet his character is given second place. The character of Jack Burton may be tough and snotty but he's always one step behind everyone else. Why is this? If he's the main character, he should be the one taking charge of rescuing Chi's girlfriend, not some other character. This principle applies for my review of Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) and Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011).Another thing that constantly screamed at me while I watched this film was the execution of action scenes. It takes a lot of effort to try and stick to what's going on in this film! There were multiple times where scenes abruptly ended and began something else in the same place. For example, Burton and Chi become stranded in an alley when out of nowhere two Asian groups clash with guns firing and knives throwing. And Burton and Chi are just watching this from the cabin of a truck and no one bothers to get out and do something? What's going on here? Will this affect the outcome of the movie - no; so why have it?However I will give credit to director John Carpenter for having some unique set designs and special effects but that's all I'm giving him. There's no specific direction in the execution of the plot. The audience is just bombarded with random scenes that have Russell, Dun and Cattrall falling through trap doors and crawling into thin spaces trying to escape danger, until finally it reaches its finale. Not fun. I'm surprised that one of the writers, Gary Goldman was allowed to write for any films after this; especially Total Recall (1990), which was a good film! It's unfortunate because I really wanted to enjoy this movie but I couldn't.Director John Carpenter has a knack for doing some amazing things in filmmaking but Big Trouble in Little China just doesn't give the same performance like the ones that came before it. The placement of characters don't make sense and the execution is poor.",Big Trouble in Little China
72,Easygoer10,I Love It!,8,5 January 2020,"This is such a good film. Its hit terrific action, but Carpenter doesn't take it serious. It's one of the few comedic films he ever made. Besides his favorite actor (Kurt Russell), you have my favorite Chinese American actor: James Hong. Imho, he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood history. A veteran of well over 400 films, he is still working, and is over 90 years old. I saw him in a Steve McQueen film around 1960. It may have been on McQueen's TV show; ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" (1958-1961). Another Chinese American actor Victor Wong is in this. He was a wonderful character actor. Although he began acting at a later age, he us terrificly cast in this film. There are many stuntman acting in this as well. Some are martial artists who transitioned to choreographed stunt fighting for movies. Even Dennis Dun, who co-stars with Kurt Russell, is a fine actor. If you are a John Carpenter fan, this is a must see film.",Big Trouble in Little China
73,PredragReviews,Explodes like a Chinese firecracker,8,11 June 2016,"A John Carpenter's classic, this movie is so close to perfect it's unbelievable. Not as classic cinema, not as biting satire or high drama, but as fantasy comedy or a parody of fantasy adventure movies, it's the best I've ever seen. Everybody has fun in this movie. Russell shines as an Indiana Jones/Snake Plissken parody (a parody of Snake? Yes, indeed...). Carpenter's script is, as always, a combination of light action, horror and fantasy, with his usual meticulous research into his subject matter. Yes, all of the core fantasy elements are taken from Chinese fairy tales and mythology. Great cheesy lines, wonderful Day-Glo set design, some very weird hells, sloppy but enthusiastic wire-work and a furry monster that just won't go away make this a classic.Russell takes advantage of Gary Goldman and David Weinstein's script to deliver the best comic performance of his career as his swaggering trucker Jack Burton blunders through Chinatown in an attempt to recover his stolen truck and his friend's kidnapped fiancée. Masterminding the bad guys is demon/ghost David Lo Pan, played wryly by James Hong. Hong parodies practically his whole career in this role, and has some priceless lines in so doing. His motive in the kidnapping is to marry a girl with green eyes, which will appease his demon-god and restore his lost vitality. The plot grows more absurd and hilarious as the movie progresses and Burton and his companion, Wang (Dennis Dun) enlist the aid of local magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong) to thwart Lo Pan. Russell and Dun are perfectly over-the-top in their deliveries, and they provide constant laughs to propel the movie rapidly along to its conclusion. It is very hard to find someone who doesn't like this movie, and with good reason. The film is so novel and so funny that it can be enjoyed over and over again a real treasure.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Big Trouble in Little China
74,winner55,ahead of its time,9,28 June 2006,"Admirers of this film sometimes voice bewilderment as to why this film wasn't more popular on release, having to develop its audience via the secondary video market (which has actually been the case for a number of John Carpenter films). In reading some of the negative comments concerning the film, I think that I can sum this up, and in a manner that enhances viewing of the film.By 1986, many Americans had become convinced that the Hong Kong action film was a thing of the past, since in many US cities the so-called ""grindhouse"" theaters these had played at had closed. Consequently, the whole Hong Kong 'New Wave' phenomenon - Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, John Woo, Tsui Hark, etc. - with its touches of irony and outright comedy, was known here only to a dedicated few. Carpenter's film is a respectful tribute to this development, and not a satire on the old-school chop socky film with which most Americans were familiar.Because of this, I think American audiences were bewildered; if it was an American kung fu film, where was Jean Claude Van Damme? If it was about Chinese kung fu, why wasn't it outright satire? If it was a serious fantasy, why were there jokes? If it was a comedy, why was the Anglo-American the butt of the jokes, why not the Chinese? We can now reduce these questions to their obvious assumptions: The Chinese make silly action movies that are only good for a few laughs, European-Americans make serious action movies with serious heroes. A Hong Kong kung fu movie is a brainless way to pass some time, a Hollywood martial arts film is has an instructive point to make about the conflict between good and evil (ala Rambo).The reason why Big Trouble has developed an audience on the secondary, video, market, is because it is exactly through this market that many Americans at last began investigating films Los Angeles and New York reviewers were raving about, films made in Hong Kong that were far more violent, exciting, and amusing than any action film being made in Hollywood. And it certainly helped that Hollywood action stars like Van Damme and Steven Seagal began not only praising Hong Kong films, but actually bringing over their directors and action Choreographers like Yuen Woo Ping. And by 1996, not only did all Americans at last know who Jackie Chan and John Woo were, but most Hollywood action films were slavishly imitating one or another Hong Kong director's style.Still, from some negative comments in IMDb reviews, one has to admit that some of the old ethnocentrism that blocked appreciation of Carpenter's achievement in Big Trouble still remains. Some young reviewers still don't recognize that the Three Storms happen to be old-school Hong Kong stars brought over especially for this project; that, as in any good Hong Kong 'New Wave' film, Russell's truck-driver can be presented as both clown and hero (see Jet Li's Contract Killer); that the use of wire-works is most effective when combined with bone-crunching realism; that an American martial arts film does not need to have an Anglo- American martial artist star; and that Chinese black magic has the same place in an action film fantasy as any other magic (or any other science, for that matter) - I mean, should we really take Yoda's mumblings about 'the Force' in Srar Wars seriously, and then dismiss Egg Chen because his magic is Chinese? Let's get real! The action film no longer recognizes boundaries, and quality has no nationality. The reason this film is so good is precisely because Carpenter chose not to approach it in a patronizing manner. he is sincerely trying to make a Hong Kong 'New Wave' action picture in the Chinese-American community of San Francisco; that was a real innovation, in 1986; perhaps it still is.Bottomline: this is a great fun exciting action-comedy, that holds up well after 20 years. Well-made, fast-paced, and it treats both its subject matter and its audience fairly and with respect.",Big Trouble in Little China
75,Gislef,Don't try to pigeonhole it - you'll just get a headache,8,11 January 2001,"Big Trouble is quite simple a comedy-action movie. It has no other purpose.

77,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Big Trouble in Little China""- The ultimate 80's cult masterpiece.",10,18 September 2018,"As I sit at my computer pondering what to write out for what will be my six-hundredth IMDb review, a myriad of ideas cross through my mind. But none are so appealing as one certain notion that quickly popped up and hasn't quite let go. That being that it may finally be time to discuss what is not only one of my own personal favorite films... but also a film that is arguably the definitive 80's movie. A cult masterpiece whose audience and legacy has only grown larger and larger in the thirty-or-so years that have passed since its initial release.Yup, it's time to discuss John Carpenter's twisted and endearing fantasy-comedy hybrid ""Big Trouble in Little China.""Released to mixed reviews in 1986, the film was a massive failure for both director Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, bringing in dismal box office numbers and quickly resulting in Carpenter's disillusionment with the Hollywood film industry. And yet, in 2018, the film is widely considered to be a masterpiece of its era. So much so in fact, that there has even been recent talk of a modern reboot or belated sequel starring today's most popular action hero Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. So what was it about this film in particular that appealed to audiences over the years? Why did a box-office bomb that was initially met with apathy and dismissal suddenly become such a beloved classic?Russell stars as Jack Burton, a loud-mouthed truck driver whose having a bit of a bad day. Accompanying his quote-unquote ""friend"" Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) to their airport to pick up his fiancé Miao Yin (Suzee Pai), Jack quickly finds himself in over his head as a gang of ruthless thugs kidnaps the young woman, and he encounters a bizarre assortment of seemingly supernatural foes. As it turns out, Miao Yin is needed by an ancient and devilish sorcerer (James Hong) to complete a dark ritual, and it's up to Wang Chi and his mentor Egg Shen (Victor Wong) to save the day... while Jack is dragged along as his glorified sidekick- kicking, screaming and complaining the entire time.It's been said a million times, and I must echo it once again here- the great appeal of ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is that on the surface, it's a competent fantasy adventure. But just below the surface, the film is elevated far beyond its competence by its infectious humor and self-aware charm. It very much is a film told from the perspective of the dopey comedic sidekick, who not only doesn't know what's going on... but he doesn't much care, either. Burton is a fantastic protagonist because he's simply trying to get by, and like anyone else would be, he's majorly peeved he even has to deal with this nonsense. It's a refreshing change-up to see a ""hero"" who would much rather be chugging beers and munching on potato chips rather than rescuing damsels and saving the world. And Russell is clearly having the time of his life in the role. Imagine a really burnt out Han Solo whose let himself go, and you have Jack Burton.Director Carpenter relishes in the material, delivering non-stop action and near-endless jokes throughout the brisk ninety-nine minute runtime. It's obvious that Carpenter, better known for his many horror films, has a certain affinity for old-school kung-fu schlock, and is just having a blast behind the camera. In a lot of ways, the film feels very much ahead of its time, with many sequences featuring dazzling wire-work and highly stylized effects that feel like something right out of ""The Matrix."" Heck, there's even a few scenes that feel like they were inspired by the then cutting-edge genre of Japanese anime. It's really strong stuff, and its among Carpenter's most dazzling work.The supporting cast is also in on the fun, and everyone seems to play the material with a certain sense of affection, while also giving a sly wink to the absurdity of the material. Of course the most notable being James Hong's now legendary turn as the evil magician David Lo Pan. It's rare to see such a devious and yet completely and utterly likable villain, and it's arguably Hong's greatest role. Dennis Dun and Victor Wong round out our heroes in strong and enjoyable turns. And we even get the charming and wickedly entertaining Kim Cattral in a strong supporting role as Gracie Law, a headstrong and shrewd woman who becomes Burton's kinda, sorta, maybe ""love interest.""So we've established that the film's well-made and performed, and is generally quite fun. But why did this film in particular become such a phenomenon years after release? Why is ""Big Trouble in Little China"" a cult classic? Honestly, I don't think there's one specific reason. The fact is, this film is a perfect storm of everything going right. Much like ""Ghostbusters"" or other comedy classics, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" excels simply because the stars just sort-of aligned. The casting was perfect. The humor was perfect. The effects were perfect. The tone was perfect. It's just one of those wonderful cases where everything went right, and people were able to appreciate this fact. Film is a careful balance between what's planned and what actually occurs during filming. And ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a prime example of this. Everything about the film is just exquisite. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" an absolutely charming 80's relic, and is amongst the decade's finest and most entertaining releases. With one of the best protagonists of its time, a strong sense of adventure and an absolutely phenomenal sense of humor, you just can't help but thoroughly enjoy it start to finish. There's a reason it became such a big hit in the years that have passed, and it will continue to be enjoyed for years to come.

79,DJAkin,Best Kurt Russell movie in this genre,10,17 March 2010,I saw this movie when I was still a lad. I saw it at the theater and laughed out loud when I watched it. I like how Jack Burton is laid back all the time. He always gets into these impossible messes and just remains calm. There visuals in this movie are great. like those characters who float down on lightening and have huge hats. That one part where the Chinese guy blows a ball into Jack' tummy was funny. Even that didn't hurt ol' Jack Burton. I liked how that old guy in the wheel chair was bragging about what a good looking guy he was and that he score with women. I laughed so hard that my eyeballs swelled up by 4% and squirted a little bit of tear juice!!! Jake Bass liked this movie also.,Big Trouble in Little China
80,Howlin Wolf,When East and West collide...,7,1 July 2007,"Like many people I have loved this movie since I was only a youngster, purely because the first time I watched it there didn't seem to be any limitations placed upon what might be allowed to happen. It exploits fully the fantastical possibilities that film-making opens up. Right from the word go the story barrels along, keeping pace with Jack's truck, and never eases up even for a moment.Now I'm older of course and have purchased the DVD so I can revel in its delights whenever I want, I'm able to better appreciate Carpenter's intentions with the project. It's basically an experiment to see what would happen if you dropped a John Wayne archetype into a more traditional kung-fu movie. Personally I gain the most enjoyment from Burton's bluff machismo... and the fact that it doesn't seem incongruous that he should call a spirit who is hundreds of years old ""Dave""... (also my name)Virtually everything that takes place has an ever present tongue-in-cheek slant applied to it, and that, I think, is what makes it so easy to sit back and enjoy proceedings. You know that it's only goal is to entertain you, and trust me, it does a great job in that regard. It may not be particularly serious and it may not add up to much in the end, but I firmly believe that it is masterful, in its own crazily lovable way.",Big Trouble in Little China

THis film stands out almost all on its own.JAck Burton(Kurt Russell,never more in his element than here) is a free-wheeling',happy-as-acclaim,wiseass trucker who is game for any sort of challenge. On route through San Francisco,he is talked into doing a favor for his friend Wang(Dennis Dun),who convinces him to transport a couple of friends,one of them a head-strong lawyer named Gracie(Kim Cattrall,LONG before Sex and the City or even Mannequin) through Chinatown.

IN pursuit of their charges,JAck and Wang end up in a powerful battle with a Chinese demi-God(JAmes HOng) who,according to legend,needs to marry and reproduce with a green-eyed Asian lady(that would be model Suzee Pai)in order to live another two thousand years.THe plot is as loose-fitting as the clothing that the lovely damsels in distress are forced to wear,and the action is at such breakneck speed that you feel like you'll get whiplash after the first thirty minutes. A gaggle of special effects adorns this film,which is basically an homage to actioner serials of the distant past(think 1940s and '50s) and kung fu movies of the not-so-distant past(try the early 70s).

82,oneguyrambling,Awesome! I want whatever drugs Carpenter was on in the 80s!,8,8 April 2011,"In reality Escape from New York should be the supercool action flick and Big Trouble in Little China should be the throwaway film long since forgotten.But this ain't reality - Escape from New York is a relic of a bygone time and BTiLC remains a terrific low budget classic.Both films star Kurt Russell. In BTiLC Russell plays Jack Burton, a big mouthed opinionated truck driver with misguided confidence to spare who talks loudly at all times, seemingly mimicking John Wayne's cadence and speech patterns.Now in real life a guy like Jack Burton would be an absolute tosser worthy of only your disdain and pity - in films he is a cool guy! Jack gets into the messiest of situations when he follows up a gambling debt and becomes embroiled in female trafficking, smuggling and dark Chinese magic.What starts as a ""mere"" Chinese gang war becomes something far bigger, including huge battles, explosions, shape changers, monsters, sorcerers and big hats galore.It turns out that a centuries old Chinese sorcerer named Lo Pan needs a woman with green eyes to ensure his continued immortality - so his gang steals one from the airport, lo and behold though when another falls into his clutches in the form of a young lawyer played by Kim Cattrall - who seeing this film was made in the early 80s must have been about 50 at the time.Jack wants Kim, his gambling buddy Wang wants his own green eyed missus back , Lo Pan wants one or both chicks (one for the ritual / one for the after-party!) and it seems every Asian-American bit part actor ever just wanted to get paid.The action runs non-stop from start to finish and while it is never especially violent it is always entertaining. Russell himself thinks he is so cool that we are momentarily fooled into believing him (all the way up to Death Proof for me).Some of the effects are decidedly 80s and obviously low budget and the inclusion of monsters was perhaps a little too cartoony on top of all else, but when a film has enough funny lines and chuckle-worthy moments you can happily cut it some slack.Big Trouble in Little China is perhaps overlooked when discussing the films of the 80s, perhaps dismissed as disposable lightweight fluff. I urge you to have another look and decide for yourself if something this fun - and funny should be written off so easily.Final Rating 8 / 10. - Before John Carpenter lost his way he and Kurt Russell shared a dream run for a while, Big Trouble in Little China might not be a classic in the truest sense but it sure is a good time.",Big Trouble in Little China

A fun and funny concept, and that's exactly what BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA is and nothing more, but what else does it need to be? BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA may have abandoned any form of common sense or plot, but what the heck! Fun is the word here, and fun it is. Who could such a totally plot-less and silly experience be engaging for 99 minutes? It's wild, wacky entertainment, that's why. There's not a single moment in the film that utters sense, but as long as you know how to wave the magic wand to make such silliness work like magic, you don't need anything else.The plot is, well there really isn't any. Just wisecracking hero Jack Burton (Kurt Russell at his wackiest) leading his posse of wizards and martial artists inside slimy dungeons hidden inside old factory buildings and sewers to find an evil wizard (James Hong) who needs two green-eyed maidens to maintain his youth. Of course this calls for ugly monsters, wacky bits of humor, moments of camp, the most over-the-top martial arts battles this side of a ""Power Rangers"" episode and Russell uttering such memorable lines such as ""Ol' Jack always says... what the hell?"" or ""I was born ready."". Okay, could you want anything else? If your looking for sense, it's right along that corridor.

Shooting and fighting and kung fu and swords and other stuff – these all made for an enjoyable trip through someone's warped mind.

This is just good old-fashioned rock-'em sock-'em action with enough wry humor to fill a dozen of the kung-fu movies that are being satirized here.""Big Trouble in Little China"" shows the humorous side of John Carpenter's work that hasn't been in evidence in his other movies (well, besides ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"").  The script (co-written by W.D. Richter, a wit if ever there was one) combines kung-fu philosophy, the spirits of rain, thunder and lightning, bust-em-up fights, dire Chinese wall inscriptions that turn out to read ""Do Not Enter"", special FX by the truckloads and Russell as truck driver Jack Burton, the last of the rugged individualists (even though John Wayne may disagree).Russell is in better display here than in ""Escape from New York"": his swaggering super-macho attitude and growling come-and-get-me delivery make his every line the envy of every action hero (or, at least, the butt of their jokes).Cattrall is well-cast as the nosy reporter Gracie Law and Victor Wong makes the eccentric magician Egg Shen a true individual.  And Jams Hong, one of Hollywood's best-kept secrets, brings life to the malevolent spirit Lo Pan as something to hate, fear and, even at times, pity.There are very few slow spots in this one and plenty of time for one-liners, sight gags and erstwhile comments on how little good machismo will do you in a battle with Chinese spirits.There's lots of showmanship from every angle here and it's a relief to see Carpenter not trying to shock you out of your senses for a change.

88,jluis1984,East meets West in an excellent film!,8,10 October 2006,"History says that ""Big Trouble in Little China"" started as a period Western about a cowboy facing the mysteries of ancient Chinese mythology. Gary Goldman and David Weinstein's screenplay was supposed to be an East meets West story where cowboy guns faced martial arts, but the producers thought it would be an unfilmable epic, and decided to set the story in modern times. With writer W.D. Richter (director of ""TThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"") making the adaptation and director John Carpenter leading the project ""Big Trouble in Little China"" was born as we know it: a modern day Western about a trucker facing the mysteries of ancient Chinese mythology.Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a trucker who enjoys the simple things of life, so he never expected that the day he took his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) to pick up his fiancée Miao Yin (Suzee Pai) at the airport, he would find himself without his beloved truck, and in the middle of a battle between good and evil where ancient Chinese magic and martial collide will decide the future of Earth. So now Jack and Wang will have to go on a rescue mission, to try to save Miao Yin from the hands of immortal sorcerer Lo Pan (James Hong) and his Chinatown street gangs before Lo Pan achieves his evil purposes.As written above, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" was conceived as an action packed Western with touches of comedy, and it shows, as thankfully W.D. Richter kept that angle while adding his own very personal touches to the script. Hence, Jack Burton is a character with many parallels to John Wayne's characters in Westerns; however, one thing that makes this movie different to those films, is that here Jack Burton is not the hero of the story. While he is in fact our main character (and our eyes) in the film, he is Wang's sidekick in his mission to save Miao Yin. It's a very unusual and original take on the action genre, and the relationship of friendship and respect that exists between Jack and Wang is one of the things that make this movie great.Director John Carpenter had received great critical acclaim with his 1984 film ""Starman"", and despite that the film was a moderate commercial success, Carpenter finally proved he was more than a horror filmmaker. In ""Big Trouble in Little China"" once again he reunited with long-time collaborators including Kurt Russell, and gave life to the magical Chinatown balancing the action with the comedy in a perfect yet natural way that makes the film flow smoothly. The non-stop action the film has shows a lot of the influence of both Westerns and Martial Arts movies (the films that inspired the script) without taking away Carpenter's trademarks such as the atmospheric score and the inventive fluid camera-work.The performances of the cast really are a stand out characteristic that has helped the film to earn cult status. Kurt Russell shows his best John Wayne impersonation and makes one of the most charismatic anti-heroes in film history. Dennis Dun is excellent as Wang, and shows a lot of chemistry with Russell, as well as the necessary screen presence to be the hero the film needs. James Hong delivers an unforgettable scene-stealing performance as the sorcerer Lo Pan, probably one of the funniest and best remembered villains ever. A young Kim Cattrall appears as Burton's romantic interest, Gracie Law, showing a terrific talent for comedy. Victor Wong and Suzee Pai complete an excellent cast that deserves a lot of credit for the film's success.""Big Trouble in Little China"" was a box office failure when it was released, and it was Carpenter's biggest flop in his career and the film that prompted him to return to low-budget b-movies (he would do ""Prince of Darkness"" the following year). However, this has more to do with the expectations of the audiences of the time than with the film's quality. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" had a humor ahead of its time, and its originality (both in the way the story is told and the pop culture references) has proved to be very influential for today's film industry. The way it criticizes action films with a very tongue in cheek humor is quite remarkable today, but probably went over the head of the audiences in its initial release.While it meant a failure for Carpenter on its day, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is definitely one of his best films, and one of the best action/comedy movies ever made. Sure, many films mix action and comedy but very few films actually succeed in doing it intelligently and without remorse.

I really prefer this movie even as I consider it to be a smidgen second rate, as that's no secret. It's very entertaining in many areas.

Kurt Russell is All-American hotness as Jack Burton. I'm definitely not in any way questioning my sexuality right now as I see Kurt in that tanktop he's wearing the whole movie through, I'm not, don't take the wrong impression. I'll just go ahead and point out hottie Kim Cattrall to avoid any further potential awkwardness on your part. Gah, Kim Cattrall as Gracie Law, what a hottie! Oh! I love her in this movie and I'm so glad she landed the part. Big Trouble in Little China feels like a quiet cultural phenomenon that's enjoyably rewatchable time and again. I love everything about this movie. What's not to love? Kurt Russell's sweltering man pecs in that tanktop?",Big Trouble in Little China
91,ivo-cobra8,A classic action film in a John Carpenter style!,10,31 October 2015,"Big Trouble in Little China (1986) is one of the best movies ever! A true classic action film from the 80'! After 20.years watching again this movie it is still a classic sci-fi action film. Kurt Russell rocks also there is theme music from Escape From New York (1981) my favorite classic film that Kurt Russell and John Carpenter worked on it together.Clever one liners that will keep you rolling. This movie has it all, high kicks, low kicks, laughs, ghouls, demons, girls, and much more. Oh and did I mention Chinese black Magic? This movie will definitely engulf your living room in green flame and keep you asking for more. Big Trouble in Little China is amazing. Action, adventure and comedy are all here, and the result is one of the best cult classic films of all time. I must have seen this movie 50+ times, and it never gets old. Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is the character that everyone would like to be just for a day (maybe more). Driving around in The Pork Chop Express, beating up the bad guys, scoring with the ladies.....it's all in the reflexes for OI' Jack Burton! This is one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's, possibly ever!I grew up watching this film, seen now after 20.years of watching this film later, It is still my favorite awesome action film! Mainly because of Kurt Russell the man can kick ass! He has humor, charm and can do a good things. He was so funny and hilarious in this film. Gosh the film is wonderful and I just love it so much. Is actually my fourth best John Carpenter/Kurt Russell film and I just love those four movies so much! I Love Big Trouble in Little China to death and It was hard to get this film on Blu-ray. It is one of John Carpenter's awesome adventures. Kurt Russell plays the egotistical Jack Burton extremely well, delivering the cheesy macho lines in the way they were intended. Beautifully filmed (the fight scene in the alley), this has been one of my favorites from Carpenter for a long time with Escape from New York, Escape from L.A. , The Thing, Prince of Darkness, The Fog and Vampires. Special effects are great, wonderful and outstanding! It is favorite Kurt Russell's performance, underrated gem of a movie, and one of the most quotable too. I love how this all started because Wang lost a drinking game to Jack. To this day I haven't seen anything like it.That's movie magic right there. Jack Burton should be in the top 10 movie characters ever!. San Francisco, CA-Jack Burton is possibly the greatest hero to ever walk the Earth at least in his own mind!!! The chemistry between Jack and Wang is so believable you want to see more adventure between the duo. This movie has a lot of fun, it is enjoyable flick it has imagination, great acting from all the actors, they all lightning us up with great performances. The action and adventures are super amazing, it is like you want to be in this movie! It has super fun characters in here and a cool awesome monster!Big Trouble in Little China is 80's classic! I love everything that it is in this film. I love the score, especially in the underworld. The battle in the alley when the 3 storms turn up is awesome. Don't see many films that transcend this many genres as well. I heard they are also planning to remake this film Big Trouble in Little China (2016) with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in it! Why? Only to get more money? Why remaking or rebooting this film?, when we already have a classic action film here! This film does not need any reboot or remake, leave it alone the way it is! ""Gosh"" Big Trouble in Little China is a 1986 American action comedy film directed by John Carpenter. It stars Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall, Dennis Dun and James Hong.The basic plot about this film is about Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) a simple man who doesn't believe in ghosts or magic until he's swept into a mind-boggling adventure deep within Chinatown's mysterious underworld. Burton's pal, Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), is trying to rescue his kidnapped fiancée. Egg Shen (Victor Wong), an enigmatic tour-bus driver seems to know a lot about ancient Chinese magic for a simple tour-bus driver. They do battle with an outlandish array of human and inhuman adversaries under the command of Lo Pan (James Hong), a 2000-year-old evil magician who has the power to transform himself from a wheelchair-bound old man into a seven-foot-tall mystical menace. It does involves black magic and mystical forces of darkness.",Big Trouble in Little China
92,petra_ste,Roaring Eighties,7,5 August 2014,"In an age where escapism often means ominous three-hours flicks about grim anti-heroes, a movie like Big Trouble in Little China feels like a weird artifact from an ancient civilization: a fantasy/action/adventure so giddy, so deliberately cheesy, it's endearing.It's clear everyone on set was having fun, from director John Carpenter (who was approaching the end of his ten-years winning streak started with Halloween) to his favorite leading man Kurt Russell - whose crass Jack Burton, amusingly, is actually the sidekick of real protagonist Wang, even if he fails to realize it.A light meal, but a tasty one.6,5/10",Big Trouble in Little China
93,The_Movie_Cat,"""This is like some radical Alice in Wonderland""",5,25 September 2000,"Kurt Russell gets little to do save react in this cartoon-like tale of battling Asian stereotypes.Big Trouble in Little China sees him as ironically macho trucker Jack Burton, in a quest to rescue his friend's fiancée from an ancient sorcerer.To be honest, I'm not really sure what the film was trying to achieve. A spoof, certainly, as the overdone exposition would seem to attest. Yet throughout most of the film the sound dubbing is also appalling. Was this a genuinely bad production technique or an attempted satire on poorly-dubbed Asian movies of the 70s? And while the film does provide jobs for just about every Chinese actor in Hollywood, it fudges the issue by having the female romantic lead played by the Caucasian Kim Cattrall.An unusual project for John Carpenter, it perhaps lacks maturity and is too effects-led to appeal fully to adults. Yet it's images of brothels and violent content make it pretty unsuitable for younger audiences too. As a comedy it's not particularly funny, though impressively mounted action sequences propel the whole thing along and make it superficially entertaining. Shame about that mullet hairstyle though. Oh, and is the end a rip-off of the restaurant scene from Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life""?",Big Trouble in Little China
94,gab-14712,A Fun and Enjoyable Action Romp!,8,11 August 2020,"John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China is a campy thrill ride that is bound to please fans of genre B-filmmaking. Yeah, it is not the greatest film of all time, but it is an hour-and-a-half romp with cool king fu moves, an interesting mythical background story, and a wisecracking Kurt Russell. The visual effects and stuntwork are excellent and well-choreographed. The story itself is interesting enough to hold my attention as I love all things fantasy and mysticism, but it could have been better developed. In other words, this is your quintessential summer blockbuster action movie.Preproduction did not get off to the best start. The original draft of the screenplay was written by first-time screenplay writers Gary Goldman and David Weinstein. Their draft was considered so bad that it was unreadable despite having interesting ideas. 20th Century Fox hired veteran script doctor W.D Richter to overhaul the script. The original writers got into a tussle with the studio over credit and the WGA needed to get involved. One thing for sure is that the screenplay is not the film's best attribute. Although it does deliver some really memorable lines of dialogue.John Carpenter was hired to direct the movie because of his ability to work quickly. There was a similar movie being released the same year starring Eddie Murphy, so time was of essence. Carpenter had success working in big-budget, special-effects driven movies such as The Thing and Escape from New York. His previous feature Starman was a beautiful drama, so I was ready to see what's next from him. Although Carpenter is proud of the final result, he became an independent filmmaker because he could not take working with the Hollywood system no more. He did not have a good time making the movie under the pressure of the Hollywood studio. I felt that small cracks could be seen, and his use of special effects threaten to overshadow the movie, but I believe Carpenter did a good job. As with most of his films, he created the score. He did away with the chop suey score one would expect and instead created a fusion of traditional synth and rock'n'roll, which I believe was an excellent choice!Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a truck driver who just arrived in San Francisco's Chinatown. He meets his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) and they head to the airport to pick up Wang's new fiancé, Miao Yin. Miao has green eyes, which is rare for a Chinese person and is important to the overall story. At the airport, she is kidnapped by a street gang. They learn that this gang is associated with David Lo Pan (James Hong), an evil sorcerer who is under a two-thousand-year-old curse. He needs to marry a woman with green eyes to break the curse. They team up with lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), a lawyer with green eyes herself. They head underground to fight magic.Kurt Russell was considered a rising star and Carpenter quickly casted him in the lead role. His character is a mixture of John Wayne and Indiana Jones. I like how he is really confident in his abilities to be a hero when all he really is the bumbling sidekick. His friend, the guy with the awesome martial art skills, is the real hero. I found many of Russell's lines and his delivery to be amusing in his cocky sort of way. He ain't no Indiana Jones, but I guess it does not hurt to try.Big Trouble in Little China is a fun cult classic. It bombed at the box office when it was released mainly because it was released in the shadow of Aliens. Plus, the cast was mainly all Asian outside of Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall. Still, it's a solid movie with an interesting story. The fighting sequences are worth watching and I liked the twist regarding Russell's status as a hero. Most of the movie is one giant chase sequence after the first ten minutes so be prepared for that. It is an effects-heavy movie so be prepared for some story to be sacrificed. Being a John Carpenter film, I still found it worthy of his name.My Grade: B",Big Trouble in Little China
95,PsychoBeard666,Imagine not giving this film 10/10!,10,17 September 2019,"The perfect adventure film from The Horror Master himself!

96,Son_of_Mansfield,One of John Carpenter's few comedies.,8,8 August 2008,"Imagine a movie that makes a hero out of a man so dense that he can't keep up in most conversations and is useless in a fight. That is Kurt Russell's Jack Burton, played with a slight John Wayne impersonation and a massive superiority complex. Most of the heavy lifting is done by ""sidekick"" Dennis Dunn as the high flying Wang Chi and Victor Wong as the mysterious Egg Shen. James Wong is fantastic as both the ten foot tall roadblock and the little basket case on wheels, Lo Pan, who kidnaps Wang's girl and Jack's partner in sexual tension. What passes for a plot, which is just an excuse for fights and silliness, has the two of them storming Lo Pan's castle for their damsels, several times, until they it right. The only sad thing is that this marked the beginning of the end of Carpenter's hot streak. People, including those in the studio, didn't get this movie and he had more then enough of their talk. If some don't love it, they just have poor reflexes.P.S. The commentary by Russell and Carpenter is classic. Two old friends shooting the breeze, reminiscing about a movie they loved making. As a matter of fact, the commentaries from The Thing and Escape From New York are a blast too.",Big Trouble in Little China
97,oneloveall,Big trouble with little time,4,23 February 2008,"Here's one that I hoped retained some sort of magic which I seem to have remembered it possessing back when it came out. Most of the time it does precisely the opposite.Trying to forgive the datedness and some intentional cheesiness that would have encrusted the acting, Russell still sounds like John Wayne on dope half the time.I suppose the magic still remains for those who weaved it so in their youth, I merely saw it once and remembered it fondly. Besides for some occasionally uplifting set-work though, there is little reason to revisit this b movie.",Big Trouble in Little China
98,AhmedSpielberg99,"This is the movie that invented the expression ""A blast from start to finish.""",7,30 September 2018,"-""Ol' Jack Always Says... What The Hell?""Filled with cheesy one-liners, next-level campy spirit, bizarre and silly fighting sequences, oddball humor, and zany special effects. All these things made Big Trouble in Little China nothing but a funny guilty-pleasure, but I don't totally agree with that opinion.Actually, I think this movie is a strong proof that John Carpenter was one of the best, and most versatile filmmakers who worked in the eighties. With all the mentioned-above delightful ingredients, Carpenter didn't neglect making a good movie in the first place.It's really impressive to see Carpenter among all this sheer fun utilizing many cinema tropes, such as; Chekhov's Gun, and MacGuffin. Or to see him really care about the main character improvement. Just try to remember how Jack Burton became totally different at the end from what he was when we introduced to him for the first time. Needless to say, that Kurt Russell gave an incredibly charismatic performance.The movie is not without its flaws nonetheless, for there are some issues I couldn't help but notice. First and foremost, the first act represented a lot of characters, and potential sub-plots that didn't pay off neither as the story progresses, nor at the end of the movie.
Secondly, I think Margo, a journalist played by Kate Burton, was completely useless, and seemed to exist only to fill up some places. Finally, there was a lot of exposition that we didn't even need. I mean what's the benefit of telling us the same information two or three times. If some characters don't know some information that doesn't mean that we need to witness all the main characters, one by one, get the same information over and over again! I found the romantic relationship between Jack Burton and Gracie Law a bit cringe-worthy at first, but then it turned out that this was intentional, and this very relationship even became very satisfying for me by the end of the movie.(7.5/10)",Big Trouble in Little China
99,Movie-Misfit,A Childhood Favourite That Still Entertains!!,8,14 July 2020,"Upon its release, I would rent Big Trouble In Little China from the video store every Friday night (or at least fortnightly) along with Project A, Lucky Seven, The Last Dragon, or any amount of other Jackie Chan classics I was able to get my hands on!I was already hooked on Hong Kong cinema by this stage, and at 9 years old, wanted to see anything that had a hint of kung-fu action or ninjas in it. I can't remember if it was the video store clerk or my dad that put Carpenters latest flick in my hands, but either way, I was hooked after my first viewing. At that age, I can remember feeling very excited, scared, and highly entertained at this action adventure film. I hadn't seen anything from Hong Kong or Taiwan (in terms of a fantasy film) with a budget like this, so it felt so much bigger and glossier with its special effects, incredible sets, and Hollywood look.Over 30 years later, and Big Trouble In Little China still highly entertains - although now, for many other reasons. Being a film maker and adult, I can now see the flaws and things that really didn't work for the film, albeit a handful at most. Watching the Arrow Video blu-ray release was a stunning experience and shed a whole new light on the film which I have to say, looked amazing. Its so atmospheric, popping with colour when it comes about, laced with incredible sets and dripping with just enough Hollywood cheese so as not to put you off. Having been sucking up the best of HK cinema my whole life, I can honestly say the kung-fu fights weren't anything spectacular here to me now, but as a kid, they were so much fun. And while other US action films, such as the Canon ninja collection were gaining so much attention for their martial arts action, it was this and The Last Dragon that showcased the better and more exciting battles for me. This was all down to the great James Lew who worked as fight choreographer and actor for the film. Lew has since went on to work on countless projects from Power Rangers to Marvel's Netflix shows, and of course, played the hilarious bad guy in American Ninja 5...Clearly inspired by the best of Hong Kong cinema, Carpenter and his team managed to pull off something a little unique that, ultimately, was a box office flop upon release. Of course, that didn't stop it quickly gaining a cult following that has made the film what it is today. The thought of an Asian guy playing the lead over Kurt Russell's hilarious action-hero-wannabe truck driver, Jack Burton, scared studio bosses - but it happened. And while Dennis Dun did a fantastic job and fits the bill, I can't help but wonder what if Jackie Chan had been placed in that exact role..?!? What a film that would be!Kung-fu legend Carter Wong makes a memorable appearance as Thunder, one of the 3 Storms in what was probably his most widely seen role ever. He is joined by the wonderful Peter Kwong (as Rain) who would go on to star in The Golden Child, Ghost Rock with Michael Worth, and Albert Pyun's fantastically fun Brain Smasher: A Love Story. The last of the weather gods is played by the handsome James Pax who plays Lightning - the inspiration for the character Raiden in the mega-hit game, Mortal Kombat. James went on to star in US martial arts flick Shootfighter, as well as Hong Kong hits The Heroic Trio, Love Among The Triad, and Enemy Shadow with Jade Leung, as well as a brief appearance in Sammo Hung's successful Martial Law series. I must also note that Conan Lee pops up as an extra, filling in his time before heading back to Hong Kong to star in the brilliant Tiger On The Beat with Chow Yun Fat.Of course, we can't forget the real stars of the show - Victor Wong and James Hong. I thought Victor as Egg Shen was just wonderful. Wong is a great actor who has impressed with roles in The Last Emperor, Tremors, The Golden Child, and even in Eric Tsang's Fatal Vacation. Just as you couldn't imagine anyone else but Robert Downey Jnr play Tony Stark, the same can be said for the great James Hong as super villain David Lo Pan, a menacing, creepy and hilarious evil Chinese sorcerer who just nails it. Hong has over 400 credits to his name working in the industry from the 1950's on many film and TV shows including Kung Fu, Ninja III: The Domination, the Kung Fu Panda series, and even directed a handful of films including the wonderful horror comedy, The Vineyard...While watching the interviews on the bonus features of the release, it was nice to see John Carpenter himself mention the same things I thought didn't work for the film. Obviously with studio pressure, he had to bow down to a few things that he didn't agree on with the biggest one being that god-awful monster that appears for no reason. I thought Beast Man had walked off the set of Masters Of The Universe and ended up in Lo Pan's lair. It just didn't make any sense really, nor did its re-appearance in the final shot of the film leading you to believe it was an important enough addition to warrant a sequel.But minor gripes aside, Big Trouble In Little China has aged quite well. The soundtrack by Carpenter is just as memorable as the witty one-liners and fun action sequences. I'd be surprised if any fans of Hong Kong action cinema - or action cinema in general - haven't already seen it. If not, do yourself a favour and grab the Arrow Video BD as soon as to see the film in its best presentation yet!Overall: One of my all-time favourite childhood movies, that still proves as highly entertaining today!",Big Trouble in Little China
100,tomimt,Intentionally campy,7,7 March 2006,"Adjust your brains before watching Big Trouble In Little China; see it's one of those films, that, even tough nicely directed, are openly very silly in every aspect.

The purpose would be to get the truck and the girl back. Oh, and to but more twist in it a lawyer Gracie (Kim Cattrall) gets kidnapped too.There is something intentionally bad about the creatures used in the film. It all seems to be so intentionally planned as a B movie, that you can only give kudos to director John Carpaneter for making the film this way. He could have tried to turn this porridge into something serious, but luckily he didn't and the campy values of the film give it a nice layer of comedy.Sure, it's not the greatest film ever conceived, but if you take it as it is, you won't be disappointed with it.",Big Trouble in Little China

103,Min111,A magical movie between the forces of good and evil,8,29 October 2014,"Big Trouble in Little China is a cult classic! a film which was made in the eighties. This film has everything - fantasy, adventure, action and even comedy.It worked really well together. Yeah! there are those that can't stand this film because let's face it, films such as Big Trouble in Little China are not for everybody, but the majority like this film at least in terms of entertainment value. So, if you haven't seen it yet, then this is a film I advise you to see.The main star of this film is Kurt Russell! who played the character Jack Burton. Jack Burton (Kurt) is a guy that owns a truck and one day decides to take his friend to the airport to pick-up his girlfriend. But problems arise as a gang of thieves kidnap his friend's girlfriend, and Kurt along with his friend are on a mission to track and get her back. Unknowingly, Jack is in a magical battle between the forces of good and evil in Little Chinatown, something he's finding very hard to believe. Jack must not only help find and getting back the kidnapped woman, but take on the bad guys, especially the evil sorcerer known as Lo Pan.Kurt Russell is the one that made this film an instant success and Big Trouble in Little China is probably one of his best films. Surprisingly! the film didn't do well at box office, but it still became a popular film.Personally, its one of my favourites, and you could watch this film again and again, yet still not get bored, due to the shear entertainment and value it brings.The great thing about this movie was that it was entertaining from start to finish. It just gets even more entertaining as the film moves along, and that's what I like about Big Trouble in Little China. Not many movies are like that these days.A sequel would've been nice, and I say that not only because it was a very good film, but it had such an open-ending too. What happened to Jack?There are many cult classics out there, and Big Trouble in Little China is one of them, but this is one of my favourite cult classics there is.",Big Trouble in Little China
104,Antagonisten,Good fun,7,9 October 2006,"I have to admit that I'm no big fan of John Carpenter. His movies always have the B-movie taste to them that somehow most of the time rubs me the wrong way, like he's not even trying. But sometimes, once in a great while, he manages to make that B-movie thing work. The result is highly entertaining, not least because you can tell he's having a lot of fun.I would probably rate this movie and ""Escape from New York"" as Carpenters best work. Not only are they solid fun, they are also well made for their time and budget constraints. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" has some pretty good special effects all things considered. And having watched the movie something like fifteen times when i was younger, it stands the test of time surprisingly well when i watch it today. Other than the effects the main attractions are Kurt Russels overblown hero, the quite massive amount of surprisingly good martial arts action and all the freaky characters. Mainly though what saves the experience is the constant tongue-in-cheek feeling.I'm sure that younger people may not find this movie that exciting. But for me having watched it for the first time when i was maybe 11-12 years old, this is pure nostalgia. And like i said above, it's nostalgia that unlike so many other things hasn't lost all of it's shine. Saying ""i wished they would make movies like this nowadays"" makes me feel too old though so i won't say it. But movies that don't take themselves too seriously have always attracted me, and this is a bullseye in that department. Recommended!",Big Trouble in Little China
105,oOoBarracuda,Big Trouble in Little China,3,5 December 2016,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is to Alfred Hitchcock what Big Trouble in Little China is to John Carpenter. I was flabbergasted to learn that the director I thought of strictly as a horror director actually had an action/adventure comedy under his belt. John Carpenter directed Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall Big Trouble in Little China in 1986. Big Trouble in Little China tells the story of an American truck driver who gets roped into a mythical Chinese battle. John Carpenter directing an action film was enough to bring a film to my attention, even if I was not especially fond of the genre.Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) accompanies a friend to the airport when he arrives in SanFransisco. Jack's friend is smitten by this woman and the only thing he knows about her is that she is Chinese and has green eyes. Upon her arrival to the airport, the two men see that she is kidnapped by a Chinese street gang. When they chase after the girl, they realize that a Chinese sorcerer is responsible for her kidnapping. This sorcerer has existed for more than 2000 years and does not require a body to occupy space. In order to retrieve his physical being, the sorcerer must marry a Chinese woman with green eyes. Jack teams up with a lawyer he meets, Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall) who agrees to assist him during his quest through the underground portion of Chinatown. Encountering new mythic hurdles at every turn, Jack has his work cut out for him in Little China.As noted, a curiosity of John Carpenter making a non-horror film is the only thing that brought me to Big Trouble in Little China. I haven't seen much of Kurt Russell's work, and there's nothing in this film to endear him to me any further. Granted there is enough comedy in this film to make sense, but Kurt Russell's over-the-top comedic performance was hammy, to say the least. One bright spot was the sound in this film. It could be only because it was an 80's film, but Big Trouble in Little China sounded very much like a John Carpenter film. There's not too much to take away from Big Trouble in Little China, unless you're a massive John Carpenter fan and commit to see everything he's ever made. I wish I could remember who told me I wouldn't like this, I'd like to let them know they were right.",Big Trouble in Little China

The ham-bone acting may have actually helped.Kurt's the prototype trucker helping a Chinese buddy meet his girlfriend. She gets grabbed by a local gang of creeps. Start the fight music guys.Kurt does what looked like an overdone 'Duke' Wayne impersonation. He seemed to be laughing along with us though. Kim Catrall's role, as cool as it was, was a long way from 'Sex And The City.' And Dennis Dun was absolutely brilliant as the Chinese lead.You have a mix of Martial Arts and Fantasy here. And Johnny C. mixed it to a crispy perfection. The critics were a bit unfair here. It's obvious they took it too seriously. Carpenter himself said he didn't feel the suits really read the script before it got made. Hence their hesitation to back it 100% Most of the cast were real Martial Artists doing there own stunts. Al Leong, a mainstay in flicks like this, needs speaking roles occasionally. And big Carter Wong might be familiar to those who like Chinese Kung-Fu films. I wonder if he can really speak English though.Got the new life in video. Thankful for that.

I know this falls under the heading of ""Unpopular Movie Opinions"" but I really don't think Kurt Russell was ever that great. And I still haven't forgiven him for THE BEST OF TIMES and CAPTAIN RON. So, Russell running around with a mullet in a tank top and his jeans tucked into his ridiculous boots doesn't do a thing for me. Part of me could embrace the silliness of this movie, the way Carpenter and all the actors seem to. The cheesy special effects and synth-y score, the nutty stunts and goofy plot. But the other part of me couldn't get past the stupidity of it, like the clumsy exposition, shitty one-liners and unappealing leads. Kim Cattrall might be somewhat cute, but in every other respect she's a zero. And of course there's Russell. I just don't dig him. I'm definitely on the fence about this movie. There are ways that it's purposefully bad for fun, and there are ways that it's trying to be fun but are actually bad.

Since the girl has green eyes, Lo Pan can become young again by marrying her.  Russell and co. must endure tons of life threatening situations as they find their way through the hidden world underneath the streets of San Franciso's Chinatown.  Lo Pan's cohorts are after them, and being affiliated with a sorcerer, they have powers all their own.  Characters such as Rain, Thunder and Lightning, who can fly and know martial arts, are constantly battling Russell and his gang.  It's a bit unclear as to why they aren't just killed, but only tied up or blindfolded and locked into a room.  Also, it's never really explained who Lo Pan is or his origin, but the key for me in any movie is pacing, and this thing zips by nicely.  The beginning is great as we're introduced to Russell as the egotistical hero, then plunged right into the action during a scene at an airport.  The rest of the cast is great, Kattrall as the cute female lead, Hong is a hoot as Lo Pan, appearing at several different ages and types of make-up, Wong as the unfazed smart-ass Egg-Shenn, and despite what some others said, I thought Dennis Dun (Wang) was a decent enough actor.  But it's no doubt that Russell is the star, with his sarcastic line readings, such as Dun telling him ""My destiny rests in your capable hands,"" to which he responds annoyed, ""Hey, I'll do my best"".  Or when he refers to the powerful, dangerous Lo Pan as simply ""Dave"".  The only thing that brings this down from perfection is the two over-extended fight scenes at the front and end of the film.  They go on WAY too long and are so chaotic that they make your head spin.  I mean, if I had to watch Dun and that one guy leap into the air and slam their swords together as they fly across the room one more time, I wouldda screamed.  Aside from that, this is just pure, mindless fun, with a terrific end credits song written and performed (except for vocals) by director Carpenter, that's become one of my favorite tunes over the years.  He uses his trademark synthesizers, also incorporating some traditional Chinese music sounds along with a great beat.  And despite a set-up for a sequel, there has yet to be a return of Jack Burton and the Pork Chop Express.  Which may be good, as it would be tough to top what they cranked out here, one of the better adventure films over the years.",Big Trouble in Little China
109,hellholehorror,Very recommended,10,1 October 2017,This should have been called Big Adventure in Little China as this is all about the Chinese fun adventure time. It is complete hokum but it is enjoyable and entertaining hokum. The acting is pretty over-board as well as the green magical special effects but the whole atmosphere makes this movie a joy to watch. I'm Chinese and I don't even want to believe it. Very recommended. The fantastic thing about this is the culture clash between the loud-mouth American and Chinese subtlety. With green explosions.,Big Trouble in Little China
110,DavidSim240183,It's all in the reflexes!,8,12 August 2008,"There's a scene in Big Trouble in Little China where one of the characters likens their situation to Alice in Wonderland. And you can imagine that's exactly how John Carpenter pitched the idea to the studios back in 1986. The surface world of Chinatown is used as the drop-off point for an even wackier world beneath the surface. Just like Alice down the rabbit-hole.But Big Trouble in Little China was a film that still must have been difficult to sell. One of the film's taglines highlights this by showing what a wide variety of clashing styles it has, ""a Mystical, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Kung Fu, Monster, Ghost Story!"" Not surprisingly, the film baffled audiences and critics of the time who just couldn't handle the sensory overload of John Carpenter's vision, and it died a quiet death at the box-office.But much like Donnie Darko, it didn't take long for the film to become a cult classic. Its not one of the great John Carpenter films. Not like The Thing or Halloween. But its a little difficult not to get swept away by the energy of Carpenter's direction, or the enthusiasm of Kurt Russell.If Russell was channelling Clint Eastwood in Escape From New York, this time its John Wayne. Russell has an absolute ball as Jack Burton, a grizzled, devil-may-care truck driver who gets caught in the middle of an evil warlord's plans for immortality beneath the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown. Jack is more likely to trip over his own bootlaces than face down a kung fu ninja. But he's the only hope a beautiful bride has before she gets sacrificed to Lo Pan (James Hong), a 2000 year old sorcerer.Big Trouble in Little China is definitely one of John Carpenter's slighter films. It falls quite a bit short of classic status. But then again, Carpenter hasn't made a bona fide classic since The Thing, his finest film. Still, even lesser fare from John Carpenter is much better than what passes nowadays for Hollywood entertainment. The film has enough of an offbeat sense of humour to paper over any of the cracks in the screenplay. Carpenter is so good at what he does that you may even ignore the film's utter lack of a plot.Besides there is something appealing to the film's idea. Anyone who's ever been to a Chinatown will know that visiting one is like entering a world unto itself. So its not really that much of a stretch to imagine another world sharing that one as well. But a world of magic and make-believe. In spite of the bizarre ideas that pop up throughout the film, BTILC works because its impossible for John Carpenter to make a bad film.In everything he makes (even lesser films) Carpenter shows his complete mastery of the film-making process. The action scenes are just as breathless and kinetic as anything in Escape From New York. His direction moves full steam ahead from one lively setpiece to the next. And best of all, Carpenter composes another of his trademark theme tunes, in this case an energetic rock score that backs up the action brilliantly.In later films, John Carpenter has seemed a little intimidated when working with bigger budgets. Which may explain they're decline in quality. Don't forget, he started out in low-budget film-making, where he always impressed with his ability to turn out magnificent films from the flimsiest budgets. BTILC has quite a modest budget, and is one of the rare occasions where he seems quite comfortable with it. The special effects he directs are stunning for the time. Especially an amazingly lifelike blob of eyes. And the fight scenes are dazzling and choreographed on an epic scale. Perhaps his enjoyment for the film overrode his fears.The film has a constant sense of humour too. Just about everything is played for laughs. And the film gets a lot of its mileage from the sheer knockabout energy Carpenter plays to the hilt. He was wise to bring in his old friend Kurt Russell. The two have worked together many times. Nobody can get a great performance out of Kurt Russell the way John Carpenter can. And this is one of his very best. Its a witty reversal of what we normally expect from the lantern jawed All-American hero, where instead of rushing into battle dispatching bad guys with barely a misstep, Russell knocks himself out with his own bullets. He's an incompetent (anti)hero, too full of his own bravado to realise how useless he is.Russell swaggers his way through the film to great effect. Never has he had such fun in a role. Not even as Snake Plissken. His deadpan John Wayne impression is so funny that his every line of dialogue is guaranteed to have you in tears. Also, despite all the chaos going on around him with damsels in distress and evil magicians, you're left with the sneaking suspicion that he's more interested in being reunited with his beloved truck than he is in saving the day. Up against him, a young Kim Cattrall seems rather blank. She looks a bit mystified by all this, like she doesn't understand the film she's in. As if she was on her way to the set of Sex and the City, and stumbled onto the set of BTILC by mistake.Big Trouble in Little China is hardly a John Carpenter classic. But it is a lot of fun. The enjoyment Carpenter and Russell are having is very infectious. And even if it tanked with audiences in its day, the video/DVD markets have assured the film a place in the cult catalogue. As it should. This is a film that gets by on sheer fun alone. It will leave your sides aching for hours afterwards.",Big Trouble in Little China
111,Idocamstuf,Kurt Russell and great special effects make this movie awesome,7,5 March 2003,"This is another one of those films that I have wanted to see for a long time because I love Kurt Russell, and Im into the chinese culture.  I was not one bit disapointed.  Kurt Russell is perfect for Jack Burton, I heard the robotic Peter Weller was slated to play the role, but im glad they chose Kurt, no offense to Peter.  The special effects were great as well, and so was all of the martial arts.  Overall this is a very fun movie.  **** out of *****",Big Trouble in Little China
112,blackmamba99971,What a great thrill ride,10,6 October 2010,"This was John Carpenters best work. Using more open spaces rather than the confining on stage studio look. Jack Burton (Kurt Russel) is just your average Joe who trucks in for the local china town restaurant's. A gambler off duty and a good friend to one local who doesn't like the fact he always wins. Yet in the midst of this friendly chaos, lies a demon who needs a girl to make himself whole again. And Jack's friends girl friend is that girl. This takes Jack in all sorts of directions from a street rumble which shows a rather unique martial arts display to a sorcerer who has hired guns called the three storms. Now knee deep in dark magic, and other types of folk lore, Jack must help rescue this girl from an ultimate sacrifice. But in the back ground lies Egg Shen (Victor Wong) who is a long time rival of this demon, and his help causes a turn around to the groups luck. Using all sorts of magic and sorcery. This film held every aspect of action, magic, tales of the old, and a reluctant truck driver who just says, What the hell, to make this movie very watchable. The only thing wrong with it is Gracie Law (Kim Cattral). Her persona does not fit this role, too mushy in some ways, and not all bad girl type. I would say a woman who could have filled her shoes would be Debra Winger. She has a way with her attitude and no nonsense hand of getting things done. A great movie from a great director, John Carpenter. It would be really nice to have a second instalment to make this show even more of a classic.",Big Trouble in Little China
113,drpainters,True classic,8,19 September 2021,"Such a good 80s movie. Def worth the multiple viewings and owning. Waiting for ideally a 4k copy, but plenty of cheesy things, action, laughs. If you haven't seen it yet, stop what your doing and enjoy. Your welcome.",Big Trouble in Little China
114,supertom-3,Great Fun!,9,9 January 2005,"Ah the 80's! The action movies you could get your hands on back then. The sheer volume of action men to choose from, whether it was the full time action men like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Lundgren, Norris, or part timers like Gibson and Kurt Russell. Now looking back I always felt Kurt Russell followed the trend of charismatic everyman heroes that Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis did most successfully in Die Hard and Lethal Weapon. However the rogue charmster in the conventional action movie was not really started by Gibson or Willis and I always need to remind myself that the marginally less famous Kurt Russell did in fact beat them both to it. Russell starred in a fair few action spectaculars in the 80,s. His most famous being Escape From New York and also his team up with Stallone in Tango And Cash. Interestingly, a solid year before Lethal Weapon and 3 years before Die Hard, Russell starred in this enjoyable little number. An action/fantasy combining effects with martial arts from director John Carpenter. This was one of the seemingly innumerable teams up of the two.BTILC Is an immensely fun film. The plot is simple and brainless while the script is crammed with humour, and enough fist fights and fantastical situations to keep even ADD sufferers happy. Kurt gets caught up in a Chinese gang war that is right in the middle of an evil ghost megalomaniacs search for a green eyed bride to make him whole again and all powerful. The film holds no surprises but it has a sense of fantasy and imaginative production film as packaging for a routine action film. Kurt Russell is good and while this is a film that doesn't do anything to silence the few niggly critics he has against his acting chops, it does show him in good light for an action man. Russell is reliable, as is Willis and Gibson. Now these folk try to at least do more mature fare, but back in the day when dumb movies like this were reliant upon a strong lead, with the quipping and the biceps, Russell was a good bet. We know Gibson, Russell and Willis can act given the chance but in a film like this, who cares? As long as they deliver zingers while running and shooting and the director competently handles the action, as Carpenter does, then I'm happy. As well as Russell there is a pre- Sex And The City Kim Cattrall who in this period was reliable eye candy for mid range films like this. Cattrall has green contact lenses in this and initially when I saw it I thought her character was blind because of the vacant stare she seemed to have. Cattrall is sexy, although in truth not as gorgeous as she is now in her mid-40's.Now as an action lover and buff, this film has a real geek factor to it. It's a bursting at the seems with Chinese henchmen for hire, who have died at the hands of your Arnies, Slys and Lundgrens over the years. Usually appearing briefly to die. Now to casual review readers, when I say Al Leong, you'll think: ""Wha?! Who?!"" However you would certainly recognise his face if you've seen more than two American action movies. That goes for appearances by other recognisable faces, James Lew, Conan Lee, George Cheung, Jeff Imada, Eric Lee and Gerald Okamura. More scratching of heads I hear but I guarantee watching this film, you'll spot a dozen faces in the background who you've seen in countless American action films, from big movies right down to DTV fodder. The same goes for lead villain, the legendary James Hong, who has appeared in more films than you can comprehend, including Blade Runner. I have to say there was one moment where the action geek inside me was jumping for joy at the sheer spectacle of the moment and that was the brief face off between James Lew and Al Leong in one of the battle scenes.Anyway, this is a film you can't fail to enjoy. It's pure entertainment and a testament to the enjoyably simple films that made careers for the Arnies of this world. ***",Big Trouble in Little China
115,p-jonsson,Quite entertaining if you take it for what it really is...a comedy.,7,17 September 2014,"I think this movie was marketed as an adventure movie when it came out. I can imagine that some people were disappointed if they were indeed expecting a real adventure movie. I remember being one of those people when I first saw this movie.However, if you approach it seeing what it is, that is a comedy or at least an action-comedy, then it is actually a quite enjoyable movie. The entire movie is utterly ridiculous. The screaming, posturing martial art champion parodies especially so.Everything in this movie makes you laugh as long as you do not try to take the movie seriously. The action scenes are often absolutely hilarious. They are also quite well done and choreographed actually. The special effects are of course utterly outdated but they are good enough for this movie.There is a story as well but it doesn't really matter much. It is just there to tie the funny scenes together, especially the action scenes. Acting? Well, let's just say that it matches the comic nature of the movie.I actually just picked this movie as a trial experience in using Netflix (which finally came to France last Monday) on my PS3 for the first time and I did not want to start something were I would be (censored) if it turned out that it stopped working halfway through. I have to say that I had much more fun watching this movie this time than the first time I was watching itand Netflix worked perfectly on my PS3.",Big Trouble in Little China
116,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,14 February 2005,"John Carpenter creates another piece of brilliant cinema with this, a mix of action, horror and comedy. The tension and violence is still here, as with the mysterious characters and sharp story-telling, but this time it's aimed at perhaps a younger audience. Or at least, he is not trying to be shocking or make us terrified. This was Carpenter's golden age, when he ensured he would not be seen as a one-hit indie wonder.Kurt Russell (who else) plays trucker/gambler Jack Burton, a man who just wants to get the job done, get paid and go. His latest job takes him to Chinatown where he meets old friend Wang Chi. They go together to pick up Chi's fiancée from the airport, but she is mysteriously kidnapped by gang members. Local reporter Gracie Law gets involved and they look for the girl. Soon they uncover a deadly and magical plot that sees the ancient Lo Pan intending to become all-powerful once he marries a girl with green eyes- Chi's fiancée. Jack and Chi gather together an army of ninjas and travel into the underground and underworld to rescue the girl and stop Lo Pan. This will not be easy as Lo Pan's powers are growing, and he seems to be immortal. His three henchmen Thunder, Lightning and Rain also seem to be unstoppable. Soon a massive battle breaks out with monsters, magic, martial arts, ninjas, swords etc in a classic struggle between good and evil.Although the film's main draw is the action and sorcery, the script is also exceptional, dripping with cool. Russell gets all the one-liners, delivering them with wit. His character has no idea what is going on, but deals with it, Cattral is very good as Law, Dun tries to be serious to comic effect (in a good way), and Hong is outstanding as the evil Lo Pan, indulging in the comedy of the story and character. Wong also does well. It is meant to look like it wasn't made for millions by Hollywood suits, and succeeds in every way. Carpenter is not only a master of tension, but a master of excitement and comedy too.9 out of 10",Big Trouble in Little China

120,jayjaycee,"""Is it an homage or a parody?"" - ""Yes!""",7,7 May 2020,"""Big Trouble In Little China"" is a 1986 fantasy action film written and directed by John Carpenter starring Kurt Russell and Kim Cattrall. It is commonly known that the director who also famously bears the title of being the master of horror is an unsociable introvert who prefers to make films with a limited budget and with only a handful of actors and actresses that he considers as friends and acquaintances. Aside from his former wife Adrienne Barbeau and veteran actor and friend Donald Pleasence, his most frequent collaborator is Kurt Russell. With a total of five films they have produced a lot of films of which the most remain beloved cult classics to this day. I personally have watched the top three of this list already, but except for the alien psychological horror film ""The Thing"" I haven't reviewed them yet. It has been something I wanted to catch up on anyway and after seeing that this this 1986 flick and third cooperation between Carpenter and Russell ranks up above in the list of a buddy from down under I thought it was time to rewatch and this time review it. Well, what am I to say? Even though it is no flawless masterpiece to me, I still take a liking to it, nevertheless. It obviously is a typical Carpenter flick and manifests the same characteristics that made all his films so uniquely iconic. First, we have an extremely likable protagonist that is almost impossible to dislike in any reasonable way. Jack Burton, a truck driver, and self-declared amateur radio show host is the loveable protagonist of this crazy trip into pure madness. From his white tank-top and stylish mullet to his semiautomatic handgun he embodies everything an iconic hero needs. The journey he involuntarily embarks on is not less iconic and with out a doubt pure madness. ""What is this film's genre, actually?"" is one of the questions I asked myself when I watched it for the first time roughly one year ago and all I can really answer is ""Yes"". JC created one of the wildest genre mixes of all time and combines several genres in this movie, but the two main ingredients of this flick are fantasy and action. Aside from this, he put in a pinch of comedy, martial arts flick, horror and romance and also a lot of adventure film. A new term needs to be invented to properly describe the nature of this film and that is what makes it so weirdly unique. I mean, what is not included in this flick? You got human incarnation of storms, black magic and all other kinds of sorcery, exaggerated fight choreographies and shootouts, creature horror and even lots of instances of slapstick humour. This film is the equivalent of a surprise bag and offers something for everyone. To be bored by this film and escape its undertow of oddity is almost impossible. The story is another thing that leaves you wondering what you just watched afterwards. Basically, the film depicts the desire of a trucker who wants to retrieve his vehicle after it was stolen by the local gang during an altercation with their arch enemies, but the more the film proceeds the more absurd it becomes. Right after three strangely dressed men with questionably large heads (that make Raiden from ""Mortal Kombat"" look like a cosplayer) descent from the sky and wave their hands around while presenting their weapons and abilities I knew I was in for absolute abstrusity. What makes this film so much fun is how Burton reacts to everything and everyone - he remains sceptical and sarcastic throughout and the only thing he wants back is his beloved truck. He becomes a hero against his own will and unwittingly gets caught in something he was never supposed to experience and his acting and reactions are what gives this film a specific flair of deliberate self-awareness. Yes, it doesn't take itself quite seriously and that the movie's greatest advantage. In terms of performances the movie offers a lot, both positive and negative. Russel is pure virility and charisma, Dennis Dun shows that he is experienced in martial arts and James Hong probably gives his most hilarious performance as the main antagonist Lo Pan. The only performance I disapprove must be Cattrall's. Even though she is stunning and charming in her own way, I couldn't help but realizing that she is extremely overacting and awkward most of the time. Fortunately, she wasn't in the focus and that made it tolerable. The actors of the three storms though are another issue, as they are cringe worthy as hell, but I think that is the general flair of the film that is intended. It is undeniable that the film also is a clash of two cultures, as it combines the roughness of the American action film with the elegance of the Chinese martial arts film. That this interesting approach might result in a decent film is indeed possible (e.g. ""Rapid Fire"") and in this case the outcome is not bad either. Aside from the fact that the film takes place in Chinatown, San Francisco you can spot a lot of influences of Hong Kong films. One of course is the choreographies of this film that easily would have fit in a Bruce Lee flick, but there also countless homages and references to the legend himself. It relies on this inspiration a lot, but there is one thing that caught my attention as well: the execution. The more the film proceeded, the more I wondered if this film is an homage or already a parody. While some fights are realistic (in the context of such movies) there were also a lot of moments that were so overstated that it was hilarious. From characters doing thousands of backflips in one shot to a sword fight that seems to take place in midair, there are countless of scenes that made me feel embarrassed, but in a funny way. Yes, this film is truly absurd and explores Chinese lore and culture with immense respect, all the while ridiculing it to a certain degree. While the whole film consequently stays on the same level of entertainment, there is a minor discrepancy with the ending though. I think some things didn't fit the characters, while Jack Burton being useless in the final battle and missing most of the action due to his sheer clumsiness is kind of funny second, the seemingly immortal antagonists are defeated so easily. I mean, theye are forces of nature in human form, one is stabbed with a sword, one explodes into thousand pieces and one dies after being hit by Buddha statue. For enemies that were introduced to be some sort of God like creatures, that wasn't wrapped up correctly. On top of that, for Lo Pan, an ancient and powerful sorcerer who has lived for millennia, dying from a small knife to his head after no memorable fight was quite underwhelming. From a film that does everything in an exaggerated way, this conclusion did not fit in the concept that was previously used. All in all, this flick is pure eighties pleasure and goes full throttle in terms of entertainment. With a blend of several genres, caricatural characters and a moody synthesiser soundtrack, Carpenter managed to create another iconic fun flick that, despite some minor issues, justly remains a fan favourite. It is overstated, absurd and embarrassingly funny, but this is what makes it so extremely enjoyable. If you can embrace the sheer weirdness of this film, you are in for a ride. Otherwise, you will probably wonder what you have just watched. I for my part enjoy this clash of cultures a lot. It is not Carpenters best and unusual compared to his other films, but a decent watch, nevertheless. Also, it takes a lot of stupidity to reject a kiss from Kim Cattrall, right? I mean, come on, Burton!",Big Trouble in Little China

122,jcbutthead86,Another John Carpenter Classic And One Of His Best Films.,10,27 June 2012,"Big Trouble In Little China is another John Carpenter classic that brilliantly mixes Action,Comedy,Martial Arts,Kung Fu,Adventure,Sci-Fi,Fantasy,and Mystery making this a fun,unforgettable movie that you can watch again and again.Big Trouble In Little China tells the story of a wisecracking truck driver named Jack Burton(Kurt Russell) who comes to San Franciso,Chinatown visiting his friend Wang Chi(Dennis Dun).While visiting,Jack and Wang go to the airport to pick up Wang Chi's girlfriend Miao Yin(Suzee Pai),but things go bad when Miao Yin is kidnapped by thugs. This kidnapping sends Jack Burton into a bizarre world that he has never seen or experienced.Big Trouble In Little China is a great film that works on many levels and is a classic now,but was basically ignored and overlooked when it came out in 1986. At the time Asian Martial Arts and Kung Fu movies were not popular when BTILC was released,Bruce Lee was dead,Jackie Chan and Jet Li were not known by American audiences during that time,John Woo's Asian Action films were also not known by American moviegoers until a few years later and the only popular films at the time that had Kung Fu and Martial Arts in the them were Chuck Norris films and The Karate Kid movies and unfortunately audiences skipped out on this great film. But thanks to the critical and Box Office success of films such as The Matrix,Kill Bill and the Academy Award winning film Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,people have rediscovered BTILC and has become a Cult Classic and John Carpenter Classic and the reasons the film works is because of Carpenter's take on the Kung Fu and Martial Arts genres,the Jack Burton character and the amazing special effects. Carpenter loves Martial Arts and Kung Fu films and his take on the two genres is just great,while also mixing together mixing excellent Action and hilarious Comedy with Martial Arts and Kung Fu and doing it with a masterful stroke. Combing different genres in one film isn't easy but John Carpenter succeeds in creating one of the best genre mash-up films of all-time greatly combines all of those fantastic genres within 99 minutes meaning that even though the film mixes different genres and the plot of the movie can be a little complex at times,BTILC never becomes uneven or disjointed. Carpenter creates a world where Martial Arts and Fantasy are powerful and bigger than life,using powers and magic with great flight. The film also has great visual style,whether it's the gray clouds and the constant raining,production design or the ingenious special effects. The main characters in the film are truly hilarious and well-drawn,with most of the film's characters talking at a fast pace like a 1930s or 40s screwball Comedy with great memorable dialog. The film isn't a spoof,parody or send-up,but the characters are still funny and when the actors and characters play it straight it's even funnier. You can tell the actors were having fun making this film. Jack Burton is a funny and classic character because Burton sees himself as a man of Action,but each time makes himself look like a fool and it's great for laughs while trying to figure out what's going on. What also makes this film great is the reversal of the Action hero and the sidekick,where Jack's the sidekick and his friend Wang-Chi is the the real hero and man of Action with fighting and with Burton really being the sidekick and saying funny one-liners,this kinda thing wasn't done in 80s Action films and you can say that Jack Burton was a parody of the 80s Action hero which was unheard of at the time and one of the main things I love about the movie is the way it hilariously takes lots of familiar Action movie clichés and makes fun of them throughout the film. The Action and High flying scenes are great and filled with a lot of energy and pace and holds up well with no wires or cgi in the scenes making the Action look natural. This movie was a decade ahead of it's time and way before the Action and High flying style of The Matrix,Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon and Kill Bill. The special effects are great and in my opinion aged well and hold up well. The ending of the film is a classic Carpenter ending that is Action-packed and thrilling but is also shocking,surprising and very unexpected. I don't know if Carpenter was leaving the ending open for a sequel,but if he was I would've love to have seen more Adventures from the character Jack Burton.Kurt Russell is excellent and hilarious as Jack Burton,with Russell bringing great laughs and an amazing John Wayne impression. One of Russell's best and most iconic rolls. Kim Cattrall is brilliant as Gracie Law,Jack's love interest with Cattrall having great chemistry with Russell. Dennis Dun is wonderful as Wang Chi,Jack's friend and sidekick who's the real man of action. James Hong is delightful and over the top as the villain Lo-Pan,a sorcerer who wants to rule the universe. Victor Wong is terrific as Egg Shen,a sorcerer who's been after Lo-pan for years and helps out Jack and Wang Chi. Kate Burton(Margo)and Donald Li(Eddie Lee) give good performances in the film. Carter Wong(Thunder),Peter Kwong(Rain)and James Pax(Lightning)also do good in their roles as Lo-Pan's henchmen.John Carpenter's direction is amazing,with Carpenter giving the film a unique look and style to the film. Carpenter also does well with the Action,Comedy and fantasy scene and keeps the film moving at a fast pace. Great Direction,John.The score from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is great and adds to the light and fun feel of the film and I also love the film's theme song. This is one of Carpenter's best scores.In final word,If you love Action,Comedy,Fantasy,Martial Arts and Kung Fu films,I highly suggest you see Big Trouble In Little China,an Action-packed and hilarious classic that is John Carpenter and Kurt Russell at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Big Trouble in Little China
123,jakethesnake-42007,Over the top and silly and that's the point,8,8 March 2021,I'm surprised of how much I liked this film. I liked how the film never takes its self serious but at the same time it's not bad. The plot is enjoyable and it's fast paced the only problem for me is I found it dragged on at times at the end. The film is full of Adrian and laughs. You have to go into the movie not taking it serious and if you do you'll love it.,Big Trouble in Little China

Jack Burton is the greatest action hero of all time, and he doesn't care if the situation is cheesy cause he's going to kick butt one way or the other -- and he doesn't even care if he gets the girl, just as long as she can kiss good.  What a guy.Big Trouble in Little China is John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's satire on the action genre.  Not a serious moment flows in this film -- so if you take it seriously, you're not going to get it or enjoy it.  But if you have fun with it, and embrace Jack Burton for the hero you know he is -- and the hero you know you want to be, your going to love it.Flying blobs; hairy monkey monsters; magic potions; and oh yeah -- Jack Burton putting the smack down on any fool who dares to interrupt his famous one-liners.",Big Trouble in Little China

Not sure about Snake but I like him much more here. More human, more ""in his own world"". I think he might be doing Snake but in a comedic mood.The whole plot is ludicrous.

129,Mr_Censored,Big Fun,9,19 August 2009,"Directed by John Carpenter (""Halloween,"" ""The Thing"") and starring frequent collaborator, Kurt Russell, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" tells the tale of Jack Burton, a trucker who leads a normal and somewhat uneventful life. His only thrills in life are talking to his CB radio and petty gambling. All that changes, however, when his best friend's fiancé is kidnapped and he is thrust into the Chinatown underworld as an unlikely hero on a mission, perhaps for the sake of friendship or to ensure a pay-day. The film doesn't really make that part very clear. What is clear by the end of the film, however, is what a wild and strange ride you've just been through! As can be expected, all the John Carpenter trademarks are present in ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" even if the film itself is a departure from the director's previous work. From the signature score composed by Carpenter himself (along with Alan Howarth) to the stunning visuals (giant balls of green flame, anyone?) and the smooth pacing, all the right ingredients are there to make this a John Carpenter classic. Add in a knock-out performance by Kurt Russell as the hapless, reluctant hero, Jack Burton, and you've got one of the finest cult classics the 80's has to offer.Russell plays the blue-collar anti-hero almost too well, sporting a mullet and appropriate wardrobe to boot. While Burton may be a far-cry from the over-confident Snake Plissken (see: ""Escape from New York""), he is as interesting of a character, and is a stark and rather refreshing contrast to the often over-blown action heroes of the time. Perhaps that's why the film failed to make an impact when it first saw a release over 23 years ago. As it stands today, though, it's a film made by a confident director at the top of his game, with some wild ideas (which would ultimately bring his career crashing down a good decade or so later) and a brilliant leading man in Russell. The action, the fight sequences, the special effects and even the plot are just too much fun for one trip. The movie might not take itself too seriously, but make no mistake: John Carpenter means business with his film and Russell helps bring it to fruition in one of his finest two-hours. Truly, ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is pure fun, and is the kind of film you'll come back to again and again, a true classic in a league of its own.",Big Trouble in Little China
130,kingofdanerds,I wish I watched this film earlier in my life,10,16 April 2021,"John Carpenter is most widely known as a horror director. But, that is not always the case. He has directed non-Horror films like Dark Star, Assault on Precinct 13 and more famously Big Trouble in Little China. Big Trouble in Little China was released in 1986 and BOMBED hard. Mostly due in large part to the studio not advertising this film enough. Shame.... This caused Carpenter to go back to independent film making with Prince of Darkness in 1987. Big Trouble in Little China did get good reviews and even has become a cult classic since release. The film stars Kurt Russell (Escape from New York and The Thing), Kim Cattrall, and Dennis Dun (Prince of Darkness).Jack Burton is a trucker and while visiting with a friend in San Fransisco and his friend's fiance is kidnapped and it is up to them to rescue her. But it is more than just a simple kidnapping............I honestly do not want to give anything away here because Big Trouble in Little China is an awesome film. This is one of many films that I have been wanting to watch for many years. It is one of the films that the longer I wait the more I wonder, will the film live up to all of the hype? Well, this film does. I do not even know where to begin. What can be said is that this is a Hong Kong style B film that is loads of fun. The reason why Siskel and Ebert didn't like this film? Because they did not realize what it was supposed to be. It was all intentional. Yeah, I will admit, I did not quite understand it at first but I eventually did and I am glad that I did. John Carpenter is known as a horror director but this film shows how versatile he can be. There are elements of action, adventure, comedy, and yes even horror. Everything about it is a B movie. The acting is where it is most apparent with the story being a close second. But it is just loads of fun and allows for repeat viewings. I think the humor really sticks fairly well here. The humor always the film to become self aware of it's hilarity which makes it even more funny. Essentially it is satirical. For a film with everything that would typically not work, it somehow pulls it all off and works. John Carpenter does the soundtrack for this film and it is pretty kickass. I love the effects and set design as they do give this mystical type of feel. The film may be set in San Fransisco but I get a feeling that it was actually set in China thanks to the set design. I could go on, but this is just a film that one has to see for themselves.There are two types of people in this world. One being that they think this film is the best film of all time and the other being that they have not seen it. If you are the later, WATCH IT!!!",Big Trouble in Little China
131,oneflewovertheapocalypse,There Is No Film Like This,9,2 September 2003,"This has to still be the best fantasy action comedy ever, I can never see any film over powering this. I grew on Big Trouble in little China and to do this day it still pulls all the punches which Carpenter does not do anymore but at least we have this film to keep in our memories of his greatness including The Thing and Escape from New York.I showed it to my girlfriend not long ago because she is a big fan of fantasy films and I was sure that she would like it, but after it finished she said ""it was OK, not the classic you were rambling on about"", you can imagine my disbelief when she said that, I can tell you now she didn't get any that night, that's for sure. I just can't see how anybody can find a fault with his. Kurt Russell to this day is the most funniest actor I have seen in this type of film, pretending to be the hard man which he is but always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Forget Schwarzegger, forget Stallone and Van Damme, Kurt Russell was the action hero of the 80's, in my book he was.",Big Trouble in Little China
132,AwesomeWolf,Awesomeness,8,7 January 2005,"'Big Trouble in Little China' - Made in the 80s, directed by John Carpenter, and starring Kurt Russell. That's three signs of awesomeness before the movie even starts. John Carpenter has made some awesome movies, but 'Big Trouble in Little China' is his most awesome endeavor, even more awesome than 'Escape From New York'.Kurt Russell stars as Jack Burton, a truck driver who finds him way over his head when he ends up against David Lo Pan (James Hong), both a ""little old basket case on wheels"" and a ""ten foot tall roadblock"". It is up to Jack to rescue his friend's fiancé from Lo Pan, and lead the good guys in a battle that has been centuries in the making. Awesome.'Big Trouble in Little China' is another of those movies that represent pure awesomeness. An intentional B-movie, it is hilarious and action-packed. Burton is just an average truck driver, the only character in the whole movie who has absolutely no clue as to whats going, while every other character, no matter how random (and some of them are pretty random), seems to know exactly whats happening. Top this off with some of the best quotes ever, and you have the awesomeness that is 'Big Trouble in Little China'.8/10 - Check it out if you like John Carpenter, or fantasy, or Kurt Russell, or martial arts, or b-movies, or all things awesome.",Big Trouble in Little China
133,blakiepeterson,A Mildly Successful Adventure Comedy,6,13 August 2015,"There's no such thing as a present-day John Wayne, but ""Big Trouble in Little China"", a mildly successful adventure comedy, provides good argument for why Kurt Russell could be considered a present-day John Wayne, if you imagine Russell in the 1980s and if the present day is, cough cough, 1986. He's got the look, the money, the power; his manner of speak, drawling, unwaveringly masculine, suggests more heroic brawn than quick-witted brains. But we like him anyway: he's an all-American hero who takes himself much too seriously. There probably isn't a better type of movie hero, unless we're talking about an unheard of one like Lisbeth Salander. Then we're talking.For now, though, I'll settle (sporadically, that is) for the bonkers fun of ""Big Trouble in Little China"", which is partially a comedy, an action movie, a kung-fu flick, a distant cousin of ""Indiana Jones"", a labyrinthine fantasy. It's uneven to say the least (we can agree that the action is terrific, yes, but what about the film's all-too-obvious inability to develop its characters?), but there is plenty of enjoyment to be had, so long as you leave your logic and bitterness at the door and turn the word improbable into likely. Because ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is like ""Danger: Diabolik"" — you either figure it to be ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" worthy or an irresistible exercise in pulp insanity. Personally, I'd go with the former.Much of the ruckus in San Francisco's Chinatown has to do with Jack Burton (Kurt Russell), a quasi-macho truck driver who finds himself in a pit of trouble after his best friend's (Dennis Dun) green-eyed fiancée (Suzee Pai) is kidnapped by a Chinese gang. The gang, however, isn't your run-of-the-mill pack of bandits looking for trouble because it's fun — they, in actuality, are the henchman of Lo Pan (James Hong), an ancient sorcerer seeking marriage to a green-eyed Chinese girl in order to bring his aging body back to youthful flesh and blood.Fortunately, the film doesn't sabotage itself with unneeded side plots or drivel pieces of dialogue needed to explain outrageous events. It's a chase movie with Hong Kong action movie instincts, going out to save a kidnapped girl and concluding by saving the said girl. The supernatural elements of ""Big Trouble in Little China"" are entertaining in a low-budget, 1940s B-movie kind of way, and the fight sequences are impressively choreographed. John Carpenter, having a ball, keeps things visually scrumptious, the tone matching in its manic gusto. Russell is perfect for this kind of material, charmingly bumbling, crafty when it comes to quick escapes and logistical battle tactics. Funny is the way Dennis Dunn's kung- fu master character is the real hero of the movie, though Russell, being 1986's present-day John Wayne, is too big-headed to notice. Kim Cattrall makes for a spunky love interest.But I suppose ""Big Trouble in Little China""'s biggest problem is how weightless it is, how nothing feels as though things are really at stake. Because the screenplay develops its characters by introducing them and not much else, we hardly get to know them, deciding who we like simply based on the power of their one-liners. The plot is rather been-there- done-that, despite the masterful telling of it all, and the supporting performances from Lo Pan and company are never quite campy enough to shape them into the Bond-esque villains they set out to be. But no matter. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is meant to be lightweight action fantasy, and, for the most part, it succeeds. Just don't expect anything other than Russell's classic heroism to stick around in your head.",Big Trouble in Little China
134,ozjeppe,An offensively bad ride through the toy store.,2,18 June 2014,"In the happy, garish '80s you could get away with a lot in the movies. ""Big Trouble in Little China"" does indeed all it can to do just that. The result is a tiresome, juvenile joyride through the toy store minus the joy.Kurt Russell plays smug truck driver Jack Burton, who makes a stop in San Francisco's Chinatown to visit his friend Wang. Accompanied by Jack, Wang goes to meet his childhood sweetheart at the airport, only to see her get abducted by Chinese gangsters. The hunt for her leads to a gang war, which in turn leads to a showdown in the underworld of Chinese black magic, mythical reincarnation curses and various Kung Fu fights. Oh, did I forget to mention drooling fur monsters in corridors, hovering spy brains with faces and characters named Lo Pan and Egg Shen?Filmmaker John Carpenter (a hero from my youth!) was at his best doing low-budget horror or thrillers. That made him both interesting, creative, and sometimes a master of creating tension and atmosphere - especially with its own scripts. He is not the writer here, and doing action comedy on a large, noisy scale with various supernatural ingredients thrown into the wok, is just not his thing. With a big monetary budget bag in his hand, he becomes a boisterous nine-year-old running through the toy store, buying one colorful balloon and Chinese firecracker after another – only to pop and shoot them off inside the store, while cheering. Continuously. It's sad to see an old hero making a fool of himself like that.I try to set my mind into harmless, playful entertainment-mode. But this is so cheaply written, deftless, desperate and dumb that I only get dejected and tired. There is no balance, finesse or wow-factor in the action-, chase- or fight scenes. They just keep crashing into one another like an endless set-up of bowling pins. Sometimes the fur-monkey-monster pops up. There is a lot of running, stumbling and yelling in corridors plus a bit of diving in indoor pools. One of the bad guys has the inexplicable ability to inflate himself until he explodes (!). And perhaps most sadly: it's simply not funny, only embarrassingly low-brow. If one wanted to find a mitigating circumstance, one could pull up the Tongue-in-Cheek-excuse or The Huge Campy- card. But for that to work, it takes smartness in the comic material. Here, I laugh once. And that's in a sigh saying: ""What IS this mess?!"" Alternately, it's like watching an extended Scooby Doo cartoon on speed (I'm tempted to write Chinese opium but that's more of a downer) with about the same amount of character development. In any case, this is offensively bad. Or maybe it IS made for nine-year-olds watching Scooby Doo? Nope, as it probably has one too many a knife in the head/broken elbow for that target group.Kurt Russell might be doing a pastiche of his previous tough guys Snake Plissken (Escape from New York) or MacReady (The Thing), but why not have a clear nod to those cult characters, like a black eye patch falling off, or something? His Jack Burton is just a charmless, impotent John Wayne-impersonator in cowboy boots who is not even given good lines. He drives a truck called ""The Pork Chop Express"" ... while chewing embarrassing clichés over his two-way radio. Kim Cattrall as the woman in distress/ love-interest is squeezed into the story so fast that there isn't a chance to buy the potentially mandatory romance even for a moment. Russell's unexpected final rejection is a bit liberating, though.Is there anything good to be found? Well, we have very stylish set designs and pretty okay special effects. But what good is that, when we have a terrible script, cacophony-action and characters that I don't give two cents about? There is a nostalgic expression in the world of film: ""They don't make 'em like They Used to"". Sometimes that fact is very reassuring.2 out of 10 from ozjeppe.",Big Trouble in Little China

Great funny characters but dialog is too fast paced at times and I found myself really cringing at the 3 chinese powered villains.Cgi/special affects:
Amazing fight scenes especially in the beginning. People just get insanely beaten up or killed with whatever they have lying around it's great. The mythical characters look a little bad but it's very acceptable for the era. The CGI is actually really damn good for this era as well. Even 34 years later it still holds up amazing.Story:
The plot was pretty crazy and very interesting. You feel like your on a roller coaster ride and it feels immersive. Theres lots of funny moments here and there and it fills the tension well. The big downside for me was most of the kung fu like noises/cable fights and other cheesy bogus that really took away from the immersive setting. however it was still interesting from start to finish and it had a lovely ending.Summary:
Not the best film by john carpenter but it was a real fun watch. If you can look past cheesy, goofy kung fu. Then you should enjoy what this movie brings. It was fun and good but not great 6.5/10 for me.",Big Trouble in Little China
137,LuboLarsson,Great Action-Comedy,8,11 May 2002,"Viewed as what it is a tongue in cheek action-comedy, this film really is a treat. Kurt Russell is great as the ""hero"" of the film, that is he thinks he's a hero, but really he's a bit of an idiot! Thats where the humour comes in, and Kurt is great as this sort of character, similar to the one he played in Tango and Cash. This film was directed by John Carpenter, back when he made decent films i.e before around 1987. This isn't as good as Russell and Carpenters films like Escape from New York or The Thing but then it's a diffrent sort of film. The martial arts in the film is superbly done and that plus the comedy make up for the dodgy storyline. Another plus point is Sex in the City star Kim Catrall, she's a great comedy actres and is very nice to look at. If only John Carpenter could still make films of this quality.

Big Trouble in Little China however, sees the master in full form and reminds you of other classic Carpenter flicks like Christine or The Thing. The mystical Chinese characters are great bad guys and Kurt's character Jack Burton is a great protagonist: funny, confused, and just a little too macho for his own good. With a Carpenter written score, Big Trouble in Little China has plenty of great atmosphere to keep audiences entertained. Bottom Line: This movie isn't meant to win awards or make people think.

I can safely say this is one of those movies that I have seen over a kagillion times, and I never get tired of it.Its filled to the brim with Chinese lore, you know Chinese gods like Ching Dai, and Chinese ghosts like ""Lo-Pan"", and monsters like the ""Chinese wild man"" a monster thats a cross between chewbacka and a very deranged gorilla. Its all embellished in a Chinese style ghost story thats done to perfection by our old pal Jhon Carpenter.The plot is about Jack, a San Francisco truck driver and Wang Chi the owner of the Chinese restaurant in San Francisco china town. Wang Chis fiancée named Maoyin is kidnapped by a gang of thugs called ""The Lords of Death"". Jack joins Wang Chi in rescuing her, and in doing so go deeper into the world of Chinese ghosts and monsters. You see Lou Pan the bad guy, needs Maoyin to turn back into a human, see hes cursed with being a ghost forever. Chaos is what follows. Or as Wang says ""we really shook the pillars of heaven didn't we jack?""The film is great fun, and most of that fun comes from the great characters in the film, I think its safe to say that all the characters are interesting and likable. Lets see we have:Jack Burton- played by Kurt Russell is my favorite of the bunch. Some of his lines have me cracking up most of the time! Hes only in this for the dough. Or is he? Maybe underneath his rough exterior he just cares about his friends.Wang Chi- played by Dennis Dun. Just a dude in love and willing to do anything to get his love back. And don't stand in his way, once hes got a sword in hand your in for some trouble.Egg Chen- and old bus driver/tour guide/wise man who's also dwells a little in black magic and magic potions. Oh and he also carries around something called the ""7 demon bag"" so watch out.Gracie Law- played by Kim Katrall, who plays this nosy lawyer willing to do anything to let the rest of the world know what is going on in the San Francisco underground sewers. And shes in love with Jack.There's a whole Chinese temple underneath the streets of Chinatown in the world of Big Trouble in Little China!It doesn't shy down in the special fx dept. It has visual fx left and right, lets see: green balls of flame, a guy who can manipulate lightning, magic power battles, people having sword fights in mid-air, and monsters with 50 eyeballs. You name it, its in there. And done well.It doesn't disappoint in the action department either, we get karate fights all through out the movie, they pale a little in comparison to todays matrix-style fighting, but they are not all that bad.

This picture was the first John Carpenter film I actually saw when I was young and to this day it remains one of my favourite action movies. I didn't realise when I was younger some of the humour. The humour is mostly involved with the fact that wise guy trucker Jack Burton (Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell) acts more like a sidekick than a leading man as he's totally clueless most of the time. But that doesn't mean he doesn't handle the situation well. Both he and co-star Dennis Dun are brilliant, with Dun excelling at the martial arts.The late Victor Wong is brilliant as good sorcerer Egg Shen, as is James Hong as ghostly villain Lo Pan. Kim Cattrsll is also great as Gracie Law, the love interest. The fight scenes are all staged well (action flick veteran Al Leong appears as one of the bad guys) and the music by Mr. Carpenter compliments the action brilliantly.

The bad guy are a stereotypical evil wizard, there is a sorcerer with magical gems, two damsels in distress, everyone( well almost) seems to know kung-fu, and Kurt Russel role, well he's macho, clumsy, but always manage to get trough the task at hand in the end.

148,wchngliu,A Cult 80s Classic,8,29 June 2007,"I know that this was more of a guys flick but Big Trouble in Little China is one of the most underrated films to come out of America, not least in Hollywood. It was virtually ignored by cinema audiences in favour of the more established and well-known 80s hits such as Cocktail, Top Gun, Back to the Future etc. Kurt Russell plays a truck driver named Jack Burton and he and his Chinese American friend, Wang are on their way to pick up Wang's girlfriend from the airport-only to discover that she has been kidnapped by an evil sorcerer named Lo-Pan. Lo-Pan has chosen her of all the women available because she is a woman, who has green eyes and he himself has green eyes and so for him to become immortal and to take on a life of his own, Lo-Pan has to marry her. Russell plays it as it is as the would-be alpha male hero, whose efforts are overshadowed by the heroism of Wang. Big Trouble in Little China succeeds in doing two things: firstly, it was one of the very first films that attempted to highlight and address the existence of Chinese diaspora and the Chinese American community in Western society and secondly, John Carpenter manages to assemble and infuse elements of different types of movie genres all into one film: likewise there is horror, martial arts, comedy, action-adventure and romance. But it's the overall simplicity of Big Trouble in Little China which makes it such a cult classic in its own right. As you would come to expect with an action comedy, there are some funny one-liners and the narrative is as formulaic and predictable as it can get but this shouldn't take away (chinese, take away, get it?!) from the fact that it doesn't go overboard with the special effects and even some of the cheesy dialogue that accompanies it. The stunts are rather good to watch and the kung fu sequences are well orchestrated. Having said that the FX to this day in age does seem to look a little dated. Yet for an action-packed type of film, this one is actually a lot of fun to sit through.It does have a very B-movie feel to it,- given Carpenter's previous, yet timeless film efforts in 'The Thing', 'Escape From New York'- and the directorial style, look and feel of Big Trouble in Little China is one that conveys an almost authentic oriental and Far Eastern exoticism, which was rarely seen in most Western based, kung-fu (comedy) 80s flicks. The only other film that I could think of which nearly came close in doing just that was Eddie Murphy's 'The Golden Child', but that was a completely different type of movie to Big Trouble in Little China, even though the comedy element of that film was somewhat of a similar vein.This is a very daft movie, but at the same time it is also quite pleasing to the eye and doesn't take itself too seriously. If anything and as I said earlier, it did introduce western audiences to a certain type of niche and camp brand of high-kicking martial arts action that wasn't present in the Hong Kong based kung fu flicks of Jackie Chan and Jet Li.Whilst Russell is on top form as Jack, Kim Catrell is virtually good as the damsel in distress, Gracie and Denis Dun is just as impressive as the all-fighting- yet light hearted, Wang. Victor Wong, Kate Burton and Donald Li also fair well in their respective roles as Egg Shen, Margo and Eddie Lee. James Hong makes a good baddie as Lo-Pan. In spite of the fact that the film has aged 21 years- my God I cannot believe it has been that long (!),- Big Trouble in Little China still retains a certain panache, cult-ness and instinctiveness that not many so-called cult Hollywood movies intend to possess. This is a real gem in the crown and it is one of the outright classics in the film world, because it is so loathed by many snobby film enthusiasts and critics. Not forgetting as well it flopped big time in the cinemas- and yet it is also loved by those because I and those people see it for what it really is... and that is as one of the best action comedy cult movies of all-time. And in a decade where movies were nothing more but mediums intended to excite, entertain and enthuse audiences, as opposed to churning out dodgy remakes and sequels in today's era, Big Trouble in Little China was an underrated-yet entertaining action fest, jam-packed with great fight scenes and end-to-end comic humour. Overall, it is a hugely entertaining and fun-filled effort that is thoroughly worth checking out",Big Trouble in Little China
149,ukproject,Escapism in its purest form,10,7 November 2017,"I watched BTILC when it first came out at the cinema. I can't remember if it was one of those movies that was a flop when it first came out and then gradually grew a following over time but I loved it the first time I saw it. Just recently I watched it again with my two 20+ year old sons and they're now hooked as well.If you try to analyse BTILC it really shouldn't work and if it was made today it would probably bomb at the box office. The action, story, characters and special effects are so far out there that ordinarily you'd expect viewers to be more like 'what the **** is going on?'.Yet, BTILC sucks you into the fantasy, the humour, the dialogue and the WFT story line and keeps you fully entertained throughout.Anyone who's thinking of remaking BTILC should have the 'curse of no flesh' placed upon him.",Big Trouble in Little China
150,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Big Trouble in Little China,8,24 August 2015,"Despite his reputation as 'The Master of Horror' it looks as though most the movies in the better-half of this list are Carpenter's more fun movies. Big Trouble is the chief representation and the foremost frontrunner of those tongue-in-cheek 80's movies where you watch and think just what the hell is going on? There's no point in explaining the plot since, although it starts with a daft loud-mouthed trucker trying to get back his vehicle, ends up with century-old mythical Chinese battles, underground monsters and a massive martial arts brawl. Seriously, it's like they made up the plot as they went along, and it's clearly intentional. John Carpenter perfectly captures the spirit of B grade serial flick better than Tarantino ever could. Big Trouble has so much to offer – Action, martial arts, suspense, humour, horror, and all with a tone that tells you the movie well aware how ridiculous the whole thing is. John Wayne bravado meets Eastern martial arts mysticism with hilarious results, in what is one of the finest examples of the 'adventure' genre, if you can even call Big Trouble that. Delightfully absurd and engaging, this movie is best watched without knowing any details of the plot.Best Scene: Just before the kung-fu chaos, all the main characters emit martial arts screams in turn. Russell's Jack Burton has a go too but gets a bit carried away and fires a couple of gunshots at the ceilingwhich comes crashing down on his head and renders him unconscious for the big fight. Great fun",Big Trouble in Little China

If you saw it way back in 1986 as a twelve year old, and you thought it was serious then, that's because it was. You could argue it's any kind of genre you like, if the film had ended before Jack rejects Gracie's kiss. It doesn't end there, though. It isn't joking. It was serious when it was released, and it's still serious now. Whether or not you enjoy this ""diss track"" is personal preference. It's more watchable than other serious films you'll see.",Big Trouble in Little China
152,MovieLuvaMatt,A real good time!,7,19 June 2003,"What can I say?  It's action-packed, it's original, it's exciting, it's filled with good humor and the characters are likable.  You've got the ingredients of a good, solid action movie.  John Carpenter is a fine director, so he always finds a way to make the action scenes interesting. I enjoyed the soundtrack as well, which has that nice eighties vibe to it. Don't expect a strong plot structure, but I wasn't expecting one in the first place, so it made no difference to me.  What I did expect was to have a good time, and that's exactly what happened.  Watching this film, I realized that Kurt Russell really should be in more movies.  Of course, you got the million-or-so nay-sayers who regard him as a bad actor and regard many of his films as crap, but screw them!  No one said he's a ""brilliant"" actor.  No one said he should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.  What he does primarily are action movies, and he's a fine action star.  I think he's a good actor as well, but the point is he has charm and charisma, and can deliver witty one-liners with perfect timing.  He delivers tons of great one-liners throughout the film, and I felt like he owned those lines.  Of course, Russell seemed to be having tons of fun, which also helps as he showed much spirit in his performance.  I'm sure I'll read a plethora of reviews from people saying how silly this movie is, but what can you do? When it comes to slick, witty action movies like this people regard it as lame, but when it comes to dumb, witless movies like ""Charlie's Angels,"" people bark at me for not ""loosening up.""  I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Big Trouble in Little China
153,CinefanR,"""It's all in the reflexes""",10,30 June 2012,"Kurt Russell's truck monologue in the beginning of the film will convince you that the ride is well worth.

It's glossy, action-packed, exotic, and a total mess. What on earth were the editors doing? Had they uuh ""powdered their noses"" in the cutting room? I'm quite serious. You can take any five minutes of this movie, slot it in at any other point and it doesn't make any difference. It really is that disjointed, there's absolutely no trace of a plot whatsoever. Kurt Russell is completely wasted and anyone who saw Escape From New York will be hugely disappointed. He spends the whole movie running around through San Francisco's Chinatown confronting homicidal triad members and for the life of me I can't understand WHY. What the hell is going on here? Big CONFUSION In Little China is more accurate. It's a pathetically weak attempt at an Indiana Jones ""tribute"", and it doesn't work. That, by the way, was also the verdict of joe public, it flopped at the cinema & rightly so. In one word? Yuch.

Kurt Russell is perfect as Jack Burton, the blowhard trucker who gets caught up in Chinatown intrigue. You actually get a feeling of nostalgia watching this now, yet it's also difficult to believe that it's almost thirty years old.It's a neat story line with plenty of action along with Chinatown gangs and a supernatural element thrown in.

157,J-bot6,Big Entertainment,8,7 February 2016,"I recently had the pleasure of seeing this film in the theater for the first time. Previously, I had only seen it on video. Not only did it have more impact in a theater setting, even the so-so creature effects held up better on the big screen.This is a movie that does a lot of amazing things, including transporting the audience to a truly fantastic world, presenting imaginative and well-rounded characters, and expertly balancing action with story.One thing that has always amazed me about Big Trouble in Little China is the extensive use of simultaneous dialog. In a number of cases there are three or even four characters all conversing at the same time, lending to the frenetic feel of the film. Also appreciated was the use of pulp-novel devices, including characters introducing themselves (complete with over-the-top exposition that would never happen in real life). That and it takes a number of clichés and turns them on their heads. Truly refreshing to see a screenplay handled in this way.And then there are the actors. What a treat to see Kurt Russell, Dennis Dun, James Hong, Victor Wong, and Kim Cattrall all showing what they can do on the big screen. They're magnificent and their characters are great fun. It's also cool to hear that James Hong really enjoyed playing the part of Lo Pan.So if you'd like a great popcorn movie that actually delivers on its title, this is one to see for sure.

Look at that guy with the huge hat and tell me the lightning going off around him doesn't remind you of Raiden. No, there is no character even slightly resembling Scorpion or Goro. But there might as well be. Big Trouble is a delectable freak show of a movie where you never know what's going to appear next. Kurt Russell plays a truck driver straight out of a comic book named Jack Burton. Yes, here comes another born-ready alpha hero named Jack. Jack is a simple man. The kind of man for whom corn nuts, pork rhinds and beer are as essential love, liberty and happiness. He never says that but I sincerely hope that's true of Jack. He meets a Chinese Indiana Jones impersonator named Wang while gambling in Chinatown. Wang is ready to chop off Jack's wang until he decides to ask Jack for a ride to the airport to pick up his sweetheart instead. At the airport, things get seriously tense when three Chinese gangbangers show up wearing the coolest eyewear you've ever seen and kidnap Wang's love. Wang is upset because he ""lost a whole girl!"" Jack and Wang set off after them on account that ""they've got this sorta clubhouse thing where they all hang out."" Our hero and sidekick end up in an alley where every actor you've ever known as ""that Asian guy from (insert movie title)"" appears for a good old-fashioned slice & dice rumble. And if you think that's kick ass, look out! Here come Tres Chinos Supremos, aka The Three Storms.

161,Krug Stillo,Definately a film like no other,9,19 June 2002,"John Carpenter upset a lot of people releasing his unsociable alien in The Thing on a public still in the friendly alien E.T. hype. Unprepared cinema-goers and a case of bad timing forced Carpenter into a state of purgatory. Leaving his usual flair for horror behind him, he directed the family friendly sci-fi, Starman (1984) and followed its success with Big Trouble in Little China; definately a movie like no other...Kurt Russell plays the loud mouthed, hopelessly inept, reluctant 'hero', Jack Burton. This comedic character demands the money owed to him by his friend, Wang. Before you can even say the title of this film, Wang's fioncee gets kidnapped, Jack's truck gets stolen and they're both up to their necks in mysticism, wizardry, monsters and Kung Fu experts.As has been the problem with previous Carpenter and Russell vehicles (The Thing & Escape from New York), Big Trouble in Little China was a film way ahead of its time. It failed at the box office in 1986, despite high production values, an original concept, great photography and your usual superb synthersizer score from Carpenter. After this disappointment Carpenter left the studio, returning to independent filmmaking for Prince of Darkness (1987).The DVD (both regions) has a great commentary and really conveys exactly how funny Big Trouble in Little China is meant to be. It's also loaded with extras, one of which is the music video performed by The Coupe de Villes (a band comprising of John Carpenter, Tommy Wallace (director of Halloween III) and Nick Castle (Michael Myers in the original Halloween).

The storyline is straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon, full of evil and magical characters who must get it kicked out of them by the rugged American hero. Almost all the lines are delivered with the same kind of conviction as a WWF wrestler, about as wooden as Noah's ark. In fact, most of the characters would not look out of place getting it handed to them by Hulk Hogan. Expect the women to be screaming for help, expect a lot of running around, coming up with plans etc.But what is really going on in Chinatown? Hmmmm? Those Chinese people never say too much. ""The inscrutable east"" as Ogden Nash put it in one of his poems. A xenophobes wet dream. It could all be somewhat educational if you happen to have missed Nixon visiting China. You can say its a 'cheap action flick', but be sure to put the accent on the 'cheap'. There's a lot of plastic props that move and crash oddly.From a historical perspective, it is interesting that this movie came out before the internet was popularized, and could therefore cultivate an ignorance that just wouldn't fly today.

Some people just don't understand irony and tongue-in- cheek plays on dated pop culture and old fashion genres, which is essentially what this film is all about. John Carpenter returns to his personal film-making style after several efforts borne out of the Hollywood studio system. Here all of his personal, auteur sensibilities come into play with a fusion of Hawksian cross-genres and postmodern pop culture references. These come in the form of old kung-fu films, which Big Trouble subtly references, but throw this in with spiritual Chinese mysticism, chaotic, balletic action, black comedy, romance and just about every other genre in the book and you have a brilliantly fast-paced and original 80's flick. It is chock full of trademark Carpenter touches such as the panaglide camera, wide angle photography, sharp cross-cutting and likable characters out of depth in their surroundings Add this to some fantastic special effects and great music courtesy again of the man himself and you have a fun, always watchable addition to Carpenter's already impressive catalogue of flicks.8/10",Big Trouble in Little China

Overall, I would say the film is equal parts fantasy adventure, martial arts, action, and just a smidgen of romance, all held together by the comedy.Kurt Russel's character is ultimately cheesy, but in a beautifully entertaining way, so too is the main villain. Everything in this movie is way over the top, characters, dialog, even the special effects. A similar movie would be ""The Golden Child"", though also a comedy-adventure-martial arts-fantasy film; ""The Golden Child"" takes itself far more seriously, only getting it's humor from Eddie Murphy's sarcasm.Big Trouble In Little China's greatest strength is in it's pure entertainment value.

There are sooo many one liners in this one that make it so much fun.  The story really moves along and I can say with some certainty that there isn't a dull moment.  I think this movie was brilliantly cast and Kurt Russel gives his most hilarious performance, you can tell everyone had a LOT of fun making it.  Lo Pan is one of my favorite all time movie villains and think he is really well played.  He is definetly tough, but there are at least 2-3 lines that he gave that made me laugh out loud.  Perhaps the funniest moment in the film can only be found on the special edition DVD, because it was DELETED!  Well the scene is still in, but the best parts (A Kurt Russell speech) were edited out.  Look under Deleted Scenes and then Gracie's Office (I believe), Kurt just goes off and brings up Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu, you also get to find out the contents of that drink.  Anyways I don't think this movie is really edgy and racey enough to garner a huge cult following, but it should.  There are so many moments to list, that I won't list them, but those of you who have seen should know what I'm talking about...well that's if you liked the movie of course.  I think the DVD is worth the price for all of the extras, though I wish the commentary focused more on the movie (which it does at times, though at one point Carpenter and Russell start yapping about their kids playing hockey).  Still that's a minor quibble and not enough to detract from me giving this move a 10.  I think it gets better with every viewing.  Also does anyone know what a 6 Demon Bag is, it sounds cool.

But Jack just wants his truck back.A box office disaster, 'Big Trouble in Little China' has rightfully gained a cult following as Eastern cinema grew more popular in the West during the nineties. This is the fourth occasion that saw John Carpenter collaborate with Kurt Russell, and it is very much a different style to their earlier work, and everything else Carpenter has done for that matter. Carpenter was ahead of his time here- giving Western audiences a type of film that they weren't interested in until the following decade. Big Trouble could easily have been the standard of subsequent trashy US martial arts films, but it is turned into an all out comedy with the roles of hero and sidekick (Wang and Burton) reversed so Burton is the lead, and therefore you see the entire film through his eyes, hence you don't know what is going on during a lot of the early scenes.It looks and feels like a lot went into the production design and style of the film. Carpenter consistently respects his Eastern influences, keeps the film B grade spirit, while fusing it with his own style and satirising it with a unique campness. Be it the musical score's fusion of Eastern music with Carpenter's trademark synth, the arcade game style magic battle between Lo Pan and Egg Shen, or the villain being defeated not in a grand duel but with a simple bowie knife to the forehead, this film is perfection in the kung fu comedy genre.For Western standards, the martial arts on display here is pretty good. But for any Hong Kong action fans, it will seem pretty weak. But for those that 'get' the film, it is obvious the real entertainment doesn't come from the action but from the writing and the overall sense of fun- unlike a lot of kung fu films, there is never a dull moment between the action. The most memorable aspect are the exchanges between Russell and Dun, or Russell and anyone else in the film for that matter. Everything he says is instantly quotable and everything he does is usually hilarious. This is largely due to Russell's willingness to do anything- be it wear lipstick, act like an idiot or be knocked unconscious before the main battle actual starts.Russell stands out and the film wouldn't be half as good without him. But this isn't to discredit the rest of the cast who consistently ""Howard Hawks it"" as Carpenter said. Dennis Dun, in what is really the hero role, says his fortune cookie wisdom with his tongue firmly in cheek and delivers his lines with as much enthusiasm as Russell; Victor Wong and James Hong are both suitably OTT playing the wise old magician and evil villain respectively, and both look like they are enjoying themselves. Chinese superstar Carter Wong also puts in 110%. Kim Cattrall has a surprisingly large amount of dialogue but delivers it all with enthusiasm, even if a lot of her screen time is spent in the shadow of Russell's one liners. Donald Li and Kate Burton have smaller roles but are good fun for the time they have.All things said, this film isn't for all audiences and took its time finding the right one like earlier Russell/Carpenter films did, and ""Escape from L.A"" has yet to do. But if you are one of the people who like comedy with your kung fu (read: fans of the brilliant Stephen Chow) you should watch this and agree it achieves perfection in what it sets out to do. Sure, it isn't a work of art but ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a fun film without a single dull second, that never gets worse with repeated viewings and will always forever entertain me more than any other film. Except The Thing, but that's a different story.12/10",Big Trouble in Little China
180,Khwaj,Just keep them coming!,10,2 April 2002,"YES, YES YES!This is another to add to the 80's Hit list. Comedy, Horror, action, suspense, romance and Kurt Russel. This is far more than anyone could ever hope for.John Carpenter has really outdone himself with this ""tour-de-force"" flick. Action packed with some slick ass wise-cracking dialogue, that's said, I instantly rushed out to buy the DVD double pack. For me this was Crouching Tiger meets Ghostbusters. It would've been nice though with a follow up, but then again a bad idea as it would have started to lose it's balance becoming somewhat sloppy (especially since all the major bad guys were killed anyway.Once again a true gem to remembered for good. 10/10",Big Trouble in Little China
181,januaryman-1,Interesting commentary track,5,15 November 2013,"The Carpenter/Russell commentary was quite interesting and candid. Russell provides several insights on his attitudes toward his career, movie shootings, and the general state of film making. Carpenter also offers his opinions but seems a bit more reserved. The two of them make the commentary track a very interesting feature of the DVD.BTLC is an unusual film that was not received well in 1986 but become somewhat of a cult classic following its home video release. (Russell credits home video sales with saving his career during a period of slumping box office results.) One source categorizes BTLC as a martial arts comedy. BTLC isn't a favorite of mine because I am not a fan of martial arts films. I disliked the campy special effects that included electrical arcing from finger tips and shaft of bright light emitting from eyes and mouths. Turns out that things such as this are staples of kung fu movies. I didn't know this because I don't watch kung fu movies. Turns out that the parts of the movie that I disliked the most were a sort-of homage to the kung fu genre.The characters are cavalier in a way reminiscent of Indiana Jones movies. The poster art also reflects the style of the Indiana Jones series. There are creatures in the movie whose appearance seemed quite cheesy to me, nowhere near the quality of Carpenter's The Thing (1982). But they weren't intended to be. I think that Carpenter's overall vision was to make a fun movie. It was that; don't expect much more.Kurt Russell is a favorite of mine for his portrayals of Snake Pliskken and J. R. MacReady. Russell's character in BTLC is Jack Burton. He is a polar opposite of those characters in that he is an all-around good guy without a dark side. A braggadocio yes, but without menace. Kim Cattrall is smoldering as Gracie Law. I found myself vapor locking at every close-up of this comely lass. The film is worth watching for her eyes alone. Suzee Pai is no slouch either. James Hong plays villain Lo Pan to add to his impressive lists of roles. The DVD of BTLC contains a Carpenter/Russell commentary track that was quite interesting and candid. If the film disappoints you, listen to the commentary track. It won't disappoint you. Russell provides several insights on his attitudes toward his career, movie shootings, and the general state of film making. Kurt Russell is a Disney (make that Touchstone) version of Bruce Willis: a true action hero. Carpenter also offers his opinions but seems a bit more reserved. The two of them make the commentary track a very interesting feature of the DVD.",Big Trouble in Little China

It's Kurt Russell at his best and his character Jack Burton is a legend, his lines are pure comedy gold. Some of my favorite lines From good old jack, speaking to Lo Pan Are you crazy... Is that your problem? And This is gonna take crackerjack timing, Wang. Short Summary: Get on this film.",Big Trouble in Little China
183,el_nickster,Lord what fun!,10,1 June 2005,"This may be John Carpenter's most enjoyable film. He busts out of horror to make an action/comedy that satirizes both American-style ""two buddies with guns"" flicks and Chinese kung fu action flicks. Don't let the movie's low marks with the critics fool you: the critics back in the 1980s didn't watch kung fu movies, so they didn't get the jokes! A rambling tough-guy truck driver gets lost in the city, and accidentally pulls his truck into the middle of a massive kung fu gang fight in Chinatown. As a result, he befriends a local Chinese guy whose fiancée has been kidnapped by a triad who follow an evil spirit (Loh Pan). Said evil spirit had decided to marry said fiancée himself, as part of a ritual to summon said evil spirit into the physical world. The two men lead a group of civic minded martial artists into the depths of the earth to rescue the fair maiden and put an end to the dastardly deeds of Loh Pan.Okay, enough plot summary. This is one fun movie. Crazy feats of kung fu. Ridiculously campy dialog. Actually funny dialog. So-campy-its-funny dialog. A main character who can't do anything right. Whacky monsters that seem to be modeled after Ming figurines on your Aunt's coffee table. An old herbalist who dispenses super potions and fortune-cookie wisdom. Kung fu gang fights. Kung fu gun fights. Gorilla fu. Kurt Russel fu.All that fu aside, there is a reason this is a cult classic. If you like cult films, you are going to like BTLC.",Big Trouble in Little China

185,DevastationBob-3,The check is in the mail.,10,4 April 2001,"Okay, I'm not used to giving positive reviews, so please bare with me gentle readers. The news that this movie is coming to DVD has filled me with a feeling I only thought could possibly be generated by Salma Hayek, whipped cream, and diplomatic immunity. BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA WIDESCREEN, DELETED SCENES! A MUSIC VIDEO! GOD'S HOOKS MAN! Rapture!This movie is the single greatest cinematic achievement of all time due primarily to two factors. First the script by Gary Goldman, W.D. Richter, and David Z. Weinstein is...indescribable. Excellent Dialogue, well researched (at least so far as my understanding of Chinese mythology goes, and even if it's not well researched, it certainly flows), and action packed. The fact that these men alone were responsible for such cinematic...nuggets like Navy Seals, Slither, and Home for the Holidays, makes the BTILC script all the more miraculous. Perhaps the mystery element is David Z. Weinstein, who so far as IMDb is concerned, has never done anything else cinematic. Who is he? A pen name for John Carpenter? A red herring? Or like, Keyser Soze a behind the scenes player, emerging occasionally to add that spark of GENIUS to otherwise mediocre scripts, only to disappear again, as sphynxlike and enigmatically as he came. We may never know.(cough) Secondly, Kurt Russel's delivery of those awesome lines of dialogue. The bravado, the braggadocio, bombast, and bluster he packs into those lines, and other synonymous b-words. Jack Burton is an unforgettable character, who spends most of the movie tied up, unconscious, or incapacitated, yet still emerges the Hero of the film. Brilliant!Not that the rest of the cast isn't superb either, Dennis Dun, James Hong, Victor Wong. The creme de la creme of Asian character actors. You'd have to rent three normal kung fu movies to get this much raw talent in a single picture!And the theme song, oh the THEME SONG. As sung by John Carpenter and the Coupe de Villes. ""We gotta run, run into the mystic night...run until they TAKE. US. AWAY!"" oooh, I can gush no more. Peace.",Big Trouble in Little China
186,Progressive-Element,A fantastic roller-coaster ride,10,21 May 2013,"Blending Asian fantasy with comic action, John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China is a unique tongue-in-cheek blast. Despite being a critical and commercial failure, it has developed a deserved cult following.Kurt Russell is hilarious as the out-of-his-depth trucker, convinced at all times that he's the hero, when he is in fact more of an incompetent comedy sidekick. Dennis Dun gets to do most of the fighting, Victor Wong is amusing as the eccentric mage, Kim Cattrall still looked hot, while James Hong provides suitable menace as the villain. Hong also at times provides amusement when he shows childish glee when things go his way, and gets into a strop when they don't. His three supernatural henchmen provide extra menace, each with their own powers, and weaponry.The whole thing flies by at a fast and furious pace, the effects are still quite impressive. John Carpenter's score may be of it's age, but it's still one of his best, a neat, funky synth-score that helps drive the action in it's own way.A must-have in any cult 80s film collection.",Big Trouble in Little China
187,arkif1,Some radical Alice in Wonderland,9,21 December 2020,"Sure, you can say ""a fun film"", and what is there much to say about fun films? Perhaps that they are witty, but Big Trouble in Little China isn't really. Nevertheless it's quite special and every special film has something. So what's Big Trouble in Little China got?1. Variety: There are no dominant characters. Every single character here is memorable and relatable. They form a great ensemble. It's all done in a cartoonish way, but at the same time there's a human dimension to all of them as well.2. Authenticity: You may consider that a joke in a film like this, but that are real quotes from the I Ching, for instance, just like that are real Buddha statues. Also, in case you've read The Three Investigators and the Mystery of the Green Ghost, didn't you actually want to see such a place under San Francisco? Well, this one is quite believable. John H. Carpenter has shown in Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness that he's quite capable of dealing with western mysticism, if I may call it that, and though I'm not the best judge there is on the matter, I think he did a decent job on eastern as well.3. Sight gags: Cattrall tied, Russell wearing glasses, a truck chasing a car in the streets of Chinatown, a martial artist snacking, Russell wearing lipstick, the rather wonderful ""How?"" situation, plowing through enemy lines on a wheelchair, backwards...Well, it's difficult to bring it under a caption, but ""some radical Alice in Wonderland"" as the film itself suggests isn't such a bad one. As all Carpenter films Big Trouble in Little China is sort of lean, transparent, precise, the opposite of overwhelming or numbing. But it lacks the superior camera work of some of Carpenter's films, i.e. (the first half of) They Live, In the Mouth of Madness or the opening shots of his otherwise horrible vampire film, which are on par with Tarkowski and Malick. So no ""beautiful pictures"" here. The sets vary some in quality. The set of the wedding scene is a little bad, Lo Pan's other rooms on the other hand relatively good. I'd say the film grows on you and becomes more enjoyable with repeated viewing.",Big Trouble in Little China

I went to see it at our local movie theater and loved it so much I ended up seeing 5 times before it moved on. Even now, my wife and I break it out and give it another watch. There's really nothing bad that you can say about it. It's funny, action packed and has solid enough performances from all involved. At this point in John Carpenters career, it seemed that he could do no wrong. His movies may not have all been ground breaking cinema, but you could rest assured that you would at least be entertained. After 'Big Trouble' though, the confidence I had in paying to see his movies waned big time.At any rate, this is one of his best pictures, and if you haven't seen it, you're missing out!Long live Lo Pan!8 out of 10",Big Trouble in Little China
190,LordOfTheThundercats,I LOVE THIS FILM!!,10,29 March 2019,Easily in the top 5 best movies of the 80's. John Carpenters collaboration with Kurt Russell creates magic every time.GET IT WATCHED!!!,Big Trouble in Little China
191,j30bell,It's not big and it's not clever,4,10 January 2005,"Big Trouble is an awful film; repeat after me - an AWFUL film.OK, so it knows it's dreadful; so it's a parody of other, possibly more awful films; so it was made in the 1980s; so it's a John Carpenter flick. That doesn't excuse it. It's still diabolical (in pretty much every sense of the word).Of course everyone DOES know it's crap. The actors ham it up (particularly Kim Cattrall and a sublime-yet-not-quite-sublime-enough-to-rescue-the-film Kurt Russell). The score is as you would expect with a John Carpenter film  i.e. it's by John Carpenter. So anyone who's seen Assault on Precinct 13 knows what level of naff synth to expect.The plot manages the extraordinary feat of being more bonkers than the Hong Kong genre it parodies. Talking of the Chinese, BTiLC's characterisation of Chinese people is a bit suspect too. The white actors are allowed to ham it up, but the Chinese ones have to play it straight. This makes it look like the joke is on them, which isn't true, but you could be forgiven for thinking it was. In its own unique way it's more 1980s than Top Gun. Ah, it really is awful.The only real question for me is why I own a copy, even though I saw it before I bought it. I don't know, I just don't know. Like smoking and Star Wars, I suppose you just get suckered into these things when you're young. If I was mad enough to make a case for this Scooby Doo meets Fu Manchu of a film, I might try to point to its infectious exuberance. That and, possibly, the wonderfully executed cowardly and incompetent heroics of Jack Burton (aka Kurt Russell). It's a sad fact that Kurt Russell has probably never been better. He is an absolute joy to watch in BTiLC, something that can't be said for the rest of the film.I absolutely refuse to give this film more than 4/10 though. I like it, I am ashamed, and that is enough. May I be forgiven.",Big Trouble in Little China
192,kamwingp,Great Film,10,19 May 1999,"This is one of best films I've ever watched. It's not good acting, or good martial arts, but its is definitely fun to watch.

193,jeffyoung1,Green-eyed Asian women exist,7,5 April 2018,"I'm not going to repeat what other fans have been saying over the past 32 years. I'll admit that the film has a distinct charm of its own and in that respect with hindsight should have done better at the box office back in 1986. But hey, BLADE RUNNER was a mediocre box office presentation in late 1982 but look at the giant cult classic it became?
Here's my two cents. 
At the time I pooh-poohed the idea of a, 'green-eyed Chinese girl' and thought that was Hollywood hokum. Yet as I later learned in the 21st century, green-eyed Asian women do in fact exist! You just have to visit CENTRAL ASIA to find them. Between 136 B.C. and 900 A.D., Central Asia was the crossroads of the historic, international, ""Silk Road"". Westerners and Easterners met and mixed in Central Asia for the purpose of invasion, war, religion, and profitable, commercial trade. The long-term biological result included Asiatic-looking people with green eyes. While watching documentary videos of the Silk Road on YouTube, I saw, yes, green-eyed, black-haired Asian women dressed in colorful Central Asian garb, dancing to cultural music. They were stunningly beautiful.",Big Trouble in Little China

But when she is suddenly kidnapped, Jack is drawn into the underworld of Chinatown, along with all of it's black magic and fantasy. It's great fun. The always great actor Victor Wong, as Egg Shen, is enjoyable here as a wizard accompanying the Jack & Wang in their battle. This is a must see movie!",Big Trouble in Little China

I recently re-watched the VHS version and was still taken away from the cares of the day; few films can do that so easily but BTILC surely does so, at least for this viewer.The theme song is very catchy and should be noted Carpenter wrote the song as well.Why there wasn't a sequel one can only wonder.This is not art but it IS entertainment.'They Live' deserves a watch also, even more today than in 1986.",Big Trouble in Little China
196,NolanSorrento,Ahead of its time,8,3 March 2001,"Nearly 15 years before the Matrix, there was Big Trouble!

Unlike all the ""Ninja"" movies that where coming out at the same time where the only person, generally, who new Martial Arts was the main hero and the villain.  This was a movie that really showed HK influence during a time when every American thought America was the first country to do anything when it comes to cinema, and that's also why it probably did so bad in theaters. 
You gotta give respect where respect is due and watch this movie sometime!",Big Trouble in Little China
197,Reef-Shark,Big Trouble in Little China - A Perfection in Camp,8,13 June 2008,"Big Trouble in Little China fits the definition of a cult film. Not popular on its initial release  being blocked by other summer films of 1986 such as ALIENS  it has since developed a following which it most certainly deserves. John Carpenter purposely made this a B-movie and I commend him for that, because it certainly is a blast and the chemistry between characters with Kurt Russell at the center is mostly entertaining.The plot revolves around an ancient feud between two separate Chinese groups that has come all the way from its homeland to San Francisco which witless, wisecracking trucker Jack Burton (the always amusing Kurt Russell) suddenly finds himself right in the middle of. With his friend Wang Chi  a skilled Chinese martial artist who owns a restraint in Little China  he is pulled into a fight between good and evil and to save his truck! An ancient sorcerer  Lo Pan  needs to marry a girl with green eyes and then sacrifice her to lift a curse and retain his young form, or else be a frail old man for centuries to come; only being able to take his true form for brief periods of time. When Wang Chi's fiancée is abducted by Lo Pan's Three Storms  warriors possessing the powers of a storm  it is up to Jack and Wang to save her and end the centuries old conflict.As I previously mentioned this film was intentionally made a B-movie and the cast obviously had a lot of fun making it, with lots of tongue in cheek dialogue and intentional mistakes. It all adds to the campy fun that is Big Trouble in little China Town. The best part about it comes from the chemistry between Jack Burton and Wang Chi. You'd think Russell's character would be on top of things being the muscled American toting the gun, but Chi is the real hero with all his martial arts and fighting skills, but Burton never seems to get that constantly puffing his chest believing he is in fact the hero and Chi is the sidekick. This is the main humor that comes from this film, and I found that aspect incredibly creative considering it was a very unique idea that many people didn't get at the time but I believe the idea has begun to catch on and people can now appreciate that humor aspect of Big Trouble in Little China.The film is great entertainment and will have you smiling at its foolishness throughout and it comes highly recommended by me if you're someone who can just sit back and enjoy this masterpiece in camp. It can be found in five dollar bargain bins across the United States so just pick it up if you get the chance. Get the popcorn out, turn off the lights and enjoy.",Big Trouble in Little China
198,supernatural-62-813086,Still a Classic,10,1 November 2019,"Just a cheeky little review of Big Trouble in little ChinaThis is one of John Carpenter's best films just like The Thing, Escape from New York, Halloween, They Live and this is only naming a few.Kurt Russell is once again the leading man and is fantastic don't think I have ever seen a bad film with him in it. 1986 Big Trouble in Little China does not disappoint.Dennis Dun plays Wang his partner in this little adventure which does come across weak and needs Jacks help but is a Fantastic fighter and there Kim Cattrall As Gracie Law Jacks love interest in the film.The main bad guy in the film played by James Hing is David Low Pan and he is brilliant as the bad guy and gives an excellent performance. His character has been cursed for 2000 years and does not have a physical body and the only way to get this is to get a girl with green eyes and Marry her to please his god that put this curse on him.Low Pan has the ""3 Storms"" that help in the quest to find a girl with Green Eyes so he can be human againCarter Wong as Thunder
Peter Kwong as Rain
James Pax as LightingAll 3 have fantastic abilities and seem impossible to kill - I was impressed with the special effects specially with Lighting.Not forgetting about Victor Wong who plays Egg Shen he is a badass Tour Bus driver that is Low Pans equal when it comes to sorcerer and they can not beat each otherSet mostly in a magical world under San Francisco which is populated by monsters, magicians and masters of mystic martial arts, it mixes straight he-man heroics and kung fu action with wonderful weapons, acrobatic stunts and special effects trickery.Like Carpenter's The Thing, this was a misfire on its first release but has picked up a cult following.It had a budget of $25,000,000 and only made $11,100,000 worldwide but people still know about this film and love to watch it. I am definitely one of those people that has seen it well over 50 times and love it every time I see it.

Now having watched this more times than i can remember i love the comic genius that pops up in nearly every scene of the film and is a great reason to watch the film.The cast is impressive but top billing was invented for a reason and thats why when Kurt Russel is top billing for a film you know in one way or another the film will be great. In this film the audience identifies with Russles character because like him we are in the mystery and along for the ride. There are some great fights that make the Matrix stick out like a sore thumb.The film plays more on story, character and action more than anything else so don't be surprised that the special effects are not what Steve Spielberg or ILM have put together because this film really doesn't care, it just wants you along for the ride and speaking of which i think i might just watch it again!",Big Trouble in Little China

I must've watched this 30 times when it was on HBO a lot one summer.  For anyone who enjoys the pure escapism of the big 80's Hollywood adventure movie.

I think it's not the director's finest at all (have you seen ""The night of Halloween""?) and in some moments it even has the structure of a kung-fu computer game, but it's only intentional and self-conscious plain fun and that redeems it.

It has martial arts, monsters, explosions, sword fighting, and cool effects with a tongue-in-cheek humor.  Kurt Russell is great as the ""hero"".  By hero I mean he's just a guy that accidently stumbles into the ""underworld"" of Chinatown, and has no idea what's going on and is very annoyed about it.  This movie successfully avoids all of the action/comedy cliches, as well as the Chinese martial artists cliches.

209,rolfesam,What the Hell was all that?,8,20 November 2016,"This movie is a complete and total mystery to me. Things just happen in this film and Jack, the main character, is in the same complete confusion that the audience is. Normally this would be a big negative for the film as a whole but for this movie it just adds to its strange enduring quality. And when I say things just happen in this movie I am not over exaggerating. This movie goes from a pulpy trucker flick to a gang movie to a supernatural action film in the first 20 or so minutes of screen time and it is just too good to miss. In a world so far removed from the 1980's in ways that have changed how movies are made (which is neither inherently good or bad) its just so exciting that I as a 20 year old millennial got to see this for the first time without any kind of information on it at all. To put that in comparison I know the how the entire next few years of Marvel's movie empire are going to go with what characters I should expect to enter the universe and what story lines are going to be used. But for this flick I honestly couldn't have told you more than I've seen some of the directors other movies. That's it. There's magic in not knowing and as a person who grew up in the years of CGI being in damn near every major movie in my lifetime it was a strange feeling to see the monsters and effects in this movie and go ""wow, now how the hell did they manage to do that?"" I know its not real but at the same time there is this piece of my brain that is trained to pick up on CGI that was just screaming that the effect was genuine. It may be a silly and at times stupid movie but its one that everyone going into film should see at least once to just get a feel of what things can be done with practical effects better than CGI and what things should be left to a computer.",Big Trouble in Little China

All I have to say is I saw the movie twice and I was entertained throughout. If this is how John Carpenter directs movies, I must say I am a fan. Let's see: Jack Burton, a loudmouth truck driver with good reflexes with his friend Wang gets involved in a kidnapping gone wrong and then they are joined by nosy lawyer Gracie Law, bus driving wizard Egg Shen to stop Lo Pan, an evil spirit who inhabits the body of an old man due to a curse and rescue Miao Yin, Wang's fiancée from Lo Pan who wants to marry her and regain his youth. That's not all; we also have a freak monster, Lords of Death who are masters of elements such as Earth, Rain and Thunder and a floating head full of eyes and a Chinese gang war. If it doesn't make sense, don't worry its not supposed to. Just sit back, and watch with your eyes not with your analyzing brain and enjoy the roller coaster ride. Many would question Kurt Russell's character, and how Lo Pan dies so easily and what happens to Jack in the end with the monster inside his truck... don't worry these are not supposed to be answered. Just see the film for what it is: an awesome action comedy with a story that would never make sense; instead of what you wish it to be.",Big Trouble in Little China

I give this film 10 out of 10 because it's just one of those films that entertains you every time you watch it. It's got very good stunts,action and special effects for the time it was done (back in 1986). The story may be a bit hard to follow at first, but that's the whole idea of the film, it's meant to be like that deliberately. I heard that the Chinese people weren't that happy with the film when it came out because it supposedly made them look bad. John Carpenter's score is great as well (like nearly all of his scores to his films) and his direction has never been better. The film's so 80's and done with a style that can't be neglected.

No brainer, the action sucks, the choreography is for laughs and the comedy...which comedy? apart from a giggle or two this movie fails in almost every way. Cheesy lines that make you grin in disgust, unreal fighting (not in the good way), acting is horrible and special effects look like they came out of a child's magic box bought at a pound shop! It is an otherwordly disaster! If you think you are smarter than that do yourself a favour and stay away from this movie!

Before you start yelling ""rip off"" at the character of Lightning, remember that this film is far older than Mortal Kombat. The storyline is again, a rehashed one but it offers some interesting and original differences that make this movie one to see. Kurt Russels arrogant character matches him almost perfectly.

BTILC is one that is starting to grow on me. Yeah, it's a broad, simplistic, chaotic mess - but it is definitely entertaining. Russell plays a great buffoon, the action and effects are pretty solid, and the idea as a whole predates Hollywoods eventual embrace of Kung Fu films by fifteen years or so. I only hope that all of JC's movies end up respected in certain circles. The guy is one of the most consistent performers in all of Hollywood.

216,Shrykespeare,The single coolest fight scene EVER (may contain spoilers),10,9 August 2004,"""Big Trouble"" is a movie that I have watched many times over the years, for one simple reason:  the campy spirit and mondo-cool action sequences never get old.This movie represents John Carpenter's best work.  Having had previous success with the ""Halloween"" series, Mr. Carpenter elected to go with a much more tongue-in-cheek film in order to appeal to a wider audience.  And boy, did he deliver.There's no denying that the general tone of the movie is very menacing and scary.  And there's no doubt that most Westerners find the concept of Asian mysticism to be very believable, given how mysterious most Asians are about their culture.  Combining those elements make for a spectacular action movie, but the crowning touch was throwing into the mix a character that will forever have a place in film history: Jack Burton.  What a character!! Perfectly played by Kurt Russell, Jack Burton is a loud-mouthed, arrogant, swaggering truck driver absolutely convinced of his ability to handle anything, anytime.  He's not too bright, though...  His obvious confusion during the scenes when he is completely out of his element, and at a loss to explain the supernatural goings-on is delicious to watch.A kidnapping, a gang war, daring rescues and escapes, butt-ugly monsters, and some top-notch martial arts fight scenes keep the film moving at a torrid pace.  (That's one of this film's major strengths. It doesn't stop for a moment to EXPLAIN what's going on: we, like Jack, have to just absorb it and keep going.)  And it all leads up to the coolest fight scene ever made.The scene starts hysterically - the two rival gangs see each other, rattle their weapons and scream at the top of their lungs.  Jack, our hero, fires his weapon into the ceiling - which causes several large chunks of stone to dislodge, hitting him in the head and rendering him unconscious BEFORE THE FIGHT EVEN STARTS!  Meanwhile, the mid-air duel between Wang and Rain had me hitting the rewind button over and over again.Of course, the good guys escape, the bad guys die, no surprises there.  But by the time this movie is over, you will be gasping for breath.Watch this one over and over - it's a classic.My Score: a 10.",Big Trouble in Little China
217,redfearnb,"It's old and a little lame, but it's entertaining because of it.",5,16 March 2006,"Not that this movie is GOOD or anything, but for being twenty years old now, it has some high quality entertainment value. It reminds me a lot of the old Ninja Turtles Movies; I wonder if some of the same people were involved in the two.So the writing is horrible, the plot is lame, there's even a big rat monster. Its not based on fact at all, so the ""supernatural"" themes can't be faulted that much. So with all of these things that are lame, why is it even entertaining. Well, back to the twenty year old thing. Back in 1986, when this film was released, this movie was on top of its game. You know what? It even has some Ghostbuster and Indiana Jones feel to it as well. Kurt Russell was the heartthrob of every woman on earth at the time, which was probably why this movie was so successful as well. Some of the martial arts scenes are amusing, while you can see plenty of unrealistic moves, but there really hasn't been any realistic martial arts action since good ol' Bruce Lee. Current actors are very showy and entertaining, but they always go past realism to be like Superman, which is a shame sometimes.So if you are sick like me, or just want some plain good childhood entertainment, then go ahead and enjoy yourself some Big Trouble in Little China.",Big Trouble in Little China
218,blackismylove,Big waste of time and little acting ability,2,3 January 2009,"For year I've heard of how good this movie was supposed to be. Friends said, ""you haven't seen it yet? Its such a good movie!"" As a big fan of 80 style special effects and movies such as ""The Goonies,"" ""Never ending story,"" ""Ninja Turtles,"" I really though I was going to love ""Big Trouble in Little China."" Instead, I wasted time that would have been better spent slapping myself in the face with a shovel. I tried to keep an open mind as to why everyone loves this movie so much. But after about 2 hours of some of the worst acting and dialog I've ever seen, the only thing I could come up with was that its one of those movies that people love just because its so bad. Personally, I didn't get it. Whether it was intended to be bad acting, or just ended up that way I was left unamused. Normally, I like to keep an eye out for goofs when I watch a movie, and then kidna compare what other people have noticed. Big trouble in little china had so many mistakes in continuity, audio visual mismatch, and frankly the worst collection of unexplained series of events, I was not only left unentertained but became flat out annoyed by what i was watching. Bad guys suddenly blow up with absolutely no explanation. Dialog and character action is so forced, fake, and contrived, the whole movie was like what you would see from your seat in a haunted house amusement park ride. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because as an armature film maker, I had some appreciation for some of the lousy, low budget special effects. But for Christ's sake, with a budget of about $25 million, Id expect more than styrofoam walls and rubber masks.",Big Trouble in Little China
219,Griever_2112,"He's a very reasonable guy, who is experiencing some very unreasonable things.",10,17 November 2009,"In my opinion John Carpenter's best work.You have Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) who is a Trucker making a delivery to San Fransisco Chinatown, he meets up with his friend Wang, who they then gamble and drink...after loosing a bet of $1,148 x2, Jack takes Wang to the Airport to pick up Wang's fiancé, and then...it all begins.The movie has everything, the Hero, antihero, the wise old man, the damsels in distress, brutal martial arts fights, The evil sorcerer, the loyal bodyguards, gunfights, vicious monsters, the most quotable lines in a movie I can think of, and Chinese black magic.The one thing I love about the movie is, that Jack is not even the hero, well in the sense of the word, he is the focus of the movie, but he's more of the sidekick who does heroic stuff. I would recommend this movie to anyone I see or meet, it's not an overly serious movie like Carpenter's other works for example, Escape From NY, The Thing, Halloween, or Assault on Precinct 13. This is a fun movie with serious action, the dialog is well executed, the action is fulfilling, even the special effects for an 80's movie are pretty damn good.",Big Trouble in Little China
220,donbendell,Bizarre low-budget affair,7,25 January 2007,"""Before it was cool to have guys in trenchcoats shooting dual guns at each other or flying around as they do kung fu, John Carpenter crafted this bizarre low-budget affair that still remains one of the most true combonations of US and HK cinema -- if only because Carpenter seems to use Wong Jing's ""kitchen sink"" approach to film-making, with both an appreciation of the past, but a total disregard for the rules.The fairly silly story is about a truck driver named Jack (Kurt Russell) who gets sucked into the strange underworld of Chinatown while trying to help his buddy rescue his girlfriend from an evil sorceror. But don't worry too much about the plot. The film has its' tongue planted firmly in cheek at all times, spurred on by Russell's wonderfully dry, yet hammy, delivery of the dialogue. Actionwise, Big Trouble also does a good job. Granted, it's no Crouching Tiger or anything like that, but Carpenter did the best (I think) with what he had to work with, and like most low-budget directors, he substitutes creativity for pyrotechnics, such as a group of three elemental warriors, one of whom (played by Cater Wong) would become the basis for Raiden in the Mortal Kombat games and movies.Big Trouble in Little China is one of those great ""midnight movies"" that you catch on TV at 3 am, and stay up all night watching. It's not really good, but it's not really bad, either -- it's one of those rare movies that are so over the top that you can't help being sucked in, unless you're some kind of film snob. I won't try to defend the plot or the script or the acting -- this is just a fun no-brainer popcorn movie, plain and simple, and a damn good one at that. Sure, there's a lot of cheese in here, but you occasionally have to have a cheeseburger to appreciate filet mignon.""",Big Trouble in Little China

It's just one of those classic films from the ever so lovely 80's that many have grown to love. Examples, the Karate Kid, Lost Boys, Back to the Future, Goonies, Ghostbusters, Teen Wolf, Three Amigos, I could go on forever. It's one of those movies that you find while flipping through the channels on TV and it just takes you back in time when you were young. BTILC is just one of those movies that does that. In this great film, you'll encounter mystical Chinese magic, great martial arts, corny acting, excellent lines by cast, and goofy gunplay. Jack Burton (Russell) makes this film. He has all the best lines and come backs that you'll ever hear around. And Wang (Dun) is the best side kick that there has been in a long time. But I have to say that the powerful Lo Pan (Wong) steals the show. Whether he be in 'Ten Foot Tall Road Block' or 'Little Old Basket Case on Wheels' mode, He makes the perfect villain. Heck this movies got so much crazyness going on in it, even the some of the most popular video games/movies around have copied ideas straight out of the movie! One guess...Mortal Kombat. Yep almost all the characters where ripped off from this cool film. Take Shang Tsung= Lo Pan (both old and younger versions), Johnny Cage= Jack Burton (both show off and try to get the girl), Raiden> Lightning (one of the three storms, an exact rip off), Lu Kang= Wang Chi (determined man searching for revenge), and even the orange beast thing at the end of the film, Street Fighter copied this one for Blanka!(Did they think nobody would know?)

I've never been into kung-fu films, so I suppose I am missing out on a lot of the subversive humor. But 90 minutes straight of silly gags and relentless cheesy fight scenes just didn't do it for me. The moments of clever dialog and Kurt Russel's arrogance were welcome but I'm afraid this movie tried to put me to sleep even watching it in the middle of the day. Maybe I just didn't buy the b-movie level humor when I knew they were trying so hard to make a b-movie. Maybe it was the way we are thrust into a nonsensical plot that never gave me a reason to care about anything I was seeing.

Kurt Russle is at his best here, as the feel right, what the hell am I doing here, Jack Burton.

The commentary with kurt Russell and his longtime friend director John Carpenter was great Fun. John and kurt talk about the experience of making the film and the fun they had.Whenever john and kurt get together they have alot of laughs and they have quite a fond affection for this film.Jack Burton played wonderfully by kurt russell and is one of my fave actors playing a larger than life guy who sometimes sees himself as the hero but he's actually quite useless.Wang is truly the hero in the film he is absolutely amazing in the fighting sequences.Kurt and Dennis Dunn worked so well together and it was so hilarious whenever they got on each others nerves.Kurt Russell provides us with plenty of comic relief and classic one-liners and i still think it's the funniest lines I've heard in any movie I've ever seen before.When i see this  film now i love watching it again and again.Big trouble in little china has lots of thrills a good cast who look like their having fun it's a very crazy film.seeing Kurt as Jack Burton is a blast he is the reason i love the film so much.This is Overall an enjoyable film.classic line from Jack Burton:""Ok you people!sit tight hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.And if we're not back by dawn...Call the president,""",Big Trouble in Little China

Only Carpenter could pull off this B-movie (on purpose), that really sets the stakes for an all-time classic and of course, your enjoyable adventure flick.Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a trucker who gets caught up with his friend Wang (Dennis Dun) in a downtown Chinatown conspiracy. An age old Magician called Lo Pan is planning on returning from the spirit world and needs to sacrifice a girl with ""green eyes"" to do so. Wang's girlfriend fits that exact description, and she's caught and it's up to him to rescue her. Of course, Wang owes Jack money so Jack decides it's best to stick with Wang until he's paid up, but gets caught up in something out-of-this-world. Teaming up with some strange and memorable characters, Jack and Wang hit the underground warehouse for Lo Pan's operations, and involve themselves in a mission that will save Chinatown for ages to come! It really is spectacular, with everybody performing to their best of ability. It's hard to explain the ""feeling"" you get from watching this movie, but it's a good one.

However its all put together so well. Its just one hell of a fun ride, from the opening credits to the end. There is high flying (even wire fighting) kung fu. There are likable characters (Kurt Russells JACK BURTON is like an over the top John Wayne with an Adonis complex). There is loads of humor, Chinese sorcery, Demons, swordplay, gun play, and an infinite amount of great, quotable lines (""Its all in the reflexes""). The soundtrack is top notch as well. Kind of a mix of Chinese electronic mixed with that John Carpenter action flick flare. It is also one of those rare 80's movies where the villains are fairly cool (rather than bumbling boobs).

Unfortunately, Lo Pan, an ancient Chinese demon/sorcerer/businessman has his sights set on the same women because only a green-eyed girl can restore his mortality.  Eventually, Jack and Wang go on an adventure to rescue a whole bevy of women with green eyes and stop Lo Pan before he can rule the universe.The best elements of Big Trouble in Little China are the characters and the situations that develop between them.  The Three Storms are defintely a great addition to the movie, and the intense fight sequences were ahead of their time.  The ""big final fight"" between the ""good"" and ""bad"" gangs is hilarious, exciting, and special-effects laden including: a sort of magical game of ""Mortal Kombat""; a man kicking another man 3 times in row (very quickly); Wang and Rain sword fighting in *mid-air*; and Jack Burton displaying his amazing throwing arm (""It's all in the reflexes"").Oh, and Kurt Russel's portrayal of Jack Burton is timeless and very funny. He's not totally brainless as some might lead on; I think he doesn't totally understand (or want to understand) the magical things that are occuring, but he nevertheless continues because his friendship with Wang.... and he wants his truck back.""Do you know what Jack Burton says in a time like this?""""Who?""""Jack Burton; *me*!""<Wang flips in and gives Jack the nod>""Ol' Jack always says, 'What the hell..'""",Big Trouble in Little China

I Suggjest this movie to fans of martial arts adventures, people who like gun scenes,gang fights, fans of John Carpenter, Kurt Russel fans, and people that like magic and monsters. This is my all around favorite movie. It is a great movie for the whole family. The movie has a bit of everything in it- Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and thrills. The movie is great I think that if you haven't seen it yet you should go rent it and you will love the movie. Its just a remarkable piece by John Carpenter. See it!",Big Trouble in Little China

I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie. I could not stop laughing. Russell is absolutely brilliant, and delightfully funny.

I personally believe BTILCH is gonna stay here for a long time in almost the same case as with ""The Wizard Of Oz"" continuing to entertain another generations, real timeless classic that will never lose its charm. John Carpenter is a real genius, not only absorbs into a completely different genre from ""Starman"" that did 2 years before but does that like he was an Asian kung-fu master and not a horror master like he's used to be. Only the greats like him can succeed in every genre (and, i dare to say, in every decade). Now you have to excuse me i'm gonna show it to my children.",Big Trouble in Little China

It is interesting to see how he reacts to the strange magical world that the Chinese create and inhabit.

But it's *so* much fun that it's impossible not to like it.  John Carpenter's film spends half its time cutting up on the conventions of the martial arts film genre, and the other half using them brilliantly itself.  It's certainly not for everyone, but it's zany, fun, and extremely successful at what it's trying to do.

From beginning to end, Big Trouble is filled with non-stop quotable lines, great effects, beautiful martial arts, fine acting, gorgeous sets and costumes, it really lacks for nothing you could want in a Hong Kong style movie...

And... well, to be frank, I can't quite understand why. I mean, it's *alright*, but I wouldn't exactly call it great. First off, good stuff: effects have aged pretty well for a movie from 1986, the action is pretty good, it's well-directed, it has one of the best intros I've ever seen and Kurt Russell is *amazing* in this movie, I'd almost recommend it for his performance alone. But there is one major problem with it; the pacing. This movie goes way too fast. Large portions of the dialogue just feel like hasty exposition to explain why the action is happening, there's basically no development for any of the characters, on that note Jack Burton and Egg Shen feel like the only two characters that have any personality set up at all, and the story is so thin it almost feels like the first two acts are a Double Dragon adaptation. A better Double Dragon adaptation than the *actual* Double Dragon adaptation, mind you. All that said, if you like John Carpenter, Kurt Russell or martial arts movies I'd say watch it, but other than that you're not missing much by passing.",Big Trouble in Little China

But, this is not typical Carpenter in the way most people know him (Halloween, etc.)BTiLC is maybe my favorite Carpenter movie because he combined his frantic paced madness with slapstick comedy here (instead of in your face horror) for full effect and succeeds masterfully.More kung fu than you can shake a stick at. Even if youve never heard of Carpenter - if you like high flying (pre matrix CGI) kicking and karate chops, you HAVE to see this one just for the fight scenes, again wonderful.The cast is amazing, each character played way over the top, leaving stereotypes spinning in the dust.Costumes and sets are great and the storyline, though done a million times has a fresh take here because of Carpenters twisted sense of humor and excellent direction taking the film trhough genre mixes so often youre not sure if youre watching a scifi, fantasy, kung fu, comedy or action thriller...the truth is, youre watching all of the above done so campy-ily well that youre not sure what hit you. And thats a very good thing.A must see for any Carpenter, Kurt Russell or Kim Cattrall fans as well as fans of HighFlying martial arts, or video game type action.

That relationship is preserved in this film and can be seen in every scene. It shows that a fun film can be made with a simple a mutual trust between actor and director. The comedic direction this film was given was not appreciated or really understood at the time of release, but is now rarely seen in any movie. It's old school classic action fun: guns, swords, trucks, samurais, monsters, girls, kung fu oriental magic, etc. But the comedy comes from a level of self awareness that lets you enjoy the fun for what it is. Most of the movie is moving very quickly with no time wasted trying to make us empathise with characters and all that jazz.

I do not scribe to this as I have always found this film to be a tad overrated but the appeal is unmissable. Kurt Russell is smooth as Jack Burton and a pre Sex in the city Kim Cattrall is sweet. The story takes place in China and our titular characters run amok trying to battle magicians and martial artists. As I stated earlier I do not have a high opinion of the film(Both the Escape movies and The Thing are much better Russell-Carpenter collaborations) but you can see for yourself.,Big Trouble in Little China
252,BWells,Big Fun in Your Living Room,10,16 October 1998,"Very few times in the course of cinema history has a film been crafted so flawlessly to achieve one simple purpose -- to have a great time.  This is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Casablanca"".  Instead, it sets out to be one long laugh-riot, slam-bang, don't-delve, don't-blink, don't breathe, good-vs.-evil boom fest, and blows imitators away.Come to think of it, there really aren't even that many imitators. Even Carpenter hasn't put something this much fun together before or since (although I *am* looking forward to ""Vampires"").  Looking for something similar?  Try the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell combo of ""Evil Dead 2""/""Army of Darkness"", which is close but slightly more forced on the humor side.  Or perhaps ""Star Wars"", which is slightly more serious.  Maybe ""Buckaroo Banzai"", which is a bit sloppier (When IS he going to tackle the World Crime League, anyway?).In any case, the best way to watch this movie (not ""film"", not ""motion picture"" -- ""movie""!) is to gather as many friends as you can, whatever snacks and beverages you crave, kick back, and remember as many quotes as possible.

I am fully aware that an awful lot of the reviews here seem to compare it to ""Citizen Kane"" in terms of his stature, but I think it's absolute rubbish, no humour and no style editing its clumsy, lots of groups of people having conversations and then walking out of shot, blah blah blah.

Kudos to John Carpenter, the tone of this movie shows an incredibly well honed sense of humor and timing.I laugh every time I see the show, I haven't found a friend yet who doesn't add it to their list of favorites after seeing it.I think those that don't like it shouldn't leave reviews, unless they like putting in writing that they don't have a sense of humor.

I have seen it three times this year, twice in the theater. The action, the laughs, the crazy Martial Arts. Everything combines to create a sense of a real world where these heroes live breathe and kick ass! Kurt Russell Plays Jack Burton, an everyman hero who moves the plot along sometimes by banging it with his head. Say what you want but you will never find a braver hero than Jack Burton. Sure he does some goofy things but in the end, when it counts--it's all in the reflexes. If you don't like this film, there is something wrong with your head. seriously, it is the Citizen Caine of Action Comedies.

Face it, he's directed a lot of crap, please lets don't mention ""Vampires"" and how many people were walking out of the theater when I went to go see it.But if there is one reason to justify his existence, it is this movie. Its great.  I may like some pretty different and intellectual movies(see Northfork, Requiem for a Dream) but when it comes to just a great action movie, this is what I turn to time and time again.  I cant even count how many times I've seen it.It well acted, great score, interesting story, some kick ass action, and some good humor(no not the ice cream).  If your looking for something a little different in your action flick don't look to Jean-Claude Van Damme, don't watch T3, don't even watch The Matrix movies(unless it's the original, that one is still ok).I give this movie a 10/10.

Films like this are movie magic. They remind you why you used to enjoy going to the cinema so much. Nowadays films concern themselves with CGI and 3D whereas Carpenter was a director who believed in giving the audience a story first. Effects are merely props. The key to a great movie is the characters and the choice of cast playing them. Could anyone ever imagine Snake Pliskin being played by any actor other than Kurt Russell or anyone other then the late great Ernest Borgnine driving a yellow NY taxi? If you grew up in the 80's then a description of this film is pointless. Chances are you've already seen it over and over again. If you're a 90's kid and you're wondering what all the fuss is about then put down your xbox controller for a couple hours, put some popcorn in the microwave, shove the DVD in the player, dim the lights and then sit back and bask in the chop-socky-comic-book-glory of this movie!",Big Trouble in Little China

This may be so, but in my opinion the CHARACTERS are all in different movies, often at different times!  We've got romance, adventure, comedy, horror, mysticism, and martial arts, with a big dial that is supposed to point to the overriding mood, but it keeps getting moved.

Easily Carpenter's most amusing film, this movie is just pure fun, never taking itself too seriously, it has no major goal other than to take the audience on a fun little ride.

I loved it when I was 6 years old and I love it now.Prepare to to be transported back in time to when not every film took itself so damned seriously. There's good guys, bad guys, minimal plot, cheesy dialogue and tons of good ol' kick, punch, gouge, slash and stab action! The acting in this show is what the modern movie crowd would call ""camp"" But, I just like to call it ""acting"" By that I mean the fun kind. No politically correct cultural pandering, and none of this ""twisted, misunderstood anti-hero"" nonsense. It's all wonderfully stereotypical chop socky goodness. Victor Wong and James Hong are both, IMHO, action movie legends and make this film a winner between just the two of them. Their respective characters, although mostly static, are instantly endearing and hilarious to watch. They pull it off with comedic talent alone. Kurt Russel, Dennis Dun and Kim Cattrall work well together and all give entertaining, memorable performances within their respective archetypes (Reluctant hero, sidekick, damsel in distress) The story itself? Well, just watch the movie. You'll pick it all up as it goes. It starts quickly and gets to the good parts without wasting your time with meaningless dialogue, side plots or back story. No hidden agendas, no bait-and-switch, no underlying social metaphors. It's just a story. A story where everybody gets beat up....a lot The special effects were....just that...effects. Nothing more. Crude by today's standards (obviously) but unlike 99.98% of contemporary action flicks, they weren't expected to support the entire show! They were ""special effects"" As in...not the entire budget! Wow! Even if you don't get a kick out of it, you can keep watching because there's an actual movie happening amidst it all! What a concept, huh?! The fights are all live action, with live extras who come in screaming, shooting and flailing like they really mean it. The hits come often and they don't stop until the the show ends.You will also notice a surprising lack of gore, profanity and overt sexuality/nudity. A few cuts and scrapes, a couple rubber corpses here and there. A few cheap scares. Kurt Russell says ""shit"" a couple times. But, that's it. By today's standards, this show is almost family friendly and has the added bonus of not totally sucking.This movie is a rare gem compared to the endless list of ill conceived, overwrought, CG driven garbage that clutters up our screens.

273,insidious420,Easily One of the Greatest Movies Ever,10,1 June 2009,"This is the PERFECT action/adventure/comedy/fantasy movie, with great ambiance, gorgeous visuals, action scenes way ahead of their time with fantastic choreography & wire-work, superb dialogue with perfect comedic timing, serviceable-yet-tongue-in-cheek fantasy special effects, and an exciting fast pace that pulls you through the entire movie before you realize it is over. While the film's world is wonderfully fleshed out and rich feeling, the whole tone of it all is not meant to be taken seriously - this is a fun movie, and as long as you don't expect Oscar-caliber material, you will enjoy it immensely.No detailed plot description, no serious critique, and no spoilers. Just this: This movie has such a HUGE amount of charm, awesomely witty banter and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, great actors (Kurt Russell as hilariously-cocky & self-assured Jack Burton, Kim Cattrall as charming & determined Gracie Law, Dennis Dun as Jack's ""sidekick"" Wang, Victor Wong as hilariously-quirky Egg Chen, & James Hong as sinister Lo Pan), all of whom totally own their roles and mesh so well together to really pull the viewer into their universe. This movie has some of the best one-liners ever put on film, mostly from the most charmingly arrogant loner-type in film since Han Solo, courtesy of Russel's Jack Burton. There is literally nothing else like it, except maybe ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" for a similar style, but ""Big Trouble In Little China"" is by far the more well-rounded, consistently funnier, and more likable film. In my opinion, this is tied with ""Halloween"" as John Carpenter's best film. If you like John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, rich fantasy themes, the charm of 80's movies in general, or ""buddy"" action/comedy movies, then you REALLY owe it to yourself to check this one out! A truly underrated gem of a classic.",Big Trouble in Little China

Music by the legend John Carpenter. I just love it and recommend it. They don't use this imagination anymore...I am afraid for the remake.",Big Trouble in Little China
275,procsol,"Less than 10, you have impossible ratings",10,28 September 2019,I have watched this movie every year which makes over 30 viewings. The camp is sublime. The fantasy is seminal. The acting is delicious. The special effects while great perfectly compliment the camp. This is best watched at a midnight show. This stands side-by-side with Halloween and The Thing as Carpenters' crowning achievements.,Big Trouble in Little China

Hell yes, with the combination of old style Kung Fu and amazing special effects Carpenter kicks some butt and makes you laugh.",10,7 July 1999,"I'm sorry, but I love this movie, and Carpenter in general. For starters you have that Jun Fan style kick-boxing that the martial arts masters made for Bruce Lee.  In the first fight scenes between the Chang-Sing's and the Wing-Kong's, there's a part where some dude is thrown a two by four and knees a guy's head between the board. The kung-fu is exceptional.  The acting is great, with Kurt Russell (Tombstone) playing the witty, arrogant trucker, Kim Cattral (Star Trek 6) as the cocky human rights lawyer, and Dennis Dun (Prince of Darkness, also directed by Carpenter and also starring Egg) the slick and strong dude determined to get his girl back from the evil 2000 year old Lo-Pan.  Russell is excellent although he's in just about every Carpenter flick imaginable.  Carpenter rocks, that's all I have to say.  Special effects amazing, that's all, rent it if you haven't seen and enjoy.",Big Trouble in Little China

I could never understand why this movie was not a box-office winner,it's got everything that an action movie requires. John Carpenter proves once again that he is a director ahead of his time, who knew that the guy who did halloween had a flair for a Superhero movie? Fans of the Matrix (myself included) have been calling The Matrix the best Comicbook movie not based on a Comicbook, well Big Trouble is the king of the Comicbook movies. Hey, maybe they should get John to do the next Batman movie. Just a thought.",Big Trouble in Little China

The low points come when he forms recognisable words.Phrases such as 'No-one's going anywhere till someone tells me what the hell is going on' and 'Where's my truck' over and over again numb even this critic, who had drunk enough to endure almost any brainless romp before viewing this offering. One sidekick even looks steely-eyed at the camera and says 'I'm going - alone if I must' in one particularly riveting scene. And, all Asians over 40 must Yoda speak like?This feels like a farce that they didn't have the guts to complete, a 'Top Secret' played for drama, a Goldie Hawn film without Goldie Hawn.Sorry, but save your time.

Jack Burton doesn't seem fazed by anything, his sidekick is always with him and Kim Cattral is to die-for in her role.Carpenter combines all of the film's elements seamlessly and it is one movie I can watch over and again.Some find it silly and childish, but I love it!",Big Trouble in Little China

I doubt even Kurt Russell or John Carpenter realized how well it would play out.The whole premise of this movie is that Jack Burton plays a bungaling idiot that plays the perfect role as a co-star to the main character, Dunn. There's martial arts, magic, comedy, and tons of attention to detail in the set design. If you haven't seen this movie, you really should.Sadly, it bombed in theaters against Aliens, which was released at the same time. Luckily it has a huge fan following.",Big Trouble in Little China

285,idolpoo2000,Kurt Russell is the king of pseudo tough guys,9,10 January 2005,"John Carpenter has truly created a masterpiece here, with the king of pseudo tough guys in the lead role, performed to perfection by the king of pseudo tough guy actors himself Kurt ""the king of pseudo tough guys"" Russell.....The lead heroes name is Jack ,I really think that says it all, martial arts, tough ass hombres, roving maniac gods stealing Asian girls with green eyes to appease big gods of the east, and a truck driver named Jack Burton (what a tough-guy name). Slick one liners steal this one and the action is great, coupled with the smugness eschewed by the obvious pseudo serious imitation of actioneers this is of the all time greats in my books. Really worth a six-pack of cheap (or expensive) beer and the rental cost of a DVD, and I am extremely jealous that my uncles got to see this one on the big screen.....",Big Trouble in Little China
286,SundayDumbDay,Take a ride on the Pork Chop Express,8,2 August 2013,"I must warn you that this review may contain spoilers. Jack Burton (played by Kurt Russell) is probably one of America's greatest fictional heroes. I mean, he's right up there with John McClane from Die Hard. Now that I got that out of the way, Big Trouble in Little China is one of the greatest & cheesiest movies of the 1980's due to its absolutely hair brained storyline of mystical beings from thousands of years ago, Chinese black magic and six demon bags. The story starts out like any other 80's adventure, with a girl being kidnapped and our main heroes chasing after bad guys (ahem...more like the bad guys chasing after them) and getting entangled within a story like you've never seen. This movie is awesome for what it was and when it came out but the quotes in Big Trouble in Little China are so ridiculous that once you've done a run through you'll be quoting just what good ol' Jack Burton always says, ""What the hell.""Check it out and I promise you won't be disappointed. After all, ""Well, ya see, I'm not saying that I've been everywhere and I've done everything, but I do know it's a pretty amazing planet we live on here, and a man would have to be some kind of FOOL to think we're alone in THIS universe.""I also write my own reviews on sundaydumbday.comThanks!",Big Trouble in Little China
287,Mark_Burton,The definitive PopCorn movie,9,18 December 2009,"I still remember the first time I saw Big Trouble in Little China from John Carpenter. It was Christmas time, I was about 10 years old and that movie became immediately one of my favorite. Indeed, this is the perfect movie for kids and teenagers. It seems that Carpenter wanted to put in the same movie all kind of stuff he liked when he was younger. Just imagine a mixture of ""The Karate Kids"", ""The Goonies"", ""The 36th chamber of Shaolin"", ""Star Wars"", ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Dirty Harry"". Seems weird? Yeah but so FUN! What about the content?The script: don't watch that movie to find a complex story like ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Mulholland Drive"", or deep reflexions about life or death (Allen, Bergman, Godard, Bunuel, where are you?)- the only goal of that movie is people to have FUN. This story was written as a video game where heroes had a quest and should complete several levels in order to succeed. Concerning the characters, you got everything a good video game needs: a beautiful Chineese girl kidnapped by bad guys, two opposite wizards, some magic potions, monsters (even a Bigfoot like in ""Harry and the Hendersons""), a kind of modern samurai, some kung-fu fighters and that Old Jack Burton, a truck driver, dreaming of becoming the next Inspector Harry but closer to Jacques Clouseau. Finally, the best aspect of that script is that you got cult quotes in every corner of every scene, from ""All is in the reflexes"" to ""We really shook the pillars of heaven, didn't we, Wang?"". Just watch it, you can't stop laughing when hearing Jack Burton speaks. The direction: Carpenter's decision to make that movie as kitsch as possible makes it go through age without taking dust. Even the old synthetized music and special effects from the 80's (which seems ridiculous nowadays for most movies), are in total adequation with the whole aspect of that film. The actors: they are all perfects with a special mention to Kurt Russell in its best performance to date: he IS Jack Burton. James Hong and Victor Wong are perfects as chineese wizards while Dennis Dun is an incredible Kung-fu fighter. And what about Kim Cattrall? Well, she brings with her the sexy touch needed for that kind of movie.Conclusion: you like that movie when you're a kid and still love watching it as an adult with your own kids! It's 100% pure FUN, 100% pure LAUGH and the DEFINITIVE POP CORN MOVIE! Just watch it and you will understand why directors like Tarantino or Rodriguez love it and love Kurt Russell!***1/2 out of ****",Big Trouble in Little China

The film bombed but has grown it's worthy cult following. The team of John carpenter and Kurt Russell works well, for the film. It's, everything, horror, action, fantasy and, comedy. Good action, a little Die hard channelling and, the pre-curser to Mortal Kombat. It has gore for slasher fans, mystery, psychological thrills, comedy, done good by Russell, and, is just an interesting concept. may the useless Rock NOT touch this, otherwise he'd be in BIGGER trouble. may his little candy ass fingers stay away, he RUINED DIE HARD with Sky crap, ah. Yea Big trouble in little China, from the creative and visionary John Carpenter, who KNOWS how to make great films, just, at times some fall flat, can have 1 or a couple duds. This is a GEM, a rare diamond, that had it rough, and over time, got the love it deserved then and has earnt to this day.

291,mortenkommen,This is art,9,21 December 2006,"This movie is just great - silly, but great. As in most of John Carpenter's films Kurt Russel plays a real macho hero, except in BTILC he's really bad at it. Every time he tries to make a move he fails miserably. But his dialogue throughout the entire film is just hilarious; always bitching and complaining. BTILC is very much a B-movie so don't expect any seriousness in dialogue, plot or action.It's all very silly, very stupid and very entertaining. On the extra-materials DVD there is also a priceless music video, featuring John Carpenter (lead singer), a guy that looks like Adam Sandler and another guy with long golden curly hair and a mustache. This video rock!! Words can't explain how cool these guys look, you have to check it out for yourself.

292,PurgeClerk,"Cultadventure, Not for everyone",6,9 July 2006,"This is a movie of great value and meaning for teenagers and young adults who grew up in it's time. The main problem for me when I watched this the first time is that the storytelling is so liberal when it comes to boundaries of the genre that you don't really know what type of movie you're watching. At first you have the impression of adventure action, then comedy action, then hardcore action..furthermore it goes on to horror sci-fi and then back to comedy action again in a haze of genre confusion and settles down at something like adventure-horror-action-comedy.That said, of course that type of storytelling is original in a sense, and all those unusual elements to it made it stand out as a cult film, and obviously a few people liked that, but to me it was always a downside. I was not satisfied with the story being so loosely hinged and unsecured that you have no idea what ""scheme"" to use when watching the movie. It was like the mixing of genres destroyed each others credibility.I think the movie would be a lot better if they either cut out the comedy and based it as a horror action(i.e The Thing) movie or cut out the horror and base it as action adventure(i.e Escape from New York). In addition the movie is a victim of evolution as the visual effects have been outdated years ago, which really isn't a bad FX gig, it's just that Big Trouble was made to rely heavily on special effects, and that at the time of release, the special effects were so new in style and cool that they never took the time to detail it on screen so that it would seem realistic in the future. A more conservative approach would definitely have payed off in my opinion.Not timeless, still the movie holds some value with a few funny scenes as well as good martial arts scenes.",Big Trouble in Little China

294,JuniorBruce,It's all in the reflexes.,10,24 January 2007,"You can measure a man by his actions, but in Jack Burton's case, you'd be better off measuring him by his words. That's because, while the pilot of the Pork Chop Express (a big-rig) has his heart in the right place, when it comes to backing up all his bravado he's about as effective as a lightning rod made out of rubber.John Carpenter has made a lot of movies, a lot of great movies, but none are finer than ""Big Trouble in Little China."" This film features Carpenter at his very best, effortlessly weaving timeless characters with a rich plot, incredible visual effects, and dialog that's so snappy you can't help but giggle with delight.I could write for days about all the great things that happen in this movie, and all the warm-fuzzies its given me over the years, but all that still wouldn't do this film justice. It is, simply put, the greatest movie ever made, period. There is not a single flaw in it, and for anyone to say otherwise only proves that that person's inner-child was beaten to death with a hammer at birth.Sure, it's cheesy, but who says every movie has to be some poignant Oscar nominee to be a masterpiece? This is cinema that entertains like a roller-coaster, without the dizziness or nausea.If you're a fan of John Carpenter, a fan of Kurt Russell, or maybe just a fan of movies that just plain kick butt, there is no good reason why you should not take the time to check out this movie.

The film has a great villian with a compelling backstory, actor who portrays him, and wardrobe with makeup. Jack Burton the main protagonist is a macho dork, much like Starlord in a lot of ways from Guardians of the Galaxy. Wang his sidekick, yet more badass friend is preety cool himself and more capable than the hero. Theres plenty of action as well deep in the alleyways and underground tunnels of San Fransisco Chinatown. The effects hold up very well with lightning bolts, explosions, and muppets and suits. The lighting isnt overly dark but not bubblegum pop bright either. The three henchmen in the film are also preety interesting themselves. The humor is quite funny as well from slapstick style to clever dialouge. John Carpenter made a very fine film all around that is so much fun to go back and rewatch.

And never has dialogue been written so perfectly for Kurt Russell. This is one of a handful of well-constructed ""fun"" movies. They can be criticized for being derivative, formulaic, low budget, or nonsensical. It's possible that Big Trouble in Little China could be called all of these things (""low budget"" is unfair, I think, but it still might be evaluated as such by some viewers today), but I think such criticisms would be too quick. See, this movie is fun. We give those sorts of films allowances. And in this one, the main character is a brash, overconfident, iconic hero that speaks almost exclusively in one-liners. The plot? He fights kung fu demons to rescue his buddy's fiancée and a green-eyed damsel that he wants to score with. That's the setting. It's not deep.

While some people may not like it due to the extreme Chinese stereotypes and very mild language i would recommend this movie for everyone.

303,Papa Doc-2,John Carpenter's pre-Jacky Chan-era Hong Kong import is still as flashy and stylish as a neon Buddha.,8,8 October 1998,"In 1982, Hong Kong director Tsui Hark made the Landmark film, _ZU:Warriors of the Magic Mountain_, an instant classic that defined and still defines the wuxia genre of martial arts films, and will no doubt do so for some time to come.  It was this film that inspired American bad-boy director John Carpenter to show America just how cool a movie fried up Szechuan style really is.Kurt Russel's John Wayne-squared performance as the prototypical gwailo, lost in a culture beyond his understanding but too cool to care, is a perfect foil.  Through Jack's eyes we are introduced to the fascinating and deadly world of flashy wuxia gongfu, magic, demons, and the smattering of superstition and China's popular religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism that is the hallmark of the modern Martial Arts genre of films. Still, his character plays a part, adding the dynamic element of luck and chance needed to bring the events of the film to their explosive, 80-frames-a-second conclusion.While the cultural implications of the movie can be explored more deeply, the film is perhaps best seen as one who doesn't understand Chinese culture fully but can go with the flow like the best of them.  Unfairly passed over, this film was ahead of its time.  Only now does America seem ready for the boat from Hong Kong to pull into the harbor.  People call this movie ""cheesy"" and ""over the top"" without understanding that Carpenter did this because he wanted to show what a Hong Kong movie was like, while making it uniquely American, and to show how a culture can flourish and run deep without being noticed by the world around it.Watch it once because you like Kurt Russel and think gongfu and Chinese magic and mythology are cool.  Watch it again to begin to understand what it means to truly be a gwailo.",Big Trouble in Little China

It was like that annoying friend that you could never get rid of yet you enjoyed hanging out with. The film does have its flaws but with the spectacular story and actors it creates a magical ride that you will never forget. Whenever this film is on television you can't help but make a big plate of chow-mein and just relax on a couch and let yourself become part of the film. It has a strong cult following and also serves as another unappreciated John Carpenter films. Not all films have to be deep and make you think and if that is the way you rate this film then you will be sorely disappointed.

John Carpenter puts his Dark Star hat on to give us this wonderfully whacked out movie that features such things as as all-seeing eyeball monster, three people who have control over the elements and the hell of the upside-down sinners, to name but a few. Kurt Russell turns in a great performance as a swaggering trucker for whom nothing seems to go right but who always ends up saving the day. He even manages to look heroic with a big lipstick mark on his lips. The always lovely Kim Cattrall also gives a good performance as a girl who, like Kurt Russell's character, puts up a brave front to hide the fear beneath. Plus she look especially gorgeous in that chinese wedding gown and make-up.A terrific score by Mr.Carpenter himself and top-notch SFX courtesy of ILM alumnus Richard Edlund round off a movie which has to be seen to be believed. And enjoyed.",Big Trouble in Little China

Actually it is my favorite movie of all time!! Yes i know such movies as Saving Private Ryan, Shawshank Redemption, or even Willy Wonka might be looked upon as better movies but i say ""Who Cares!!!"" Big trouble in Little China is a fun movie that you can sit back on a lonely night and just enjoy. The plot is pretty basic and that is why it is easy to follow. Yet the acting of Kurt Russell alone makes the movie. Im not saying this just because i am a BIG KR fan but he just does a wonderful job in this movie as a Truck drive who has no clue on whats going on but just goes with the flow! The witty lines of Kurt Russell in this movie are some of the funniest lines i have ever heard come from an actors mouth.. I mean the whole part of Lo-pan and Jack in the wheelchair is one of the funniest peices of material i have ever seen on the big screen... Well gtg and just remember if some wild 8ft tall monster grabs the back of your favorite head and slams it aganist the bar room wall and ask if you paid your dues!!??! well just tell him what ole jack always says..

315,mworkhoven,This film sucks!,3,2 December 2006,"Big Trouble in Little China definitely has it's moments, most of which come courtesy of Kurt Russell and his entertainingly goofy performance. However, the film is neither funny enough to score as a comedy, nor exciting enough to make any impact as a good action movie. Sure, John Carpenter may have meant the silly monsters and incomprehensible plot to be part of the joke. But as any good comedian would tell you, if you have to explain the joke, then it's time to get off the stage. And in this film, not only does Carpenter explain the joke, but wrote endless pages and pages and PAGES of dialogue full of mystical hooey. Every time someone opens their mouth to explain something, the film makes less sense than before. This ""joke"" gets old fast. As for the action, it's well-staged, but you never feel that any of the characters are ever in danger. It's certainly nothing to write home about, especially compared to superior films like the Indian Jones films, or the many Hong Kong films that Carpenter rips off here. The film has a cult following of people who seem convinced that this was all part and parcel of Carpenter's plan, but personally I think he just made a bad action comedy, and is now trying to rationalize it by saying it was SUPPOSED to be bad all along. Still, at least it wasn't boring, so all is not lost.Mark",Big Trouble in Little China

And it is funny.  Lots of great lines.I think it lacks the kicking ass scenes that movie-goers crave.  The hero never rises above, lucky/goofy.

318,darrenglover74,"""No pathetic excuses....!!!""",10,3 April 2011,"Probably one of the most quotable films of all time, this John Carpenter action, comedy, kung-fu, monster, magician, fantasy mash-up remains probably his finest work, and one of the best films to come out of the 80s. The gag in this movie, is that the ""hero"" Jack Burton, an out-of-his-depth truck driver, is nothing of the sort. He's a bumbling, useless but wise-cracking idiot, and played to perfection by Kurt Russell. The plot is pretty standard fare. Truck driver Jack arrives in San Francisco's Chinatown, and becomes embroiled in a plot in which Lo-Pan, a 2,000 year old cursed Chinese sorceror needs to marry a girl with green eyes to become human again. Lo-Pan abducts the suitably-eyed fiancée of Jack's best friend Wang, and the duo set off with friends in tow, to defeat the dastardly sorceror and rescue Wang's girl (and Jack's truck) The script moves at 100mph, bolstered by some of the best (and funniest) dialogue of all time. The supporting cast, including a young Kim Cattrall, help to flesh out the story. One of those films that can be watched over and over again, the bizarre sight of a man who can self-inflate himself when under attack is worth a watch by itself. ""Have you paid your dues Jack?

Kurt Russel's Jack Burton was a great character, adding the all American attitude with clumsiness, amazing reflexes, and a diesel truck.

It seems wittier, potentially 'cultier' (if not already), and funnier than I remember it to be back in the day. Granted, I am a Kurt Russell fan, but I wouldn't let that dissuade me from watching a more contemporary film than one that has as much quality as this one. Despite the fact that I watch a lot of movies I don't often write reviews, but I am picky about what I do watch and I was somewhat reluctant to watch 'Big Trouble in Little China' once again because it could easily have been outdated, but Holy Moly, I was not disappointed!! If you read some of the quotes from the movie which are no doubt listed here on IMDb, and if you can't appreciate their quality and frequency, it could be likely that you have neither a pulse or a funny bone. This film is like a woman (such as myself...) or a fine wine, of which both share two things in common - they each have the ability to age beautifully and with grace, or not. 'Big Trouble in Little China' has both. So pour yourself a glass of wine (fine or not), or a root beer (whatever...), then kick back. relax, and enjoy the ride; you will not be disappointed.

326,pgray86,Movie Ridicule Perfection,10,16 March 2005,"John Carpenter's ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is a recent personal favorite. Hero, Jack Burton goes on an oddball trip through Little China to discover secrets in Chinese Mysticism and the universal plot of obliteration schemed by the evil, yet lovable, David Lo Pan. Although many consider this film too obscure to be taken seriously, Carpenter's intention wasn't to make a serious ""kung-fu action/adventure"" film. At its best, it's a simple satire on generations of action and karate movies. While taking elements from the 80's, it becomes a time capsule holding all things sacred to film goers looking for a break from the monotony in the industry.

331,unclebyblood,John Caprenter's opus magnum,10,11 January 2000,"John Carpenter really steps away from his usual fare in this easy going `fortune-cookie theater' parody that was originally the manuscript for the second Buckaroo Banzai movie.  It features a cast of pithy characters, bizarre and memorable dialogue, entertaining special effects and fight scenes that are well choreographed by western standards.For those of you who already love John Carpenter, prepare for one of his finest moments.  In 1987 Carpenter's sentimental sci-fi-side made `Starman' an instant classic and in 1984 his tense, brooding gothism made `Prince of Darkness' truly frightening.  Sandwiched  in-between these movie greats is the 1986 production of `Big Trouble on Little China', where eastern martial arts mysticism meets John Wayne bravado with zany and often absurdly hilarious results.  How can you not love a movie unwilling to take itself too seriously while at the same time still managing to keep a straight face?Carpenter's skills as a director, producer and songwriter come together in this film to produce what many consider to be his finest work.  Big Trouble' s theme and content naturally compliments Carpenter's style of cynical humor, flashy cinematic expression and loose, caricature-esque  development of memorable story line figures.  If this isn't his opus magnum then it is at least one of his greatest moments as a director.",Big Trouble in Little China

The kung fu scenes are very much like those in the HK movies at the time. Lo Pan is a great villain. This is a classic Kung Fu movie story filmed through western eyes.

Add to that John Carpenter's penchant for creating strange situations and Kurt Russell's perfect portrayal of a semi-hero and you have a true classic American movie. Any movie that can almost single handedly influence a classic video game as much as BTILC influenced Mortal Kombat has to be a hit.Perhaps the biggest factor of this movie are the characters. Jack Burton is the ubiquitous ""white guy in a Kung Fu movie"" and Kurt Russell pulls off a fabulous performance with equal portions complaints and heroics, while the real main players in the story line (Egg Shen, Wang Chi, David LoPan, among others) were perfect fits, mixing in a seriousness of the situation with some very unexpected American humor.This is the kind of movie you can throw in any time. Its great to simply watch, but even if you're busy doing something else, the sound and the music tell the story well, while any scene you watch, even on its own, is entertaining.

I always enjoyed the action sequences and the great one liners delivered by Jack Burton (Brilliantly played by Kurt Russell. And what really sets this movie apart from more recent films is it's engaging story and its great characters.The story is simple and as old as any story that involves myth, magic and heroes. Of Good vs Evil. We have our hero (Jack Burton) truck driver by profession, who believes himself to be worldly and wise as though there is nothing he hasn't seen or done. As you see in the opening sequences, he thinks of himself as a philosopher of life and holds all its mysteries in the palm of his hands.After a night of drinking, gambling and good old fashioned male bonding.By morning to the annoyance of his new friends Jack finds himself the richer man. Yet Wang, an old friend of our philosophizing hero, convinces Jack to give him a chance at double or nothing. Of course Jack doubles his money. Sadly Wang can not afford to pay him at the moment but he can after he picks his girl up from the airport. Escorting his good friend Wang (played perfectly by Dennis Dun) to the airport. Where Wang will collect the girl and Burton will collect the cash owed to him. However our two heroes find themselves being swept up in the Chinese underworld after the kidnapping of Miao Yin (Wang's fiancée). Like any good story we need the princess to be kidnapped.Together Burton and Wang must battle against gangs of knife wielding butchers(or Chinese gangs) cray guys in straw hats,demons and a ghostly apparition named David Lo Pan to rescue the girl and restore all that was good. The story is simple but as the story unfolds you find yourself being swept away with the two heroes as the sequences flow rapidly, giving you a sense of breathlessness and given no time to really think about what has happened. You find yourself engrossed in the ride and the characters.The duologue is rather cheesy and corny but that is what makes the film so great. It is meant to be taken lightly and with a sense of humor. You can not, not laugh at Russell, who you can see is way out of his element as he understand nothing going on around him dispelling his seen and done it all brashnessI think that was Carpenter's want, for the viewer to relate to Burton and see the story through him and he achieved it wonderfully well, I feel. Jack (Russell, couldn't resist) is along the ride with you.The action is fast paced, and the fight sequences are well choreographed. The music fits flawless and perfectly with the story and at no time do you feel as though it intrudes upon the movie, which to me is a sign that the score was well handled.

I do remember a lot about it, like wasn't Rawhead Rex in it at the end? This was a fun inventive movie I hope John Carpenter doesn't stop directing like he said he would or take to long of a break. All great directors will stop, like everyone has to stop, but they have a chance to live forever in the minds of generations to come.Carpenter is proof with this and his other movies that not all great talent is awarded with ""Oscars"" but with the love of a movie fan.

350,whiseykins,Just the weirdest most amazing masterpiece ever,10,12 August 2005,"To anyone who has wondered, ""i wonder what would happen if Kurt Russell was walking in Chinatown and found a drain full of weird 80's kung fu magic"", then believe it or not, this film will answer your question and more. Tarantino tried hard to emulate this spectacle of Kung Fu mastery in Kill Bill Vol.2, but he can't compare to this. B Movie's are meant to be a film that interest sub-cultures and avid film goers, but this is something else. Move out the way Godfather, Shawshank, and all the other wannabes, this is how to make a film. Just give Kurt a gun a girl and a bootylicious (yes, thats right) storyline, and you've got your all time #1.",Big Trouble in Little China
351,phoenix_united_,Why this movie is the greatest movie of all time,10,6 October 2004,"Big Trouble in Little China is one of the few films that generally impressed me and didn't give off a ""fake"" feeling like a lot of movies that are coming out today. I grew up watching this movie almost every day, and I continue to do so now. The characters in this movie are played very well, especially Kurt Russell's part as Jack Burton. The movie blends action, comedy, and even some science fiction/horror, all the while staying solid instead of seeming like a bunch of unrelated parts thrown together. If you are a fan of John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, action movies, the 80's, or a fan of great films, definitely check this one out. In fewer words, run out and BUY Big Trouble in Little China right now!",Big Trouble in Little China

353,Billizard87,Carpenter and Russell give you more action in china as they did in New York,9,21 July 2013,"John Carpenter has always impressed me and when comes to directing a actor like Kurt Russell you are always happy with what they come out with. In this we see Jack Burton(Kurt Russell)taken on the forces of Evil in china town,attempting to find his friends girl friend and a very sexy Kim Cattrel who both have been kidnapped by a deadly sorcerer named David Lo pan who wants to marry the girls and lift his ancient curse forever. But not if good old Jack and his friends from China town have anything to say about it. The action and humour come thick and fast in this classic fantasy adventure with a twist of the western in it. This big fun this Big Trouble in little china.",Big Trouble in Little China
354,paul-ritchie,A film of genuine greatness wrapped in mediocrity,8,18 November 2004,"Like the army of darkness set in china town ! If only it were Bruce Campbell in the lead. This is a total p*ss take, that at times seems just cheesy, lame and mediocre. Yet totally compelling and on occasion brilliantly funny.The battle during the wedding sums this up perfectly where we see the hero display the best contribution to a battle... ever ! Throughout all the mad other worldly crap this film is kept firmly in the realms of reality by Kurt Russell's quips. As he guides the audience through it all.This is probably not a 'must buy', more a must borrow and watch kind of affair. Just pray that some TV exec in a suit decides to play this one on a rainy day.",Big Trouble in Little China
355,pfudurich,Have you Paid your dues Jack?....Yes sir the check is in the mail!,10,1 January 2015,"I have to be bias because I'm a huge John Carpenter fan and absolutely love his story telling. Of his many remarkable stories (Halloween, Escape From New York). Big Trouble in Little China is one of my all time favorite movies. It has comedy, kung fu, fantasy elements with creatures, monsters and magic, and amongst all FUN. It has one liners that stick with you forever, characters that are memorable, and story telling so creative, only the legendary John Carpenter himself could bring it to life. Kurt Russell is in his element brining a Snake Plissken from Escape mixed with a softer Dean Proffitt from Overboard type character. Its not a movie to be picked apart, its meant for you to enjoy. The story is not complex, it is a true guys flick in every sense of the word, and I highly recommend it as a movie on your bucket list to watch.",Big Trouble in Little China
356,apolluxr,wheelchairs,9,30 July 2013,"Carpenter certainly was aware of his time and place with this one. Playing out as a sort of Ghostbusters (same year I believe), ON ACID, Big Trouble might be the ultimate eighties movie. It seems like Carpenter closely observed everything 80's Hollywood adventure movies were about and crammed it into one film. It isn't always equally clear how serious he is about it all. Every now and then hints are given (in among other things the acting style) that everyone in the picture, as lead by Carpenter, is laughing with their own clichés. But it's never as well-aimed cynical or as playfully mean-spirited as, for instance, Escape From LA would turn out to be. But once you allow the absurdity to overshadow the genuine Indiana Jones-like adventure aspect, it becomes a very fun and rewarding ride. One notable moment that you just have to surrender to is when there is a conversation between three characters (two main characters and the main villain) and you realize that all three of them are in a wheelchair, for no *real* reason. Another good indicator for what you're in for is that every single character in this film is an incompetent idiot.",Big Trouble in Little China
357,archmacabre,A great film with a magical atmosphere,9,13 January 2005,"I own this one and have seen it many,many times since i was just a small boy,and its still just as magic as the first time.It has a beautiful atmosphere that makes you (me) want to be there.As you've probably already read its also very fun,well written and directed etc. but its the atmosphere of the film that does it,characters you want to meet and know,places you want to be (and some you don't but they're cool anyway),and fiends you want to oppose.The music's cheesy but great at the same time,it sets the scene and is very memorable.it's a great film,watch it,love it,and share your thoughts and theories on it with me at archmacabre@yahoo.com.au",Big Trouble in Little China
358,dmmetzger,Best Movie Ever Made. Fact!,10,28 March 2014,"I watch a lot of movies. Over 10,000 to be specific. A lot of people say the greatest movie ever made is The Godfather, or Shawshank Redemption, or even Gettysburg or The Natural. To be honest, these are great epic movies that a lot of people can collectively say are great. But I have always looked for a movie that represents me. I want an original stake in movies, I don't want to just be a sheep who likes what they are told to like. I don't want to be everyone else.If I was talented like John Carpenter, I would want to make a movie that would compel people to say, ""Only John Carpenter could make that. Scorsese, Cameron Spielberg, Tarantino, no one else could make that movie"". And I would want an authentic movie, more like life than an epic sprawling production of escapism. Sure movies are an escape, but some movies take humanity, and our existential condition, to a higher plain.Movies are driven by characters, dialog, action, and plot. I watched Avatar the other day, and the dialog was like it was written by a 3rd grader. Jack Burton is the greatest character in film and TV history, only Eric Cartman comes close. Special Effects have ruined action, Kung fu is real action and real actors. Big Trouble action is far better than the artificial fights in The Matrix. The story line is perfect. A tour guide named Egg. A best friend named Wang. Two girls with green eyes. There is no better story.There is only one reason to argue that Big Trouble in Little China is not the best movie ever made. That reason is that you never watched the movie and focused on its greatness during the best movie experience you will ever have in your life!",Big Trouble in Little China
359,nankenba,I loved this movie.,10,21 August 2005,"I really thought this was a great flick.The fighting scenes are amazing, the first one with the 2 gangs fighting is one of the best fight scenes to this day. The music was really good, (norm for John.) And it was funny! Like when *I guess this is kinda a spoiler* Jack shoots in the air, and it blows ceiling parts off of the ceiling and hits Jack in the head. Or when he has red lipstick on, and he is trying to be all manly, it's just funny stuff.It is just a really good movie, and I think if you haven't seen it yet, you should, and if you didn't like it, I think you should see it again, and again until you do.",Big Trouble in Little China
360,klingro,This movie is awful,1,26 February 2006,"Why are really bad movies being portrayed as ironic, parody, intentional, etc? A movie from the 80's has rubber monsters and stupid light effects cos it was intended to be a parody ?!? No, because it was stupid and because even if it was intended as a parody, i didn't had that feeling and all i saw (well, 80%, couldn't last to the end, shoot me) was a stupid ""movie"".PS. The guy from Midnight Caller is supposed to be Bruce Lee's lost son ?!? Wow!PPS. Hmm... 10 lines of text is the limit to this content. Let's see then, I wanted to stop but looks like i'll have to go on. So... Kurt Russel. What's wrong with him? Why can't he stop looking like a dumb truck driver (yes, excellent choice for this movie, except he drives the truck for 1% of its length and manages to bump it in all sorts of stuff) and why can't he refuse this sort of movies? Maybe because he's a bad actor, who knows.Chinese black magic. Wow! I mean WOW! Gods and hells, smoke and mirrors, ""ancient traditions"" and of course big straw hats and spinning knives.Green eyed girls. Yum-yum. Wait, that's a plus for the movie, we're not here for that, I'm only allowing my ISP to bill me more for making fun of stupid movies.Chinese actors. Man, are they really in such a short supply? Are all Caucasian characters in movies made in china/Taiwan/honk-Kong being plaid by the same 5 Caucasian actors? No? Then why do we see the same old 5 Asians in all movies involving karate, Chinese ghosts, swords,bright colors, Kobe Tai (oups) and flying people (or was that daggers... ?)? Yes? I don't care, Hollywood should be better and hire 6 (six!!!) Chinese actors, just to prove they really deserve the Oscars they hand out amongst themselves (yes, i AM aware there is an Oscar for foreign movies, but you're beyond the point)Rubber monsters. I rest my case. (Now it's time to scream ""Objection, your honor, it was the 80's!"" Over-ruled, the 80's don't have to be all about stupid movies, if you can't make a scary monster, don't bother coming to work if you're a director/special effects guy or whatever you have to do to get your name in the long name scroll at the end)The end!",Big Trouble in Little China

362,QUIGLEYIAN,Great fun,10,14 August 2005,"This is a cracking movie. From start to finish it's great to watch something that doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't degenerate into a farce (Police Academy IV). One of the many elements of BTILC that I enjoy the most is just how 80's the whole thing is: from the music to the 'special' effects, to the obligatory white t-shirt sported by the muscle bound,man's man, hero. Another great thing is the fact that there is an actual story - and an enjoyable one too - just the right amount of mythology to make it interesting - an ancient ghost who needs a green eyed girl to marry to lift a curse that will make him flesh again and allow him to rule the world. Yes the acting is hammed up, yes so is the script but all of this just adds to the fun. This is a film to get lost in, a film to crack open a beer and enjoy with your mates. It won't impress 'intellectuals' who aren't happy unless a film is: a) black and white or arty b)Profound But it is a good movie Only a complete tool would not enjoy this film.",Big Trouble in Little China
363,guymcl,"Without a doubt, my personal favorite movie of all time!",10,17 February 2008,"This action-adventure cult classic directed by John Carpenter and starring Kurt Russell is my all-time favorite movie. Not ""the best movie ever made"", but my personal all-time choice for the ""take one film to a desert island"" scenario, bar none. The plot line defies simple one-liner description, introducing us to the swaggering, wisecracking truck driver Jack Burton (Russell) whose friendship with a young restaurant owner in San Francisco's Chinatown (Wang Chi, unforgettably portrayed by Dennis Dun) leads him into a wonderfully over the top confrontation with an ancient Chinese sorcerer (Lo Pan, played by James Hong). A mix of comedy, fantasy and kung-fu action-adventure, Big Trouble in Little China is a wild ride, full of fun and excitement. Russell is magnificent, creating an unforgettable character in Burton, who is the polar opposite of the actor's other famous action-adventure hero, Snake Plisskin from Carpenter's Escape from New York. Where Plisskin is grim and taciturn, Burton is a character who never stops bragging and chattering for a second. (I always wished the two characters could have met -- they'd have hated each other in sight...) The rest of the cast ably supports Russell, at times even unabashedly stealing scenes from him, which he nimbly steals right back in cascading comedic fashion. The earnest, super- competent young Wang Chi is heroic enough to carry any kung-fu epic, especially when backed by the immortal Victor Wong as tour bus driver/wise Chinese sorcerer Egg Shen. Jack is all brag and bluster, but his courage lives up to his swagger in the long run though he is hilariously out of his element as a back-street tough guy facing real magic, monsters and martial-arts mayhem the likes of which he never before imagined. Along the way Jack meets Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), a crusading lawyer who finds herself attracted to Jack despite his incessant posturing when she sees the real hero inside him. The movie is nothing but fun from one moment to the next. I never tire of it, even after hundreds of viewings. This is a cult classic to rival such fan favorites as Buckaroo Banzai, Star Wars and Tremors -- a must-rent, must-own, must-watch-again-and-again wonder. Please let the remake artists leave this one alone -- it is perfection as it stands.",Big Trouble in Little China
364,maillist-8,It's so campy it's sublime,9,23 September 2005,"Kurt Russel plays Jack Burton, a truck driver who finds himself thrown into a situation that includes full scale China Town gang fights, monsters, evil sorcerers and green eyes girls. He just goes with the flow and that's exactly what people watching this movie must do. It isn't a movie that makes a profound statement, it's just one to experience.People that say this movie is horrible, just don't understand it. I can't say it one of the greatest movies ever made but it certainly is one the most fun. It is incredibly campy and that's what makes it so good. The cast is outstanding. It takes real talent to pull off their lines and keep within the movie's style. This one is one of the best and one of the only within it's genre.",Big Trouble in Little China
365,dosriosstudios,Cult Classic,8,17 April 2007,"Simply a great cult classic. I saw it when it first came out in 85-86 and thought it was hysterical. I recently watched it again and I still got a lot of laughs. Overall, I really appreciate John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's work in this movie. It was definitely ahead of its time. It has humor, great kung fu (homage to the genre before it was cool), Chinese mysticism, great special effects, and most importantly it never took itself seriously. :-)I have to agree with the commentary on the DVD, you either love this movie, or you have ""never"" seen it.Rent this movie if you are looking for good light fun.",Big Trouble in Little China
366,mscales1,Guaranteed to entertain,9,2 March 2006,"I often wonder about the thought-processes of the people in Hollywood who vote in the Academy Awards. For whatever reason, they seem to think that a movie is only great is it has some kind of deep meaning or moral. Well I claim them all to be arrogant buffoons, because the sole purpose of a movie is to entertain. If they believed the same, Big Trouble would have cleaned up at the Oscars. There aren't too many movies that entertain from start to finish but this one does, and does so in numerous ways. Whether it be the fantastic plot, the hilarious script and lovable good-guys, the frightening and powerful bad-guys, you'll be in a state of emotional pleasure the entire time. You'll also find yourself in sensory euphoria. The music fits the movie perfectly, but where the movie really shines is in the visual department. The sets, the wardrobe, and special effects are an awesome treat for your eyes.Don't expect to be in a state of deep thought when this one ends, and don't expect to have learned some lesson. Just expect to be truly happy and in a great mood.",Big Trouble in Little China
