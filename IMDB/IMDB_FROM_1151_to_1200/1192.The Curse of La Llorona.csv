0,TheLittleSongbird,The weeping woman,4,3 September 2019,"The story sounded really fascinating and do have an appreciation for horror. The cover looked creepy and the film did look pretty good. 'The Curse of La Llorona' has also been compared to 'The Conjuring' films/universe (with it having the same producers), and being somebody who really liked 'The Conjuring' and its sequel that immediately was enough to get me stoked in seeing it. So was expecting quite a bit in a way, and really did want to like it regardless of its polarising reception.Sadly, am going to have to agree with those that didn't care for 'The Curse of La Llorona', emphasis on didn't care for, that doesn't mean outright hate. It is not as bad as has been said by others or a disgrace to film-making, it has its moments/good things. However, it should have been much better and really goes downhill after a promising start. Of 'The Conjuring' universe films, for me only 'The Nun' is worse but only consider this marginally better rather than infinitely so.As said, there are good things. The photography is pleasing to look at and has an atmospheric look that one wishes was reflected in the rest of the film, 'The Curse of La Llorona' is not a cheap-looking film and the location is both beautiful and eerie. Also felt that Linda Cardellini and the children acquitted themselves very well here, Cardellini especially is very committed in a role that is far removed from Velma Dinkley and doesn't overact or underplay it (instead she is just right).It started off very promisingly, with it being genuinely creepy and suspenseful with a set up that draws one in and intrigues. A few creepy scares early on, and sadly there is quite a big emphasis on moments.Because 'The Curse of La Llorona' falls downhill quite badly too early and not only never recovers it also gets progressively worse. There are often complaints regarding horror films of not being enough jump scares or scares in general, there is also such thing as too much of them. The latter is the case here and too many of them are ruined by too obvious build ups to them thanks to very predictably placed, overused and too loud sound effects. There is very little new here either in the scares, there is a seen it all before and much better feel throughout. The dull pacing, especially in the middle, and the overuse of La Llorona herself (looking quite freaky but the characterisation had too much trying-too-hard) kill the suspense and any kind of atmosphere for that matter.Morever, 'The Curse of La Llorona' can get very silly in the latter stages, with some truly baffling character behaviours that are facepalm-inducing and an ending that is not just ridiculous and rushed but can be seen from a long way off. The general predictability of most of the film is a big problem here. The rest of the acting is lacking, with Raymond Cruz giving a performance devoid of charisma or energy which gives the impression that he is not lead actor material. The pacing when it all goes downhill is all over the place and goes dead in the too many uneventful stretches in the middle. The dialogue is banal and can sound very awkward, while there is an inexperienced quality to the direction, not the visuals but in generating suspense and atmosphere and making the drama interesting.Altogether, promising start but descends into well filmed mediocrity. 4/10",The Curse of La Llorona
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, for what it is",5,23 February 2020,"THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA is another film in the CONJURING universe, although thankfully similarities and links to that overrated franchise are few and far between. Instead this one heads south of the border to explore a Mexican legend previously covered in Hispanic cinema, such as THE CURSE OF THE CRYING WOMAN. It's a standard type of horror film with a familiar plot in which an ordinary family gradually come to believe in the supernatural as they're haunted by a sinister entity, and it does scream cliche throughout. However, I found myself enjoying it to a degree. There are plenty of scare sequences, the apparition is an interesting one, and the pacing never drags. It's a little better than many Hollywood horrors I've sat through in recent years.",The Curse of La Llorona
2,SnoopyStyle,Conjurverse,6,25 September 2019,"In 1673 Mexico, a woman in white is drowning her family. Three hundred years later in L.A., social worker Anna (Linda Cardellini) is struggling to raise her two children after the death of her policeman husband. She rescues two boys locked in a room by her presumed abusive mother. Later, she discovers that the supernatural force at work is coming after her own family.Father Perez from Annabelle shows up. Yes, it's a part of the Conjuring universe. It's the Conjurverse. It's a functional ghost story. There are horror moves but few actual scares. It really needs to be from the kids' point of view. After the success of It, one would expect a studio would be happy to do some copying. It shouldn't be about Anna even if she's the bigger actress. It's also annoying to have the little girl do stupid things. That doll scene is not scary. It's frustrating. Otherwise, the kids are fine. They just need a scene to develop their personalities beyond running from evil. As for the style, the movie needs more 70's. There is a general grimness and various period touches but it needs more. It needs more pop music than Superfly despite the costs. It needs to add exterior scenes of the era even if it's news footage. It needs to get more of the feel of 1973. Overall, this is just good enough for a pass but nothing more.",The Curse of La Llorona
3,claudio_carvalho,Unoriginal Collection of Clichés,5,27 August 2019,"""The Curse of La Llorona"" is a horror film with beautiful cinematography and atmosphere. The cast is not bad and the effects are also good. Unfortunately, the story is absolutely unoriginal, indeed a great collection of clichés. The film gives the sensation of Deja vu and the viewer feels that he or she has already seen it all before, frustrating those with expectation of watching a creepy horror movie. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Maldição da Chorona"" (""The Curse of the Weeping Woman"")",The Curse of La Llorona
4,nogodnomasters,We are not safe anywhere,6,28 April 2019,"This is by far the best La Llorona film I have seen, mostly because it wasn't made in Mexico. Ann (Linda Cardellini) is a social worker, a widowed mother of two. Patricia (Patricia Velasquez) is one of her cases. On a visit, she discovers her kids locked in a closet with bruises. Seems the Weeping Widow is after them and the next thing you know she is after Ann's kids.Building a 40-foot wall won't keep her out. The film draws on the classic jump scares and horror of the exorcism/ demon genre. A good film, just don't expect anything novel.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Curse of La Llorona
5,kosmasp,Making a Mark,6,21 October 2019,"Pun intended I guess, though I don't really remember the characters names and it might only make sort of (pun) sense in my twisted brain. All that aside, this plays in the Conjuring universe, that replaces superheroes for monsters or something other that is evil. In this case it is a folk tale that is apparently very well known in the hispanic community (or at least parts of it). I personally never had heard of it, but the actors are talking about it in brief making ofs on the disc.Now this has all the makings of a ""Hollywood"" horror movie, with jump scares and all the other things you come to expect. Even the dreadful scenes were characters are practically commiting suicide (close enough at least) for inanimate objects or other rather daft and very illogical reasons. Then again, if everyone was acting in a logical manner, most often than not you would not have a movie ... so here we go",The Curse of La Llorona
6,classicsoncall,"""We are facing an evil that has no bounds.""",7,16 March 2020,"When I was about nine or ten years old, ""The House on Haunted Hill"" was the first horror movie I ever saw and it gave me the heebie-jeebies for about a week. Watching it today of course, it's more hokey than scary. I'm not saying the case will be the same with this film, but if you've seen your fair share of horror flicks over the years, ""La Llorona"" probably won't make you jump as often or very high, given the nature of the Weeping Woman and her occasional appearances. Even so, it's probably not a suitable picture for young kids like the ones in the story, who in real life if it happened, would be scared out of their wits. La Llorona herself (Marisol Ramirez) has a demonically gruesome appearance, and impressionable youngsters would definitely lose a few nights of sleep coming in contact with her. My favorite character here was the exorcist 'curandero', Rafael (Raymond Cruz), who had a solid, and even sometimes humorous temperament in dealing with the Weeping Woman, as in his admission that he was using the entire family as bait to draw out the demon. Ultimately, dispatching the evil entity didn't seem all that difficult provided one had the right tools, in this case, some anti-venom from the sanctified tears of La Llorona, and a crucifix fashioned from the bark of a fire tree. Apply at will and there you have it - 'Ta-da!'",The Curse of La Llorona
7,lee_eisenberg,"Lorraine Warren, RIP (also, I understand that this movie misrepresents the Weeping Woman)",5,21 April 2019,"As a horror flick, ""The Curse of La Llorona"" is pretty much what I expected: jump scares, CGI, and incorporation of folklore. I understand that it's part of the Conjuring universe, but I've only seen one of those movies, so I don't know the connection.Now the unfortunate part. This movie apparently misrepresents the titular character. It makes her out to be an evil spirit, which she isn't in Mexican folklore. The other criticism that I read is that the protagonist isn't a Latino.So, if you expect a typical horror flick, you won't be disappointed.I wonder why movies so often show it raining in LA.",The Curse of La Llorona
8,jboothmillard,The Curse of La Llorona,5,31 May 2021,"I only later found out that this film was part of the Conjuring Universe, it is a spin-off with a small connection to the previous films, it is based on the Latin American folklore, I was certainly interested what it would be like. Basically, in 1673 Mexico, a family plays in a field, and the youngest son gives his mother a necklace, who says she will treasure it forever. The boy later goes walking and finds his mother violently drowning his brother in a stream. Horrified, he runs, but his mother catches him and drowns him too. 300 years later, in 1973, Los Angeles, caseworker Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardellini) investigates client Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velásquez) whose children, Tomas (Aiden Lewandowski) and Carlos (Oliver Alexander), have been missing school. Arriving at Patricia's house, she finds the children locked behind a door. Patricia tries to attack her and is taken away by the police. Patricia's sons tell Anna to keep them in the room, so they are protected. Ignoring their warnings, she takes them to the child-services shelter. During the night, Tomas sleepwalks, and Carlos follows him until both boys see a woman in a white dress who attacks them. The boys are found drowned in a river, and Anna arrives at the scene, with her own children, Chris (Roman Christou) and Samantha ""Sam"" (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), in the car while she investigates. Patricia is also at the scene screaming, she blames Anna for taking sons, and that she tried to stop the malevolent force of ""La Llorona."" Chris leaves the car out of curiosity and encounters La Llorona (The Weeping Woman), who seizes his wrist and leaves burns. She stalks him back to the car but leaves once Anna returns. The next day, La Llorona also grabs Sam and leaves identical burn marks. Anna interviews Patricia, who has an alibi for the time of her sons' deaths. Patricia reveals that in her hatred for Anna, she prayed to La Llorona to bring her own boys back and to take Anna's children. Soon after, Anna sees La Llorona when the spirit tries to drown Sam in the bath. The ghost leaves burn marks on Anna's arm. Anna goes to Father Perez (Tony Amendola) for help, the case reminds him of his previous experiences with a haunted porcelain doll (Annabelle). Perez suggests Anna meet with former priest Rafael Olvera (Breaking Bad's Raymond Cruz) to help them. Rafael arrives at Anna's house, setting up items for protection. In the night, La Llorona repeatedly attacks them and attempts to drown Anna and Sam in the swimming pool. During a struggle, Anna pulls off La Llorona's necklace. Patricia arrives with a gun and tries to give Anna's children to La Llorona. Sam and Chris flee, and Patricia comes to her senses and releases Anna, allowing her to help her children. Chris shows La Llorona her the necklace that her son had given her, she briefly assumes her human appearance, imagining Chris to be her real son. However, La Llorona sees herself in a mirror, reverts and proceeds to attack them. Anna stabs her through the chest with a cross made from a Fire Tree: trees that grew by the river where La Llorona drowned her children, destroying the spirit. Anna and her children thank Rafael for his help. When he leaves, Anna sees what looks like a puddle of tears beside the road. Also starring Sean Patrick Thomas as Detective Cooper. Cardellini as the single mother and Cruz as the experienced exorcist give reasonable performances, the special effects are alright, there are the obvious attempts at jump scares, but it is nervy and tense enough to maintain your interest, and it is a different story to the previous instalments, not a bad supernatural horror. Worth watching!",The Curse of La Llorona

10,paul_haakonsen,It was actually good...,6,5 June 2019,"Well, I entered this movie with a somewhat indifferent mindset, because most of the movies set in ""The Conjuring"" universe haven't exactly been cinematic masterpieces, ranging in at mediocre horror more or less.However, I will say that this 2019 ""The Curse of La Llorona"" by director Michael Chaves was actually one of the more interesting and entertaining movies to color this shared universe of horror movies.While the storyline and script wasn't exactly groundbreaking or innovative, it was still thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining, especially because it had that archetypical horror style and formula to it. And it actually worked out well enough at the hands of writers Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis.The movie does, however, stoop to cheap jump scares a bit too often. But it would work much better if it wasn't so predictable that you see it coming a mile away. But I guess that is the backside to being a life-long seasoned veteran of the horror genre.""The Curse of La Llorona"" had some nice acting performances to carry it along the way. And I will say that Linda Cardellini actually carried the movie a great long way with her performance. However, I was most impressed with Raymond Cruz, just a shame that he didn't have a much bigger role in the movie. It should also be said that the performances by the youngsters Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou also really added a lot to the movie.The characters in the movie were nicely fleshed out and this helped the acting performers to really delve into their characters and put in additional effort to the characters to bring them to life on the screen.Now, this being a horror movie, of course there is going to be a force of evil - of some kind. And yes, that was here too; enter La Llorona - portrayed by
Marisol Ramirez. The concept of the entity was nice and the backstory was good, however, the entity just wasn't particularly scary for me. It felt like the make-up and special effects for her were just too mundane and generic.However, all in all, then ""The Curse of La Llorona"" was enjoyable and entertaining. Just don't expect a horror movie that will blow you away with creative thinking. Nor should you expect to be scared to the point of fainting.",The Curse of La Llorona
11,BandSAboutMovies,"Well, it's better than the last one",6,24 April 2019,"Can you believe that this is the sixth installment in the Conjuring series of films? This is the first one to feature a ghost that didn't first appear in the mainline films, centering on the Mexican folklore of La Llorona, which is all about the ghost of a woman who drowned her children in a fit of jealous rage and now cries while looking for them in the river, taking other peoples' children to assuage her grief.
300 years after the opening of the film - which shows how the legend began - this movie begins in 1973 Los Angeles, where social worker Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardellini, who between Freaks and Geeks and playing Velma in the Scooby-Doo films owns plenty of geek hearts) is investigating the disappearance of Patricia Alvarez's (Patricia Velásquez, Anck-Su-Namun in The Mummy films) children. When she finds the boys, they beg for her to keep them hidden. She wrongly believes that the children are being abused, but they are really the next victims of La Llorona, who drowns them in a nearby river.If you've seen these movies before, you'll understand that the ghost moves its curse on to her and her children. You may also wonder how a social worker - even with a dead cop husband - is able to afford such a great house with an in-ground pool. Perhaps you shouldn't think all that much.Now, our heroine is seen as a potential abuser as the ghost woman begins attacking her children. They turn to Father Perez, who was the priest in Annabelle, taking a movie originally meant as a stand-alone called The Children and making it part of the shared Conjuring universe. He sets them up with a former priest named Rafael Olvera who helps them rid their home of the entity, but not before jump starts aplenty and the daughter being dumb enough to value her baby doll over the life of her family.If you're sick of these films, bad news. Annabelle Comes Home is up next. There are even five more films you may not have seen - The Nurse, The Confession, What's Wrong With Mom?, Blund's Lullaby and Innocent Souls - that won a My Annabelle Creation contest and are now considered part of the universe too. Then there's The Crooked Man, which has been in production. These films are moving further away from Ed and Lorraine Warren and more into having their own characters. My wife was totally not into the last one, The Nun, and then she saw that new Annabelle trailer and BOOM. Right back in. And of course, there's another Nun film, too.This movie is exactly like you think it will be. If you love these films, you'll love it. Otherwise, you'll be moderately entertained. It's certainly better than the last one, but that movie felt like examining a bowel movement for ninety minutes.",The Curse of La Llorona

She lives in shadows desperately wanting to replace her own child. In 1970's L.A. supposedly La Llorona is stalking small children. A troubled mother suspected of child abuse and a social worker with her own issues seem to be sucked into a supernatural world.

14,neil-476,"Decent, but ordinary, horror",7,10 May 2019,"This Mexican woman in the 1600s drowns her children as revenge for her husband's philandering. In 1973, her demented sprit is still wandering around drowning random kids. Social worker Anna, not realising this, takes Patricia's 2 sons into care, only for them to turn up drowned. Following this, it seems that La Llorona now has her eyes (or, more accurately, acid-tough hands) on Ana's two children.This tale comes from the Annabelle universe, but is not connected to it. As a standalone horror story it works tolerably well, albeing there won't be any huge surprises for avid horror fans.Linda Cardellini is pleasing as Anna, Patricia Velasquez, so sexy as Anck Su-Namun in the first 2 Mummy films, has not aged well, the kids are pretty good, and there are a couple of nice lines from the exorcist-y bloke played by Raymond Cruz.Of ifs kind, not bad.Oh, and to the staff of my local multiplex, it's pronounced ""Yorona"" not ""Lorona.""",The Curse of La Llorona
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid mainstream genre effort,9,3 December 2019,"Working for a truancy case, a single mother finds the situation has brought her and her children into the realm of influence of a deadly Mexican folktale known as the La Llorona, a figure that targets children and must rely on a native spirit-healer to protect her children from the spirit.This one was far better than expected. One of the films' better features here is the overall impressive and strong technical features that make the film very sleek and professional-looking. The atmosphere of the shots here, from the afflicted kids wandering through the hallways in the asylum where the flickering lights hide the spirit, the confrontation at the crime scene of the children where her kids find the ghostly figure waiting for them or the spirit arriving at her house and toying with her and her kids throughout the night manage to be appropriately chilling and full of high-budget studio gloss. As these scenes then allow the continuous reliance on jump scares featuring the ghost to pop-up out of the shadows, from behind billowing curtains or reflected in wafer have a greater impact due to the thrilling atmosphere. With that atmosphere in place, the second half of the film concentrates on chilling supernatural scenes of the spirit targeting the family. As the attacks get more personal and dangerous, there's plenty of back-and-forth encounters here as the religious undertones and black magic they turn to in order to stop her gives this one some frantic, hard-hitting encounters. As the action here picks up around the house and it gets even tenser as the kids get into more danger as well, this picks up nicely even though this section tends to highlight some generic sequence. Showing them being dragged along the ground by invisible forces, thrown with supernatural force into walls or being so overwhelmed in the use of CGI for the demon manipulating the environment that most of these genre efforts feature. The other great aspect of this one is the fantastic storyline here merging together into a chilling whole. That the initial introduction to the spirit through her work causes the torment o the abduction and outcome of the family which gives the spirit a new target in the kids follows a predictable and worthwhile setup. That the spirits targets begin to affect not only the family but her as well, as the spirit also being a mother looking for her own children thinking hers are the next target adds a wholly impressive backdrop for the finale. The idea of a mother fighting to save her kids from a spirit trying to kill her to take away her children is a powerful theme that runs through the final confrontations, and when added to the influence of Mexican folklore and culture raises the film significantly and giving this one a lot to like overall.Rated R: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",The Curse of La Llorona

So that hell is over.Now the bad, damn near everything else. Mediocre acting combines with a surprisingly unengaging story-line to make this one of the low points of the Conjuring Universe films. The film and everything that transpires within is also the dumbest of any of the films in the extended series. Lastly the lame attempts at 'humorous' one-lines fall flat.The fact that the director of this is also tasked with The Conjuring 3 feels me with far more dread than anything that's contained in this film",The Curse of La Llorona

18,Robert_duder,Another similar entry into The Conjuring Universe,7,1 May 2019,"I love horror films and I like The Conjuring series. Some have been great, some have been good, but all follow a very similar pattern and bring the same things to the table. The Curse of La Llorona is exactly what you should expect and I mean that in a good way. It had some genuinely freaky moments and definitely a few jump scares that got me good and that's not entirely easy to do. It has a strong cast and a familiar story and fans of the Conjuring Universe will likely enjoy it for what it is. Director Michael Chaves certainly has a good handle on the recipe but it also doesn't really bring anything remarkable new to the table either. It would be nice to have something a little more unique and exciting but this one follows the recipe to a T and has Exorcist nostalgia written all over it. Linda Cardellini is very good as the mother who finds her children haunted by the spirit. She usually gets runner up supporting actor status but she proves she can hold her own in the lead in the film. I really wanted more out of Raymond Cruz in his role as the Priest who wasn't really a Priest. I think someone with more charisma on screen was needed for the role. Overall it is a good film, entertaining and a great part of the franchise but not the best of it either. 7.5/10",The Curse of La Llorona
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Tears of boredom.,3,12 May 2019,"'The Curse Of La Llorona (2019)' is the latest entry in the ever-growing 'Conjuring' franchise. It was clumsily amalgamated at the last minute, seemingly because it shares a single cast member with 'Annabelle (2014)'. The result is somewhat strange. It doesn't really feel like a 'Conjuring' film, mainly because there are no real links to the main entries in the series, aside from an oblique reference, and the connections to the series' spin-offs, essentially, start and end with the aforementioned cast member, who basically only has a cameo in both pieces. There's also a brief, entirely unnecessary flashback to explain these arbitrary connections to uninitiated audience members that's so ham-fisted, it's probably the most entertaining moment of the flick. That's only possible because the movie is, by and large, an utter bore. It has a really strange pace to it and just keeps going. I mean, it has about five different endings and actually finishes on what's probably the worst one. It's actually quite difficult to get through, in a way; you just want it to be over. It doesn't help that it isn't scary in the slightest, either. There are several long shots which are meant to build tension but just end up being dull. The jump-scares are quite obnoxious and extremely obvious: the sound drains from the scene, a few moments pass and then there's a loud scream and musical sting. Repeat this, with some crying thrown in for added 'tension', over and over again and you'll get an understanding of the sort of 'horror' that this feature goes for. It's not that inspired and it just doesn't work. There isn't really a logic to the eponymous ghost; it seems as though it can do anything. This 'freedom' isn't used to good effect, though. The few more interesting gags are squandered by subsequent screams or the odd pacing (which I think is a failed attempt at creating 'ever-escalating tension'). On top of all this, there aren't really any characters. No-one has an arc - apart from, I suppose, the side-character of Patricia Alvarez - and they all seem like the most basic version of themselves possible. Therefore, you only care about the central characters as much as you would any random human. It makes the scares even less effective then they would be otherwise and makes for an experience that's less than engaging, to put it mildly. The main issue is that it's boring, though. That's, essentially, the worst sin a picture can commit. 3/10",The Curse of La Llorona

I just wanted to watch some at least OK horror movie on a Friday evening. For around 30 minutes or so this movie succeeded in being an pretty OK horror flick for a dull Friday evening in a movie theater, but eventually this movie did not turn our to be any good. It wasn't scary - and that pretty much says everything you want to know about horror movie. The flick also did not had any sense of humor - its not that is necessary, but for this particular movie it could have helped at least. Acting wasn't anything special to say the least, yet i liked Linda Cardellini's performance - she is the best thing about this boring and not scary flick.Overall, ""The Curse of La Llorona"" (what a name!) is not scary, not thrilling and not involving movie.

Despite that, this was still a creepy tale.The film features very good cinematography, great visuals, good acting, and a few very scary moments. The acting from the entire cast was excellent, especially Linda Cardellini as Anna, the mother. The film reminded me a lot of 'Mama' and the Russian film 'The Bride'. Staying within the Conjuring universe, this was not as good as 'The Conjuring' or even the 'Annabelle' films, but it certainly was much better than 'The Nun'.

28,cruise01,Creepy Llorona but dragged down by a slow direction.,6,20 April 2019,"The Curse of La Llorona (3 out of 5 stars).The Curse of La Llorona is a decent supernatural horror film that does bring some suspense and thrills with the concept idea but kind of a long haul of waiting for something to happen with the movie. Based on a Mexican folklore story, Llorona who is a lady in a white gown and weeping by the river after she murdered her two children. She haunts anyone she can attach herself too and tries to kidnap their children to murder them. The film is decent. It has a decent amount of scares and thrills. But it is definitely cliché. Having scenes set up for a predictable jump scare which doesn't make it jump scare when you notice it coming. The film does drag for the first half hour of the movie which can be a little boring.The plot follows Anna (Linda Cardellini) a social worker who is a widow and raising her two children alone in 1973 in Los Angeles. After she came across a case were Patricia (Patricia Velasquez) locked her kids in a closet. With mysterious symbols on the closet door. Then, Anna's own children are next on Llorona path. Her two children are being haunted by Llorona. Anna seeks out from a priest, which she gets Rafael (Raymond Cruz) who is an unorthodox priest that can try to stop Llorona.It is a decent plot. Yes, the folklore and concept idea can be creepy and scary. The idea of a weeping lady dressed all in a white gown and veil lurking by the river or in the shadows. And the idea of hearing her cry which if you get close and she marks you to be the next victim is scary. The film's direction does lack in trying to be creepy and scary. It is not as scary as I thought it was going to be. The first half hour of the film is slow and boring. It follows the same cliché in almost every supernatural horror movie. Characters walking through the house, hearing creaking noise or something blowing at the curtains. And being haunted by this supernatural force while no one believes them until they see it for themselves. The climax of the film does make up for the lack of intensity and suspense. Anna and her two children and Rafael are trying to stop Llorona from haunting the family. Lots of lights flickering, characters being thrown into walls, furniture moving, and people being separated in a house.Linda Cardellini was good playing Anna, a widowed mother who is trying hard to be a good mother to her children. Raymond Cruz was good playing Rafael, a former priest who is doing his own thing to help free people from negative energy or evil spirits. Patricia Velasquez was also good playing a character who is haunted by Llorona and will do whatever it takes to save her children.Overall, The Curse of La Llorona is a fair film. The concept and folklore is creepy and scary. The film does lack in trying to be scary with a direction that is cliché like any other supernatural horror film. And kind of boring. It does make up for it with a dark thrilling climax.",The Curse of La Llorona
29,TheMovieDiorama,The Curse of La Llorona cries itself to sleep with ineffective jump scares and a repetitive plot.,3,6 May 2019,"""The Bad Spell of My Sharona"". ""What's the Capital of Arizona?"". ""I'd Rather Be in Barcelona!"". The metaphysical entity that has now manifested into ""The Conjuring Universe"" has certainly had its highs, mostly with James Wan involved, and lows. ""The Benefits of Swedish Krona"" may just be the lowest point that this franchise has dipped to. It's rare, especially for me, for a horror film to be completely ineffective yet director Chaves (his debut!) releases a relentless amount of jump scares that were both predictable and tamer than a domestic cat. A case worker uncovers a dark secret involving a weeping ghost known as La Llorona who haunts families and takes children. It comes as no surprise that she starts experiencing her curse.""The Woman from Oklahoma"" is frustratingly poor, mostly stemming down from the atrocious writing. The expositional script is nearly absent of any character depth for both the titular ghoul and Velma (forgive me, but Cardellini will always be my Velma). The loose connection with ""The Conjuring Universe"" is that the father, who explains the entire motives of La La Loner, is the same character from the original 'Annabelle'. That's it. The amount of exposition, for a plot that really doesn't need any whatsoever, is atrocious. And yet, somehow, we practically have no idea why La Macarena is stealing children and how she came about doing this!? All these pathetic explanations and no frickin' depth.Cardellini was sensationally good. Seriously she saves the film from being the worst of the year (thus far...). Displaying a range of emotions for her children and a ridiculously commanding presence. Sweet lord, I love her. But Velma clearly needed the rest of Mystery Inc. to satisfyingly unmask La Diploma. When Chaves decides to unveil the ghost in the opening sequence in her full form, it leaves little to the imagination. This therefore results in every jump scare (and there are many...) and suspense-driven camera movements to be ineffective.There is some ingenuity used in various scenes, the umbrella scare was minimally chilling and the long take following Velma throughout her house was well executed. But it's not enough to differentiate itself against every other generic horror film one could easily find on Netflix. The quality and effectiveness that mostly exists in this cinematic universe is not present at all! Predictable right from the bloody start. Velma's children make so many stupid choices that she should've just given them to La Lymphoma. Do not get me started on that doll sequence as the girl reaches out for it on their porch. There's plenty of choking. Eggs explode blood!? Lord, take me now!Cardellini deserved better. Way better. It started off with an interesting approach on child abuse, but no. Should've known it would throw that out of the window. What should've been a decent mainstream horror turns out to be a supernatural disaster.

Another one from the conjuring universe taking place in the 70s, I was not sure how Linda Cardinleni was going to be the star of this if the movie is about a Central American ghost.
Well, if you don't know the plot, she plays a social worker who takes away a Latina's kids cause she assumed she was abusing them. Turns out it was this Mexican spirt who the latina Woman decided to pray to to take away the social workers kids like hers were taken away.
Linda Cardenlini is so cute however that I think no Latin man would care if she was the star of this picture.
My favorite part of the movie is the charater Raymond Cruz played in it. This guy is similar to that couple who have all the hunted materials in their basement. Hopefully he'll be in another movie and maybe make a cross over with them.
Anyway, the movie was creepy, something that the conjuring universe likes to focus on over being actually scary. It was not creepy enough, however. Though l like there attempts to make light of the genre these conjuring movies are thriving in, it was a little too little of this in between. Too much set up during the hunting which slows down the horror pace.

It did just enough to keep me from hating it and nothing more. The film started off with a semi-decent opening scene. It wasn't overly long but it did enough to set the tone for the movie. Then the tone drastically changes in the next scene, then goes back to trying to be scary in the next, then everything is back to normal, then scary again. This continues for quite a lot of the movie and it really made it hard to stay in the suspenseful mood the film was trying to achieve.The problems with the spirit were very distracting by the end of the film. Very rarely in films like this does anything make a lot of sense, but at least they're not usually as in your face as they are in this film. A spirit that can seemingly do anything, can also only walk through one door to enter a house? An embarrassingly bad piece of writing there. The rules just seemed to be made up as they went along to fit the story.The film's biggest strength is, as you might imagine, 'La Llorona' herself. She is suitably creepy. She was also used a lot which I liked. Often in these Conjuring universe movies the title character goes missing for large parts of the movie. That can't be said here. The film relies on a lot of jump-scares, some of them are actually done very well and caught me off guard. 'The Curse of La Llorona' does just enough to get by, but there are worse things you could do than going out to see it.",The Curse of La Llorona
34,stevendbeard,Mexican Folk Tale Meets The Conjuring,7,21 April 2019,"I saw ""The Curse of La Llorona"" , starring Linda Cardellini-Green Book, the Daddy's Home movies; Raymond Cruz-Major Crimes_tv, Training Day; Marisol Ramirez-Right at Your Door, The District_tv and Tony Amendola-Annabelle, Crazy in Alabama.
This is a horror movie that is based on a Mexican folk tale, and Yes, it is connected to the Conjuring universe-Annabelle makes a quick cameo. Marisol plays the title character La Llorona, whose story starts back in the 1700's. After an infidelity incident, Marisol decides to kill her two children-by drowning them-to punish her unfaithful husband. After realizing what she has done, she kills herself, becoming a supernatural entity, and goes in search of children to replace hers-that she killed. I know, kind of strange logic but remember, this is a folk tale. 300 years later-1970's-Linda plays a social worker that is also a single mom with 2 kids. After an incident with Marisol involving another family and child endangerment, Linda catches Marisol's attention-she goes after Linda's kids-and she has to seek help from a priest, played by Tony. Tony has his own problems-see the Annabelle movie-and refers Linda to a fellow priest/friend of his, played by Raymond. Marisol does look spooky as La Llorona and there are some jump scares but there is also some humor, mostly from Raymond.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.

The reason i say ""little"" is the movie is very low-key, it's got a small bunch of characters & it's really all set in one place which is a big house, it's all small scale but made well with some exciting scares.
I liked the spooky atmosphere & look of the film, the 1970's Los Angeles looked cool with a smoggy haze over the city, it's well photographed & the music is well suited but there's nothing Big about the film but i liked that. The cast is pretty good & that's because we get the always great but underrated RAYMOND CRUZ, I've always liked this dude since he popped up in everything during the 90's & onwards with films like, The Rock, The Substitute, Under Seige, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, Clear & Present Danger, Alien: Resurrection, Training Day & many more. Here we get the older rugged Raymond Cruz as a once ""man of god"" but has left the church & does his own thing now & tackles evil Supernatural forces his own way & he's easily the best part of the whole movie, he plays Rafael & is the man a family goes to for help against an evil Mexican legend that has attached herself to the family, she is La Llorona, the weeping woman, a terrifying evil spirit who likes to kill children!!! She's a very scary creation here & does some scary stuff. The film is a very basic haunted house story & one that does feel very familiar but it's still a good watch & a decent spook fest.
The mum of the family is Linda Cardellini who starred as Velma from the live-action Scooby-Doo films from the early 2000's & there's a nice little wink that role when she arrives home from work & her kids are sat watching Scooby-Doo the cartoon on t.v & i love little bits like that.

46,peterp-450-298716,A standard horror film without too many terrifying moments.,4,5 November 2019,"You used him as bait?
No. I used you all as bait.When I visited Eurodisney near Paris for the first time years ago (it seems like centuries ago), I was so overwhelmed and enchanted by the atmosphere and everything there was to admire. I literally hovered through this park for three days and had the time of my life. At the beginning of this year, I visited the park again (this time with my two young kids) and it was 3 days of fun again. However, it was far from the same as that first time. If you have been somewhere six times you know what to expect and you are no longer so impressed by it. The same applies to this film ""The curse of La Llorona"". A horror movie that is part of the ""The Conjuring"" universe.The entity La Llorona in itself is fairly well developed. But you could also say that about the evil nun that scared you in ""The Nun"". I saw the latter at the beginning of this year and to be honest I found it rather disappointing. After two ""The Conjuring"" films, several ""Annabelle"" films and ""The Nun"" it starts to look like mass production. Now, it's a golden rule that globally well-known brands always do the same thing. And that's not to deviate from its formula for success. It ensures that people aren't disappointed because they know the product very well. But with a product such as horror films, this can also lead to a worn-out formula. A worn off formula in such a way that it becomes boring and far from scary. And that's exactly what you need in a horror. Creepy moments so that fear grabs you by the throat.Not that I've ever experienced a feeling of fear while watching a horror. But this looked weak. I was looking at it as if I was watching the umpteenth repeat of ""America got Talent"". Uninterested and numb. The La Llorona phenomenon isn't remarkable. After a while, you come to know that it's about a woman who drowned her children in a moment of madness and afterward killed herself. The legend grew into a sort of parenting trick that was used to teach children some discipline. I can already imagine how old grandmothers admonish their grandchildren with a standard sentence such as ""If you don't behave, La Llorona comes to get you."" Terrifying for the children. Not so impressive for an adult.""The Curse of La Llorona"" is full of jumpscares. That in itself isn't a problem. At least when they are presented decently and preferably also in an original way. The jumpscares here, however, are so clichéd that you already know in advance where they will be used. The most intense and successful scene is the bathtub scene. Claustrophobic and effectively put together. It reminded me of ""The Drownsman"" (even though you can't call that movie excellent). And maybe the involvement of Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz) can be called original. He's not an average exorcist like the Warren couple in ""The Conjuring"". I tend to think of him as more of a medicine man who performs voodoo-like rituals and lavishly sprinkles tree seeds and puts down a whole bunch of candles, just to stop La Llorona. To be honest I thought it was pretty funny. The moment when Olvera picks up his samba balls. And certainly his bone-dry reply in the end.No, you can't call this film successful. ""The Nun"" wasn't that great, but I still place it above this film if I had to arrange them in a list. Perhaps it's an interesting film for newbies to start with the horror genre. As a warm-up to discover the better stuff, as it were. For the seasoned horror film fan, it's more likely to be a disappointment. So, I kinda have my doubts about the upcoming episodes from the ""The Conjuring"" Universum.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Curse of La Llorona
47,aidanratesmovies,An uninspired and cliche filled missed opportunity,3,12 August 2019,"Disappointing, cliche, and deeply unoriginal, The Curse of La Llorona has the potential to take the Conjuring franchise to so many new opportunities but succeeded on almost none of them. The film seems more like a Conjuring wannabe than an actual film itself, and yet almost nothing about the film seems to be nearly as scary or well made as it thinks it is. The film starts entertaining enough, with a decent premise, and a family to care about at the center as always, but the film goes dangerously downhill from there. Besides the obvious pacing issue, which slows down to a crawl as it goes on, the film's script seems incredibly generic. The acting has its ups and downs, with the script's dialogue not helping with any of it. Raymond Cruz as the film's paranormal investigator, Rafael, is the films weakest acting point with his performance and character feeling mundane at every chance he appears on screen. The worst part of La Llorona however, is that it simply plays it to safe, and is incredibly held back from the potential unique horror film it could have been. The film can be dull, boring, and at times plain embarrassing, though at times it does prove to be somewhat interesting, and also provides some wonderful shots and an adoring look- though that's hardly much compared to other films in the series all pf which are much better than this one.
My Rating: 3.75/10",The Curse of La Llorona
48,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Addition to The Conjuring Universe,7,21 April 2019,"This was a film that I first heard about at the Nightmare Film Festival. I've enjoyed most of The Conjuring universe to this point and was interested to see how this film played out. The synopsis is ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother suspected of child endangerment, a social worker and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm.We kick this one off in Mexico back in 1671. We see a mother, Marisol Ramirez, with her two sons. They are playing a game and one of them closes their eyes. Once he opens them, his brother and mother are gone. He finds them in a local creek, with his mother drowning his brother. He is then next.It then shifts to 1971 in Los Angeles. We see a single mother, Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardellini), as she is trying to get her children ready for school. Her son is Chris (Roman Christou) and daughter Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). Their father was a police officer and was killed in the line of duty, so they are struggling to get by without him. The kids miss the school bus and she has to drive them. Anna is a social worker and she is typing up reports. Her boss tells her co-worker to take over one of her cases for a Hispanic woman. Anna fights with him to let her go, as the woman is suspicious and won't speak with the other woman.Anna and a police officer go to the apartment. It belongs to Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez). Her sons have been missing school. They are found locked in a closet. They are taken into protective custody and Patricia is arrested.That night things take a turn. Anna is woken up by a phone call. She goes to a river where both of the boys were drowned. We saw an entity, La Llorona, took them from the facility, but the mother is suspected. Anna has to bring her kids to the crime scene and tells Chris to stay in the car. He doesn't listen and encounters the entity as well.The family is then haunted by this spirit and it starts to break their already shaky lifestyle. It gets to the point where Anna's work makes a visit, thinking she is abusing her children. She has to find help from her local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola). He believes her as he encountered the entity possessing the Annabelle doll. He tells her it will take time for the church to get involved and directs her to a former priest who does more folk healing, Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz).Now I want to lead off stating, what I was really interested in this film was the lore of La Llorona. I didn't know much about the history of this, but I'm always up to learn more about an entity I don't know much about. This one is interesting as when I heard about this film coming out that there are many films about this spirit. From posts on my social media, it seems that this film takes some liberties with it and that it has changed quite a bit. I think I might search out some of these films to see what is different and look more into this legend.This film has an interesting concept in the job that Anna has. She is a social worker that deals with children that are in houses that could be high risk. I like the idea that the ghost is making those at her work question if she is abusing her own children. Being that she is a single mother, it could be that things have gotten to be too much. There is also an aspect of racism here. Anna was married to a man of Hispanic descent. She states she has built a rapport with them and the other worker is of Asian descent. I found this intriguing though, because Anna is Caucasian. She claims it is because she is a mother and not the ethic background. During this time period of enlightenment, it is good that it was pointed out.I found this film to keep my attention throughout. It doesn't waste any time getting into the haunting and I feel that the film continues to build tension. The stakes continue to heighten as the spirit becomes stronger and stronger. It is actually an interesting curse that those that come in contact with it then have to deal. The climax of the film was pretty solid and Rafael is pretty funny in some of the things he says. Also the ending was pretty fitting for what the film was building toward as well.The acting was also pretty solid as well. Cardellini is an actress that I grew up watching on the television show ER. I thought her as a mother in this film was good and it was a good choice to show her as she is trying to keep her family together with the death of her husband. She is also still quite attractive. I thought both Christou and Kinchen did a solid job. Children are really hit or miss for me; with these two I would say definitely the former. Cruz was good in this film as was Velasquez. I also liked Sean Patrick Thomas who was a detective who knew Anna's husband and Amendola was solid as the priest as well. I couldn't finish this section, without talking about Ramirez and her performance. I think she did a fine job and she had good look as the entity. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.The effects I was pleasantly surprised with how well they were done. There was quite a bit of CGI, but it looked pretty solid. They enhanced La Llorona with them and some of the things that she did. This film did rely a lot on jump-scares, which I'm not the biggest fan of. I do think they were some pretty effective ones in this. It was also shot very well. I was a big fan of the mirrors that were used to show some things. It is a motif it goes back to a few times. Not knowing the back-story might hurt me here, but she looks into them quite a bit and they crack. This is something I'll definitely look into and update accordingly.Now with that said, this film I thought was pretty solid. It is about an entity I don't know much about and I think I will definitely look into, as it is an interesting concept. I have heard there were some liberties taken, which I'm actually interested in learning more about as well. It really needed to mesh into The Conjuring universe which is also part of it and I think it did well there. I thought the acting was good and the editing of the film was well. The effects were CGI heavy, but I didn't have any issues there. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt the film. I do think this is one of the better films in this universe and I found it to be above average overall. It is really a ghostly, but I don't think it is cheesy like many in this genre.",The Curse of La Llorona
49,robertemerald,Good simple urban myth ghost horror,8,28 December 2019,"There are so many things I like about The Curse of La Llorona. I like that it's not teenagers getting bumped off one by one and I like that it's children in the frame here. I like that time isn't given to frustration when a member of the family disbelieves the visions of another. That's often the case in horror movies, but with this one a powerful ghost makes herself known to all concerned. I like that things start happening early. The Curse follows other recent urban myth movies such as Grave Halloween (2013), and The Midnight Man (2016), Slender Man (2018), and The Bye Bye Man (2017). The ghost is very much like that in The Nun (2018). Also, very similar to these recent urban myth stories, one quickly realises that the ghost is super powerful, and thus it will be a miracle if the family survive. The production is what you would expect from Warner Bros, with a great cast, capable acting, good effects, and odd moments of classic imagery. The Curse does suffer a little from a lack of review, as there is one scene where we are expected to believe a terrified little girl would suddenly stop being terrified to retrieve a favourite doll. I didn't buy it, some would, the point is why put a question mark in there at all. Indeed, there were a few occasions where characters turn slowly to see the creeping evil, when anyone real would have snapped around instantly and backed off at the same time. That's a normal human reaction. I get it, movie reactions are about the tension and the imagery. Still. Overall The Curse of La Llorona (or The Curse of the Weeping Woman, as sold here in Australia), is a good horror movie, a worthy evolution from earlier ghost examples, and full of scares and tense moments. This is a movie guaranteed to give you a good hour and more of great horror entertainment, especially if you are liking all the new urban myth movies.",The Curse of La Llorona

51,rgkarim,Cursed To Mediocrity?,7,20 April 2019,"Horror movies, they seem to come a dime a dozen these days, following a carbon copy formula that does not shy away from trying to appease the die-hard fans. With the establishment of universe trends, various film franchises continue to work their hardest to match the success Marvel's comic universe is currently pulling. And tonight's review is a movie that barely finds a way into one of these universes, but still tries to make a claim on its own. Yes, tonight yours truly takes a look at the haunted cries of:The Curse of La Llorona (2019)Director:
Michael Chaves
Writers:
Mikki Daughtry, Tobias Iaconis
Stars:
Linda Cardellini, Raymond Cruz, Patricia VelasquezLIKES:Jumps into scares
Good Run Time
Good Use of Shadows
Decent Acting
Comedic Relief
Good Make UpSummary: A horror movie has to keep the speed going and get to the darker thrills that this genre brings. The weeping woman's journey does not hesitate to give its audience the chills it wants, hopping into the jumps and creepy tone within minutes of it starting. As such, the pace of the movie is very brisk, keeping in time to present as much of the scare fest as they could in the 90-minute run time. For yours truly, the jump scares don't quite get me, but instead the creepy atmosphere is there to settle into the crevices of your mind. La Llorona is all about utilizing the shadows to stoke the embers of your imagination to craft unspeakable horrors. It's those slight sounds and eerie music that were the scariest components for me and it worked well. I'll hand it to the cast in this film, for they sold the terror of the movie, as if they were being haunted. From the kids to the adults, each one did a wonderful job with the limited roles they had in this film. My favorite was Raymond Cruz, not because he was the star of the film but more so the comedic relief used in his role. Despite all the bone chilling screams, and various telekinetic pulls, the rogue priest makes for some laughs without it being too forced. Finally, in regards to haunted make ups, La Llorona does a nice job of the pale pallor, dark lipstick, and gory liquids to satisfy most make up fans. Nice execution, with some haunting special effects makes for an interesting antagonist.DISLIKES:Simplistic
Story Is Okay
Jump Scares not So much
Flat Characters
Trailers Revealed Much
Unoriginal Makeup
Not The Best Connection To The UniverseSUMMARY: While scaring is the name of the game in these types of movies, the fact they are pumped out rapidly leads to some quality drops for this reviewer. The simplistic nature of this film is a limitation for me, the potential decreased by just the simple presentation that they pulled out. No twists, no original edge, and a story that held a lot of promise were all just mediocre for me and led to a story that was hard to grip onto for me. Even the characters were only semi-there, flat one-dimensional people that weren't the most engaging for me to hook onto. Perhaps the scares would get you, but seasoned horror people like me won't find much in originality from scares, nor the most suspenseful climax.
Now part of this was due to me finding tricks of avoiding jumping, and others due to the trailers showing much of these scenes in their brief life on the television. Yes, La Llorona falls victim to the trailer revealing too much, giving you much of the premise in the short two-minute commercials. And while I said the makeup was executed well, this universe is having trouble coming up with unique make ups that don't follow the same template. Because of this, the weeping woman may look good, but she's another pale figure with black lines to emphasize death. And finally, the connection to the Conjuring Universe is like a derivative line touching the main curve. A brief exchange from a shared character it the only opening to the universe and without a teaser or much else to connect, the story telling continues to be lackluster at best.The VERDICT:In truth, the movie about the legendary figure is okay for me. It fills the void of a scary movie for the month, and has some of the traditional means to generate a few jumps. Your best source of entertainment will be to bring those who scare easily to the film and watching them react. Yet in terms of the movie, it's just not the same dark magic that the Conjuring wielded a long time ago. It's got the superficial ""charm"" to it, and uses shadows well to terrorize the actors they have casted/ Fortunately, despite the limitations, the movie has a low run time, meaning you won't be in the theater that long in case it's not your particular cup of tea. Worth a trip to the theater? Kind of, but I'd say this one leans more towards the home viewing in this reviewer's opinion. My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 6.5

52,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Curse of La Llorona,4,9 August 2019,"The setting is 1973 Los Angeles. A social worker and her two kids are being terrorized by a dead woman in a vale. Said dead woman murdered her own children way back in 1673 Mexico. That's the layout of the silly, doltish, and bland, The Curse of La Llorona (my latest review).Starring Linda Cardellini and produced by James Wan, ""Llorona"" is yet another horror endeavor that relies on obviousness and a plethora of jump scares. Heck, there's enough of these scares here to fill five movies. We're talking ""boo"" scary and that's not really scary. Despite being stylish, a la mode, and well cast, everything on screen is about as frightening and/or traumatizing as a dead ant.The Curse of La Llorona is directed by future Conjuring helmer, Michael Chaves. His flick is littered with supernatural mumbo jumbo, cut and dried plotting, and some interesting camera slants (I haven't seen the Dutch angle in a while). Within ""Llorona"", he fails to give any audience member substantial nightmares as they exit the theater. Mikey probably should have consulted guys like William Friedkin, Sam Raimi, or John Carpenter before shooting.And yeah, let's talk about ""Llorona's"" main antagonist. You know, La Llorona herself (""The Weeping Woman""). She is played by Marisol Ramirez and her actions are totally repetitive (especially during the pic's prolonged conclusion). She screams, she's sneaky, and she annoys the viewer with every tired jolt. The demon in The Exorcist makes her look like a shy, doting school teacher in comparison.All in all, The Curse of La Llorona is unoriginal, formulaic, and far from a more superior 70's style of fright fest film-making (I miss the zoom shots and the elongated shots from back in the day). Yup, ""Llorona"" is the lather, rinse, repeat of trepidation fare. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",The Curse of La Llorona
53,justin-fencsak,Not as scary and original as Us,6,20 April 2019,"Out of all the major horror movies I have seen this year, this was was way too short and very predictable yet there was lots of jump scares as I saw it in dolby cinema. Linda cardelinni is amazing and the guy who played the pastor from Annabelle makes a cameo in this film, which kinda has ties to the conjuring universe yet can be enjoyed as a stand alone film.",The Curse of La Llorona
54,eric262003,Looking For Anything Original? Look Elsewhere!,4,17 December 2019,"There was a time where the lovers of the horror genre would gravitate to the cinemas and eagerly await the proceeding feature from James Wan who has become an icon in horror films over the last decade. Starting fresh with ""The Conjuring"" which featured horror films of a new breed that truly relied more on scares and spine-tingling moments over massive body counts and slashing people. This led to him becoming labeled as the leader of a series of films known as The Conjuring Universe. What's interesting about this universe is that the world that is created seems to have some connections to Wan's films and a hint of cross-overs seem to intertwine with each other. ""The Curse of La Llorona"" is the latest addition to Wan's Conjuring Universe. Did you think it lived up to the standards of its predecessors? To respond to that, I would think not. The plot was so formulaic and the plot was pretty much done to death, it quickly wears out its welcome right away. Even the scary jump scares have lost its charm. If this scary film bores you over scaring the viewers, then something is wrong somewhere.It's just the same movie that Wan has churned out over the years but with different characters and different settings not to mention different time periods as well. Because nothing remotely original is happening here we could not care much for the characters even if they are at best emphatic. Sure this phantom like creature has been an iconic entity like Dracula and the Wolfman, but it serves no purpose if fans are not thrilled by the outcome of how bad this film turned out. And even with the film to appease to the Latin community, it does not come across as any different than any of the scary film in the last few years. It's a letdown that when the scary film get a PG-13 rating, it's even more mind-boggling that when it does get an R rating, it does not do much to make it more horrifying.It's a gracious thing the iconic La Llorona has an origin story dating back in time in the 17th century Mexico where a mad woman is frustrated over soulmate for cheating on her with another woman so she gets revenge by drowning the offspring by throwing them down a well. Heartbroken by her grief, she commits suicide and legend has it that she still haunts and when you hear her weeps, you're all in for it. Very soon the film shifts to 1973 Los Angeles with no real reason except to be nostalgic in a period where people were more free from their daily lives and didn't depend on social media, smartphones or quick information. But still we can't ignore the high level of stupidity that the characters do in these kinds of movies.Linda Cardellini takes the leading spot as Anna Tate-Garcia, a widowed woman of two kids who is also by profession, a social worker that is tending with a very troubled woman named Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez) who went off the deep end as she locked her two sons in the closet. The woman proclaims that her sons are being under the spell of La Llorona (The Crying Woman) (Marisol Ramirez). Sadly the boys die, however the ghost turns towards Anna's children Chris (Roman Christou) and Sam (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). Anna's passive ways are expunged when she confronts the ghost. Under the help of Father Perez (Tony Amendola from the ""Annabelle"" series) who then assists her to former priest now exorcist Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz) lets in his inner Max von Sydow from ""The Exorcist"" and to see what he can do to let her not do evil things to them.The sole moment where there was a level of intensity was when Chris and Sam were locked in the car. That was it as this movie offers little to offer in frights or originality. The appearance of La Llorona is more wax sculptured than it is real with its deranged face, blood from her eyes, and her darkened clawed hands looks nothing that we've seen in the past few years. Also the atmosphere is very anticlimactic as well. Under the direction of Michael Chaves (Wan serves as a producer here) believes that the effects to get our gears in tune are rain, thunder and strong wind.Character wise there really isn't very much to get intrigued by because it's virtually the same archetypes that we have seen over the last 10-15 years. La Llorona will only change her ways to which suits the direction this film is geared towards that lacks anything that is climactic. The scary manifestation about the flick is that it's opened to a potential cash-grabbing sequel.",The Curse of La Llorona
55,vengeance20,Decent Edition to the Conjuring Universe.,7,7 May 2019,"Didn't know anything about this film being made until seeing blipverts & trailers of it. To be fair, it didn't look like anything much different from 2018's The Nun or the Annabelle Franchise, both of which are in The Conjuring universe. But this film looked like a good one & as a horror buff, I went in to see it.Well after watching I'd say this film was actually not bad. Pretty decent in all honesty. I mean I will admit the film was pretty samey & again not much different or even remotely iconic from others like it. But it was a good one.The films story was simple enough. A single mum & her 2 kids are terrorised by a folklore legend after the mum takes 2 kids away from another foster mum who is somehow cursed by La Llorona. The film itself is based off the real life legend.The jump scares & visuals were pretty good. Although the film felt a bit bland at times & not very unique in a few of areas. The villains backstory was alright, but could've been beefed up a bit more. However, the film did keep you in & the run time wasn't bad either at 1hr & 26mins. Although I usually prefer slashers, this supernatural film was actually good.7/10",The Curse of La Llorona
56,begob,Disney after dark,6,24 October 2020,"A social worker must intervene to protect two kids from harm, but the harm comes looking for her kids too ...Formula horror that selects the ghost & religion template in the screenwriter software. There are very nice touches in the direction and editing, with an efficient opening scene to establish the mythos, followed by playful camera work to introduce the family. The ghost is well done, and I liked the variety of its manifestations through mirrors and puddles, and even an umbrella. And I did get caught by a jump scare at 40 mins, but I'm a sucker.The problems then come shuffling out of the shadows. Thin plotting and plain characters soon drain the story of its energy, while a few episodes of clunky procedurals crank us along, with two priest characters who surely should have been rolled into one. There's little suspense, and by 60 mins the ghost has revealed as much as it can of its threat. That leaves us with an exhausting thousand metre sprint for the finish line, a full half hour punctuated with ""I love yous"" and aw shucks humour, before all the usual tricks are pulled from James Wan's top hat. I only realised it was part of the Conjuring rigmarole by a clumsy Annabelle insert, but whatever.The performances are fine. Music nothing special.Overall: Scooby Don't.",The Curse of La Llorona

The story is nothing new as usual as an averages horror movie where bad souls freed at the end after creating havoc throughout the movie). A woman drowns her own children at water because husband found another woman to interest and leaved her alone. Then she became children hunter ghost! Our leading actress ( Linda Cardellini) fighting to save her children from La LLorona with the help of a banned ex priest. As said story nothing new and interesting only jump scares is much effective. Acting side in null. No one did impressive acting. Little siblings give some relief between such rough plotted movies.

63,hnt_dnl,Surprise sleeper of 2019,9,25 May 2019,"I'm a bit baffled at the low rating for this movie on IMDb. So far, this is the most entertaining movie I've seen in 2019 in theaters. And these are the other movies I've seen: Us, Pet Sematary, Brightburn. Yeah, I thought all 3 of those movies would be great and were more or less duds, and from the trailer thought CURSE OF LA LLORONA would be a dud and left the theater pleasantly surprised. Spare, tense, scary, emotional, and well-acted, La Llorona is a simple adaptation of the Mexican legend of a woman who in a burst of anger at her husband's abandonment drowned her 2 children and then killed herself, the result of which causes her ghost to manifest itself to women with 2 children as she searches for her own.Linda Cardellini is superb as widowed social worker Anna and mother to the 2 children in danger for the bulk of this film. Both child actors are fantastic and also great character work in supporting roles by Sean Patrick Thomas (as Anna's cop friend and former partner to her husband) Patricia Velasquez (as the aggrieved and vengeful mother whose kids befell the curse early in the movie), and last but not least Raymond Cruz in a scene-stealing turn as a shaman tasked to save Anna's family from the Weeping Woman, creepily played by Marisol Ramirez.The jump scares actually work in this movie, along with welcome and well-timed moments of levity. A simple tale told in simple fashion, but with a ton of emotion and good writing. And finally, this is a great addition to the Conjuring universe and a rebound from that underwhelming Nun movie from last year. I'd rate Curse easily the 4th best movie of the franchise behind Conjuring 1&2 and Annabelle Creation.",The Curse of La Llorona

65,rockman182,The Curse of La Llorona (2019),6,20 April 2019,"I loved the show Grimm. It was cheesy and formulaic sure but it was interesting and I loved the characters. I remember a particular episode based on the famous Mexican folklore of La Llorona, the weeping woman who tries to take the children of other people. I was sort of excited for this until..... I found out it was part of the Conjuring Universe. That's where the hope died. I think the Conjuring Universe gets even worse with each entry and it wasn't anything special to begin with. I thought La Llorona was just okay but its about as cliche and predictable as you would expect.The film is about a child protective services worker who stumbles upon the legend of La Llorona when investigating a family. Soon the ghostly weeping woman starts terrorizing her kids. Now she must try to protect her children from this mysterious and terrifying force that becomes ever present. The film stars Linda Cardellini, who I just found out was Velma in the Scooby Doo films. The film is a stand alone feature but has ties to the Conjuring Universe. I don't know why, but it is so.The film relies on the newer age of jump scares. They are all set up exactly when you would expect the scares to come. Sometimes the weeping woman looks cool, other times she looks like shes an overabundance of computer effects. I think the film is well acted by the kids (which is a surprise) and Cardellini and is funny in some aspects. I liked the fact that the ghost hunter/preacher was unconventional as he had a sense of humor and brings some laugh to a film that goes through the motions and doesn't surprise.I'm happy that as a horror film this was at least more entertaining than the utter disappointment that was Pet Sematary. Still, this is a forgettable affair. Its a cool idea and has interesting mythos but doesn't capitalize to set itself apart. I hope that this film doesn't get a sequel, seeing as everything in the god forsaken Conjuring Universe seems to be getting one.

After ignoring a spooky warning from a mother who has been accused of endangering her children, Anna & her kids experience strange & terrifying events.The Curse of La Llorona is a passable film. Director Michael Chavez has done nothing to change the continuing trend of inferior spin-off movies set in The Conjuring universe, apart from the superlative main film franchise consisting of, The Conjuring(2013) & The Conjuring 2(2016). Annabelle: Creation(2017) & The Nun(2018) surpass this movie. La Llorona ranks at the bottom of the pack, along with Annabelle(2014). The jump scares are super predictable. Linda Cardellini is brilliant as Anna Tate-Garcia. Roman Christou is superb as Chris. Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen is fantastic as Sam. Raymond Cruz is great as Rafael Olvera. Marisol Ramirez is impressive as La Llorona. The supporting cast is good. The Curse of La Llorona is not a must watch.

67,fernandoschiavi,"Completely generic, The Curse of La Llorona goes little more than a combination of horror scenes and sudden scares",5,17 June 2021,"With the success of The Conjuring, Warner Bros. Had the idea of creating a horror franchise exploring secondary characters from the main franchise (cases of Annabelle and The Nun) or using other myths and urban legends for this universe. In the latter case fits The Curse of La Llorona. Even though the release of the film does not assume that the plot takes place in the same universe as the couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, the film is set in Los Angeles in 1973 and puts a family in the path of the haunting of the title, a woman who chases children after having drowned his own children. The creature comes from a Mexican urban legend, but the script isn't too concerned with honoring those roots, just pulling the central figure and putting him in a film with formula and no identity.La Llorona is a mother who killed her own children, in symbolic revenge against her adulterous husband, and now, maddened, seeks to appropriate the children of others. The mother, the ultimate symbol of care and protection for most societies, becomes a danger to the little ones. This Mexican Medea's cry of pain is real, not just a trap to seduce little children. Likewise, people's compassion in the face of distant crying - that is, what makes us human capable of empathy - is the same element that puts us at risk. In other words, our humanity and our family love pose the real threat in this horror movie.With an uncreative text in character construction and plot development, ""The Curse of the La Llorona"" takes some time to find an interesting rhythm. And among the horror sequences, the problems of the script are evident, which uses shallow or questionable arguments to connect the scenes. This can be felt in the way that much of what is presented in character development is of no use to the story - apart from giving one or another punctual detail. The absence of the father figure, for example, is shown with some emphasis in the opening scenes, only to be brushed aside afterwards. Perhaps this is why the family nucleus has a function of serving as an object for fear. Linda Cardellini (""Green Book: The Guide"") plays the role she's been given well, and you can feel her dread as she gradually discovers what's going on. The actress is committed, but can do little in the face of a script that shows no interest in the role. The goal here is fear for fear, no attachment to the characters. And in this sense, the horror scenes are conducted with care, which results in great moments where the tension is maintained and, mainly, having the final scare as a reward for fans of the genre. Llorona's first appearance is a good example of this. With an intelligent assembly and using the corridors and photography very well, the result is satisfactory. In the same way as happens in the sequence of the swimming pool - which is beautiful in construction -, punctuating the terror and the scare very well.However, while the execution is intelligent and satisfying, on the other hand there is little connection between what we see and how the spirit manifests itself. Naturally, as is common in the genre, it is necessary to have the suspension of disbelief activated. And in this, those who are more attached to details may feel uncomfortable with some events, generating even ridiculous scenes, including. The impression is that we are facing several horror shorts (some of these sequences are relatively long by the standards of the genre), forcibly interconnected by an uninteresting script.However, it is in the last act that the main problem of the film lies. The villain's exposure significantly reduces her fear, and her appearances have less impact. The exaggerations committed by the narrative also call for improbable situations to be disregarded and the problems of how Llorona manifests itself are even more inconsistent. And finally, there is a terrible attempt (here in the bad sense of the term) to create moments of comic relief that are unjustified, disrupt the rhythm, and are ineffective.La Llorona is a weak antagonist: little about her story is explained beyond the basic premise, which results in uninteresting and impersonal ways to fight her. She also doesn't have the same presence as Valak, the demonic nun, which in itself greatly alleviates the film's visual impact. What really complicates it is how director Michael Chaves, in his first feature, fails to create tension in an original way and compensates with cheap scares. Among the Evil Summon derivatives, this one is easily the most appealing - and also the least effective. Thus, what could be a bolder movie for the studio and more in tune with the more profitable market ends up not daring and bringing a small and unnecessary connection with the franchise to which it belongs and would not need to belong. With five works already released, and at least two more in production, it was to be expected a more interesting link than simply confirming that the events belong to the same reality. Therefore, their intention to show themselves present in an already existing universe is frustrating or, at the most, dispensable.The Curse of La Llorona goes little more than a combination of horror scenes and sudden scares, those very predictable and that smack of the aforementioned formula of the Evil Summoning franchise. The entire intermediate act serves as a collage of situations for the long and final combat. Relatively interesting, but also with its feet rooted in the sameness that pervades mainstream horror cinema today. There are moments of breath, as clear references to other horror classics and, especially, the children's performance. The two are no longer just victims of a curse to become direct agents in the last act of the film, either in favor of the solution or as another element of horror. Both Samantha and Chris draw attention for different reasons and bring some differentiation in relation to other productions, especially when La Llorona takes Anna and healer Rafael (Raymond Cruz) out of the equation. Still, however, there is little that represents an escape from the curve or an actually scary element here. It is possible to mention, perhaps, an unpredictable factor related to La Llorona herself (Marisol Ramirez), which sometimes appears with ferocity and, in others, appears in a sneaky way. The problem, however, is that the spectator always knows when she's going to show up, only being surprised by her way of acting.One of the positive points of the film is certainly in terms of acting, with emphasis on Linda Cardellini who, increasingly familiar to the public's eyes, shows that she can hold the prominence of a film of this size without needing other stars to brighten up the supporting roles. When there's a problem with your character, it should be attributed to the film's poor dialogue work. In some moments, the scenes are even confused and, in a few others, maybe even nonsensical. It must also be said that the choice of how to conduct the story with Cardellini's character is somewhat flawed, and the spectator may end up questioning her attitudes and actions, which is an evil for most of the protagonists of the genre. Another role that can be awkward within the plot is the one played by Raymond Cruz. Within what the film proposes, his character clashes with his recurrent catchphrases and all his appearance as the protagonist of action films from the 1980s.The technical and creative team of The Curse of La Llorona does a great job of nuances - something very important in horror, a genre so fond of manichaeism. The house is neither too sloppy nor too cared for; the lighting is dim, as would be befitting a mother who spends little time there, and barely opens the windows. Actors are not ugly, nor are they overly beautified. In particular, the camera work is needed, from the long sequence shot at the beginning, with the children running inside the house, to a scary scene with children in a greenish corridor, very well set up, through the irruption of a scary figure in dark and muted flashes.The director Michael Chaves even ventures into a subjective plan of La Llorona, observing the house from the outside, and another image that starts as a point of view of Anna (Cardellini), until the character appears inside the frame. Some risky scenes in terms of direction become as beautiful as they are frightening, because they mix affection and danger - see the hair washed in the bathtub, or the children trapped in the closet. This becomes a war between mothers, or even the symbolic battle of a mother who, in order to be good at her job, needs to harm the family of others. The problem is that Chaves does not bring anything new to the formula created by James Wan. Not that he's the only one - all the directors in the franchise try to follow that, but each one adds something of their own, no matter how small - but he's certainly the one who least experiences the scary moments. It's a film that looks more like a compilation of Wan's techniques, such as the sequence shot to introduce the environment at the beginning, or playing with threats coming from various directions, such as the scene where the main children take refuge in the car and have to stop their children from doing the windows to open one at a time.The Curse of La Llorona represents the big problem of this expansion of The Conjuring: producing a saga of movies on an assembly line. All come out with the same structure, but seeing it repeated with less and less experimentation in the plots, scares and tension leaves a truly bitter feeling - something intensified in a feature film with shallow characters and situations. Completely generic, filmmaker Michael Chaves does what he can, adds shots that reference Evil Dead and other horror movies, achieves an average result and proves that James Wan's base franchise derivatives still have many curses and entities evil to behold.",The Curse of La Llorona
68,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Another Conjuring universe dud,5,19 July 2019,"This film probably has better jump scares than The Nun had in my opinion, but I don't like horror films that depend heavily on jump scare films. But some of the jump scare scenes were original and I pretty much have seen them all. My biggest problem is that the story takes place in the early 1970s, but I didn't think the director paid enough attention to details to pull off that era. It just didn't feel like a 1970s story. Another thing that bothered me was the skimpy backstory and logic behind the film. Also, why were they all trying to keep a secret of how they gotten their burn marks on their arm?. I think Anna Tate-Garcia should move down to Arizona with her kids to avoid La Llorona from trying to drown her kids. lol. I just don't think there was a sincere effort at creating a convincing story. So I give it a 5/10. It feels like the folks behind the Conjuring universe is getting sloppy with their stories.",The Curse of La Llorona

70,kuarinofu,This has to stop,4,20 July 2019,"Seriously, these half-baked ""horrors"" based only on ""produced by James Wan"" credit should stop. I know everybody has to be like Marvel now, but I don't think we need a horror universe which this movie is trying to build. Come on, Annabelle, Annabelle Creation, Annabelle Comes Home, The Nun. In this movie, they even make sure to mention that this is the Conjuring ""cinematic universe."" Jesus Christ, even Universal tried and failed miserably with their Dark Universe.I understand these type of movies are reliable in terms of profit since they are low budget and make a decent amount of money in return. But it really doesn't work this way. The first Insidious and the Conjuring were way too good, and as these movies go, the newer ones never came even remotely close.And here we are in 2019, with Insidious movies turned into complete schlock (Insidious: The Last Key) while Annabelle ones were never good in the first place (besides Annabelle Creation, which was ok). The Nun is a slasher movie, Annabelle Comes Home is a horror about Warrens without Warrens, damn.And now comes this one. The Curse of La Llorona provokes two emotional states. It's a pain to watch mostly due to its stupidity while the acting is so bizarre it makes you laugh (Raymond Cruz was so odd in this). The writing is terrible, the premise itself is ok, but the characters are non-present. Some of them don't even have anything to do in this movie, and yet they still waste time establishing them (the child services lady, the father, the father's cop friend). Nobody has a real character arc. Cardellini's character was so ignorant toward her kids (and their injuries) WHILE WORKING IN CHILD SERVICES, how does this even make any sense? And she never even tried, like when they put the kids in the closet to protect them, THEY WERE NOT EVEN IN THE SAME ROOM.They could've gone the psychological horror way, as they did in The Babadook, and the premise would've made this possible. Instead, they just show you La Llorona in the first 20 minutes, ultimately killing all your interest in this movie.The Curse of La Llorona was not only a lousy horror but a bad movie altogether.",The Curse of La Llorona
71,Neptune165,La Llorona comes from a tradition of the American countries. Precisely from Mexico,4,26 July 2019,"Every thing was OK until the eggs scene from this moment the movie fall into disappointment. They took such a unique legend and made la llorona come after a family who doesn't even live in mexico. I'm more amaze of the fact that she crosses country borders I mean that legend is well known all throughout Latin America, for decades at least it should've been filmed in Mexico with more unknown Latin actors/actresses this movie didn't look unique in the slightest. Looks exactly like every other ""supernatural demon terrorizing a family"" movie. This is beating a dead horse in the horror genre and I hope someone comes up with an intriguing idea of one of these for once. ""Takes place in the Conjuring universe"" Literally why? when that priest mentions ""Annabelle"" So that they can get more people to see it since Americans haven't heard of la llorona but they have heard of the conjuring lol. Yes The folktale is way bigger than that. I don't know about you all, but i'm personally super sick of every horror movie being about ghosts and demons. The world desperately needs a really good, home invasion/abduction alien movie. Like the grey aliens from Signs. They're my absolute biggest fear. Probably the most famous Mexican scary urban legend..RUINED!! I hope a director from Mexico or Spain does it justice in the future. La Llorona is a South Western US and Mexico legend.

73,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,18 April 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)It's not as bad as The Nun, let me write this straight away. If there's one thing that this movie proves is Michael Chavestalented filmmaking skills, which offers hope for The Conjuring 3. Contrary to the other spin-off of the universe, The Curse of La Llorona toned down on the lazy exposition and elevated its scary sequences, simply by having a more capable director. Beautiful one-take scenes are spread throughout the runtime, which not only increase the suspense but prove that Chaves actually works hard to provide a terrifying environment.He also delivers some effective and innovative jump scares, even though most of them still follow an annoyingly predictable timing. These are still heavy on the cliche of ""character turning her head, big ugly monster face screams and the score goes from silence to screeching volume."" Scenes like these aren't scary anymore and they feel dated, as well as the typical origin story. There's nothing new or exciting in an ""urban legend turned true."" Fortunately, the backstory is simple, it isn't filled with explicit exposition every two minutes, and the short runtime helps the film to develop through a fast pacing. Sadly, it's just another common horror screenplay that the writers took from the scripts cabinet.Linda Cardellini gives a strong performance as the protagonist. Even though every character in this movie makes questionable decisions that lead to avoidable events (something inevitable in horror films), Anna is a compelling and courageous woman, who only wants to do what's best for any children, not only their own. Raymond Cruz portrays Rafael, a priest who sort of almost is a deus ex machina. He barely has any kind of decent character development, but he works well enough as comic relief to lighten up an otherwise too dark tone. The kids are good, but Patricia Velasquez (Patricia Alvarez) is way over-the-top, which doesn't help her already not-so-good script.All in all, The Curse of La Llorona is ... okay. It's not near as horrible as The Nun, and honestly, that's a good compliment for such a typical and cliche horror flick. Michael Chaves truly saves what could have been a disaster with another director. Wonderfully handled one-take sequences, which elevate the suspense levels, and he also produced some imaginative jump scares, even if most of them still lack actual scariness. Linda Cardellini is great as the lead, but every character is compelled to make dumb decisions to move the plot forward. Some characters needed more care in their scripts, and more focus on the story to tell instead of just creating scares after scares.Close, but not close enough ...",The Curse of La Llorona
74,virek213,"Good Enough, But It Should Have Stood Out On Its Own",8,4 September 2021,"One of the great (not to mention utterly terrifying) legends of Latin American culture, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States, is that of a figure called ""La Llorona"", or ""The Weeping Woman"". It is told that a woman who married a Mexican rancher in the 1670's and bore two children by this man proceeded to drown those same children in a river in a fit of blind rage when she saw her husband with another woman. She drowned herself not long after, but wasn't able to enter the afterlife; and as such, she is said to roam the Earth until she can find her children. The legend was the basis for numerous Mexican horror films from the 1930's into the 1960's; but up until recent times, it was not considered prime material for an American treatment. Then came 2019's THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA.As part of what became known as ""The Conjuring"" series of horror films, which had begun in 2013 with THE CONJURING, THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA is set in the Hispanic community of Los Angeles in 1973. Linda Cardellini stars as a Los Angeles County social caseworker investigating the truancy of two children belonging to a client of hers (Patricia Velasquez), who seems like she is on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. And then when Velasquez drowns her kids in the Los Angeles River, she blames Cardellini for it, and that she was only trying to save them from La Llorona. Cardellini, though not one to believe in religious superstitions, nevertheless consults with a local priest (Tony Amendola), who informs her of this particular legend. Although he himself is prohibited by the Catholic archdiocese from getting involved, Amendola encourages her to get into touch with a local shaman (Raymond Cruz), who, though he may have lost his faith in the church, still maintains an independent contact with God. Cruz, along with Cardellini and her children, the latter of whom are the ones that La Llorona wants, must confront the condemned woman (Marisol Ramirez) in a bizarre and terrifying.While it may have been profitable for the Mexican legend of La Llorona to be part of the Conjuring franchise, one wonders why that was even necessary. While not necessarily an unflawed horror film, relying a bit too much on jump-scare shocks like the rest of the Conjuring franchise, and, to be fair, more than a few horror films that have been released this century, THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA could have actually succeeded on its own. The legend itself, involving infanticide, irrational rage, and much more, provides enough for a solid terror opus. As it is, the film does suffer slightly from the aforementioned problems, plus occasionally clunky dialogue in Mikki Daughtry's and Tobias Iaconis's script, and some slightly ripe and overtly sincere acting on the parts of Amendola and Cruz, who seem to be this film's equivalent of the Jason Miller and Max von Sydow characters in the 1973 horror classic The Exorcist.All that said, however, THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA is spooky, scary, and terrifying during a goodly amount of its 94-minute running time; and although there is one bloody moment at the film's climax, it is never over-the-top in its viscera. Director Michael Chaves, who made the 2016 short film THE MAIDEN, does get a solid enough performance from Cardellini in the role of the mother and caseworker having to confront a centuries-old legend that threatens to do to her kids what it did for Velasquez's. Ramirez herself makes for a very scary, not to mention ghoulish, impression as La Llorona. When the film does divest itself from the strict confines of the Conjuring series, THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA, in addition to the references to The Exorcist, also pays loose homage to other great horror films, such as THE HAUNTING (the original 1963 Robert Wise-directed film), Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING, and the 1982 Steven Spielberg/Tobe Hooper classic POLTERGEIST.Had it followed its own convictions and the reality of what made those aforementioned horror classics the great genre films they were, especially given the legend it bases itself around, instead of being a franchise film, we might have had an outright 21st century horror classic. Even having said that, however, there have been far worse horror films (read: HOSTEL; SAW) made over the last forty years; and going by that standard, THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA comes closer to master status than most of its kind.",The Curse of La Llorona

The scenes that are supposed to be frightening, merely deliver on coveted frights; not to say the lack of urgency left a bad taste in my mouth.Do they ever realize that immoderate repetitions of the same tropes over and over again make it all the more predictable and wearisome? And please refrain from putting redundant 'witticism' where it's not at all needed! I despise that.Luckily, on technical terms; things aren't that grim. The Cinematography is decent enough and so is the Score in the background. Both being very much generic; still, they get the job done! Performances aren't worthy of any special mention; but again, it would suffice I guess!This movie is a prime example of speculative execution and wasted opportunities.

Everybody loves to attack an actor's abilities in a film but few know how difficult it is to translate the emotions in a film like this onto the screen believably, and two standouts for me in this movie were Linda Cardellini (AKA Velma, of course) as Anna, the mother, and Roman Christou as Chris, one of Anna's two children, who gave a fantastic performance and, despite this being his first major film, has shown himself to be talented in the field and has the potential to make a successful and prolific career out of it.

Sure they manage to give it a brief initiation (not discussed here due to spoilers), but it really does feel like the stand-alone work that it is. It raises the question, however, whether this was ever intended to be a Conjuring Universe film or if it was a film Warner Bros. was unsure how to handle so they slapped the Conjuring label on it knowing the horror fans would support it in massive quantities.Either way, despite being warned of what an awful movie this was, I walked away pleased and excited to see where the universe goes with other ""stand-alone"" films in the future.",The Curse of La Llorona

Any who thinks film is nothing special but I think this deserves higher ratings if you want dark horror to be full on scary and madness and darkness staff like that watch this. The Haters and bad Reviewers always have issues with understanding any film. Do not believe what they say they are lying through their teeth with their stupid reviews who knows what the like who knows what they want ? i never understand why but sometimes people trust your instructs trust yourself and never pay and listen or read at reviews or that's a bad movie i wanted this i wanted that sometimes your aren't going toget what you get, but people just don't know what they want and decide to flop this movie i am like ? jeez give me break at least it's better then film US Jordan Peele what did he do with that movie to be in Process of anything no he didn't and remake of Pet Semtary even more boring i heard that crap gets pass but not this ? people wake up this is real great horror movie it will keep you One and a half eye closed, it's full on their isn't cheap jump scare scenes. this movie will freak you out completely without it. i would say it's 3rd best installment in Conjuring Universe film next to Nun. this has a very interesting story as well Ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother Anna Tate-Garcia
(Linda Cardellini) suspected of child endangerment she had a husband that died he was a police officer you do feel sorry for the family itself because Anna has 2 kids witch i thought they were good but not annoying like Annabelle Creation or some another horror movies where they were so annoying. Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), Chris (Roman Christou) and you have cast you will know and haven't seen for awhile Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez) known for Mummy (1999) Anck Su Namun she was in it their and their she is good actress. her character has those 2 kids were killed because Anna didn't listen or believe in her that llorona is real. but their is a lot of scary scenes in movie that was well made i liked it, it looked scary more intense of terrifying their is. Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz) known for Under Siege, The Rock, Blood in Blood out, From dusk till dawn 2, Collateral Damage, Breaking Bad every single movie or TV shows out their he did, he plays a interesting character
in this film he is like priest but he is not really of priest he is guy that knows how to deal with evil and spirits. La Llorona is in entire movie she is not Annabelle just appears their and their, the film does have Suspense but not like the Nun does because Suspense in Nun doesn't show it until 40 minutes of movie but in this she is in it the all time, i should call it a non stop horror film it keeps going on and on, the story and direction, characters is pretty good you do get sometimes dumb scenes in horror movies but their aren't that much in this only 1 scene from movie that's it really but characters make smart their little problems with lead character in film witch i thought it was dumb where she got same hard burn mark and her kids have it she doesn't tell to therapist she got mark as well and explain how she got it she saw it as well ? that's dumbthing to hide secret when her kids got it ? that scene got me bit upset, but rest of film it was entering, fast forward film, full on horror not much built suspense some people hate it but this film doesn't have it but it does but not as much suspense like Nun or Conjuring or Annabelle any another horror movies. I highly recommended if you hated Nun or Annabelle boring or slow as those films if you didn't like them give this a try if your massive horror person it's totally worth it to check it out if you love full on horror this is it, watch it with your lights out if you ever watch it with your lights on it won't make sense at all because you will end up like chicken.",The Curse of La Llorona
89,SkullScreamerReturns,Zero originality but I was somewhat entertained,4,28 January 2021,"I was curious about this movie because I've heard about the Mexican legend of La Llorona. I'm not too familar with the story but my hunch is that you could also make a better movie out of it...What you have here is your very typical horror film where a demonic spirit is attached to a family and then some spiritual guy comes to to help them get rid of the monster. That's it.In the beginning there is a very short prologue that is set in the 1600's. Then it switches to present time (or 70's or whatever) and I was a bit disappointed. I thought this mythical monster would have suited better in a more distant historical setting. Well, 70's is a good place in time for a horror movie but then it's also more likely to feel like every other horror film. And instead of Mexico they also decided to place it in Los Angeles. Great... you had this intersting folklore character but you decided to strip it from all of its unique quality and make it like every other monsters. That's the biggest issue. There is very little feeling of Mexican folklore, but it's more like every other demon/ghost movie with just some scary woman as a monster.Even though the movie was totally unoriginal I can't give bottom points because I wasn't bored either. I liked the visual style and quite slow haunting mood which was similar to other films in The Conjuring franchise (though lacking the visual period piece setting.) The monster effects weren't as good as the buildup. The first glimpses of the monster were creepy but when she started having more screentime it became cheesy.Conclusion: If you expect something new, don't watch. But if you're a fan of demonic curse movies, then you might want to check out this basic genre flick.",The Curse of La Llorona

91,Just-A-Girl-14,Decent horror film,7,1 November 2019,"The Curse of La Llorona is another spin-off of the Conjuring Universe franchise (the sixth if I'm not mistaken).It's an interesting film based on the Mexican folklore of la llorona, the weeping woman. The legend tells of a woman who was abandoned by her husband and out of grief and anger drowned their two young boys in a river. As a result of her actions the woman is condemned to wander for all eternity searching for her lost children. She is always heard weeping for her children, earning her the name ""La Llorona"". It is said that she kidnaps wandering children at night, mistaking them for her own.It's a decent horror movie, spooky with lots of jump scares. If you're looking for ""the next big thing"", this movie is not for you but as a spin-off it's pretty good.

The movie is shot beautifully and La Llorona looks really creepy but the things that happen in the movie made me chuckle. They conveniently do stupid things and somehow get away with it.

94,Mike_Devine,Not much more than cheap and disposable horror,4,1 February 2020,"In the horror/supernatural genre, there are some movies that were filmed just to appeal to the masses. These cheap, disposable scaries usually do well at the box office from a profitability standpoint, but they are not long for remembering. 'The Curse of la Llorona' falls into this category.Sure, 'la Llorona' has a number of elements that have the potential to make a good horror film. From a single mother (Linda Cardellini) who is just trying to do the best for her kids (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou) to a centuries old ghost with an axe to grind and, of course, the Catholic Church. But in this instance, the fright factor just isn't high, and the actual scares are few and far between.The best moments of 'la Llorona' are when the haunting presence is not visible (the pool scene comes to mind), but there are too many times where the overly CGI'd la Llorona causes things to fall flat. The highlight of the film is surely when Cardellini's social worker heroine character detects a presence in the house and pursues to investigate. If 'la Llorona' was built around these kinds of moments, it would be a much higher quality product. But, it's not.One redeeming aspect of 'The Curse of la Llorona' is the incorporation of Mexican culture, which sets it apart from many others.

So IF you like that sort of movie this is not too bad until you get to act 3 when the ex-priest enters the picture. From that point you may as well just skip to the last minute as nothing happens during this time. You're just just waiting for it to end and it's become a giant sleeping pill by that time. It doesn't have the payoff twist or resolution of bad guy type ending it should have. It's just a let down. You may enjoy it all, it depends on the viewer.

97,fciocca,"One of the stupidest, trivial and laziest horror movies that I have ever watched",1,13 February 2021,"I guess that saying that this movie is set on The Conjuring narrative universe is good enough to attract people to the cinema. This amazing franchise was unfortunately already ruined by ""The Nun"", but of course Warner Bros needs to squeeze this lemon, even if there is no one single juice drop left: they just dropped a random scene in the middle of the movie that lasts less than 30 seconds, and voilà, here your amazing and well thought connection with the universe. Bur clearly this is working, because ""The Curse of la Llorona"" was in fact a commercial success.The movie was clearly not directed by James Wan, which is one of few directors that managed to master the horror genre and was able to bring it to a larger audience in recent years. Even if The Conjuring 2, was not at the same level of the first one, it managed to really scare the viewer, by bringing somewhat something fresh. Here instead we have all the most basic clichés of the genre: rocking horse that suddenly moves, predictable jump scares with loud noises or music, doors that slam and last, but not least a ridiculous amount of voodoos rites, that are completely useless. There is no structure, there is no character development whatsoever, therefore you don't care about any of them and you hope that la LLarona kills them instantly, so the pain will be finally over. A lot of choices that characters take, does not make any sense and you really wonder how it is even possible that they manage to survive every time. They must be very lucky.I feel really sorry for Linda Cardellini, that took part to amazing productions such as ""Mad Men"" and ""The Founder"", being part of such an awful project.

director:Michael Chaves
starring: Linda Cardellini,Raymond Cruz,Patricia Velasquez,Marisol Ramirez,Roman Christou,Jaynee Lynne Kinchen etcoverall rating 84/100The curse or la llorona was terrifyingly good. It had so many good components and was very cleverly made and put together with its excellent cinematography. Lets get into more detail about why this film worked on so many levels.First lets start of La lloronas great and fairly detailed back story. At first i thought this was going to be an issue due to then only showing Llorona drowning her children,but luckily they went into more detail about her reasoning for her actions and why she haunted children. These details just added greater understanding into why La llorona does what she does and the aftermath of this led for a very entertaining movie. Also the character design for Llorona was excellent. She was terrifying to look at so whenever she appeared on the screen it generated a feeling of fear which is the intended aim of this particular genre. And i loved her apparent innocence and ways of cursing people, she lured people to her by crying so she seemed from a distance a normal women but obviously this was not the case so this was brilliantly done.Next the film developed and excellent tense and nerve wracking tone. This film did a brilliant job with keeping you on the edge of your seat due to the long dragged out scenes with no sound at all, this made you nervous about what was going to happen as you dont know whats going to attack the family. The film did this excellently and therefore it was was not generic or predictable due to there not being a build up in the soundtrack.Next the film had excellent and clever cinematography,settings and jump scares. This film was very creative and unique compared to many other horrors. In particular i loved the green flashing lights and the umbrella scene. These were excellently crafted and genuinely caught you by surprise when a jump-scare happened as they led you to believe one was happening but then did nothing only to catch you by surprise a minute later. So i thought considering its very small budget the film did an excellent job with its creativity and detail.The main thing that annoyed me was the really dumb and frustrating decisions the children actors made. I mean this is to be expected from a horror movie. But i was nearly screaming at the screen at how dumb the children were, every time they were finally safe from La llorona they found something they wanted or walked towards a noise to stop them from being safe. This was just annoying but to be expected. And i also found it slightly annoying that the children ( Roman Christou and Jaynne lynne kinchen) did not tell there mum about seeing La llorona for a large portion of the movie. But once again this is to be expected as otherwise there would not of been as much of a movie and i guess they thought there mum would not believe them so this i understood a bit more.Next i loved the little conjuring universe links. To have a cameo appearence from Tony amendelo from Annabelle was fun to see and a good way to get more people to see the film. Although warner brothers did not market the film enough as part of the conjuring universe which i thought was weird but the film is still good enough as its own film to stand out from the crowd.And finally this film was exceptionally well acted. The kid actors did a surprisingly good job in there roles. And showed a surprising amount of versatility in there performance as a lot of child actors are fairly wooden due to there lack of experience but not in this case. And the star of this film Linda Cardellini was fantastic here. She has added even more versatility to her already big resume with a fantastic and believable performance here of a troubled mother trying to protect her kids. You felt her sadness and pain also fear so this was another phenomenal performance from Linda.So overall despite a couple of flaws expected from the horror genre. The curse of Llarona was a terrifying and creative horror film that should keep the horror movie buzz going for a much longer time to come.",The Curse of La Llorona

103,movieman6-413-929510,With La Llorona they turn an interesting Mexican myth into a standard horror film.,4,20 April 2019,"The Curse of La LLorona is a new horror film directed by Michael Chaves, the director of the short films Billie Eilish: Bury a Friend and The Maiden.The film is about mother Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardelini). Her husband was a cop, but died, so now she only has to take care of her two children. She also works at child protection. Here she is involved in a conflict between a mother and her children, who claims that an evil spirit by the name of La Llorona tried to take her children from her and kill her. Anna does not believe the mother, but later learns that the mother might be right about the evil spirit. In her own household, she notices that her children are starting to behave differently. To protect herself and her children, she seeks help from a priest who can help her fight against the evil of La Llorona.They have based this film on an existing Mexican myth, but have adapted the film too much apart from the idea. For example, they have just turned an interesting idea into a standard horror film. This way the film also comes across as predictable, because you have seen most of the situations in the film better in other horror films. The film is also supposed to be part of the Conjuring horror film series, but there is little to be seen. Only a character from another horror film of this series makes an appearance in the film, but the scenes of the Conjuring films make the timeline somewhat confused.For the script writers, this is also their second script they have written. This can be seen in the many unclear situations that happen in the film.
In addition, in all these different situations, the evil spirit always seems to have the right powers to get hold of its victims, which often also simply ends with a predictable jump scare. La Llorona also looks a lot like other evil demonic spirits such as the Nun of the Woman in Black.The acting is done nicely in the film, but because of the stupidly written script, the characters make stupid decisions. The characters come across as stupid, which means that as a viewer you don't really care about them anymore after the umpteenth stupid mistake they make.",The Curse of La Llorona

The problem is that anyone who's ever seen more than one of these kinds of movies will be able do predict every beat before it happens and it gets tiresome to watch things play out exactly how you know they will. It also doesn't help that the monster at the centre of the maelstrom is such an over the top, schlocky CGI cliche that it's hard to take seriously.

I wouldn't quite say it was worth he price of admission but it was a lot better than it had the right to be. I really wish that we got a better background on La Llorona and more screen time/scares from her or at least more brutal moments. The characters (minus the fallen priest) were dull and uninteresting despite good performances, and the scares were scarce rather than scary. The script was also bland and cliche.

120,MinistryofDoom,Appropriately Creepy albeit Formulaic Ghost Story,6,25 August 2019,"In the Curse of La Llorona, also referred to as ""The weeping woman"", a social worker, Anna (Linda Cardellini), is forced to remove two children from their home, placing them in foster care. Unfortunately, the mother of the children was very superstitious and had been protecting them from the curse of a vengeful phantom woman who steals children. When the children are removed from their home, La Llorona is accidentally released and sets out to terrorize and steal children in the community. Anna discovers the origin of the curse and sets out to vanquish La Llorona before it takes her own children.When I watched this film, I found myself thinking that it looked a little too similar to another film called ""The Woman in Black"" which starred Daniel Radcliffe. Nonetheless, this wasn't bad in terms of horror. I was surprised, however, that it was part of the Conjuring series. I haven't seen much press indicating it to be so. Upon viewing the film there are only one or two very brief string connections to the greater series which you will surely miss if you haven't already seen the Conjuring films and are knowledgeable about their events and characters. I suspect that this was tacked on a last minute decision. Without the Conjuring imprint, it would have just been another ghost film that would have entered and exited under the radar.

It lives up to nothing. With the film's starring ghost virtually being a Mexican knockoff of the Nun (notice, this movie is better than the disastrous ""The Nun""), and originality as absent as creepy atmosphere, this film is a completely dissatisfying piece of horror movie. The combination of lackluster acting, uninteresting characters, and reused plot elements, with absolutely nothing being innovative or original, ""The Curse of La Llorona"" seems like nothing but a cheap try in not having the audience forgetting about the Conjuring Universe and it's upcoming films. But when the creators relievers their audiences this sort of pointless movie making, they might just loose them before their next release. I mean, slightly remixing the score from ""The Nun"" and placing it in this 1970s-set (you forget the decade five minutes into the film) is sad.

126,eelen-seth,"Jump-scaring a grieving family is so wrong, but try to explain that to a ghost who drowned her own children..",7,17 April 2019,"La Llorona is a very well known tale in Latin American folklore. It's the story of a woman who, after her husband left, drowned her kids in a fit of rage, realised what she had done and took her own life. The legend goes that now she kidnaps children and drowns them, mistaking them for her own. Urban legends and ghost stories are always a good formula for a horror movie, so the ever expanding Conjuring Universe is cashing in on this and making it one of the best chapters we've seen so far.It's a very impressive and frightening film I must say. Having watched all the other Conjuring Universe-films (Annabelle and her sequel, The Nun and The Conjuring 1 & 2), The Curse of La Llorona or its Australian title The Curse of The Weeping Woman is the best chapter after the very first Conjuring. The cheap scares were more effective, mostly because there's more build-up and atmosphere, and the scares feels more deserved.The film starts in the 1600s with Maria (Marisol Ramirez), later known as our titular ghost, taking her children to the lake. We jump to the 1970s, and meet Anna (Linda Cardellini) - a freshly widowed social worker providing for her two children (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou) - who discovers that one of her clients, Patricia (Patricia Valesquez), has her two boys locked up in a closet. The boys are quickly taken out of her custody and La Llorona strikes, passing on the curse to Anna's children. Desperate for a solution, she turns to an eccentric priest (Raymond Cruz) to rid their house of its newly acquainted curse.The Weeping Woman mostly takes place inside Anna's house, but there's more layers to the story. Personal grief while trying to take care of children who are also in mourning, the whole stigma around a single mother working, mixed-race kids, and why this Latin American curse hits them. They're all part of the story and blend pretty well to make it one cohesive tale. Cardellini shows us a side of her acting chops we haven't seen before, and sells it very well. After her last big film Green Book, where her part was almost non-existent, its nice to see a woman of this calibre lead a horror film and isn't afraid to take on a different challenge. The genuine fear, but taking charge of her role as a protective mother, always feels and looks real.As far as the rest of the cast, there's not much to talk about. Cruz as a priest is a little bit fascinating, but doesn't have a big enough role to get excited about or to leave a lasting impression. The children are mostly screaming or thrown across rooms like dolls, by La Llorona.It might feel a little bit repetitive at times and plays out like a short film stretched out to a feature length film (best comparison I can give you is Lights Out, directed by David F. Sandberg - Shazam!). The best bits of the film definitely include Cardellini and some incredible imagery. But only being 93 minutes long, is more than enough for the story to be told. Director Michael Chaves is also taking over from James Wan to direct The Conjuring 3 (he's still producing and writing the screenplay), so I guess this director is just getting started and will grow to a larger scale in his next feature. The only advice I could give to new director Chavez is to not rely too much on what other horror masters have done in the past, create your own urban legends and voice.",The Curse of La Llorona

The actors are all very good, especially Linda Cardellini who gave the role more than it demanded. The cinematography and sound mixing are great. The story... well, at least it does take the time to let the viewer engage with the characters before they start making dumb decisions. There isn't much here that's likely to surprise horror fans, with the possible exception of the mother being brought in on the 'ghost is real and she can see it too' a whole act earlier than you usually see in these movies. Otherwise, it's a jump scare fest with a few good setups and one nice long tense sequence near the end, but mostly it's just a competently made generic supernatural film.",The Curse of La Llorona

That is a rarity nowadays so I'm giving a higher rating than most.Granted the story and the ending may not be that great, but at least the movie is satisfying at the end. Many other horror movies just end whenever the movie pleases.It is not without its flaws. If La Llorona's objective is to find scapegoats to die in place of her children, why didn't she stop after the first two children?And if La Llorna is so easy to kill, why didn't anyone else try to kill her before? And why didn't she take precaution against the thing that could kill her?I wouldn't pay to see this in a theatre. But watching a rental or streaming is ok entertainment.",The Curse of La Llorona

133,domtaylor,"It's not scary, it's just annoying.",3,21 July 2019,"'The Curse Of La Llorona' is about as bland and generic as a horror flick gets. There's absolutely zero character work here, so there's no reason to care about any of them, which obviously makes things a lot less scary in the first place. It would help if the scares weren't as cut-and-paste and predictable as they are though. There's little to no attempt to create tension or an atmosphere, and instead we're just left with the most unremarkable of jump scares to 'frighten' us. If they were actually effective it would be slightly less of a problem, but since it can't even manage to make you jump with a loud noise, you know there's something wrong. The entire film consists of characters looking in one direction as the music drains out and things go quiet, then turning around and being screamed at by the eponymous 'La Llorona'. That's not scary, it's just annoying. The narrative is very thin, too, and what's there is as formulaic as a picture like this gets. You don't even need to see it if you want to be all caught up on the events of 'The Conjuring Universe' either because its links to that are tenuous at best. It does lead to a hilariously bad attempt at tying the film to said universe, though, which is one of its more memorable moments thanks to how badly it's done. It's a shame that Michael Chaves has been chosen to direct 'The Conjuring 3' as well because there are far better directors that have worked inside of this franchise. 3/10",The Curse of La Llorona

136,gerry_barnaby,Hell has no fury like a woman sorned. One of the most frightening and sphine chilling films of the conjurying universe,9,3 May 2019,"As the legend goes the real La Llorona also know to be recognized as the La Malinche of the Spanish conquistadors Cortés' story dates as far back as the 1400s, where people calm to have seen a woman in white crying, but when investigated nothing other than some unfortunate event that happen around those that see her. It's from these Encounters over the years she has been known as an omen of death to those that come in contact with her ghost or hear her crying.This is what truly adds to this film The Curse of La Llorona because it based on a legend, it truly set an example of hell have no fury over a woman scorned. Even though Michael Chaves who have done for the better lack of word a great horror film here, you can tell it got James wan influence written all over it has he was a co-producer to this film.The way this film draws you to its dark moody atmospheric nature which really set the tone for the whole movie, especial when it doesn't Ease up on the tension. Because when this film gets really dark and creepy, its truly give you the chills down you spin with small supernatural moments but the lighting effects and use of shadow movement and shadow play as you starr in the darkness give you that overwhelm sense of fear which this film really plays on.This is how you make a supernatural horror film work when you already show the supernatural spirit, the way they portray La Llorona her self is truly terrifying. It like imaging that you have children yourself you have this complete relentless dark evil twist spirit after them, it how can you protect them from this, when it powerful enough to get you from anywhere.This is what this great horror film does, it put you in the shoes of the family with a mother trying everything in her power to protect her children from an evil spirit, it gets intense and frightening and the tension builds up. This is a perfect example of how to play with the audience mind draw them in and give them spin chilling moment that chills you to bone and throw in a few moments that scares the living hell out of you.I love the fact they got an actually Mexican actress to play the role of La Llorona in instead of some model looking woman with a model looks and little CGI which gave appearance more of a real look which made it even more frightening. Give a more Authentic feel of a woman's spirit twisted by Evil over grief and tumoral.What great also is this film connects perfectly to the Conjuring universe with a certain mention from one of the other events, allow the audience to know that this event happens in the same event timeline as the others. With perfect acting and great moments of frightening scenes truly is one of the most frightening films in the conjuring universe..Dislikes: Despite this film being frightening and possibly one of the great supernatural scares the living hell out of you film's, there are a few flaws.1. There were two moments where a certain character trying to make a Joke in an intense moment, they joke kind of fell flat and didn't work.2. There was one moment that was a little too predictable, which I think the audience will see coming.Other than that the film was great, one the of the best horror this year so far.Overall: Frightening, Psychological, Dark twist story, one of the best out of the conjuring universe",The Curse of La Llorona
137,cwade22,"Acting, writing and casting an issue.",6,26 January 2020,"The lady playing the mom is either very rusty with acting or the writing told her to react very slow to things and to just be a bad mother. The daughter was DUMB! How old was she? Old enough to remember warnings and follow directions, but NOPE! Her dumb doll was more important than safety of herself and everybody in the house! DUMB! The two brothers at the start, in Los Angeles, were also dumb! Failed to communicate WHO hurt them and WHO they feared! They could've saved everybody time if they at least mentioned La Llorona name at the start. But they didn't!The mom of son and daughter was just dumb. Went to hospital, doctor sees burn marks on son's arm, looks at the mom, the mom doesn't even try to explain it! Cops come, she seems like abusive mom. Very annoying and dumb character. Maybe it's the writing or maybe the acting was void if reacting and understanding specific circumstances. Daughter was really dumb, though. I don't care if she's young, she's old enough to know better! She's going to grow up to be another dumb Los Angeleno who can't drive, can't park inside her parking spot lines and is just dumb! I've lived in this city 11 years to see it. She's just going to grow up to be dumb! Talking about the character not the actor playing the daughter.Not sure if it's the bad acting or bad writing in those areas but these characters were dumb and hurt the movie a bit. Why did the priest give the mom the necklace when he first met her? She didn't seem to be in any stress. It made no sense.The lady playing the Mom of the daughter and son either is rusty with acting or maybe it was the writing, but I didn't like her at all in this movie. Her character made so many mistakes that a regular person wouldn't make. Maybe it was the writing but could've been her acting. I didn't like her. I kept asking ""who would marry her and have children with her? She's so dumb!"" That's what is think every time she'd do something stupid.The movie had potential to be great but a few flaws with the writing, acting(lack of realistic reactions to things) and just dumb things characters would do took away from the potential of greatness. It's slightly better than average because of the concept and the ghost lady, but the aforementioned flaws held it back. I think the mom should've invited her husband's partner to witness the ghost lady at the house. But whatever. Could've been way better. And maybe even gotten a sequel of the flaws were gone.",The Curse of La Llorona

You can tell these spinoffs are just cash grabs without much substance at this point other than the excellent Annabelle 2 imo. This film follows every predictable horror formula imaginable and had one of the bare bones plots. There are some effective scenes that work though seem by the numbers and lacking originality. Most of this is just darkly lit cheesy jump scares with horrendous screams and ridiculous acting across the board. By the time the finale comes you're ready for it to be over. Michael Chaves will also be directing Conjuring 3 and that does not sit well with me after seeing this mediocre product. Hopefully Wan will oversee a bit more with that film.

155,robinsonaustin-07490,It'll Leave You Weeping,6,24 April 2019,"The Curse of La Llorona is the sixth installment of the Conjuring Universe taking place in the 1970s sometime around the time of the main Conjuring films. This movie involves one of my favorite urban legends that being a Mexican tale of La Llorona. According to legend, La Llorona (Weeping Woman in Spanish) was once a beautiful woman who drowned her children in a blind rage after she discovered that her husband had found another woman to replace her. Realizing her mistake, she tossed herself into the river to join her sons in death. However, this was not the end for her. Because of her committing two of the most ultimate of sins, she was forever barred from the afterlife, unable to pass off the earthly plain of existence until she found her children. Her story was told as a way of teaching children to behave lest La Llorona would get them and drown them if she realizes they weren't hers.So you have an interesting premise of the ghostly lady haunting a family. My only real problem is that whenever it comes to spinoff films in the Conjuring series or prequels, they tend to fail at being truly original with their scares. La Llorona looks no different than any other horror monsters wearing a dress and being a tall and lanky figure much like some examples such as The Ring. It's as though the producers of the film were afraid to branch out from the Conjuring movies by sticking to one house becoming haunted. It's not even getting into how the film's plot can be predictable at times.The children in the film also consistently made stupid decisions that impeded on their chances at surviving their experience with La Llorona unscathed. It all hinges on copying the basic horror formula down beat by beat.With that, the actress that plays the social worker having to do with a vengeful spirit does a good job with what she had to work with. Other than that, there is actually an allusion in the film that shows how it's connected to the rest of the series, but it was otherwise an average film.",The Curse of La Llorona

157,willians_franco,Predictable horror film,6,9 August 2019,"A film based on a Mexican urban legend (a folklore) about a spirit of a woman who, attacked with jealousy, drowned her children in the river and, when she realized what she had done, and consumed by guilt, drowned in the same waters and was cursed, and wandered the Earth in search of children to stay in their place. From the knowledge of this legend, parents send their children to behave and listen to their elders or else the spirit (La Llorona) will come and take them away.
After several years, this formula for horror films begins to saturate. It works like this: there is a spirit that torments and kills some people. So they call a priest/medium/healer to expel the entity. Then the film develops into a climax where there is the final confrontation with the entity, ending the film with a question mark if the entity was expelled or not. This is another one that follows the same formula and, therefore, it is no longer frightening. At least not to me. The thing is so repeated that you are no longer taken by surprise by the outcome of the plot.

The jump scares are fun, though predictable, but I love a good jump scare, as long as the film keeps me interested. La Carumba has a very murky, dim aesthetic, most scenes have flat lighting and very dark interiors, and to be honest, it works, it adds to the atmosphere and gives the film a very bleak outlook.The characters are fairly one dimensional, and stands as one of the weaker entries to the Conjuring series, but it's better than The Nun, and if it had better direction and stronger writing, then this Curse would certainly be one that sticks around.",The Curse of La Llorona

God damn. There must be thousands of better and more creative horror scripts and horror directors out there. Just split the same money over 10 of them and make something decent instead. But this is what the masses want? Another stale McHorror?",The Curse of La Llorona

It jumps right into the story without proper introduction of the legend nor the characters .

170,daryopeek,The curse of jumpscares,6,25 April 2019,"I have never been giving this much effort to watch a movie. The long-awaited ambush of Avengers: Endgame turns ALL theaters in my town into their screenings and leaves no mercy for other movies. Some of them are too bad to end early, but La Llorona probably is going for good.As the newest installment of Conjuring Universe, La Llorona follows a single mother with her kids that terrorized by murderous spirit La Llorona or the Weeping Woman. The titular character comes from Latin folktale that delightful to dig it in terms of her background and terror mechanism. Unluckily, this movie only offers jumpscares.Jumpscare is the main selling point for me when talking about Conjuring Universe. Their jumpscares are innovative and unique on their own, unlike the story which always felt super thin, which unlike the other horror movies, able to justify much weakness of the film. La Llorona seemingly drives from that thought and develop all the way to become a whole movie.La Llorona feels so ambitious to make all scenes horrifying, the grey dominated sets, the raining-cloudy days, dark halls in the house, just hoping that the formula will attract audiences. However, the lack of logic in/and the story, distaste me for liking this movie further. Cringe comedic-like acting, big background story with no significance to the climax/whole plot, and the mechanism of La Llorona in haunting, confusing me while been scared by many one-shot jumpscares that unable to increase the horror.Although I like the movie to be fast-paced and the jumpscares are innovative, this movie gives a warning to the producers/directors that this pattern starts to be stale. How if they rely on the jumpscares too much? How if they forget to write the plot? I think it's a curse to limit your horror creativity into one big picture of disturbing images throughout your filmography. I hope the next Annabelle movie will be smarter because it's a pity that all jumpscare workshops the director probably had only to be damaged by a weak plot.",The Curse of La Llorona
171,gluonpaul,A by the numbers horror but done fairly well,7,3 May 2019,"So this movie in broad strokes has been done many times, its your fairly typical american style ghost story where the christian church fights the evil spirits.The story has most of the standard cliches of such a storyline but to be fair although the basic story isnt very original its done fairly well here. The ghost is quite good, the background story for the ghost is decent and most of the acting in this is pretty good too.It seems this is ostensibly part of a horror ""universe"" with the annabelle movies which is fine, perhaps they will build it into a full set of movies. it would be nice to see more horror movies in the cinema.Overall I would say if you are a fan of horror movies this is worth seeing.

178,Clintekabor,I haven't heard that name since I was a child. The weeping woman.,5,7 December 2020,"The curse of La Llorona or also known as the curse of the weeping woman's biggest major flaw is it's unoriginal story. The movie looks and feels like a old foreign movie that was filmed on an extremely low budget in the 90s.The effects of La Llorona were just ok but far from terrifying. The film starts out somewhat interesting where it is set in Mexico in 1673 and we witness the violent drownings of two young brothers by their Mother.Then however the movie carries on a tedious trajectory by moving to 1973 in Los Angeles which feels quite uninspiring and dull. About halfway through the film you start holding out for a big reveal or the climax hoping that something would get you a little animated. However this films ending was also very ordinary and cliche.I had no idea it was supposedly linked to the conjuring universe considering the fleeting appearance of the Annabelle doll which was probably the one true surprise and highlight of the movie.The cast were modest but to be completely honest they didn't have any memorable parts that you are going to want to remember.I won't carry on too much here. The curse of La Llorona was a bit of a let down and overall a very sub par film at best. It didn't leave you hooked with a gripping story but instead it made me keep checking the clock to see how long of the film was remaining.I don't like to be overly harsh and negative on films without good points of evidence and my own personal opinions. But there was just not enough tension and excitement to keep you interested for the full 90 minutes of runtime.I like to say there was a moment or two like many films that keep you intrigued and involved in the story but for me it didn't really get out of first gear, the lack of suspense and the absence of plot twists made this a film that I'll happily only watch once.I could only recommend this film if it were on Netflix and you had absolutely exhausted your film library or it was in the bargain bin at your local DVD store otherwise don't hold your breath for an original horror masterclass. To finish on a positive note however this movie is slightly better than 'don't knock twice' but only just.5/10",The Curse of La Llorona

I like how the family that is being tormented is introduced to the demon because the mother is a social worker. There are some jump scares in the movie but I don't mind. One very scary scene is when the kid has a clear umbrella and you can only see La Llorona through it. The 3rd is fine but nothing great.

This movie would have been over by the beginning. When the CPS mom went to her house and asked what's wrong? Where are the kids? She gives a cryptic answer, while looking nuts. Why not just say there is an evil spirit here trying to steal my kids , so they're safe in the closet. Then she blames the CPS lady for her kids dying. Uh no lady, it's your fault, you should have said something. The way La Llorona was after the kids in the end, why when she opened the closet door, did she not come right then? Why does she wait all night till they are moved to another location, just to kill them in a completely different location? Why did those kids act cryptic too, saying ""she"" did it, while everyone thinks it's the mom? Why didn't the CPS lady's kids say, mom there's a Spanish bride coming after me look at my burns!! If the fire tree blocks her from coming in the house, why did she go through the back door? If she could, wouldn't she go through a window? Why is she acting like a home invader, can't she just appear? Why is everyone so calm? How did the little girl stay in the pool that long, had to have been 5 minutes, just to come out coughing? So many more questions but I'm done asking them. I wish they would start making some good horror films because I think this is a bad trend. No one tries anymore...

184,kamikaze-4,Annabelle U,5,20 April 2019,"I always have been fascinated by Mexican horror films. That's why I jumped at the chance to see The Curse of La Llorona. I remembered in my youth a local station showing English dubbed Mexican thrillers such as The Man and the Monster, as well as Curse of the Doll People. Once, and only once, did I see a film titled Curse of the Crying Woman AKA La Maldición de la Llorona (1963), AND IT WAS SCARY! I saw the poster for the Curse of La Llorona, and decided to give it a look see. I was hoping this movie would be Mexican made thriller that retold the story of the Crying Woman. Oh well, I should have done some research on this film. The movie was a good scary thriller until it became apparent the movie was a homegrown US thriller from the Annabelle Universe.

TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. When the girl looks out the door I already knew it was for her doll and voila, that was it. Everything is fortuitous. The stupid shaman that is trying to be funny, the kids behaving so foolish that everyone in the room wanted to punch them, people laughed and they were angry (but that's the script's fault). The other mexican crazy lady that becomes bad and vindictive in order to finish the others, and in the end is redeemed from one moment to another because the plot says. This movie is like a Mexican fast food in the USA that you find in a corner, which is not the REAL FOOD in Mexico. It has good things and I know that there are people who like this kind of cheap fear, and there were some who got scared in the room and even shouted and covered their faces. SPOILER: In the end they kill La Llorona, that's like killing The Bogeyman, totally absurd, that's an urban legend in all Latin America, a folklore, a woman who lost her children and is walking around kidnapping others.

But for the most part, it's annoying. It's not a good bad movie.The children are not well-written or well-acted. Their performances are wooden and their actions don't make sense. The lead actress is doing her best in my opinion, but she has to react to a really poorly directed monster, and it's sad how ridiculous these scenes can get.The conjuring reference really sticks out like a sore thumb.

Annabelle was a poorer film and I actually preferred the sequel to the original. The Nun was diabolical and yet - I lasted an hour of that film before giving up. I literally walked out of this mess after 24 minutes.Where to start?The CGI - rubbish now so imagine it in a few years when technology goes even further.The plot - *spoiler warning* The Weeping Woman is the ghost of a woman who killed her children to teach her cheating husband a lesson. She then killed herself and now walks the earth looking for children to take away to replace the ones she had originally killed. Been there, done that, seen it in better films... But then, it is based on lore so originality can be excused but I'm sure they could have found a more original way to tell the story.The atmosphere was lacking, the jump scares failed to hit the spot and I wonder what film people watched who rated this as a ten out of ten?

212,CinematicGarbage,Not Scary and Very Annoying!,2,1 June 2019,"One question before reviewing the movie: Is ""The Curse of La Llorona"" part of the Conjuring Universe? Maybe and maybe not, look at Rotten Tomatoes' List of The Conjuring Universe and ""The Curse o La Llorona"" wasn't there but I still think it is because there's James Wan (as a producer). And guess what, this movie FAILS! And here're my opinions about it.Initially, the performances are good with Linda Cardellini as Anna Garcia and her two children, Sam and Chris and there's a woman Patricia played by an actor with the same name. Their acting was the most impressive of the movie. They knew how to scream, how to weep but I wasn't impressed much with the actor of La Llorona, she should be a lot scarier than how she was in the movie. I like the make-up of La Llorona, a grey face with black tears and yellow eyes, that's a bit creepy.This movie definitely looks like a James Wan movie. James Wan had some horror masterpieces like Saw, The Conjuring and more. The cinematography, it was okay, how they shot was good, not disturbing or bad at all. I don't know if they used that much special effects and then I looked at the budget, it's $9 million, they wasted some.You know why this movie FAILS? It's because how I measured the movie in the scare factor, from a scale from 1% to 100%, I would rate this movie 5% scary and that's the problem with horror movies nowadays, they forgot to make the movie scary, all they did was adding blood here and there, it's not scary and I wanted to see this in the theatre and then people made stupid decision to rate this R and it's a waste, just like Hellboy. Even the jumpscares they had were over and over again but none of them worked. The whole movie is totally boring, almost every part of the movie is non-horror.The Conjuring Universe is going to be one of the best horror franchises but all it takes is one substandard spin-off to make you realize just how much craft and care are needed to make these things work right. I really don't think there's a reason for this movie to exist. It's not scary or creepy, it's just so annoying that I really want to give it a 1 or 0 but nah, good acting, good cinematography as well but still, the movie really FAILS.",The Curse of La Llorona

Not really sure why the reasoning behind this, but they tied THIS film into the ANNABELLE series which kinda doesn't make much sense but is a nice treat for those who love that spinoff of 'The Conjuring'. There was a couple of creepy scenes if you wanna call them that but there was nothing scary and there was a few bits of humour thrown in near the end for good measure. It seemed like they were trying from the jump scares too often and they showed too much of the ghost instead leaving the darkness and the imagination to scare the audience in my opinion.I can say is worth a rental and a one time watch.If you want to see a good horror film worthy about La Llorona:

220,Lockout_Salties,The worst movie in the entire Conjuring universe,3,10 April 2020,"Where to begin with The Curse of La Llorona. Well let's start here: it's awful. It's really, really, really awful. It's not so much that everything in the film is bad, but more so that certain parts of it are so offensively lazy, so aggressively cliche-ridden, that it completely eviscerates any potential the movie might've once had. There were a total of three things in this movie that weren't terrible. The design of La Llorona, the diversity, and the acting. But most of these are so minor that they barely are worth a mention. The one thing that is big (the acting) isn't good enough to salvage the train wreck that are the characters in this movie. Oh, and don't get me started on the story. The writers were so lazy they didn't bother to explore anything about... actually, no. They were lazy enough to not explore anything, period. If you sit down and try to predict the plot of this movie, you could probably do just that exactly. The story is so, so, SO predictable, to the point if you wonder if this was written by some sort of AI purely relying on past haunted house movies. No moment of this movie felt memorable, scary, unique, or even noteworthy in any way imaginable. The few times the film actually does introduce an interesting idea, it is either immediately forgotten or completely wasted. There's no reason to watch this movie unless you want to watch all f the Conjuring universe films. Otherwise, stay far, far away from The Curse of La Llorona.Final Score: 26/100.",The Curse of La Llorona

Rule number one in horror, don't bore your audience. I was actually bored. I just didn't find the story itself all that scary and it didn't help that it had so much lag. The scares were not that scary and I couldn't get into it. One minute she can just appear in the house and the next we have to believe that she needs to use doors? WTF? Can the writers make up their minds? It was a frustrating boring watch. I'm glad I can cross it off my list now.",The Curse of La Llorona
222,re-animatresse,"this movie is not The Conjuring, and that's not a bad thing",8,3 October 2019,"I personally did not have high expectations for this movie when i learned early on that it would be part of The Conjuring Universe. i know the first in the franchise is a very popular film for its portrayal of Ed and Lorraine Warren, icons of paranormal investigation, but i have difficulty suspending disbelief enough to enjoy anything steeped too deeply in Christian mythology and rather disliked it when it debuted in 2013the narrative of The Curse of La Llorona is depicted through a very Christian perspective as well, but with more focus on Christianised Latin American folk magic tradition, which i find fascinating from an anthropological point of view. i can't speak to the accuracy of its portrayal here, but the story of La Llorona at least stays true to the folklore, specifically the Mexican boogeyman version involving a young woman named Maria who drowned her children and herself after learning of her lover's infidelity, and wonders the Earth as a spirit, searching for her lost children and doomed endlessly to repeat her desperate acts of filicide. i first read this story around twenty years ago in Ghost Stories of Old Texas (1983) by Zinita Fowler; it's stuck with me through the years, and this movie's got me looking for a copy to re-readThe Curse is a very character-driven film with excellent cinematography and notable performances from Roman Christou, who makes his acting debut in this film as the protagonist's young son, and Raymond Cruz as Rafael, the curandero they turn to for help in their crisis. i actually liked and feared for the characters throughout, and there are plenty of really creepy scenes that don't rely on jump scares to startle audiences, although there's a tasteful amount of that as wellwhile it performed very well in the box office, critics who are Conjuring fans appear relatively disappointed, so i'd recommend adjusting your expectations accordingly and judging The Curse on its own merit.

Nice fast paced, decent enough movie with alot of jump scares,
Easter egg tie ins to The Conjuring universe, aswell as the production style.
La Llorana has a striking resemblence to Valak in form and actions.
Fans of the TV show Grimm get a movie based on one of the folk tales covered in the show.Downfalls for me were,
The scares were very predictable
As typical in most horror movies the responses from the actors to events going on around them was somewhat dumbfounding.In summary it was a decent enough movie in the Conjuring style and wasn't dissapointed.Tho it's M rated there were a few parents who brought there pre-teen kids in and they were obviously ""scared"" and the entire back row of theatre were teens who were giggling and talking the whole time but that's not the movies fault.",The Curse of La Llorona

Set in the 70's, the film revolves around the story of a widow who works for Child Protective Services in LA.This film has ZERO scare value. La Llorona has to be the most ineffective ghost in the history of ghost films. She just can't seem to kill anyone after the first two kids who die to get the film a R rating. There is nothing in the film that justifies the R rating. This could easily have been a PG film. The entire film is poorly lit to make it seem more atmospheric but it fails miserably in this regard as most of the times you can't see what's going on in the scene.The ending is especially cringe worthy with the forced ""Ta Da!"". Holy Sh**!Not scary, very dull and boring at even 95 minutes. Please avoid watching this drivel so in the future we do not have to sit through crap like this.

The Curse of La Llorona is not a masterpiece in the horror genre but neither is it such garbage as people here claim. Feels a little bit like many jumped on the bandwagon and trashed it which is just as generic and boring as they claim this film is.I quite enjoyed this film. It passed the time and I jumped a few times. And I found a few scenes quite disturbing. Did it drag slightly? Yes a tad.

We just can't get away from that evil Annabelle doll or that nun who looks like Marilyn Manson. The Curse of La Llorona is the most recent Conjuring spin off and it's a mostly mixed bag of jump scares, some cringe-worthy dialogue, and even a few fun moments.At its heart, La Llorona is a classic ghost story. It centers around a widowed single mother whose job in Child Protective Services leads her to investigate the case of two murdered children. It seems like their mother might have done it, but she tells a very different story - La Llorona did it. Pretty soon after, the caseworker and her children are haunted by the title character who plans to murder the children.It's not a bad concept for a film and there are some moments that really elicit some chills. For some reason, the filmmakers have decided to bring the title character out of the shadows far too often which really minimizes her scare factor, especially when seen in bright lights. I find it hard to believe they were so enamored with the makeup design (which looks a bit like a white faced version of the wrestler Sting) that they felt it needed to be seen in such elaborate detail. A few more shadows here and there could have made her much more frightening.The finale isn't quite as exciting as it should be, but it's not a complete waste of time.",The Curse of La Llorona

It would have been more interesting if they showed more of how the legend started, but they had a good idea to go with. What really didn't work for this movie was showing La Llorona too many times, to the point that she wasn't scary. What's always creepy in movies like this is not being able to see their face until the very end, which they had a perfect scene to show her, but by then it was too late.If you like the Conjuring universe/horror movies, it's a fun watch, just don't expect anything special.",The Curse of La Llorona

Her quick movements are absolutely unnerving. The scene in the beginning where she cracks her head to the side feels inhuman and yes I jumped and I have no shame. Some moments are deserving of actual jumps and that one certainly was.The only moment I really didn't enjoy as much was when Anna (Linda Cardellini) first sees La Llorona standing in the hallway and screams. Her scream just didn't resonate with me it didn't sound like a true terrified scream.",The Curse of La Llorona

The legend of La Llorona should have been explored further. I would have appreciated a bit more background on the original folk tale and perhaps the story should have developed in a different time/setting (e.g. Mexico in the early 1900s).Rather than creating a generic and predictable story of an American family and their struggle with La Llorona, the screenwriters should have considered investing more time in proper research and creative writing.

Then it came to Anna's home where she was getting ready with two kids. The camerawork is pretty good in there. Almost thought the movie would be great by those two scenarios.Nothing else is impressive. Cannot stand how they have made 'La Llorona' too visible all through the movie. At the end, she is not scary at all.
There is a similar ghostly character in 'The Woman in Black' movies. I like the scenes of Jennet the black woman.

I can't review the whole film as I spent a fair chunk of it watching the back of my eyelids but what I saw of it offended my eyes. This has every single horror cliche you can imagine chucked in. La Llorona is more annoying than scary, letting lose the usual horror scream that has graced every ghostly horror chicks mouth since the woman in black founded it (that however is a great movie)..
It has extremely tenuous links to the conjuring series in the form of Father Perez, who randomly blags about his run in with Annabelle then he disappears only to be replaced by an equally if not less useless character in the form of Raymond Cruz. His character has to be the most pointless character I've ever seen on film, he actually just walks off at one point during the final 'terrifying act', probably to phone his agent or the dole office as that's were he'll be headed after that performance.
The kids were the best actors in this film, they did a great job pretending to be scared of a really not scary antagonist in the form of La Llorona.

1. 10 Stars - how many films are genuinely 10 Stars?
2. Very short reviews with no real analysis of the film just generic comments about how great it is.
3.Bad grammar, the spelling is often ok but the nuances of how to construct a proper sentence in English are lacking and although the mistakes are small they are often there.A combination of these three markers almost always means it's a fake review and IMDB should be developing a way to root them out and delete them as it is damaging their reputation.",The Curse of La Llorona

296,mxbrecher,So it's a folktale....to some!,8,5 May 2019,"The Curse of La Llorona is a fun chilling ride! I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this film, what I'm also surprised at how people hate on this. Whether you BELIEVE or NOT, in Mexico back in the late 1600's there was a woman named Maria. Maria was said to be the most beautiful woman in all of that part of Mexico, she was from a poor family and village, but then met a very wealthy man who she married and had two children. As Maria found out her husband had an affair with a much younger woman, Maria out of complete anger she drowned her children and realized what she has done she then drowned herself. Her spirit now haunts the land and searching for children to take in replace of her own. What's the most interesting part of La Llorona is that it's not explicitly a conjuring film but it actually ties all the chapters even more than the NUN. I don't understand the negativity to this film. It is accurate to the real story of La Llorona mixed with a case involving the conjuring cases from the father in Annabelle. Acting is superb, cinematography and mood was perfect. Scared came off predictable and then wasn't I like that balance. Great addition to the conjuring universe, and it's scarier than the NUN and Annabelle",The Curse of La Llorona

300,MisterAwesome,The worst installment of the conjuring franchise,2,11 October 2019,"First of all, let me state that the connection to the conjuring franchise is hardly visible, even with a microscope. It is so loosely connected that if you blink at the moment the connection is explained you might miss it. It's a shame the ever expanding conjuring universe is being diminished to an ordinary cash grab, when once it was a such a gem in a failing, hardly original industry. The movie itself, when viewed independently of aforementioned rant, is poor in it's own way. The movie is, quite frankly, just not scary. The pacing is off in so many scenes it's just painful to watch. The intention of long following shots is to induce tension, but it ultimately creates boredom. The decision making of the main characters, the jump scares, even the 'presence' itself are laughably bad. While watching the movie unfold, it feels like viewing a movie you've already seen ten, perhaps hundred times before because of it's unoriginality. The plot isn't any good while the direction is poorly executed. I'm at a loss trying to come up with reasons for James Wan to produce a movie like this, other than cashing in on some easy money. I hope in the future Wan will take up direction and story writing for one of the upcoming conjuring universe movies, but I'm afraid that's never going to happen.",The Curse of La Llorona

303,LinaInverse23,Better than The Nun,6,22 April 2019,"And that's not saying much. The overall premise is wonderful, and an age old legend used to scare kids to go to bed. The beginning sets the audience up for something truly sinister and creepy, and the atmosphere in the film is fairly decent. The acting from everyone involved is good, and direction is for the most part, good. The film falls apart on many levels, however, when they try to do too much at once.
Jump scares are old and tired, and no one is asking for these any longer in horror films, which hurts the film. The director sets up a nice creepy buildup, only to have it end with a jump scare instead of something truly remarkable and innovative. While the film has some awesome atmosphere, the director seems to forget his own setup and doesn't know how to utilize it.
One of the more spine-chilling moments is when the family surrounds themselves with candles and you can see a shadow in the darkness, and can't quite see the full apparition- this is true suspense and mystery, when not all is revealed; director please take notes from Hitchcock and his use of shadows in Vertigo.
CGI hurts the film as well- instead of a creepy looking La Llorona, we get a CGI ghost face that doesn't look much better than something from Stay Alive (2006). There is also a severe lack of character development, absent from most horror films in general. The only character the audience possibly cares about is Linda Cardellini's Anna Tate-Garcia; the kids might garner some emotion from the audience. Raymond Cruz's Rafael Olvera is just a cool fun character, and honestly could have used more screen time. Had the writers developed these characters more, the more the audience cares what is happening to them, and become increasingly more worried for their well-being.
Overall the film suffers from many maladies, not being able to follow through with the setup. The director does an excellent job with the setup, not necessarily the execution. Still, the film does deliver some creepy scares and is worth a watch if already invested in the Conjuring universe. Otherwise, check out the new Pet Sematary, it is more effective as a horror movie overall.",The Curse of La Llorona

309,mmjnr10,My honest professional review on this movie and cinema in general over the past 6 months!!!!,4,20 September 2019,I don't know what's up but there is a serious lack of good movies lately in all genres... I am a movie freak and critic by profession and find the last 6 months are dreadful in all kind of movies and this one is no exception... I knew before watching to keep my expectations very low and rely on good story telling and how they will make this basic urban Mexican legend into a decent movie especially Mexico is not known to be a source of any kind of horror to the normal educated viewer so making the general lame story into an interesting movie the viewer could belive and sink into is an extremely difficult task and not anyone capable of pulling it off in terms of actual story and story telling and this movie being unbelievable as it is forced me to sink more down the moment I saw the son of the lady not tell his mother of what he saw and witnessed alone and with his sister in the car with windows going down on their own and his arm stained with three very strange wounds and any child worldwide would tell his nearest adult relative while being in absolute fear and most likely screaming yet the director decided that the son AND the daughter not tell their mother what happened when she came back to the car.. Now how lame is that.. Seriously those kind of mistakes make movies go from 6-7 to 3-4 unwatchable due to the lack of common sense and due to the wrong kind of story to tell related to a Mexican urban legend even if it is false made up from nowhere still you need to make it look as real and common sensible as possible to make the viewer belive the imaginary... Funny thing is a read a couple of scary Mexican related urban legends that are actually very scary and supposedly happened in real life but I would prefer to only release it on contract since it's quiet very valuable compared to absolute **** they do nowadays including a scarey dummy called Annabelle yet they pulled it off nicely in the 1st part I give them that but when you have a stronger story which is actually supposedly based on actual events it links much more with the viewer and could become an instant hit if done correctly...

I'm not the biggest fan of the Conjuring spin off's, this one definitely isn't the worst. But do I consider it a good movie, not really. The story itself feels like it would be made for a extended tv episode, the character in the title is reduced to just being a vengeful ghost, something that you would find in a simple Supernatural episode. Didn't have a lot of depth just jumps scares here and there without touching on much regarding the mythology of the character. The acting was good and I liked the kids and felt for them when it got dark for them.
As for the way it fits into the Conjuring universe, aside from a cameo from one of the movies it didn't really feel like it is fitting into anything. But overall was I bored not really but wasn't entirely enjoyable and if your scares are relying on jump scares than you have already lost me.

It is creepy and formulaic. The scares are predictable but able to induce startle responses. The plot is archetypal of a James Wann horror movie. Thanks to Jame's obsession with this sub-genre, the viewers are now starting to see Nuns in a whole new way. The problem being, viewers grow quick resistance to such sequels or prequels or spin-offs and most importantly studio-executives are not the only audience. I feel a gradual shift in the horror palette - first there were graveyards and churches, then came secluded cabins, pharaohs and mummies, urban legends of all sorts, creature monsters of all shapes and sizes, aliens, supernatural flicks, Japanese and Korean horrors and then came the Spanish horrors. Someone's surely been doing market research on this.Be ensured that this movie does not meet any gold-standard in the realms of Conjuring universe, but then it's not expected to be. Spin-offs and their installments like this have happened before and nothing sort of new goes on here. You have already been spooked before with similar wights and you are au courant with most of the scenes, color tones, ominous music and above all, the plotline.

That let us realize plot and twists were not part of the original budget. I guess all the money went to la llorona herself.

WHAT???In most horror movies you kind of feel for the evil entity, it has an interesting back story, what it does is wrong, but it had been wronged itself in the past, while still being human, but no, this broad finds out her hubby is cheating on her, so she decides to murder her children as punishment...MOTHER OF THE MILLENNIUM...then someone (WHO??? GOD??? THE DEVIL???) curses her to roam the earth killing other innocent children (yup, that certain someone who 'punished' her like this is the movie's true ANTAGONIST)Patricia, another mother of the year, thinks she'd find peace after her 2 innocent children are being murdered by the weeping broad, by getting other 2 innocent children murdered...yup...The shaman dude first decides not to help the desperate mother with 2 children that are being haunted by an evil spirit, even tho that is basically what he does for a living...It felt like the shaman dude was 'chilling' near the Hollywood studio where this was being produced and the crew invited him on set, 0 fu**s given by the actor, he had no idea why was he even there and his attempts at humor were cringy...I am sick of idiot kids risking their lives for a toy, yes I have been a child and I haven't been that stupid at that age...Americans some times forget their houses are so big that they have a back entrance...The mother jumped in the pool to randomly search for her daughter in the water, instead of first pinpointing her exact location from the outside and only then jumping to get her out...The shaman dude hopped in a taxi the next morning, right after the crazy mom Patricia had shot him in the chest or shoulder during the night...hmm, ok...The acting was laughable...Should I go on?

The weeping woman is creepy!!I don't really have any criticism to give of this film other than a few really poorly delivered lines. Tuko (from breaking bad) plays a priest, and while it made for some good laughs, I just couldn't see him as any other character other than Tuko, which just made him unbearable.

CPS case worker goes to discover 2 children dead in a canal. She has to take her children with her, even though the boy is old enough to babysit. Then the boy goes on an adventure and wants to be nosy. Then he encounters The vengeful spirit La Llarona and gets his sister and mother cursed. Then the mom looks for help to stop her from taking her children. I swear I've seen this before. The Jump scares still kind of get you, even though you see them coming. It's the same old, same old.

I didn't even pay to see it but as it was produced by the same people who made the conjuring series (which I enjoy for the most part) I figured this would be joining my blu ray collection soon. Thank god I asked my mate to download it for me first because if I had contributed any money towards this pile of garbage I would have been left feeling slightly violated. There isn't one single original idea in this film, the acting is god awful, the characters are complete and utter morons and the ghost isn't even slightly scary. I managed to guess almost every thing that happened because it was all just so formulaic. I was watching this with my girl on movie night so we saw it through to the end incase it had any redeeming qualities but it didn't and even she thought it was a steaming pile of excrement.

337,Sebastian Valmont II,The Nnun,2,5 May 2019,"In 2019, I am used to Hollywood being creatively bankrupt and every move being either (a) some lame superhero flick that's the same as all the others or (b) some cruddy second rate remake/reboot/ripoff, but The Curse of La Llorona is the first time someone has made a ripoff of their OWN MOVIE in the space of 2 years.La Llorona is basically a Nun-wannabe. She has the same CGI facial expressions, does the same Generically Spooky Crap; appearing behind people (a lot), creaking floors, slamming doors, floating in the air and shrieking etc. Her only unique schtick is that she likes to drown kids.Here, she materializes in 1973 Los Angeles (which looks nothing like either 1973 or Los Angeles) and lamely menaces two kids who belong to widowed social worker Linda Cardellini (who also has a convenient giant swimming pool in her backyard). Needless to say, after many stupid plot contrivance, lots of stupid jump-scares (a few of which land), they kill her in a totally anticlimactic way which, had they known about it earlier, could have ended the movie after about 20 minutes.It gets 2 stars because poor Linda Cardellini (who deserves SO much better) turns in a great performance, never once letting the clunky, crappy Scrappy-era Scooby Doo-level writing get in her way. She even manages to play it straight when getting hit in the face by a bunch of black glop that comes out of a Llorona-bedevilled exploding egg, THAT is how good she is and how bad the film is.",The Curse of La Llorona

Yes, this has been done many times before; yes, lots of jump scares; yes, not fully fleshed out storyline and light on character development... but the acting was VERY good and the music setting the mood was effective.

The Annabelle ones are alright - pretty formulaic but good fun for the Halloween spooky season - and The Nun was boring but not offensive. This one was the first that I had a hard time finishing. Not very scary and the whole story just feels kind of stale, especially when you consider it's a part of the Conjuring universe. Didn't they make this one a few times already?

After The Nun debacle (there is nothing outwardly bad in that movie except for Father Burke, whose dialogues gave me a headache, it was just very boring and uneventful in the first half and only picked up in the last 20 mins. ),I almost paid no attention to this franchise, and was mostly concentrated on the marvel franchise. Now, after watching this, I have a similar kind of a feeling. The acting was good in this movie, but there's just nothing new. Children doing whatever they're told not to do, the holy cross scaring away the ghost. I mean, it's so cliched that i dozed off half an hour into the movie. One other thing that bothered me was, the lengths that they wuld go to earn some extra bucks! This had no business being in the Conjuring Universe, still WB puts that tag to put extra asses in the seat. As if they knew that this isn't upto the mark, so we'll add that tag.

I was looking forward to a mainstream movie coming out for it. Boy was I disappointed.The story is very predictable after the initial sequences. You can see the ending coming from a mile away. The characters are mostly bland and there is little to no depth to them. The actors tried hard with what they were given, and they were given very little.The movie follows the classic horror movie formula and while that can work sometimes, as in The Conjuring, this movie failed in doing so. I don't like that this movie is in the Conjuring universe because it nowhere near the ballpark of what The Conjuring was. It is not memorable by any means nor rewatchable. The main antagonist/la Llorona becomes less scary due to her overexposure. We almost get used to her and her creepy shenanigans.I will say the film is shot very well and has good atmosphere at times. Set design is great, costume is great as is usual with the conjuring universe films. It just has no real substance. So production and others, great job. Directors and writers, try harder.

The maincharacters play very well, and you do actually care about them, something a sadly couldn't say about it's counterpart, the nun.

It created a tense situation and the story too had some layers which made it better than The Nun. The thing where this one falls back is too much use of jump-scares and I also the movie was very loud. Being a hardcore horror fan these was ok to me but loud music became irritating at times.

369,smsoto24,A Review,10,10 August 2019,"It's apparent that everyone has become an experts at making films, but see lack of these same critics attempting at better. This has standard element of these kind of haunting films, this does not diminish it's ability to scare an audience. I find it funny that we've been desensitized to these haunting films as a result we see ghost, demons, and creatures of the unknown as common. Yet I bet a majority won't wake up at night and pray to la llorona or go to the local store and buy a Ouija board, because your afraid. If these supposed scares are overdone and overrated then I call the curse of la llorona to haunt you in your dreams and see who runs and hide like the intense scenes in this film.The film is overall a good Saturday night movie filled with some dramatic and horror scenes. The only issue I did have with the film is that they tied it in with the conjuring/Annabelle films in attempt to heighten its appeal. The mood of the transitions to the horror parts are quick enough to keep you engaged. I personally thought the antagonist was terrifying.

379,mksxoxx,BEST CLASSY HORROR MOVIE TILL NOW. DON'T WATCH IT ALONE!,9,3 August 2019,Linda really knows what she's doing when it comes to horror movies. Linda delivered an excellent performance throughout the movie which kept the audience engaged the whole way through. I love her. Every moment of this film was excellently executed with amazing surprises. Roman Christou & Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen were the soul of the film and Raymond Cruz provided the right way to solve this mystery. I recommend everyone to watch this classic horror movie and watch it alone if you dare!,The Curse of La Llorona
380,F4LS3G0D,Below average horror movie from the Conjuring universe,5,12 August 2019,"I personally think it's not nearly as good as the conjuring films. I think this movie suffers greatly from the writing. The characters in this film are.....dumb. They make stupid decisions that make you shake your head and roll your eyes. The jump scares aren't as good as the conjuring films, i mean it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great jump scares either so i give it a meh on scares. Technically it's a horror film so if you have average scary parts then that's a big knock on this film.
I could only picture this film scaring children or tweens since this movie's story is based around children.
At the end of the day i wouldn't recommend this movie, even though the story is original, the movie as a whole is very flawed. BUT i will recommend a 1x watch only if you love the conjuring universe and want to know the backstory of la llorona.",The Curse of La Llorona

395,judge-fudge,Not horrible but not great either.,5,12 April 2019,"Personally I was expecting this movie to be in the 6-8/10 range so it was a bit underwhelming for me. The film felt much longer than it was and looking at the clock after leaving and it was fairly short at around 90 minutes. I felt as though I was sitting there for about 2 hours and half of that time I was fairly bored. There were only perhaps one or two moments where I felt scared and even then it was only very mild and for a few seconds when a jump scare had occurred. It's worth noting that I am not familiar with the source material / urban legend so it's not a story that has any personal meaning to me. I found the setting of 1970s LA quite bland even though it shouldn't have been and the characters generally uninteresting including the monster. I don't mind the idea of the monster's origin story but it's still not really interesting enough to carry a whole film in my opinion, unless it was done really really well. I think had the film been set somewhere more isolated it would have helped a lot. There is not a whole lot to like about the film for me apart from a few decent scenes and the stereotypical horror film moments of stupidity are there for a few unintentional laughs along the way. I'd say the film is worth a watch for horror fans but I'm not sure it's really worth the price of entry so see if you can watch it another way at some point in the future.",The Curse of La Llorona

While the Nun at least had very cool visuals and Annabelle 3 knew it's lack of seriousness this movie offers neither of it.As I said.

Widowed parent, it's not the house that's haunted it's the person so it doesn't matter where you go. That has been the story line way back to paranormal activity which came out in 2009, if not further then that. Also the story of La Llorona is one that makes you feel sorry for her and she's ""only"" a bad spirit because of what happened to her in her life. Again that has been done so many times.I also completely didn't understand the camo role Annabelle randomly popping up in a flash back, maybe once they've brought out another 5 movies that will eventually make sense.There was nothing in the movie that particularly surprised me or stopped me from picking up my phone to check texts etc. It's getting a five from me solely on how well it was cast.",The Curse of La Llorona

429,borgiesblog,(Ay Coramba!) The Curse of La Llorona (2019) Review,4,28 April 2020,"(This is an ABRIDGED version of my review which contains Spoilers)You know, the practice of slapping franchise universes on poorly-made films has got to stop. Remember Cloverfield Paradox from a few years ago? Of course you don't. But trust me, it was a thing.Apparently this La Lorona movie was retooled (emphasis on tool) as a Conjuring movie when the studio realised the chronic dud they were delivered by the director. I bet, like me, you had no idea this was set in the same universe as those movies, even after watching it all the way through.Not that it particularly matters or amounts to much in the end. Father Perez from the Annabelle movies - themselves only with a tenuous link to the Conjuring franchise - turns up to take a giant expo-dump after the first encounter with the ghoulie and then quickly disappears. I would bet this was a last minute reshoot to tie it in with a more successful brand rather than just releasing it as is at a box office loss.Anyway, the story doesn't make a lick of sense:Firstly, the script goes out of its way to make characters not behave as real people. Get this folks: It opens with a social worker (I'm gonna call her SW because I'm not wasting any more time researching this movie) checking up on a single mother and her two boys. They are nowhere to be found, the flat is a tip and the mother is holding a cross and ranting in Spanish (never a good sign. As per Paranormal Activity and countless other movies, if a crazed sweaty woman starts flinging a cross at you whilst ranting in Spanish just get the heck outta dodge).Anyway, I woke up again and she was leaning herself up against a closet and for some reason senses something inside. The mother attacks her a second time, continuing to rant in Spanish until a random cop holds the crazy woman back so the SW can open the mysterious closet door. She opens it, flicks on the light and instead of a rack of flamenco dresses and sombrero's there are just two little boys sitting on a filthy mattress. They have burn marks on their arms and seem to have been abused. They simply look up and say ""please close the door or she'll get me."" The SW says they are safe and she won't get you, thinking they are talking about the mother. Why the boys don't just say ""NO, NOT ME MAM, IT'S A FRIGGIN' GHOST YOU GOON"", I don't know. Oh yes I do, BECAUSE PLOT REASONS.Also, why this particular closet somehow keeps out a ghost who is later shown throughout the rest of the movie (e.g. attic scene at end) as not being phased by walls or doors is beyond me. Funniest part about all this is that it is revealed in the very next scene with her that the Spanish mother could speak English THE WHOLE FUDGING TIME. Why didn't she just say, ""how about you don't open that door because a 17th century Mexican ghost is trying to drown me sprogs? Why don't I make you a cuppa and we have a sensible chinwag 'bout it all. I'm usually a great mother, honest. I just have to keep me kids in a closet from time to time. No biggie.""Why Is Everyone In Horror Films So Stupid?Another pet peeve is making characters dumb to progress the plot. It's infuriating. People in this movie behave in the most nonsensical ways as I said earlier. For example, the priest character from the previous Conjuring movies (I mentioned him above but he is so forgettable I honestly can't remember the name I just typed ten minutes ago) gets the spirit outside the house and then draws a line of salt across the threshold of the doorway, Supernatural-stylee.Then there is some talking and somehow (and I honestly don't recall the situation of how on earth this set of circumstances come to be) but the little girl opens the door again and drops her teddy over the salt line, and then kneels down to stretch for it. You know what's going to happen. I don't even need to describe what happens next. Suffice it to say any goodwill the movie has built is instantly squandered when characters do stupid things and end up deserving their fate.The little girl gets her teddy but accidentally smudges the salt line, allowing the ghost back in. At this point, the film-makers have just stuck two fingers up and have completely lost the audience. If a character does something so stupid that the audience end up cheering for the ghost to kill them for their sheer incompetence then the director has failed and movie has fallen flat on its face.So great job guys.Also, I will just mention here that during this sequence there is a 'twist' where the salt-line has been broken and a pair of dirty feet cross the threshold, with the white gown menacingly creeping into the hallway. We are led to believe it is La Llorona but it turns out it is the crazed Spanish mother from the beginning, trying to take her kids and offer them to the ghost so it can give her her kids back.Oh I forgot to say, her two kids from the closet at the start are drowned by the ghost in Act 1. So this is all preposterous because although this ghost can appear anywhere and physically touch people, I doubt it also has the power to give chest compressions and CPR to a bunch of rotting child corpses. I know this is just supposed to show the Spanish mother has gone crazy with grief and blames the SW but all of this is undercut when the Spanish mother suddenly comes to her senses as the kids are trapped in the attic by the ghost - WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED TO HAPPEN!! It's not like the ghost killed the SW's kids and then refused to give her children back so what on earth caused the sudden 180 in her thinking? I don't get it. Maybe I fell asleep and missed something. Maybe I just don't care.The movie also introduces elements in Act 1 that are completely forgotten about and dropped throughout the rest of the movie. They try to set up some 'rules' and in-world lore regarding the mythology of the spirit (of course delivered by a Spanish priest, no less) and then do nothing with it.So they try and say you hear the crying first. Meant to symbolise the ghosts' regret for killing her children. The crying is what lures the yungun's in for her to take. It is explicitly shown in Act 1, when the SW's male child is lured to La Llorona via her crying. This is then never mentioned again, as far as I can tell.Final ThoughtsWhatever. Honestly, this whole thing was next-level dull. The definition of predictable. The confidence with which the set-pieces are executed is staggering, like the director has never seen a horror movie before and believes he is inventing something truly unique. The movie also makes the cardinal sin of showing too much of the monster. We learned in last year's serving of a Conjuring snooze-fest that evil nuns are only scary if you don't show them too often. This movie has the most generic 'evil-nun' type make-up design screaming into camera. It's amateur. It's child's play. (Now that was a good horror film!)I will end by circling back to my starting point. The studio were delivered a dud on arrival which they knew they couldn't sell, and so slapped 'From The Universe of The Conjuring' onto its marketing campaign to get bums on seats. All I know is that the only reason I watched the Cloverfield Paradox was because it was supposed to be Cloverfield movie. As soon as that movie ends you know that it was never intended to be a Cloverfield film (which was later confirmed by JJ Abrams himself) and they ushered in J.J.'s Bad Robot to retool - there's that word again - the movie accordingly. The net effect of all this is to dampen expectations and actively burn any goodwill the actual franchise sequels get in the future as audiences lose confidence in their products. (But then again, it hasn't hurt the Fast & Furious brand...)Oh well, at least Mr Wan can keep counting that Aquacash swimming in, eh.Ay Coramba! - The Curse of La Llorona Review",The Curse of La Llorona

456,stevennoorso,You don't wanna watch it in daylight,3,18 August 2019,"For starters I wanna say I could hardly bare watching this one. It gave me nothing by all means and overall it was a waste of time and 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Say I was seeing it in the cinema, I think I woulda walked out after 30 minutes, which is generously optimistic. Actually no, I'm not that extra. Instead I was watching it at home at 2PM which might have had something to do with me disliking it so much and so it made me think that there might be an actual reason for people to go see horror movies at night. So just in case you should do just that and give ""The Curse of La Llorona"" the benefit of the doubt it probably doesn't deserve.
Now a bit about the story itself and what I thought of the whole concept. So as the title says the film was about the curse of La Llorona, a woman that due to her vicious actions couldn't find peace and is now back to get all of our children. And that's pretty much the whole story to the movie. It didn't give me anything new. It was all the things we've seen before countless of times. I mean there was a cursed someone and there was also some exorcism involved which is anything but new and interesting to me. All those jump scares I could see coming and they weren't even scary (again, I was watching it at 2PM so..). And even leaving all these clichés aside, still the story itself didn't go anywhere and was weak in my opinion. I guess it's indeed difficult for the producers to give us something complitely new since we've seen all sorts of stuff already, especially when we talk about horror movies. Keep on giving us them psychopaths please though. But not everything is gone yet, in fact I've seen couple of pretty extraordinary ones this year. I'd definitely recommend you go see ""Us"" and ""Ma"" if you haven't done that.
The cast was okay I guess. I won't remember any of them at the end of the day though. I did like the crazy Latina, Patricia (Patricia Velásquez) that brought some outrage in the end I wasn't expecting. But I absolutely did not like this exorcist that was tryna play this tough guy. I think he didn't fit in there very well. And as I mentioned the plot was bad so overall the whole thing fell flat.",The Curse of La Llorona

I just watched the movie and throughout the movie I got really frustrated. Every single cliché got brought up. I was just rooting for Patricia because the mom was just really bad, just as her kids, in making decisions.
Suddenly the priest comes and explains everything. Very cliché.
They never told each other what was happening. They never told us what happened with welfare check, as if it was all ok.
Patricia never asked Rafael for help?
They all made bad moves and blamed Rafael while they asked him for help and Rafael just could make a whole pool holy with just a little bit of salt.
The girl was really long in the water and somehow survived it. No neighbours heard the whole ordeal.
It was really easy to kill the lady and Patricia suddenly had a good heart while she was the one who prayed to get the kids killed.Nobody died, no empathy for the family or anyone in the movie.

494,joeman-12,Objectively poor,4,24 April 2019,"I don't believe in ghosts, devils or anything so I'm never biased when judging horror. This movie's story is weak, half explained. You learn why la llorona came to be, but never why and how you get the curse. La llorona screems way more than she cries, actually, they could have used that to create tension and play with it, but cried very few times at the beginning only, then it's just opening her mouth wide and scream a lot.
The kids react unexplicably to the first encounters, not entering in shock and running to mom, instead they hide from her and conseal evidence when any normal kid would run crying to their mother and tell her what they experienced.
Predictable scare scenes, the stupid action the kid does to mess it up, the curandero that fights the ghost outside the church. The writer lacks of imagination to set believable scenes, instead factories scenes and behaviors only to produce the situation he wants even though some times are not convinsing.
The acting seemed ok, not bad at all actually, sadly the plot had little to nothing to offer.
Watch in in DVD, rent it or watch it in any other mean, then watch ""the ring"" and then watch ""la gritona"" sorry, ""la llorona"" again and you will see for yourself how poor this movie is.

But a movie based on a traditional bruja story is dangerous because it's a well known cultural knoledge. They didn't do well. To start of, it's not balanced in its story. The start with boring story telling is so long and not a lot of scares. All the action happens in 20 minutes. Secondly, all the scares are jump scares. The producers had in their hands a legend, you can create such good scares with ambiance and just story telling putting the audience on the edge of his seat to see who that widow is, but no, we see her face in the first 5 minutes. Thirdly and lastly, towards the end, they did a weird choice of cut scenes with actions happening for 2 seconds then dark screen for 2 seconds and again in a loop for one good minute. I had to stop the movie to see if I was watching a trailer by mistake. That destroyed all the stressed built until that very moment.

Really like the idea that the family asked help from a former Father, Rafael who uses doggy but working tricks to defend against La Llorona.
We all hate the girl as she broke the seed line just for her doll. But she's still a kid. It totally makes sense.

This was not a good product.If you find yourself rooting for the creature, and it's not the intention of the script, then it should be scrapped.This script belonged in the garbage can, not the film can.

514,rissaelrod,"Left with many questions, was expecting much better",4,15 August 2019,"This movie was disappointing. I never write reviews but for some reason felt the need to write one on this.So I originally gave it a 5, after thinking about it a few hours after, my rating went down and honestly won't be suprised if I wake up tomorrow and will give it a 3. I like the conjuring universe. (Except the first Annabelle). I was expecting something really scary. I watched it with my boyfriend, because after reading reviews I was expecting a great horror and truely terrifying film. Honestly could have watched it alone in the dark and been fine.WARNING SPOILERS
The acting wasnt great. Everyone did pretty well except I thought the son seemed bored and never really seemed genuinely concerned or worried about his sister. I'm suprised this isn't mentioned in other reviews. The guy they hired who left the church seemed bored in every scene he was in. They both showed not much emotion, except the son having fear for his own self.I had SOO many questions!
Since la llorona clearly made herself clearly visible to everyone, why was her boss who came over for dinner never contacted to come over when this was going on?
Why did the ex priest get shot, but no one seemed to care or even ask if he was okay even once? He clearly never got medical attention and to me it looked like he was shot in the neck.
Why did they never follow up on the original mom who prayed to la llorona for bad things to happen to them, but somehow came in out of the blue towards the end? Where did she go?
After everything that happened why was the daughter out of their sight when she went to get the doll? You think the adults would make sure both of the kids didn't get out of their sight for even a second.
Why was the daughter in a trance but somehow it went away and never came back?
Also, the daughter was in the pool for far too long and seemed passed out and she just came out with a couple coughs and was fine?
Why wasn't the importance of the necklace she ripped off out of the pool explained any connection or even anything?
Why was the daughter in the bath alone when they clearly knew the entity was there around them to drown the children?Also, it was incredibly predictable for every scene. And same with a bunch of other movies why do they wander around in the dark. Even in the daytime the house was so dark, they didn't even attempt to turn on a light except twice.I'm frustrated and left without endless answers.I dont necessarily regret watching it, but I won't recommend it and will never watch again.",The Curse of La Llorona

525,luizgeorge-91412,A coma is more interesting.,2,21 July 2019,"Where to start...I gave a 2 out of 10,for the cinematography...as in the cameraman/woman kept the camera at great angles, and took good shots. The 2nd star is for the Lighting. They managed to capture lighting and create ambience for dark vs light, and even did their best to create grey shots for your typical old bubblegum horror shot.Now, this had 2 writers...I dont see how when the storyline is about as aggravating as scratching a plate with a fork to cure a headache. She doesnt ask any questions about the marks, as if a parent would see burn marks on their kids and just ignore them. We have kids locked in a room and a child protection agent doesnt ask why the jids are locked in there. The kids are conveniently taken to a murder scenr by a ""Child protection agent"". The kids typically dont tell the mother anything, and she doesnt ask anything...the ghoat can only capture them when they are close to water, and yes, conveniently, the son is standing infront of a puddle of water. The daughter's umbrella is blown into a pool in the cold with no rain, and she chases it...yes, that is convenient.Lets move to the acting...the boy, Roman Christou, is in constant astonishment...as if the director was asleep for all his shots. We dont get the mixed emotions from his acting. We get a constant monotone ""oh my god, whats going on"", and that then shows the director was on vacation for all his scenes. He doesnt mix it up with relaxation then building up into concern and later shock or horror. This shows that the casting team are also just there by name. This screams of a ""family and friends"" or even f-buddies crew, whete everyone hired to get the film together is all sleeping with each other and has absolutely no idea what it takes to put a great film together.As for the New York Times...the fact that yout critic gave applause to this slapstick bubblegum garbage tells me that you dont hire actual critics...you hire ""yes men"" to review films.

535,rblkever,The Curse of La Jump Scares,3,19 April 2019,"This is literally just like The Nun from last year. Although I think The Nun is probably a bit better.
This movie definitely has an interesting premise. But that whole premise is ruined with cheap jump scares, these demon movie cliches, and just bad writing.
I would say this film is pretty fast paced, but that's because once it hits its third act, it drags on forever. And once the third act starts, they decided to add comedy into it. There was literally no comedy in it before. So once they start getting down with all the ""La Llorona"" stuff, they start making jokes out of nowhere. What the hell?! WHO WROTE THIS?A good thing about this movie? The child actors aren't that bad. Linda Cardellini's on screen for the most part. And the sound designs honestly really good. So if you were to watch this, spend those extra bucks for IMAX.I was about to give up on James Wan, but then I realised that although his name is literally plastered everywhere, he's just the producer. Not the writer or director. But you know who is the director? The guy who is about to direct The Conjuring 3. So I guess the curse is on us?If they had gotten Alfonso Cuarón to write and direct this, then I bet that would have made me crap my pants. The Prisoner of Azkaban still creeps me the hell out to this day.

Outside of the jump scares there was some genuinely good atmosphere when the movie doesn't try to jump scare you.
Also I'm going on record to say this isn't apart of the Conjuring Universe, the only thing connected this movie to the conjuring is a throw away scene where the priest talks about Annabelle, which makes this more of a movie that happens to have a pointless advertisement for the Conjuring movie",The Curse of La Llorona

That being said, the movie could have used a bit more scary scenes. Also, I've noticed that La Llorona's eyes glowed in the beginning of the movie but not towards the end. Why? One thing that disappointed me about the movie was that there wasn't an after credit scene. There were a lot of people still in their seats waiting for one. So one less star for that. NOT being racist here but the movie could have used a Mexican lead actor, therefore, another less star for that. Keep the scary Mexican folklore to it's most natural form.

The curse of La Llorona has no connection with either, except for the same priest who was connected to the Annabelle series. The actors are mediocre and the plot is decent. I wouldn't have watched this movie if I wasn't rewatching the whole conjuring series. It's similar to all the others in the way that a family is being attacked by a demon but that's it. I was hoping for some more back story on the demons in the previous movies but all we got is a new evil spirit with not much of a backstory. Like everyone else said, you see way too much of the demon. It's not very scary after the 10th jump scare. And Raymond Cruz? It's so hard to take him seriously as a serious demon slaying character. Good actor, but wasn't right for this movie. Trying to make him the comedic relief character was just cringey. Just all around a weird movie. Not terrible but not great. Very generic family possession movie. Could've finished the conjuring series without this one in my opinion. And the end.......not even worth finishing...very predictable.",The Curse of La Llorona

I think the way to go is Dolby Digital because the immersive sound really adds to the scares and sounds of La Llarona and keeps your attention. What I love most about this movie, is that La Llarona is very visible throughout the movie. You actually see the spirit for good amounts of time and not just intended for a cheap jump scares. I also love that the mother quickly sees the spirit and right away believes in this and doesn't think her kids are just crazy and seeing things. The cinematography was beautiful as well. Now, they're are things I didn't like. Things that were just illogical and predictable. I know that little girl was way smarter than to open the door to reach for her doll while a spirit she knows wants to get her. I also didn't like how at first, when the mother saw the burns on the girls wrist, it was quickly dismissed and to really be believed as just a bad fall. Last but not least, why didn't the kids just say what they saw at first. How could anyone keep that a secret.

Lol I mean why wouldn't the kids say anything to begin with?! Why would then hide the fact that there was a creepy woman in white threatening their lives and burning them with her touch?! Especially since they have physical evidence of this, definitely had my eyes rollin lol Another part that frustrates me is that they begin to question her as a mother... I mean cmon, the lady works with Child Protective Services... couldn't they have questioned her without having to send someone and treat her like she would actually abuse the kids?... And Lastly, I really think it's stupid how the priest recommends her to use a Curandero knowing that it is okay for him to do so.... and not to mention Raul's methods for ""curing the home"" were pretty silly, eggs filled with blood??? Using the children as bait??? Using sanctified tears as ""anti-venom""? Overall I think this movie was not well thought out and doesn't deserve the money I paid to see it... Please do yourself a favor and wait until it comes out on Redbox lol :)",The Curse of La Llorona

576,nickysalmon,Please don't,1,1 May 2019,"Terrible movie. As a Mexican, I know a lot of better versions to the legend and this movie felt a lot more like a bad cliche and following the stereotype of Mexican characters.
Lack of plot.
No story at all.
Boring, predictable and even full of bad taste.
They clearly didn't take the time to make a good research about the folk stories and legends surrounding the character, and also it felt more like Medea's story.",The Curse of La Llorona
577,jim1908,Easy game against a six years old child,4,18 April 2019,"This is my first ever written review. I thought it was a great moment to start writing. (I'm sorry for my English, I'm trying:)) My nephew and I have seen a lot of horror movies over the last few years. Every cliché we have seen in all those films were combined in La Llorona. A big house, a mother alone with there children, a demon who is entering there house, a scream for help at the church and a big CGI ending which one was way too much. The idea of the story has its potentials. But the plot is an easy, predictable play with some cheapass jumpscares.What makes a good horror movie? If you ask me, its very simple. I think a good or great horror needs to hide his demon, pain or whatever the horror makes, to the end. Like when the ending is bad, you just had a good time finding out what was standing in the dark. (Like 'It Comes at Night'). Give the audience time to think what is really happening. La Llorona was easy to play, like a fifa game against a 6 years old boy. After 5 minutes you were done.I'm not asking too much of horror annymore. I'm happy with a simple script. I know the director and the executive producers wants to attract a big public to earn there investment back or even make some profit. But please, don't treat us like children. I'm only asking for a film that don't tell there entire plot after ten minutes.",The Curse of La Llorona
578,niyah421,Disappointed,4,19 July 2020,The trailer made this movie look so good. It dragged on. No excitment..no originality. I was falling asleep several times. I was wondering if I was watching the right movie...,The Curse of La Llorona
579,theowhite012,Terrible,1,12 May 2021,"Leave the horror directing to James Wan, this is a clear indication The Conjuring 3 will probably be terrible because of this director.",The Curse of La Llorona
580,mr-abdulazizb,Good but not amazing.,5,27 April 2019,"I've watched all of the movies in The Conjuring Universe and all of them had good stories and back stories. This movie has really good scares in it but it didn't do so good in terms of the story and how the movie plays out, as well as The Nun. The ending could've been better, but over all it was a decent movie.",The Curse of La Llorona

582,mohamed750400,Negative Rating....,1,25 February 2020,"One of the worst movies you can watch. The story,
the scenario, directing and even actors in their roles. If there was a negative evaluation, the film would be negative.",The Curse of La Llorona
583,lisasmobiles,Really enjoyed this film,10,11 May 2019,"Great story, plenty of scares and tension. It's so rare to get good scary films today that do not resort to violence or murder.",The Curse of La Llorona
584,goody-03938,It was a waste of my money and time,1,22 May 2019,"When i knew that it was in the conjuring universe I immediately wanted to see it and I knew the curse of la llorona previously so it made me wanted to see it even more, my brother and i went to see it (my brother is a huge fan of the the conjuring universe)
We had high hopes for it and oh boy was it disappointing.
The negatives:
Let's start with how they didn't take advantage of the amazing story basically they told the story in about two minutes and that's it,they did mention it once or twice afterward but it didn't do justice to the story. Second thing to talk about is the jump scares, the movie consisted of jump scares
(With the examination of the first of thirty minutes) after that it was either a jump scare or the music leading to a jump scare.
Third thing is that the movie is a cliché, you have your cliché kids that will get everyone killed to get their toy and your cliché church that will tell you that they can't help you but they'll send you to normally a ghost investigator but this time it was a shaman and many more.
That's all i have to say if the movie did anything good it was that it made us laugh.",The Curse of La Llorona
585,violaleafs,It was way too predictable,4,19 April 2019,Overall it wasn't like a low budget TV movie but it was close. The story line was weak and missed a lot of depth. Everything was too easy to predict and lacks surprises. Not sure if James Wan was really involved in producing this or they just used his name to attract more people.,The Curse of La Llorona

588,TheLegendaryBeardedBroDog,Not as scary as i thought,4,1 May 2019,"So James Wan is a master of horror. I mean ""the Conjuring,"" ""Annabelle. ""Insidious"" he's truely talented, however like ""The Num, La Lalorona wasn't as scary as I thoughy. Theu could've done a lot better madecit scarier. Now granted i jumped a few times, but a decent amount of the scares were the ones in the trailer. I don't know o thougjt ot could've been better. Sorry James Wan",The Curse of La Llorona
589,pyongie,So stupid my head hurts,1,19 July 2019,"This movie is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. They put the bandages on the outside of his shirt, that's how stupid this movie is.The acting isn't good. The writing isn't good. The makeup looks like a cheap Halloween costume. There's absolutely no thought put into it and the need to use classic horror clichés was more important than to actually make it work with the story. Jump scares you can see from a mile away instead of a story which could actually be scary on its own.I can enjoy a low rate horror movie from time to time, it doesn't have to be flashy, the acting doesn't even have to be A-grade, as long as there's at least a good story. This movie didn't have anything going for it from start to finish. If the creators didn't put the effort in to even try to make a decent movie, then the viewers shouldn't put the effort into watching it either.Complete waste of time.",The Curse of La Llorona
590,robinruis,Expected more,5,30 April 2019,"I had higher expectations from a horror movie by James Wan. The story development was very dull with expected jumpscares. If you have enjoyed the Conjuring movies, this will be a let down for you.",The Curse of La Llorona

594,lionel-03289,Should be called LA GRITONA!!!,1,20 April 2019,This movie should have been named the La Gritona or nagging/yelling woman. I was falling asleep during the movie buy the dang Gritona kept waking me lol. Movie sucked period!!!!,The Curse of La Llorona

596,Jimztah,"Flat, boring and filled with clichés",3,2 May 2019,"Honestly I'm surprised with all the good scores in the user reviews. I'm surprised as this was easily one of the worse movies I've ever seen. The acting was subpar, the plot was so incredibly flat and easy to guess beforehand, the dialogue was futile and almost like something a writer threw together in a day or two.If it wasn't for the decent effects, the mostly atmospherical suspense and the children's surprisingly decent acting I'd give this an even lower score. It's that bad. Don't waste your money on this like I did.",The Curse of La Llorona

I left my little one with Dad but took my teenager and HE was even scarred. It's rated R, omg. I feel they used the same house as that movie Hereditary from the inside...little spoiler alert.......>>>>> attic scene. Any who I think this deserves higher ratings.",The Curse of La Llorona

603,ellencjonsson,Stop blaming James Wan,7,21 April 2019,"This was a decent movie in the Conjuring universe. It wasn't great, but definitely decent. The writing was lacking a bit, but the acting was good and so was the entire mood of the film. The resolution/ending wasn't very good. Could've been improved by better ""writing."" Don't compare this movie to the Conjuring and don't blame James Wan if you didn't like it. I've seen a lot of comments going on about them being so disappointed they can't sleep and that they've lost their faith in Wan. Cool your pits people. James Was was not the director, nor the writer on this one. He was 1 out of 9 producers. Michael Chaves was the director, and is also going to direct the Conjuring 3 that comes out in 2020.",The Curse of La Llorona
