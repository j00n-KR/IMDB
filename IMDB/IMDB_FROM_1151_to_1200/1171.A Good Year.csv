0,SnoopyStyle,not right for a comedy,5,14 January 2016,"Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) is a high-powered self-assured successful investment trader in London. His uncle Henry (Albert Finney) taught him the love of wine. After Henry's death, he inherits the rundown estate in Provence where he spent part of his childhood. He's looking to sell the property as soon as possible. He falls for local waitress Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard) after almost running her over with his car. His latest deal has caused problems and he's suspended for a week. Old memories hound him and then American Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) shows up claiming to be Henry's abandoned daughter.Russell Crowe is not right for this slapstick comedy. All his attempts at pratfalls come off flat. Ridley Scott is not known for comedies and it shows. The romance is weak and takes too long to get going. It's a shame considering it has a great actress in Cotillard. Christie provides an interesting mystery but she doesn't fit the light slapstick comedy. It's not bad but it's not funny either.",A Good Year
1,jboothmillard,A Good Year,5,15 March 2010,"You might think this looks like an odd choice of genre of film for director Sir Ridley Scott and his leading star of Gladiator to pick together, but it does almost work actually. Basically English banker and trader Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) learns that his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) has died, and as the only living relative he has inherited his château and vineyard in Provence, France. Through flashbacks we see that Young Max (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Freddie Highmore) spent some of childhood with his Uncle learning about and doing some wine making, and the business of selling it. He goes to the château intent on selling it, and quickly returning to work in London, but it needs quite a bit of repair before it has a showing, so he stays there a few days in the meantime. He also has the inconvenience of young American girl Christie Roberts (Candy's Abbie Cornish), saying she is Henry's illegitimate daughter, living with him. As time goes by however, it is not just his childhood memories changing his mind about things, but he wants to stay very close to his new love interest, French waitress Fanny Chenal (Le Vie En Rose's Marion Cotillard). In the end Max has to choose between his career and the château, but thankfully he manages to take the money, and sell his house in London, before returning to Provence, and of course Fanny. Also starring Rafe Spall as Kenny, Archie Panjabi as Gemma, Richard Coyle as Amis and Pirates of the Caribbean's Tom Hollander as Charlie Willis. Crowe has a very lame English accent, adding unnecessary words like ""fellow"" and stuff, but he and the beautiful Cotillard manage to charm you, it might not be the funniest film ever, but it is a delightfully good-natured (near romantic) comedy drama. Worth watching!",A Good Year
2,tavm,A Good Year is enjoyable fluff for Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe,6,12 November 2006,"Having read some negative reviews of A Good Year, I wasn't sure what to expect when my friend bought some tickets to this. While some of the slapstick, such the mud-filled pool sequence, did grate on me, it did get better as it went along. Russell Crowe plays a London stock broker who has inherited Uncle Albert Finney's French villa after his death. The same villa that provided some wonderful childhood memories as depicted by Finney and Freddie Highmore as the younger Crowe. There's also a couple of beautiful women in Abbie Cornish and Marion Cotillard. So in summation, this is an uneven, but still enjoyable romantic comedy that should please anyone who likes that sort of thing. A nice departure for director Ridley Scott.",A Good Year
3,edwagreen,A Good Year for Wine But Not for Film **,4,8 September 2007,"Russell Crowe's attempt at comedy in this film is good but the problem with this film is that it is so highly predictable.If Crowe loved only his uncle, why hadn't he seen him in 10 years? Crowe, as Skinner, is in selling bonds and his unorthodox methods leads to a suspension which comes just in time so that he can learn about the vintage that he has apparently inherited.The one surprise here is that the uncle (Albert Finney) in flashbacks, had an illegitimate daughter who can claim the vintage for her own.Naturally, there is a girlfriend for Skinner here as his best friend ultimately falls for the daughter (Marion Cotillard) who is supposed to be brilliant in ""La Vie en Rouge"" as Edith Piaf.Everything ties up so neatly here. It is just too neat.",A Good Year
4,dbborroughs,Disappointing misfire about a bond trader who grows up when he visits his uncle's estate in France,4,30 June 2007,"Ridley Scott's film of Peter Mayle's book was an unmitigated disaster at the box office. Costing a chunk of change this ""romantic comedy"" essentially was dead after the first weekend. I had wanted to see the movie when it played in theaters last year but it disappeared almost instantly. Running across it in the used bin I picked it up and then put it on while I was cleaning this afternoon.I know why it sank.Russell Crowe is a bond trader who only wants to make a buck at anyones expense and to hell with the consequences. Just as he scores big on a questionable deal he finds his uncle, the only man he ever loved, and to whom he hadn't spoken in 10 years has died. Running to France to see the estate left to him, an estate he decides to sell, Crowe finds his past catching up with him and a few bumps in the road.Billed as a ""Romantic Comedy"" the romance-other than a love of the French country side, is not really in evidence here.To be certain Crowe does woo the girl, but most of that is in the last third of the film. The rest is Crowe trying to keep his life from imploding, dealing with an unexpected relative, the locals who don't want him to sell the estate and his nostalgia for his dead uncle. The movie is funny and charming at times, but I can only suspect it suffers from a compression from the novel. There is simply too many threads running through this and its not much of anything.Worst of all is Crowes character who is pretty much a real SOB. You don't like him at all, at least not below the surface. He's charming and sweet but its clear he's a shark thats always on the make.Any sympathy we do have is the result of Crowe being Crowe and not because of anything about the character thats likable. This makes his change to someone else largely unbelievable (at least in the movies time frame). Its bad enough the film is juggling too many balls but to have a lead character you don't like is asking too much (especially when his trader buddies are equally vile).Beautiful to look at and very well acted, this is the sort of movie that you may want to use to show how beautiful your new HD TV looks but its not the sort of thing that you'd actually want to sit and watch. Its a perfect example of how good people in the film industry can bring the best things together and still make cow pie of a movie.Almost 5ish out of 10 for the bits that work.",A Good Year
5,writers_reign,Non Vintage,6,28 October 2006,"The English critics have more or less blasted this new release unanimously but I went anyway. I'm lion-hearted. And you know, it wasn't too bad. Sure, it owes something to Avanti and Ridley Scott is no Billy Wilder and Russell Crowe is definitely no Jack Lemmon but Marion Cotillard, soon to be seen as Edith Piaf, is more than a match for Juliet Mills. In their wisdom IMDb omit five actors from the initial cast list so that you have to click 'more' to find out that Marion Cotillard, Abbie Cornish, Isabelle Candelier, Didier Bourdon and Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi are also part of the ensemble; leading lady and love-interest Cotillard is arguably the largest omission but Candelier and Bourdon offer huge support throughout, Abbie Cornish is the Californian who turns up looking for her father whilst Bruni-Tedeschi is an avocat. It seems to be a truth universally acknowledged that Russell Crowe doesn't do Charm and/or light comedy but hey, he gives it the old college try and with support like that mentioned it's not such a big deal. It's basically a feel gooder with some great scenery punctuated by some Judge and Andy Hardy lessons in life with Finney in the Lewis Stone role and Crowe as Mickey Rooney but the two hours really do fly by.",A Good Year
6,lastliberal,It's your life that does not suit this place.,7,25 March 2008,"Who wouldn't want an uncle that left them a vineyard in Provence? Why would anyone have to think twice about a life of sipping wine and Marion Cotillard, who looked her real beautiful self, and not the character she portrayed in La Vie en rose? But, Russell Crowe was making this choice and provided an enjoyable romantic comedy about a successful trader that inherits a château in France. Crowe provided just the right touch in this film. The comedy was subtle and not overdone had they cast someone like Hugh Grant for the lead. The magic with Cotillard could not have been done with anyone else either.I had heard some criticism of this film and was wary, but I was mildly surprised at just how enjoyable it was. Of course, Albert Finney added to that enjoyment, and the enchanting Archie Panjabi as Gemmy, but none so much as Cotillard.",A Good Year
7,ferguson-6,Not the finest vintage,6,11 November 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, this is the reuniting of the director and the star of ""Gladiator"". For some reason, Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe decided to remake ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". Okay, so it may not really be a remake, but it is a wimpy version of Peter Mayle's novel. Twenty years ago, Alan Alda would have been cast in Mr. Crowe's role. The transition of the high-powered Gordon Gekko type into an ultra-sensitive stop-and-smell-the roses guy is painful to watch for all respectable men. Women, on the other hand, will love it.The flashback scenes with Freddie Highmore (""Charlie and Chocolate Factory"") as the young Crowe and his mentor uncle, played by Albert Finney are actually fun to watch, although there are far too few of those scenes. Marion Cotillard plays the horribly named Fanny Chenal, the magical French bistro owner who melts Crowe's iceberg heart. Ms. Cotillard actually flashes some nice acting in one scene towards the end. Other than that, the pain of watching tough guy Crowe play with his eye glasses and act effeminate is just torturous.For a date movie or a chick's night out, the film is just fine. Other than that, I say Ridley and Russell owe me something very special in their next reunion ... otherwise, just say no.",A Good Year
8,gradyharp,Pablum for a Evening's View,6,28 February 2007,"Peter Mayle's popular novel 'A Year in Provence' has been transferred to the screen by screenwriter Marc Klein under the odd direction of Ridley Scott, best known for such films as 'Hannibal', 'Gladiator', 'Matchstick Men', 'Thelma and Louise', 'Black Hawk Down', 'Blade Runner' etc. and the result may surprise many viewers. No, this is not a shocker of a film but rather a too familiar tale of a man obsessed with making money who inherits a vineyard and château in Provence from the uncle that served as his family as a child and in returning to the old estate, finds the earth and his memories too long buried about how he loved the space of arrested time of his childhood. The man is British financial wizard Max Skinner (Russell Crowe in a very subdued performance) who as a young bright lad (Freddie Highmore) lived with Uncle Henry Skinner (Albert Finney), learning the ins and outs of growing grapes and making wine. Max returns to the château after Uncle Henry's death with all intentions of polishing up the neglected place to place on the market to make yet more money. The live-in couple who maintain the place (Francis Duflot - Didier Bourdon - and his wife Ludivine - Isabelle Candelier) challenge Max's decision to sell the place, hiding some secrets about the vintages that will eventually alter the course of the story. Max slowly falls in love with his memories of his childhood, reconnecting with his love for his uncle, discovering a young beauty Fanny (Marion Cotillard) who owns a bistro and was actually a childhood 'friend' to Max, and also discovering that the philandering uncle had an illegitimate daughter Christie (Abbie Cornish) who visits the château to get to know who her father was (bringing along a deep knowledge of wine making from California's Napa Valley!). The film is then a struggle between Max's obsession with money as abetted by his home coworkers Gemma (Archie Panjabi) and Charlie (Tom Hollander) and his changing need and love for the life and memories bound tightly to his Provence château. How it all works out is the relaxing if predictable finale of the story. The cast is attractive (including even a bit part for the beautiful and talented Valeria Bruni Tedeschi!) and seem to meld with Ridley Scott's concept of offering a little fluff of French dessert. It is light in vein but beautiful to look at and it is interesting to see Scott and Crowe together in a non-violent venture! Grady Harp",A Good Year
9,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A Good Year,8,5 November 2006,"The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together, they made the award winning Gladiator, and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar. Here, they come together again for a pretty feel good movie, but I don't expect that this would win any major honours. Not that it's a bad film, but it's quite vanilla plain, that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold.Based on a book by Peter Mayle, A Good Year has plenty of life references to wine and vineyards, made as a comparison and reminder on how to live life. It's quite unlike Sideways, which was more of a road trip movie and had its plot revolve around wine. A Good Year has its revolve around an arse hole of a character, Maximillian Skinner (Russell Crowe), the successful bond trader everyone loves to hate, given his ruthless knack on the trading bourses, and making loads of obscene money.So he learns that he had inherited a château in France, the same one he had spent his childhood (little Max played by Freddie Highmore) summer holidays in with his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney), but instead the first thing that crosses his mind is, how much is it worth should he sell it?It's a look at how you want to live life, making loads of money versus living it out with plenty of heart, and love. Love for the people who once made a difference to your life, and love and appreciation of life itself. Time to stop and smell the roses, versus the corporate rat race filled with backstabbing and office politics. And naturally when finding out about oneself, a look back at one's roots will always be a good way to start.There are a number of sub plots weaved into the movie, like the sudden appearance of a possible illegitimate cousin, Christie (Abbie Cornish), who could complicate matters of inheritance, of the opposition of resident vineyard caretaker Francis (Didier Bourdon), and of course, romance in the form of a feisty French woman Fanny (Marion Cotillard), amongst others. There's also a bit about the different wine standards thrown in, which serves only to confuse, rudimentarily. There's a ring of familiarity to these characters, and at a glance, you would probably be able to guess the parts they play to develop the story, as do the little nagging business bits in the movie, but by making all these threads come together, and certain plot devices as well, only served to deliver up to expectations in an all's well that ends well.Some random thoughts - I loved the song by Alizee used in the movie, and quite surprised that it actually made it other than just be featured in the trailer. The movie also turned out to be quite the technological showcase, at least in the beginning, accompanying Max's progressive change. You have GPS, and almost an ad feel to Max's use of his PDA phone for calls, photo taking, the whole works. And if you think Crowe's outfits looked snazzy, yes, he's outfitted by Armani.The very first time I took notice of Russell Crowe, was when he played the villain in Virtuosity. Back then I thought that the guy had something going for him. And I've been convinced, having watched his last 6 movies, that he's a pretty fine actor, though his buffed and gruff demeanour had the tabloids highlighting his every shenanigan. Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore make a good pairing as well, given their limited screen time as the Uncle and his young nephew spending summer together. And don't get me started on the eye candy, who, well, remain eye candy for the most parts.A Good Year runs on an even keel, and feels light by the time it ends. Let's hope the next collaboration between Scott and Crowe in American Gangster, with the addition of Denzel Washington (who played opposite Crowe in Virtuosity), will be something more explosive.""Winning's not everything, it's the only thing!"" - Maximillian Skinner",A Good Year
10,siderite,Not very interesting,6,18 March 2007,"The idea is nothing new. Ruthless city slicker (bond broker, of course) remembers his childhood and regains his soul in beautiful sunny Provence, where his uncle had this great vineyard.From the very beginning I could see that the introspection, written text bits and some of the details did not fit the usual cliché and that it was probably based on a book. Apparently, Ridley Scott had the idea, gave it to a guy to write the book, then, when the book wasn't quite like what he wanted, he made the film based on the book , but with his original idea in the background. And it shows!The movie is not terribly romantic, even if it has all the setting and opportunity. It is not a very emotional movie, even if it should have evoked feelings of nostalgia and love of nature. It's not even a nature shot film, as the beautiful scenery is mostly wasted in useless scenes and most of the movie is placed either in the city or in the house.So where does this get us? Nowhere! Just a failure of a film with a failure of a script. Even my wife said it was bad. Bottom line: really boring and implausible.",A Good Year
11,namashi_1,"A Simple, Feel-Good Film...",9,14 July 2015,"Based on the 2004 novel of the same name by British author Peter Mayle, 'A Good Year' is A Simple, Feel-Good Film, made none other than the Master himself, Sir Ridley Scott. This rather under-rated film is a combination of subtle romance & engaging humour. 'A Good Year' Synopsis: A British investment broker inherits his uncle's château and vineyard in Provence, where he spent much of his childhood. He discovers a new laid-back lifestyle as he tries to renovate the estate to be sold.'A Good Year' made me smile. The narrative is lighthearted & relaxing. The beauty of its characters is nicely presented, while the humour doesn't miss a beat. The romance here is subtle, but very mature too. Marc Klein's Adapted Screenplay is top-notch. The Writing is consistently engaging & the narrative flows very nicely. Sir Ridley Scott proves how versatile he is by handling a Romantic-Comedy like 'A Good Year', with such skill. His Direction is flawless, yet again! Philippe Le Sourd's Cinematography captures the sheer gorgeousness of the South of France, most accurately. Dody Dorn's Editing is mostly crisp. Art & Costume Design are decent. Marc Streitenfeld's Score is pleasant.Performance-Wise: Russell Crowe is excellent, delivering one of his most believable performances to date. He shines from start to end. The Wonderful Marion Cotillard is lovely, as always. Albert Finney, who only appears in flashbacks, is effective. Abbie Cornish is superb. Didier Bourdon & Isabelle Candelier are impressive. Archie Panjabi is first-rate. Freddie Highmore is masterfully restrained. On the whole, 'A Good Year' is indeed A Great Watch. Two Thumbs Up!",A Good Year
12,ksf-2,man checks on inherited vineyard,7,11 April 2021,"Russell Crowe is british businessman Max, who inherits a vineyard from Uncle Henry en france. He must go back to check it out. As we can see, he has been living the fast, action packed life as a stock trader. When he arrives, he doesn't make any friends. And.. the gentleman running the vineyard is SO disappointed that Max wants to sell the place. And one more complication... a girl claiming to be another heir turns up at the last minute. Some funny lines in here, mostly insults uttered quietly behind someone else's back. The story marches on, and Max meets an old flame. And starts to like the place. As these movies go. No big surprises, but it's a sweet story. Directed by Ridley Scott. Nominated for four oscars (but not for this film). He and Crowe have worked together on numerous (very successful) films. This is certainly a slower pace film than Gladiator.",A Good Year
13,inkblot11,"A Good Year is a good time at the movies, if a trifle blase in parts",6,27 November 2006,"Max (Russell Crowe) is a cutthroat banking executive who loves to outwit fellow bankers and score big bucks in the fray. A workaholic, he seldom makes time for anything like a personal life. Word comes one day, however, that his uncle has died in Provence and that Max is the inheritor of a large house and a vineyard. Pausing to reflect on his wonderful memories of his uncle, Max nevertheless travels to France with the sole intention of selling the place as quickly as possible. Yet, there are distractions from his plans from the moment he rediscovers the old mansion. The vineyard caretaker is amiable, a local lady is beauty personified and a previously unknown relative turns up on the doorstep, too. Is it possible for a ruthless banker to develop a heart and a taste for the simple life? This is first, and foremost, a lovely film to watch. The locale, in France, is stunning, much like the beautiful scenery from another film called French Kiss. All movie fans who like to go gaga over gorgeous footage should make a date to see this film. Crowe, a fine actor, is pleasing in his role as the banker. The supporting cast is also very nice, especially the woman who plays Max's catty secretary. Tom Hollander, who scored big laughs in last year's Pride and Prejudice, is also a lot of fun as a cohort of Max's. There is really nothing wrong with the film except that life, in the country, moves at a slow pace and there are parts of the film that seem to crawl. Scott, with Blade Runner, Matchstick Men, and Gladiator on his resume, has a secure place in film history as a stellar director. One can accept the fact that he probably longed for a chance of pace and chose to do this film. Although it is not the one he will probably best remembered for, A Good Year is still a very pleasant and often witty film. It will probably age very well, just like fine wine from a vineyard in France.",A Good Year
14,vincentlynch-moonoi,A very enjoyable Russell Crowe,7,3 July 2015,"When it comes to Russell Crowe,, I'm pretty neutral. Certainly not one of my favorites, but I must admit he has turned in some superb performances. I think what I usually don't like about him is that I feel he takes himself too seriously. I liked Crowe in this film more than any film I've seen him in. He seems more relaxed here, and showed a talent for humor that I never realized was there.Aside from Crowe's entertaining performance, the movie itself is quite charming, pleasantly humorous, and just a bit dramatic, as well. The basic story is a go-getter stock trader gets in trouble with some questionable tradings, right about the time his uncle dies. Up for grabs are some great memories and a château and vineyards in France. But, along comes a usurper...maybe...and a potential lover...maybe. Essentially, it comes down to a story of you can take the boy out of the country...or can you? Another treat here are the flashbacks of Crowe's character as a boy with his uncle, played by Albert Finney. Finney may have let himself go in his later years, but he's still quite enchanting on the big screen.All of the supporting actors here do very nicely. I particularly enjoyed seeing Archie Panjabi, lately of ""The Good Wife"".I recommend this film because it is charming and so different for Crowe.",A Good Year
15,tabuno,An Entertaining if Not Great Romantic Comedy,7,21 January 2019,"10 March 2007. Russell Crowe under the direction of Ridley Scott (again) is somewhat overly, manipulative awkward in this romantic comedy. There are some nice cute, humorous scenes, but overuse of unnecessary car stunts that are more ridiculous than funny. But Russell Crowe is usually playfully against type. This romantic comedy has a decent storyline yet it didn't manage to capture the modernistic comedy/drama balance that contemporary movies have reached now. More of a popular entertaining, fun movie for the date crowd with a morally safe message for all. Some of the subtext plot lines weren't sufficiently developed to radiant a stronger intensity. Overall, ""A Good Year"" was an enjoyable, if not great movie.",A Good Year
16,johnnyboyz,Crap d'rhone - this 2006 vintage certainly leaves a bitter taste.,4,25 June 2013,"A Good Year is a film predominantly set in France made by somebody who doesn't appear to understand the first thing about France; nor indeed French people, nor indeed English people or England - nor indeed comedy and had the film been made by anyone else other than someone with a track record as good as Ridley Scott, nor even narrative. This is not a good film – a piece here refusing to depict anything intricate or subtle; this is an aggressive film, the worst possible comedy one can come across: an 'international' comedy that has been made with the widest possible audience in mind flush with stars and a poorly thought through 'tourist' aesthetic which plagues proceedings throughout. As far as Crowe/Scott combinations go, this is one of the more exasperating.At its core is actually an interesting idea about someone stuck in a very stoic, very specific life of hard-line rhetoric whose ignorance to other people and cultures is challenged when, by chance, they find themselves abroad. How the film goes about depicting such a thing is laughable to say the least, but not in the way that arrives via a good comedy. The lead is a certain Max Skinner, played by Russell Crowe. When we observe the earliest part of a point in Max's life, we see him spending carefree summers with his uncle in the south of France, summers of which include the briefest of moments of wine tasting and games of tennis and chess in the sun. Cut to years later and London has replaced France; Cognac has replaced wine and a sharp, metallic greyed out office in the ""Gherkin"" building has replaced messing about in life. Max is a trader and a good one at that. His insistence on competition, winning and daring to cheat during those aforementioned chess matches has carried over into his job, a job that allows him to be someone who abuses the system in ways that are perfectly legal that often results in the making of lots of money. Feared and respected in equal measure by his peers, Max is the boss of his surroundings.Hark, for time away from his luxurious apartment; successful job and cold, characterless, cutthroat surroundings are challenged when a trip back to Southern France rears up out of the fact his dear old uncle has died and left Max the house. Wary that should he go someone could usurp him as is the tradition in the field of trading; Max is sceptical, but is convinced by co-workers that it will be good for him. Cue comedy, and the fish-out-of-water content suddenly kicks in as this tough-as-nails trader ends up in a zone that is the polar opposite to what he's used to. Where films such as Brick Lane and The Namesake have depicted people of such varied cultures and backgrounds trying to come to terms with a different society/culture/climate/set of beliefs, and have done reasonably well to depict such things, A Good Year appears to be of the belief that separate sequences involving Russell Crowe rolling around in some mud and being urinated on by a dog should suffice as instances ably depicting someone out of their comfort zone.Scott's laughable ideas on how this person's adventure out and away from what he's used to are equalled only in their rank abjectness by a God-awful approach. Listen hard and you can hear the wails of a sub-text crying out to be explored which might have seen the vast, cultural differences between two once-great nations that are so close to one another geographically depicted and explored - tragically drowned out by a rampaging series of cleavage shots, ugly stereotypes and derivative character frameworks. Crowe (who, one must remember, is actually a New Zealand-born Australian) agrees to play dress up to Scott's behind the camera antics and act as the epitome of a priggish Englishness one encounters when one is abroad in places such as France or Spain. Sporting a cricket kit and possessing a brash, arrogant tone as if one is 'above' one's host, he revels in trumping those he encounters at whichever turn he can. Further evidence that this was always intended as an international comedy, with no regard whatsoever to the subtleties that should be inherent in a film such as this, the French are offered few favours in their depictions as scatty, eccentric people whose heat in the South appears to have gone straight to their heads and stayed there.Of these French is Fanny Chenal (Cotillard), a young woman whose purpose is to pout a lot; allude to the fact she has breasts and fall off a bicycle. As time goes by, it appears she ought to be more relevant to Max than initially seems. The groans one ought to induce upon a certain reveal being made should be long and hearty, the sheer coincidence of the instance should make one feel they have had their intelligence not only insulted but removed entirely; beaten with a small pole and then shoved back in again. Max's womanising ways, already established in the opening, are here designed to act as the film's centrepiece around which the very makeup of the man should shift into being the polar opposite of what he was back in London. Twist in mind, the process is wholly sped up in this regard when compared to how it would've been had they had to start from scratch and the technique is nauseating - what does Max actually learn about women in this regard? The film left me feeling cold and unsatisfied, not things I associate with the director's work; the lead actor's work and the location when it's put to film properly.",A Good Year
17,southdavid,Uncle Albert,7,27 April 2021,"The ""star"" channels addition to Disney Plus has, frankly, played havoc with my plans to watch every movie on the app in alphabetical order. In addition to the number of new films, at the moment there's no longer a list of all the films in alphabetical order, so now there's homework to try and work out what's what.Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) is a rather unscrupulous merchant banker, whose used to the finer things in life and not used to being told ""no"". Just after a particularly questionable trade, Max heads to France, to see about selling his late Uncle's (Albert Finney) Vineyard and estate, where he spent much of his childhood. As he struggles to decide on how to progress, he meets Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard) a beautiful waitress, who further encourages Max to change his life.What could be more relatable, in this day and age, than the troubles of a white, male, merchant banker, whose biggest life problem is whether or not he should sell the estate in France he's inherited - we've all been there! Joking apart, I actually quite enjoyed ""A Good Year"". It's a slight and easy-going sort of film, the fact that Ridley Scott actually directs, rather than just produces is interesting and it must be pretty close to the most easy-going film he's ever done. It's reasonably funny and Russell Crow is a surprisingly good romantic leading man, it's a shame we didn't get to see him do it more often in his prime years. There is a litany of fine supporting actors in the film, including Rafe Spall, Freddie Highmore, Archie Panjabi, Tom Hollander and Abbie Cornish. There are even tiny roles for Daniel Mays, Richard Coyle and Kenneth Cranham.I wouldn't argue with anyone that said the film was a bit too long and a bit too predictable. Or that it was a bit stereotypical, with it's view of the French characters. But overall, I quite enjoyed it - there was chemistry between the actors and the cinematography is really well done.",A Good Year
18,FiendishDramaturgy,Derivative,1,31 May 2007,"Yet another commonplace piece of detritus from Crowe. I did expect better from Ridley Scott, but after hearing what preview audiences thought of the film, I decided to go anyway to see how bad it really was.Frankly, the preview audiences' reviews weren't strong enough to demonstrate just how bad this IS. It is 100% predictable, and the moral (was there a moral?) is the most common tripe ever presented.Ridley Scott is known for his anti-American sentiments, and he doesn't fail to sink his claws into us here. Of course, we are no-class, trailer park living inbred yokels, according to this film. Thanks for nothing, Scott, which is exactly what this film gives its audience; nothing.Albert Finney is brilliant.

19,juneebuggy,A nice escape,7,6 October 2014,"This was pretty good, a bit of a departure for Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott as its a ""charming romantic comedy"" but it works. Crowe plays a London Investment banker who inherits a vineyard in France and finds his life changing for the better as he goes about the process of renovating, selling it and falling in love.Not a terribly unique story and I didn't care too much for Crowe in the romantic comedy role. Some of his scenes felt forced (the pool, driving the mini car) but this is still an enjoyable, well made and amusing movie with gorgeous scenery.

20,EUyeshima,The Romantic Emancipation of Russell Crowe,7,12 November 2006,"I have to admit this 2006 movie based on the book by Peter Mayle (whose ""A Year in Provence"" is a favorite of mine) starts rather unpromisingly since it carries the same smug, self-satisfied attitude that its hero has. Director Ridley Scott takes a while to find the right rhythm for this romantic comedy, but he eventually does, even if it means recycling elements from other similarly executed fish-out-of-water films like ""Baby Boom"", ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". In fact, the whole venture feels decidedly old-fashioned with formula elements feeling like they come from some Universal film made in the 1960's, but the retro-chic aspect somehow works like a fictionalized account of a lifestyle cable channel program since there is little in the way of real dramatic conflict.Atypically cast in a lighter vein here, the naturally pugnacious Russell Crowe seems to be channeling one of the Grants (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) in portraying a Machiavellian-level London investment banker named Max Skinner, who unexpectedly inherits a dilapidated château and vineyard in Provence from his uncle Henry, a figure he loved as a child but has since become estranged due to Max's selfish, greed-obsessed existence. Written by Marc Klein, the bulk of the movie is about what Max does with the estate as he argues with the longtime vintner and becomes entwined with two women - pretty Christie, who claims to be Henry's illegitimate daughter from a tryst with an American, and the too-perfectly-named Fanny Chanel, a beautiful local restaurateur who tries mightily to resist Max's romantic overtures after a most bumpy start. As Max weighs his options, his unforgiving career and jet-setting lifestyle back in London appear to be in jeopardy.More like a Cagney than a Grant, Crowe has the type of aggressive screen persona that takes on all comers, so he seems more in his element being a jerk. However, he acquits himself more than you would expect as the story begins to humanize his character, and he is more deft as a comic actor than even Scott presumes. For example, there are extended sequences in an empty swimming pool and during a tennis match when Scott seems to mistake action for slapstick. Max may be Crowe's most likable role since the loving gay son he played in the 1994 Australian indie, ""The Sum of Us"". In flashbacks, Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp's protégé in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", affectingly plays Max as a child, even though the lack of physical resemblance is a bit jarring. Better is Albert Finney as rhapsodizing Uncle Henry since his casting hearkens back to the actor's youth in south-of-France-set movies like ""Two for the Road"" and ""The Picasso Summer"" in the late sixties.Australian actress Abbie Cornish convincingly portrays a guileless American with more than a passing interest in wine, while Marion Cotillard is a stunning, feisty presence as Fanny (although the obvious age disparity between her and Crowe makes some of the back story a bit of a head scratch). Entertaining though more standard rom-com contributions are made by Tom Hollander as Max's realtor best friend Charlie (in an update of the usual Gig Young third-wheel role), Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Candelier as caretaker Duflot and his playful wife, and Archie Panjabi as Max's jaded but devoted assistant Gemma. The wine-growing region of Provence hardly needs more exposure in movies, but Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography brings it glowingly to life. A most idiosyncratic soundtrack accompanies the film with genre-irrelevant chestnuts like Patti Page's ""Old Cape Cod"", Harry Nilsson's ""Gotta Get Up"" and a French cover of ""Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini"" by Richard Anthony. This is the kind of movie where you can see the ending a mile away, but I have to say for the most part, I enjoyed the ride.",A Good Year
21,jaybob,A good movie,7,7 April 2007,"I do not understand all the bad reviews the film received. Its not a great film, I did not expect a great film. This is a romantic comedy & very few romantic comedies are more than good.Ridley Scott directed this, I am not sure if he directed any comedies before, He always is a competent director.Russell Crowe, makes very few romantic comedies & it is nice to see him in one.There are some scenes bordering on slapstick & this is not his forte. Then again very few actors today can do good slapstick scenes.There are some lovely ladies as well & they all are very good. Albert Finney has a small tole & as usual he is wonderful.The only real fault I have is the length. the 114 minute running time was long. It could have been cut by about 20 minutes.I did like the music song score & many of you know how I usually condemn the song scores in films.

22,dierregi,Fairy tale meets stereotypes = not a good mix,2,7 July 2009,"This movie manages to put together a truckload of stereotypes and a bunch of annoying characters, to deliver a conventional, Cinderella-worth happy ending.It is supposed to be realistic (the ferocious financial genius, the cynical Londoners, vineyards in Frances  surely all things that exist) but at the same time conveys an idea of fairy tale and unreality.I am not sure if financial sharks of the type portrayed by Crowe actually exist. I never met one in real life, so for me he is the equivalent of a modern Prince Charming. I am also not quite sure if rich uncles (and aunts) departing from this world and leaving a fortune to a distant heir actually exist, but they are the stuff dreams are made of – they die, you don't even suffer because you haven't seen them in ages and yet you find yourself immensely richer thanks to their departure. Add a magical country, far far away (even if it is just France and not so magical in reality) painted in loving golden tones (by contrast with England, painted in steel gray, cold tones) and you have a blurry scenario to work with.The main character in this fuzzy territory is your average, cold-hearted guy, working as a financial trader of some sort (the type we saw in many movies since ""Wall Street""). He is played by an extremely annoying Russell Crowe, as your cliché British man: arrogant, insensitive and pompous.His love interest is raising star Marion Cotillard, going down a well-traveled road of her own- the one of the sexy, warm-hearted, spirited (and slightly slutty) French woman.Add more stereotyped characters to the mix (supplementary sexy French women; a French wine maker who hates the British; an eccentric British uncle; a snotty British secretary) and the predictable result will be the melting of the ice-cold heart of the British guy and his decision to overturn his life for the love of the French gal.This is not a spoiler as I am pretty sure everybody knows by now (or would imagine, as soon as the movie starts) how it is going to end. Could you possibly imagine Russell not getting the girl and not turning into a decent human being? Honestly, I used to like him, but he is totally insufferable in this movie. There is something absolutely idiotic in the way he is acting – but maybe he was doing it on purpose, to make his character so unlovable. In this case he would have deserved an Oscar.A final word of warning: for anybody who has never been to France: not all French women are thin, sexy and feisty. In fact, you have all kinds, exactly as you can find in most Western countries.",A Good Year

24,Galina_movie_fan,"""Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.""",6,8 June 2007,"I've been a fan of Russell Crowe for long time and I like a lot all his performances I've seen. He is a very talented actor, one of the best of his generation. He is especially good and convincing at playing strong, charismatic, intense, and often brooding characters but I've noticed that I like him the most when he smiles. He does not do it often, on the contrary, his smile is a rare gift but it changes his face completely, it literally lights his face, makes it younger, softer, and even tender. I have always been curious to see him in a light and funny comedy and when I learned that he and Ridley Scott who has directed him to the Oscar in ""The Gladiator"" teamed up for a romantic comedy that takes place in the vineyard of sunny Provence, in the south of France, I was very interested in seeing it.I should say that even though I had expected more from the movie, it was nice. The story is very familiar and predictable but the film is a delight to watch since it was made by a master of the stunningly beautiful visuals, the master who can look at the familiar landmark from the different prospective, the way nobody else has. The best about ""A Good Year"" is its look - dreamy, enveloping, delightfully intoxicating - just as wine that plays such a big role in the story of Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) who one day suddenly finds himself back in the place where he used to be happy once as a boy but almost forgot the feeling having left for a huge dynamic mega polis where he has become a ruthless arrogant businessman. He will have to slow down and to learn what the real pleasures, values, and priorities in life are. Once more, Russell Crowe has proved that he can act but I found his performance a little too heavy and intense for such a silly light comedy. Watching him in ""A Good Year"" reminds me of an old story. A famous comic actor, lying on his deathbed, was asked by a friend, ""Is it hard, this dying?"" ""No,"" replied the actor. ""Dying is easy. Comedy is hard."" I was glad to see Crowe in the comedy even if not completely successful and there was one absolutely charming and hilarious scene with Crowe driving the smallest and cutest car imaginable which brought to my mind the similar scene in the latest Woody Allen's comedy. I began to wonder what Woody Allen's next project would be. What if two of them, Allen and Crowe will get to work together? That would be a comedy I will never miss.6.5/10",A Good Year

There's nothing interesting going on between the 20th Century Fox opening drum-roll and the final FIN.The primary blame lies with Peter Mayle, a bland and talent-free writer with no knowledge of real people, their characteristics, the reality of living. For example, out hero makes a quick $21 million in the opening 5 minutes by an entirely un-clever stock manipulation. Sure he did, and I'm the King of England. I've never met any group of people in real life as boring and shallow as you meet in any Peter Mayle novel, or in this movie in particular. When he inherits a vineyard in Tuscany, the story gets worse, with every boring moment leading to another transparent and phony-baloney scene. Don't blame Russell Crowe. Given a zero script and listless direction from the once-great Ridley Scott, his job of breathing life into this is hopeless.",A Good Year
26,Stampsfightclub,Scott generates feel good comedy romance,7,30 March 2010,"On making a successful stock move Max Skinner (Crowe) returns to France to visit the place he spent as a kid to find his old self remerging through the French lifestyle.Alien director Ridley Scott brings some flash and style to a story of rediscovering the past through some sharp settings and a likable story that, whilst has flaws in comedy and romantic timing, will make many faces light up.Ridley Scott, in his first shot at a romantic film, predictably uses experience in the more humorous and action orientated sequences. The bike knock over sequence is done with a nice swerve and precision, if the context of in the moment is misjudged. The scene in the pool filling up uses good angles and the moments of window gazing cement the feeling of isolation nicely, but there is something that doesn't fit with this picture, and that is the structure which is too juggled to be opportunistic for the story's moments.The opening sequence, a quiet and cheeky dramatic insight into Max's youth shows Freddie Highmore sat cheating at a chess game whilst Albert Finney is blissfully aware of his nephew's antics. On resuming contact the two engage in meaningful life philosophy that feels a tad preachy for the beginning of a supposed comedy romance. As the film shoots us forward into the stereotyped coldness of Britain and in none other than in a happy person's workspace celebrating robbing others of a stock move, we have the emergence of predictable downgrading person's growth. Cold hearted business man seeks more financial income so flees his moment to France where he inherits his Uncle's château and vineyard that as the film progresses brings back treasured memories.So the misguided opening is to be left aside from a film that is certainly feel good and an enjoyable relaxation of troubled mindset rediscovering its roots.Crowe brings a light-hearted comedy vibe and a sharp obvious British accent to Max and whilst script-fully the plot isn't as chuckle some as your standard romantic comedy, Crowe is a good on screen presence and the right man to lead. Albert Finney is the right man for the body of respectable life experience as the film juggles past and present as if an over hyped clown with a new set of juggling balls.If this film was told chronologically we could have felt more in sync with the current state of proceedings and whilst it is always easy to establish what is happening, there are frequent moments when the mood doesn't match the right flashback.Scott in his first outing with anything so romantic gets it mostly right with cinematography of France well balanced and the cue of Marion Cotillard's entrance perfect. The comedy and drama are good enough to maintain the mood of feel good throughout that come the end, whilst there is a sudden rush to show the credits, will hopefully make everyone smile.",A Good Year

That's the kind of non-choice dished out by A Good Year, which plays like a smarmy credit card commercial, a wish fulfillment fantasy careful to avoid truly difficult, disquieting choices - the ones, you know, which fuel drama and conflict in fiction.Crowe goes through the motions (first time in his career as far as I recall), adorable Cotillard and Cornish are wasted, and Scott succumbs to his worst instincts, halfway between a travelogue and a luxury perfume commercial.5/10",A Good Year
28,ajs-10,Actually pretty good!,7,5 February 2011,"I have never made a secret of the fact that I am a fan of the work of Ridley Scott. So, in the interests of completeness, and although I'm not particularly a fan of romantic comedies, I decided to give this one a try. I was pleasantly surprised; a gentle comedy with a lot of charm and a very appropriate soundtrack is what I found, oh, and quite a few laughs too! But enough of my ramblings, more of that later. Here's a brief summary first (summary haters please help Duflot clean the outdoor pool while I write the next paragraph).Max Skinner is a tough, uncompromising investment banker in London. In his youth he had spent a lot of time with his uncle, Henry, who owned a vineyard in Provence (France). He had not been in touch with him for the last ten years when he hears of his death. It seems that, as his only surviving relative, Max is to inherit the vineyard. Intending to sell it, he heads out there only to find a lot of memories in his surroundings. The people who work on the estate, Francis Duflot and his wife, Ludivine are fearful that they will no longer be working with the vines. Max agrees that they will be kept on when the sale goes through. In the village, he meets Fanny Chenal, a mysterious, and beautiful young woman who he falls for. And then, out of the blue, a girl, Christie Roberts, claiming to be Uncle Henry's daughter turns up. This adds a bit of spice and has Max afraid that she may have a better claim on the vineyard. Will the wine and the girl soften Max's heart? Well I guess I'll just have to leave you wondering.A beautifully made film with that great visual style we have come to expect from Ridley Scott. As I said at the beginning, a very appropriate soundtrack, it fits the mood perfectly and enhances the visuals no end. I wasn't sure about Russell Crowe in a romantic comedy, but he pulled it off pretty well. I just wish he could do an English accent. Albert Finney was perfect as Uncle Henry and Marion Cotillard was excellent (as ever) as Fanny Chenal. Honourable mentions go to; Freddie Highmore as Young Max, Abbie Cornish as Christie Roberts, Didier Bourdon as Francis Duflot and Isabelle Candelier as Ludivine Duflot.A really good script by Marc Klein, based on the novel by Peter Mayle, contains an awful lot of humour and some great one-liners. If I have one gripe, it's that not enough was made of the romance between Max and Fanny. Unlike most rom-coms, their relationship is not the main feature of the plot. It's more about Max finding himself again, which, to a great extent, is achieved using flashbacks to his youth and his time with Uncle Henry. Over all, a very engaging gentle romantic comedy with some great comic moments Recommended.My score: 7.3/10",A Good Year
29,oneloveall,A low point for Ridley and Russell,4,24 February 2007,"Surprisingly lackluster film which adapts a novel about one jaded, heartless businessman's return to his childhood vineyard in France, comes across as strikingly inept given the talent involved. For all those anticipating the re-teaming of Gladiator champs Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, look no further then the film's first ten minutes to realize that the comedy-drama, lighthearted romance genre is not either of these consummate professional's forte. The awkwardly paced rhythm feels strained where it should feel breezy, tedious when it should feel nostalgic, and embarrassing when we should be laughing along with the characters. There are bits of scenes in which you can actually witness the relaxed tone begin to take it's charming effect, but by and large the choices made throughout A Good Year remain a complete misread, not to mention a painfully half-assed approach in the vacant direction and performances. Brimming with a smug indifference attempting to fool less interested participants into seeming like something deeper, Crowe gives one of his least engaging performances to date, making viewers do more then just dislike his negative character- they will become completely indifferent. The plot is so predictable that one will foresee a resolution two frames in, and become tediously anxious for an ending around the ninth frame. A simple, shallow, disappointing exercise in lite entertainment, stuffed with unnecessary production values to mask a lack of vibrancy within the script, the film still may be mildly entertaining and escapist for the ye old weekend afternoon viewing, just try to forget the talent involved so as not to depress you further about this apathetic mess.",A Good Year

This is one of those films you can just put on and enjoy without having to think too hard. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't.

31,bopdog,Pleasant and likable. Gorgeous views. But does not quite live up to its pedigree.,7,29 October 2006,"You can't not like this movie. the scenery is absolutely jaw-dropping, drop-dead gorgeous. It's worth a trip to the cinema just to bask in the lush French countryside. With such stellar talent as Ridley Scott, Albert Finney, and Russel Crowe, however, one expected a tad bit more.Not to say this wasn't enjoyable. I'm glad I went. But it was a '7', even though those involved were all of the '10' calibre. The script was a bit 'jerky'--- i.e., it went in fits and starts. The frustration humor was definitely annoying--- it's not ever my thing, and wasn't here, either. But the cast was immensely likable, and again, the scenery. Oh my gawd!!! What a visual treat, and a pleasant enough rom-com.This Ridley Scott directorial effort reminded me a lot of director John Boorman, and his 1989 (-ish) under-rated movie, 'Where the Heart Is'. Boorman was 'getting on' in his successful career, and he made that movie with one of his daughters as producer, and maybe writer, too (?). As an aside, she sadly died from brain cancer, so this movie is a kind of memorial, too, I would guess.Its initial concept was as a British comedy of eccentricities, and fitted the English context and culture perfectly. It was translated and transported, for some unknown reason, to a New York locale, with a stellar cast--- Dabney Coleman, Uma Thurmon, Maury Chaykin, Suzi Amis, Christopher Plummer, etc. The art work and some of the scenes were amazing and heart-opening and stupendous! The movie, however, had some fundamental flaws as well. I suspect something went horribly wrong with some scenes or characters or something, and an important chunk or chunks were cut out of some key portions. Whatever happened--- it was somehow 'broken', and thus will never gain the wide-spread acclaim and fame it could have had, and maybe deserves in spite of the mistakes. Nonetheless, I own TWO copies of the video (they are impossible to get anymore, so they're in my 'vault'), and have watched it 2 dozen times over the years. Despite its frustrating limitations, I LOVE that movie!Sorry, I rambled. the point is, it was a largely beautiful and mostly entertaining 'stumble' by a GREAT auteur who was seeking a new way to express himself. 'A Good Year' may be the same: Star talent all around, a thing of beauty to admire and enjoy, but, alas, some quirky and rather important flaws, too.Oh well. At least Ridley Scott took an artistic chance. At least he showed up! He deserves our praise for that, and you might want to go see this flick anyway--- you'll like it! It's a great 'tone' and 'mood piece'--- uplifting and a bit soppy, in the best possible way!",A Good Year

Based on Peter Mayle's 2006 novel, which, in turn, was loosely based his 1993 work, ""A Year in Provence"", the film is reminiscent of Diane Lane's 1993 comedy/drama, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", and also brings to mind the 1961 Rock Hudson/Gina Lollobrigida comedy, ""Come September""; all three films offer romance, a glowing Mediterranean atmosphere, and characters as unconventional as they are, endearing.Crowe is a high-power, unscrupulous but wickedly funny British investment broker, who inherits the French estate and vineyards of his late uncle (Albert Finney, who plays the endearing codger in flashbacks). Under investigation for a more-than-a-little-shady stock transaction, the trip to France gives the broker a chance to let things simmer down, while he unloads the property...but childhood memories, old friends, the arrival of an unknown, illegitimate heir, from America (Abbie Cornish), and a feisty, beautiful local French girl (Marion Cotillard) all conspire to force Crowe to rethink his priorities, as he falls under the spell of Provence.While the film offers few real surprises, the characters are all likable, the dialog is crisp and witty, and there is a tangible magic in the glorious French landscape.All-in-all, ""A Good Year"" makes a GREAT date movie, and may have you booking a trip to France!",A Good Year

36,Flagrant-Baronessa,From the people that brought you... Gladiator? Huh?,6,17 February 2007,"Under the unprecedented and unparalleled direction of Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe makes the transition from testosterone-fuelled Maximus the gladiator to Maximilian the stuffy British high-roller stock-broker. The father of two has now mellowed out into a low-key dapper romantic twit and let me be the first person to herald his departure from the heavy-handed, Oscar-baiting roles he usually commits himself to. Unfortunately, ""A Good Year"" is not the ideal outlet for these new tendencies, slotting itself in with the rest of forgettable romantic comedies.It is a god-awful cliché for reviews to use the word 'romp' to label a film like this, but here I feel it is entirely justified. ""A Good Year"" contains all the light-hearted, sweet briskness of a 'romp', but regrettably also inherits the lack of depth. Quite desperately Ridley Scott attempts to add background and layers to the story by interjecting idyllic flashbacks with Albert Finney, nearly all of which end up meandering and time-consuming. It's all very nostalgic and talkative in the film, but ultimately a ploy like this means treading down a road we've all been down before.Let's talk about Russell Crowe, his abominable English accent and his character Max the stock-broker. Max is a narcissist: he manipulates, makes money and womanizes all for self-aggrandizement. When he returns home at night, he is met by a gorgeous and empty apartment in London. One day he inherits a vineyard in Provence from his uncle (Albert Finney) and reluctantly he agrees to visit the area. Seeing ol' Max the stone-cold businessman become increasingly intoxicated by the local spirit, the local wine and the local girl, the audience can predictably tick off the lessons, messages and the heartfelt climaxes from the rote formula titled 'man learns from midlife crisis', a most snooze-worthy template.Crowe is an actor who takes himself amazingly seriously and often gives wonderfully intense performances because of his devotion to the craft. In ""A Good Year"", his heart is not in it and he never captures the physical comedy that is necessary for the lead in a romantic romp. Most comedy undeniably stems from Tom Hollander's scenes with Abbie Cornish (who for the record is too lovely for words here) when he gives his all as a foppish, fumbling Brit-twit displaced in Provence, the performance Russell Crowe should have emulated as Max. Marion Cotillard chips in as the local café owner/waitress in the little village with nothing novel about her performance, except the sweetest French accent ever committed to a celluloid.""A Good Year"" is bound to evoke comparisons of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and even if it is not entirely similar, it is not really entirely different from any film like that either. The good news is that when it is poignant, it never dwells on its poignancy like many Hollywood films would do. Ridley Scott is far too no-nonsense to fall into that trap. There is no doubt that the film is also lovingly filmed on location with a Provence countryside that is unspeakably picturesque. Although some stereotypical images of ignorant Americans ordering food at a café and French bicyclists flash by, there is often remarkable sensitivity to culture and language to be found. Sadly, it is never enough to save this film from rabid fangs mediocrity.6 out of 10",A Good Year
37,OttoVonB,"A good fix of charm, tenderness and truth",7,16 February 2007,"Max Skinner (Crowe) is scum. He is an arrogant, selfish trader of the most insidious variety. One lonely evening, in his lush, crystal clean apartment, he receives news that his Uncle Henry (Finney), who brought him up to the simple pleasures of life in Provence, passed away. He then races to the estate to evaluate it for sale, until an unfortunate accident strands him there for a week, during which he comes to reevaluate his life ...Unfairly maligned and looked down on upon release, ""A Good Year"" catches Crowe and Scott at their least typical, but undeniably most personal. Scott refrains from delivering post-card visuals, choosing instead to show the little things that endear us to this place and soon make us feel at home (unsurprising given that it also is his home! The director has had a house in the area for over 15 years). Crowe is also commendable for the subtle ways in which his character evolves. He starts off as a bastard, albeit a very real one, and finishes as one too in certain ways, though he gets at your heart and becomes the kind of person you occasionally want to punch but care for.Max's childhood is developed in a few fresh and touching flash-backs, with the great Albert Finney as his mentor-uncle, and Freddy Highmore - possibly the greatest child actor ever to grace the screen - playing the young Max.The sweet and fresh romance between Marion Cotillard (who, between this and ""Jeux d'Enfants"", marks herself as a revelation) and Crowe manages to be convincing, endearing and true without overwhelming the whole film. Don't let the hype fool you: this isn't really a romantic comedy. It's a one-man existential comedy, and a very effective one at the: the picture remains focused on Max's slow, subtle transformation, and as such makes for invigorating entertainment.",A Good Year
38,come2whereimfrom,OK comedy/drama from Scott,7,12 November 2006,"Comedy drama and Ridley Scott are not two things you would normally associate, Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are, so teaming up again after 'Gladiator' they join forces to bring us 'A Good Year'. It is the story of a high-flying stockbroker (Crowe) who is basically an absolute person without a father, he cares about no one, loves money and especially loves being an arrogant git. But when his uncle Henry dies and leaves him a vineyard in France his initial thoughts are how much can he sell it for but over the course of the film he awakens within himself distant memories he thought he'd buried and begins to see things a little differently. Splashed with a little tragedy as well as the humour the film does make you think about some of life's big questions such as is money important? or is love important? What makes someone happy? Etc but without ever being over sentimental or too deep. The film is populated by an array of characters both in London and France that add a richness to Crowe's central performance and some unusual camera work from Scott make the film flow along at a pace just above relaxing. The scenery is as beautiful as you can expect from the south of France and forms a lush backdrop to the proceedings, as does Henry's run down villa. Ultimately it is a film about one mans struggle with his identity in a world where he thought he had to behave a certain way. It is his interaction with the people he meets and the lessons he realises he learnt from Henry as a child that in a way were detrimental to start with but eventually lead him to make the right choices. Well directed and acted, this is a film that wears its heart on it sleeve, it is warm and welcoming, funny and sad, different from his usual subject matter but none the less another film Scott can be proud of.",A Good Year
39,yris2002,"Light, predictable but enjoyable feel-good movie",7,20 December 2009,"I saw this movie for the second time on TV last time, I think that it is the most suitable movie for a Friday night at home after a week of work, when you need something relaxing, light and enjoyable. Of course, you perfectly know how everything will turn out from the beginning, characters, settings, situations and dialogues are nothing original and widely predictable: the selfish and cynic stockbroker turning good and romantic, the romantic but wounded girl no longer able to trust a man, but finally yielding to love again, the gentle atmosphere of a warm vineyard, with an old-fashioned swimming pool, love that wins over everything. However, I sometimes need these kind of movies where things go in the way they should go: why not? If not in real life, why not in fiction? I liked the pairing between Russel Crowe and Marion Cotillard, the moments when they are together are the best ones in the movie, they convey mutual attraction and passion, their first date framed by rain is touching and intense. Also the actors playing the schizoid City Londoners, as contrasted with the fool characters in the countryside offer credible performances, in a movie that, without being pretentious at all, just offers some time of lightheartedness and quiet serenity.",A Good Year
40,dy158,"Of family ties, wines and love",6,7 July 2009,"I suppose even if I am old enough to drink wine (tried it a few years back, and it was kind of strong for my liking), any films which has to do with wine in one way or another still catch my attention. And this film is one of those, I suppose.Growing up, Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) spent his childhood with his uncle Henry at a château and vineyard in Provence. Fast-forward to Max the adult. He is now working in London as a banker and a bond trader. His life is now surrounded by making money. That was until he received the news that his uncle had died and left behind the château and the vineyard.So he set out on a trip across the Channel and head to where he once spent his childhood days. On intending to sell the property. The current owners were pleased to see him upon his arrival given they still remembered Max but, they were not happy on what he plans to do with what his uncle had left him behind. On the surface it makes sense because Max has no interest in wine-making. But after spending a few days there and getting ready of selling the property his uncle had left behind, there were a number of distractions during his return to Provence.Memories of Max's childhood days when he spent with his uncle Henry there, a beautiful woman, and a young American who says she's Henry's illegitimate daughter. Each part of the property Max's uncle had left behind had triggered memories of the past. Where does he goes on from here? This film is not Oscar-winning material but, for the scenery after Max made the trip across the Channel, the wines...a pleasant way to spend an afternoon watching it. Or maybe it is me and my romantic images of the French vineyards.",A Good Year
41,badajoz-1,Nothing much doing here - typical Mayle,2,13 October 2009,"Ridley Scott and comedy - words that do not go together, and, after this mishmash they still don't! Based yet again on a further retelling of Peter Mayle's ever so moneymaking Brit in deepest, prettiest France, the film meanders around for hours on end getting nowhere more than you thought at the beginning - arrogant clever money making Brit comes to reassess his life and people amidst picturesque surroundings and dreamlike qualities of southern France. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Russell Crowe is no Jack Lemmon or Cary Grant - or Hugh for that matter - so the so-called comedy stalls while Ridley Scott just lets all the funny business drift away before the next pretty picture - witness the real throwing away of the joke about the French SatNav, criminal! Every Brit is an East End barrow boy on the make, the French heroine fights off Crowe through two short meetings before agreeing to a date forty minutes from the end - by which time we've all gone to sleep!

The support from the likes of Abbie Cornish, Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard and others equally as talented ices this cake with real quality.There's no sex, violence or bad language, nobody gets hacked into pieces, and no cars explode.

43,tccandler,A Moment Spent with Marion Cotillard Would Make My Year!,7,27 October 2006,"Food tastes better there. The women are naturally beautiful. Walks are more romantic. Wine is more complex... but life is less so. France can turn good memories into grand ones. It replaces currency with passion. It replaces accumulation with appreciation.I believe the above statement to be very true. France is among the loveliest countries that I've ever been privileged to visit. If they had ESPN, I'd consider moving there. So when I heard that Ridley Scott was directing Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard in a film about a money-hungry British stock-broker who is lured into giving it all up for an inherited French vineyard, I thought it would be right up my alley.To be honest, the film is so far up my alley that I felt my dreams were being violated. I cannot imagine a life more pleasurable than one spent living in a château, overlooking my own vineyard, waking up every morning to the glorious sensation of Marion Cotillard's morning breath. I'm practically orgasmic at that idea.""A Good Year"" is a crystal glass filled to the brim with 1982 Château Margaux... but unfortunately diluted by some city tap water.As mentioned before, I loved the premise. The cast is equal to the task. The cinematography is only enhanced by the country's natural canvas. The music is eclectic and joyful, ranging from old standards to a traditional up-tempo score to the modern energy of tracks like Alizee's ""Moi Lolita"" -- which was, oddly, not chosen to play upon the arrival of a certain character. Nevertheless...Everything about this film is a deliciously prepared meal... on a paper plate. The plate, in this case, is a flimsy script that brushes over too many details, cannot maintain its tone for more than a scene or two, reaches for grandeur without ever attaining it, and presumes its audience is naive and unworldly.There are just too many scenes in this film that demanded more time and effort. Characters fall in love too easily. Massive decisions are taken too lightly. The tone shifts uncomfortably from romantic to slapstick to tragic to wistful to sarcastic. It all just felt a little forced. Screenwriter, Marc Klein, seems to be trying too hard. And Ridley Scott seems rushed, as though the studio demanded a running time under two hours.It is a shame really, because the film has greatness in it... but they uncorked the bottle before it had time to mature.Russell Crowe is relentlessly reliable on screen. He rarely, if ever, gives even a mediocre performance. It is no wonder that he is so highly regarded. I just thought that his character, Max Skinner (too obvious), was written so two-dimensionally as to handcuff his immense talent. I also thought his English accent was a little too ""mate, blimey, b*llocks, b*gger, tally ho"" -- If you know what I mean.Marion Cotillard is typically brilliant as Fanny Chenal, the glorious vision of a waitress from the nearby town. She gives the film, and Max, some heart and soul. She is a fiery French lass with shampoo-commercial hair and skin that makes silk seem like sandpaper. I can't get enough of this actress. She is the visual equivalent of Pringles... once you pop, you can't stop.Relative newcomer, Abbie Cornish, is also very impressive here. Again, her character, like all the others, is somewhat underwritten. She deserved much more screen time. However, this critic is 100% sure that she will have tons of screen time in many major films over the next decade or so. She is a future star, with talent and beauty in equal measures.""A Good Year"" may remind many of the similar Diane Lane adventure from the female perspective, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". The main difference, aside from the sex of the protagonist, is that ""Tuscan"" decided from the get-go that it was going to be a lighthearted romantic comedy. I think that the screenplay for ""A Good Year"" got a little confused along the way. Sometimes it aims higher... and that is when it works the best. Other times it aims lower... and that is when it dwindles into lame slapstick comedy. If it had maintained a lofty romantic tone, it may have been one of the best films of the year. As it stands, it is a merely a nice film with a pleasant message.© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",A Good Year
44,j-lacerra,Doc Hollywood of the Vineyards,8,24 May 2009,"A Good Year is a laid back tale of a British financial trader, Max (Crowe) who goes back to the French vineyard of his late uncle to settle the estate he has inherited from him. The beautiful place is full of his most treasured childhood memories, and causes him to re-examine his life.While there, he interacts with the irascible vintner (Didier Bourdon) and his high-spirited wife (Isabelle Candelier), both of whom play well off Crowe's smug humor and little-boy charm. He soon also meets Fanny (Marion Cotillard), who at first seems set on fending off his advances. Enter also the uncle's secret (probable) daughter, who may have a claim on the estate.Rounding out the players are excellent performances by Archie Panjabi as Max's secretary, Gemma, and his friend and realtor Charlie (Tom Hollander). Above excellent is Albert Finney as the beloved late Uncle Henry, seen mostly in flashbacks.The movie moves on the sentimental self-discovery of Max, his budding romance, and the contrasts to his high-pressure lifestyle that he begins to see more and more as abhorrent. In fact, this movie shares a good deal of plot devices and feel with Doc Hollywood, even down to some humorous pratfalls done by Crowe. All in all, a feel-good movie with much to recommend it, as long as you are not looking for fast paced driving action.I'd have given it a higher rating except for a sub-plot regarding the quality of the vineyard's wine and an excellent and rare mystery vintage that keeps turning up. This matter is never really followed through. This sub-plot had great potential, but was allowed to simply peter out.A Good Year is a soothing and pleasant movie, worthy of a good watch.",A Good Year

46,Ozzy2000,A boring pretentious film,1,13 January 2008,"I really respect Ridley Scott but cannot understand why he uses Russell Crowe whose has only two expressions arrogant and conceited . This flabby little man Crowe shows his real pretentious character in playing a pretentious and snotty Merchant broker who inherits a property which has a vineyard. The film goes down hill from there . Drink plenty before you see this crappy film.The attempts at humour begin with Crowe mumbling his lines as he falls into an empty pool. Crowe's Indian secretary also tries to lift the movie by trying to be funny by backstabbing Crowe's character on a constant basis. She comes out with a line "" ...are you Mad Max..."" that was the best of feeble attempts at humour. Please Ridley stay away from comedy you really stink.

47,dhaufrect,"""A Good Year"" is a Good film",6,14 November 2006,"""A Good year"" is a good film. Ridley Scott has directed Russell Crowe in this love story that touches the heart. Crowe plays Max Skinner, a stock market wizard from London. His heart remains in his childhood geography of his uncle's vineyards. Albert Finney stars as his Uncle Henry and gives a very convincing performance. Crowe's childhood character is very nicely done by Freddie Highmore and his role adds to the frosting of this sugar coated film. The vineyard scenes are reminiscent of those in ""The Godfather"" scenes in Italy. The audience was quiet, and seemed impressed, however, I have a feeling that they were made of those folks who enjoy the mushy genre portrayed. Women were most impressed with the product. It was a good film but not a great one. The performance by Crowe was somewhat subdued or underplayed with success. The most attractive part of the film is the photography.",A Good Year
48,saarvardi,"As it's title may imply, ""A Good Year"" is just that: a good film by Ridley Scott",8,9 November 2006,"I had the chance to see this film during an early press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel, several weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised. A good friend of mine that came along was thrilled with the views and landscapes and caught up with the dramatic plot, despite having a distinct preference for action flicks. Speaking of which, here's a chance to give a little tip for the guys: although this is generally referred to as a ""chick flick"", the screen is filled with the presence of 2 beautiful women throughout the film. Watch out for the young Abbie Cornish (who appears in a brief nude sequence, so don't blink) and for the arousing french actress Marion Cotillard as Crowe's love interest throughout the film.As it's title may imply, ""A Good Year"" is just that: a good film by Ridley Scott. It's tone reminded me of Scott's Matchstick Men and it's premise is similar to Under the Tuscan Sun. Nonetheless, despite the similarities, Scott managed to create something new and different in this movie, muchly thanks to it's rich plot, vivid characters and breathtaking landscape, that build up an enchanting European atmosphere that allows you to wander off to France for some enjoyable 118 minutes.The plot follows Maximillian Skinner (Crowe), a young and bright manager in the British stock market that has low morals which bring him high financial results. He's cocky and arrogant, and like all characters that appear in films of this nature, his life is about to change dramatically. This occurs one sunny day when he finds out his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney, who appears in flashbacks throughout the film) has passed away and left him his heritage: a vineyard in Provence, France. Skinner immediately realizes the financial value of the property and boards the first plane to the colorful valley. Arriving there, he is filled with childhood memories through which we see Henry teaching his young oprhan nephew Max (Freddy Highmore, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") the values of life. Meanwhile, the plot thickens when a young attractive American girl arrives, claiming she's Henry's long lost daughter and posing a threat to Henry's inheritance. When problems at work force him into a for-longed leaf of absence, he falls in love with a local French woman and starts unveiling the secrets of the vineyard.I gave it 8 out of 10, for it is a good way to spend a matinée or an evening with your partner.",A Good Year
49,C22Man,Devoid of the Charm and Laughs it Desperately Needed,2,3 July 2016,"Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teaming up once again to do a light- hearted romp set in the south of France. Sounds interesting. There is something admirable about directors and actors trying to tackle different genres than their usual work. Whether it is to challenge themselves or just to offer a nice change of pace. With that said, comedy is a different ball game usually. If a director or actor try their hand at comedy when they don't understand what makes it work then it can be disastrous. I'm sad to say that A Good Year is a great example of that.It's about Max, a thirty-something bond trader who is successful even though his practices are rather unethical. He's uncomfortably droll, slightly obnoxious and seems to jump from woman to woman. Gee, I think we're going to like this guy. He gets a letter that his Uncle Henry (the only actor who truly delivers here, Albert Finney) has died and his vineyard in France has been passed to Max, who flies out with the intention of a quick sale. We get some overtly sentimental flashbacks to a time when Max was a young and innocent soul. I think it's incredibly obvious where the film is going even at this early stage. His uncle gives him advice and they have great relationship, which I admit is portrayed well. Yet the flashbacks do nothing but fill in the gaps in the plot instead of actually building the characters.Of course Max is then suspended for a week and decides to stay in France to see how it goes. The biggest problem is that Max seems relatively happy in his life and any past issues are barely touched upon. He's got money, he's good at his job and the woman seem to love him. Why would he want to leave that? I doubt a potential lawsuit is enough because even he seems nonchalant about it. We get typical romance between him and a French waitress (played by the lovely Marion Cotillard). This doesn't work because Crowe and Cotillard share no chemistry, and because from a story perspective it's impossible to understand what she sees in Max that would win her over. We also get a weird sub-plot about American backpacker Christie who might be Henry's illegitimate daughter. This adds nothing to the film except some stupidly forced and hollow conflict.The films fatal flaw comes in the shape of Russell Crowe. He can't do comedy. Crowe is a fine actor, but ask him to be funny and what you get is a mess. Max should be a sly yet charming individual, someone who's imperfect but has something that might win us over. But Crowe plays him like a conceited fool. Always mumbling mild obscenities in a polite tone and totally oblivious to any pratfalls that lie around the corner. He just does the same smirking expression for the whole film and his attempts at slapstick are best described as painful. It's a horribly misplaced performance.In regards to the films 'comedy', it really baffles me. It's as if it just decides to throw all kinds of styles at you and see what sticks. Crowe's comic timing is non-existent and as a result the majority of his jokes die a quick death. The slapstick is really annoying. One scene has Max stuck in an empty pool and he keeps trying to get out but cant and it's just weird to watch because it lacks any sense of physicality or flair. You then have formulaic stuff thrown in for good measure, like a dog that hates Max for no reason and him getting frustrated over the language barrier. Finney's joke in the film's opening was the only one that got a laugh out of me. Considering the films style it didn't have to be hilarious, but it needed to be clever or subtle to be effective. Falling back on slapstick that has been done better a million times before isn't funny.Seeing as this is Ridley Scott the sole area where the film constantly delivers is the visuals. The French countryside has never looked more radiant. The way the glow of the sun is captured, the splendour of the vineyards and the graceful beauty of these small villages. It might be eye candy, but it sure is gorgeous. Yet you could easily argue that it's almost too idyllic, for the stories sake. The sun is permanently shining, the French are witty, the women are all beautiful and there's nothing to worry about. You can paint a pretty picture, but at least try to be authentic. In fact many clichés spread throughout the film with such classics as the American tourists that are idiots and the French waitress whose heart cannot be won. Haven't seen those before.By the time A Good Year draws to a close pretty much everything you assumed would happen fifteen minutes in has happened. I haven't an issue with films that are deliberately simple and light-hearted. What I have issues with is when they are not the slightest bit amusing, alluring, smart or generally entertaining. This is a film that is crying out for charm and instead we get Crowe playing a character so incompetent and insufferable that we don't care about his plight which happens to be the whole basis of the film. It's the done-to-death guy find himself in a new environment film but with much less appeal than usual. I can only hope that both director and actor learnt their lesson.",A Good Year
50,murtaza_mma,A beautiful about life and its endless bounties,8,15 February 2016,"What one wouldn't give to own a vineyard in south-eastern France. What one wouldn't do to spend an evening with a beautiful French girl. Ridley Scott's A Good Year is a beautiful film about life and its endless bounties. It's a film that often goes unnoticed in the English filmmaker's body of work.In life we sometimes get so busy that we fail to recognize what we truly desire. We even forget how to really live our lives. Lost in this modern-day madness, we get reduced to the state of machines with no feelings or emotions. The movie revolves around a ruthless London-based banker named Max Shiner who following his uncle's death becomes the sole beneficiary of his French estate in Provence. He is so immersed in his corporate life that he doesn't even care to visit his uncle during his final days despite him being the only surviving family member. When he learns that he has inherited his uncle's property, Shiner travels to France at once with the hope of making a quick sale. But things don't exactly go according to plan and Shiner is stuck. The time he gets to spend at the estate makes him nostalgic as he fondly remembers his childhood. How his uncle had taught him to appreciate the finer things in life--all of which he seems to have forgotten owing to his busy life. Before too long he gets enchanted by a head- strong and beautiful French girl. But time is quickly running out. Shiner must now make a final call: to sell the property and return to London or to quit his job and settle down in Provence.A Good Year presents Russell Crowe in a very different light. For a change, we get to see his tender side. Crowe shares great chemistry with Marion Cotillard. One just can't afford to blink in between the scenes the two share. It's a pure delight to watch them play around, filling the air with passion and romance. It's impossible not to fall in love with them. The film is a testament to Ridley Scott's versatility as a filmmaker. Kudos to him for concocting a beautiful tale about life and for eliciting such memorable performances from all his actors.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",A Good Year

Listening to the writer, director and other comments about the movie in special features I am struck by their recurring theme that it is a comedy. Although it has lighter moments, it isn't, and I have decided that labeling noncomedy as comedy must be a Hollywood inside joke, and a bad one at that.It is actually a touching and charming love story about people and places past and present, and the battle of good over evil in our society. And it does a fantastic job of that. There are three incredibly beautiful women in Provence and and a gaggle of men throughout, everybody demonstrating tremendous talent.

54,JackCerf,Incredible and Uninvolving,4,19 November 2006,"Watching this fantasy of cashing out to live a life of food, wine, sex and sunlit idleness in Provence, you don't suspend disbelief for a minute. Right at the outset we are shown that Russell Crowe's character is exactly what his beloved uncle calls him when he cheats at chess as a boy -- ""a little s**t."" Now grown up, he enjoys making money by cheating, not so much for the money, though that's nice too, but for the sheer pleasure of dominating others by being smarter, tougher and more ruthless than they are. Since, he's surrounded by agreeably available women in London (the movie tries to make a running joke of flashes and cleavage shots) it is clear that he needn't sleep alone. Nothing Crowe does makes us believe that he is less than perfectly satisfied with the life he leads, or that he would give it up to take up with a Provencal girl and contendedly guzzle home grown wine on the terrace. Nothing convinces that he and she are made for each other, or that she should see him as anything but a good looking rich foreigner who'll be an enjoyable but short-lived roll in the hay. Because Crowe's boss writes him a thumping severance check when he turns down a partnership and leaves the firm, his choice is too easy to be interesting. His buddy the real estate agent has it right. After six months he'll be bored to death, up to his ears in some financial shenanigan, and probably fooling around on his honey just to prove to himself that he can get away with it.The subplot with the American cousin never gets its feet untangled because the conflict between them over who deserves the property and what to do with it isn't fully developed. She's supposed to be smarter, tougher and more knowledgeable about wine than her youth and good looks indicate, but she doesn't get to do very much with those qualities. Crowe's character can't stand losing. It would have deepened him, and explained his change of life, to have this kid see through him, take him on and beat him at his own game. It would have been a more dramatically satisfying romance to have him try to seduce her, fail, and then fall in love and have to win her. The film hints at those possibilities and immediately backs away.There's a lot else wrong with the picture. We never feel that Crowe is actually in serious trouble over the financial maneuver that gets him suspended for a week because he never acts like a man who's job is on the line. There are a number of pointless sexual innuendos involving secondary characters that don't go anywhere except, perhaps, the cutting room floor. The rental car foul up is formulaic, not credible and therefore not funny. The smack at a couple of clueless American tourists with Southern accents is smug, gratuitous and irritating. Albert Finney's role of Bacchus as an English gentleman gone native is written by the numbers and phoned in on screen. The flashback structure allows Scott to pull out of the hat whatever rabbits he needs to keep the plot moving, like Crowe's childhood ability to imitate his uncle's handwriting and his one childhood encounter with the woman he falls in love with. That actress, by the way, is too young for a character whom we learn is about the same age as Crowe.The only really enjoyable performance is Archie Panjabi (who played Parminder Nagra's older sister in Bend It Like Beckham) as Crowe's hip, all knowing secretary. Her work I'd like to see more of.Bottom line is that this is an unsuccessful variant on the formula High Pressure Guy Finds Self And Love In Laid Back Town. Cars and Doc Hollywood did it better. The Luberon region photographs beautifully, but that's it.",A Good Year
55,moimoichan6,France as a lost paradise for tired gladiators ?,4,12 January 2007,"In ""Gladiator"", Russell Crowe was torn between the green fields of his natal country, where he spend all his youth and where he could live happily with his family, and the battle fields, where he affirmed himself as a man and a warrior. ""A good Year"" tells us almost the same story in another place and another time, and, unfortunately without the battles. The epic tone is replaced by a romantic-sitcom comedy one, the arena by the towers of Londons market and the luxurious dream place is now an advertising version of the french country.And first of all, I must admitting that we don't loose too much with this changing : this movie is nicer and easier to watch than ""Gladiator"", for it doesn't have any of the gigantic proportions of the previous Scott movies. In fact, it doesn't really have any ambitions at all : ""A good year"" is rapidly watch, and rapidly forgotten : there's no chance to keep this movie in mind for a year. And this movie, quickly forgotten, somehow gives the impression to have also been lazily done. The diner scene, for instance, is far from the usual meticulously of the direction of Ridley Scott. In it, everything seems approximative and almost ugly, from the easy effects to give the impression that one of the character is loosing control to the editing. Maybe too much wine isn't so good for the accuracy of an English director. And the same thing goes with the story : the characters are just plain figures without psychological realism, events arise rapidly and incoherently (the falling in love is unrealistic and happened too fast, whereas the movie should have been focused on it). All this defaults make it hard for the spectator to identified himself with the characters and to be really moved by the story. You're just watching ""A Good Year"" passing by, with an indifferent smile and without any real interest.But if the characters are plain and the situations unrealistic, the way the movie described french country is very funny. It appears to be like a lost paradise, where everything is easy, from wine to women, and full of ""joie de vivre"". It's like a french advertising for tired and fortuned Englishmen, who want a summer house in the south of France. And it's also a very British vision of France, where the culture mixes without classifying them wine, Jacques Tati and Alizée (sic). Hum... The only good point is that you never get the impression of watching a french movie, but if you want to have a more realist and less utopist and touristic vision of France, I recommend you to watch ""Flandre"", by Bruno Dumont, or at least, ""Le dernier des fous"", from Laurent Achard, which also described a typical summer in the south of France.One last word about the other ""Scott Free"" production of the year 2006, ""Déja vu"", which is all that ""A Good year"" isn't : it's seems to be the most ambitious movie of Ridley Scott's little brother, and it's also certainly his best movie. So, if you have to choose between two Scott this year, I suggest you to take the younger for once.",A Good Year

57,jantoniou,A paean to the simple life...,6,27 February 2007,"Though simply dripping with wonderful scenery that alone makes it worth watching, this film plays out its tropes and stereotypes in the first 5 minutes. You can feel the plot coming--lurching, actually, into view. Heartless capitalist finds redemption in the simpler things in life - incoming at 12 O'Clock! Crowe is a brilliant but morally questionable bond trader who inherits his dear old uncle's beautiful French château and vineyard. Long removed from the soft, slow pace of French country living that shaped nearly all of his childhood, Crowe has become lost in his self-absorbed and vacant money-obsessed lifestyle.Crowe's Max Skinner is full of witty charm and disposes insults like gum drops to his legions of underlings. He is abruptly pulled away by his uncle's death from his work after a successful but controversial sell-off.Max is intent on immediately unloading his inherited albatross but in his own slow way falls back in love with the aging estate and vineyard. This is, of course, facilitated by the French beauty Max is drawn to.After arriving at the estate, the movie loses its pacing, if it ever had it to begin with. Perhaps it is a reflection of real life on a nearly perfect French provincial estate that Crowe simply begins meandering around through the plot that loosely centers around his endeavor to sell off the property and running into excuses not to.What I found most surprising about this movie was how emotionally uninvolved I was with Crowe's love interest. I think many will find her character's development rather thin.As a masterfully made movie, this lacks, but as a showpiece for truly wonderful cinematography, it can't be beat.",A Good Year
58,tanelteder,brings back memories,9,18 March 2011,"It's nice when you see a movie which is going to affect you emotionally. Well, A Good Year is exactly this kind of movie. It tells a story of a man who goes back to a peaceful château where he spent his childhood. He discovers new laid-back lifestyle which leads him to the woman he loves. It shows perfectly how something unexpected can change your life. The film totally delivers. It's a touchy and romantic tale which has a bit drama and comedy. In my opinion, underrated.Russell Crowe shows his versatility. His character, Max Skinner, develops throughout the movie and it's satisfying to see. And I give my word, Marion Cotillard doesn't leave you cold. She's very likable. Brilliant Albert Finney cameos too.The movie has several flashbacks to Max's childhood. I think many people, who have seen the movie, thought about their childhood afterwards. At least for a while. It's great. A Good Year is A Good Film.",A Good Year
59,nikashvili,A Very Nice Movie To Watch,7,24 September 2012,"A Ridley Scott's one of the best non-action film adaptation. A Good Year is a romantic comedy screened according to Peter Mayle's book, starring Russel Crow, Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard. **Spoiler*** The film tell a story of British investment broker Max Skinner(Crow) who visits France to sell an uncle's château and vineyard where he spent most of his childhood. He plans to rid of the old memories and get back to London shortly. But something changes in his life when he faces his past and people he used to know. **End of the Spoiler** This is a delightful love story and comedy about something very personal problems any person is supposed to face some time. The acting part of the movie is perfect. Russel gives sensitive, confident, charming performance transforming from callous millionaire to loving family guy. This is not a play for Oscars or any of other awards, it seems Crow played just for himself and Scott shoot the film for his own pleasure.Albert Finney portraits Max's deceased uncle in the best way anyone could imagine and Marion is just like a real French woman - beautiful and passionate.But there is still something I don't agree with the screenwriter and probably with the author of the book. Max Skinner is a materialist, ruthless millionaire who treats his co-workers as experimental animals and destroys it's every rival. But suddenly he massively changes, money does not mean everything to him, he almost bankruptcies his company and stays in France. Well, that's probably good by not realistic. In the middle I felt like I've switched to a different movie. I would more appreciate all this without total happy-endings. It would work more effectively.But averagely it is really nice comedy to see. Probably you'll watch it even twice or three times.Read more review on my blog: http://running-reel.blogspot.com/",A Good Year
60,penseur,Disappointingly shallow,5,15 November 2006,"Firstly a plea to location scouts - the exterior of London's Swiss Re a.k.a. ""Gherkin"" building is already a cliché - if you don't want audiences to groan, choose something else to represent the City of London from now on. Author Peter Mayle's love affair with the gorgeous Provence countryside is well known and the best thing about this movie is Ridley Scott's filming of it. As for everything else - the deepest thing that will be experienced in this movie is the dry swimming pool into which Russell Crowe's character falls. For the first 40 minutes or so Scott attempts to compensate for the thin script by slapstick and boorish behaviour on the part of Crowe, but it doesn't succeed. For the rest of the film the attempt is made by putting the two beautiful actresses Marion Cotillard and Abbie Cornish to the fore, but so unconvincingly that it doesn't work either. A film that probably sounded good in theory, but conceived and executed badly.",A Good Year

62,graestella,Une Bonne Vacance,9,16 February 2014,"This film had the double whammy of Russell Crowe AND Ridley Scott. It should have been fatuous and tedious - Quelle surprise ! It wasn't.After a very slow start, and very boring City types who should have all been shot, we finally get to Provence. Like Russel we never leave there again. This film was wonderfully whimsical and an unexpected delight.Yes, the plot was totally expected. The girl he nearly ran over was obviously going to end up as his girlfriend. He was obviously going to rediscover himself and fall in love with the country side again. But it made a pleasant change from the usual mass carnage and lugubrious battle scenes we normally have to put up with from both the lead and the director. With well studied cameos from Albert Finney and a luminous Marion Cotillard there was a lot to like in this lovely film. I must be going soft in my old age.",A Good Year
63,pete36,Massive Disappointment,4,13 February 2011,"Another take on the tired old Provence/Tuscany cliché where spoiled brats find redemption.Story is simple : massive pr**k (finance trader Crowe) inherits a French vineyard, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, beds the coolest French chick in town and receives a massive financial bonus (after all he is a trader). He gets it all but remains a massive pr**k. And a massive bomb at the BO.That's the whole storyline. There is also a very annoying US girl, claiming also the inheritance, the lovable old uncle(Finney)and some French stereotypes. Taking into account the talent (Scott and Crowe) and all the money invested in this movie - 35 million $ - you 'd hope for something more sophisticated then your average romantic TV movie of the week, but that is what this is, no more no less. Any redeeming factors ? Well, it all looks great, this is after all a Ridley Scott movie (and he lives about 10 minutes from where this is shot). The French do their best to speak English, especially Didier Bourdon (very famous comedian in France) as the vineyard keeper, who also shares the only funny scene with Crowe (a tennis match).And with all these French Provence clichés, the ultra thin storyline and that soft-focus photography you'd almost expect for some young nubile David Hamilton style girls to show up.

It is a very cute story about vineyards and wine, love, loss and ultimately the coming of age, or wisdom as the case may be, they do go hand-in-hand. The setting is what makes this film all the more watchable, the south of France, oh la la! Not your standard Ridley Scott fare, but this works in his favor as it exhibits the scope of his talent and range of versatility. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances given by the entire cast, especially that of Russell Crowe's. There's an impressive chemistry generated between Mr. Crowe and Ms. Cotillard, whether he gets the girl in the end or not, at least they have a history. The storyline is further enhanced by the curious twists and turns in the plot. I believe that anyone who watches this film will truly enjoy the experience, I know I did.

67,cultjones,A Good Year for Crowe,7,5 December 2006,"Ridley Scott brings us a charming tale set in probably one of the most beautiful locations in France. Accompanying this scenic and heart warming story is a fantastic score, pleasurable soundtrack and outstanding cinematography that compliment each other superbly.The audience enjoys winding down Max Skinner's path of nostalgia which eventually thaws the heart of this ruthless broker as he discovers the humanity within. On this path we meet Didier Bourdon and Tom Hollander who add to the humor with some well timed comic relief that leaves you chuckling in your seat. Skinner's delicate and beautiful love interest, Fanny Chenal played by Marion Cotillard is a delight for the eyes while Albert Finney's 'Uncle Henry' is the lovable Uncle we all wish we had.Russel Crowe's off screen antics have been well documented through the entire globe, however in spite of his yobbish personality, it can not be denied that he is arguably one of the most versatile actors of our time and 'A Good Year' continues to illustrate his wealth of talent.Equipped with a balance of humor, grace and few predictable clichés, 'A Good Year' is a light, feel good movie which had numerous facets to enjoy and appreciate.",A Good Year

69,johnjohnson68510,Self-satisfied as a samba (+ a note Crowe's Music Videos),6,8 June 2008,"Pleasant movie. Self-satisfied as a samba, not quite smug. Ridley Scott and the novelist live in Provence, and we don't, but they don't hold that against us. In fact, at the end, they invite us to come pick their grapes and frolic. Crowe was perhaps too aggressively interested in sleeping around to make this a chick flick. None of the jokes were actually funny, but they were all pleasant, and I liked the movie.The DVD's special features include three music videos by Russell Crowe. I watched all three. One of them, Weight of a Man, has him wearing a matador suit and charging us/the camera like we're a bull, or a cow, and he's got libidinal designs on us. It is listless and generic, a miscalculation almost to the scale of Shatner's Transformed Man. I would guess Crowe was hoping to snag one like Richard Harris did with MacArthur Park, but as he stalked the camera I found myself thinking ""Just act, you maggot."" Nothing personal.Surprisingly, the third song, Testify, actually finds some magic. If he could deliver songs of that quality for a whole set, I'd happily pay a cover charge, hoist a glass, and it'd be money well spent.",A Good Year
70,youngman44,As Close To Perfect As It Gets,9,28 April 2008,"So often critics and moviegoers judge a film based on expectations. What I have found is that expectations almost always (as in all of life) lead to some level of frustration (Christmas day is rarely better in reality than in expectation and hope). Such is the case with this film. Don't expect Casablanca and you won't be disappointed in the least. Just expect a very enjoyable evening with your significant other. This movie has grown on me since the first time I watched it. It's not strictly a ""chick flick"" but is a great romance - not just between a man and woman, however. It is a romance with a lifestyle in the south of France (the joys of a dream estate; great wine; tennis; etc.) and the beautiful Marion Cotillard. Sure, this is not Russell Crowe's best in terms of epic roles (e.g., Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, etc.) but it's not intended to be an intense role. He is great at what he does, regardless. This is a movie that is relaxing and peaceful and very enjoyable in a world that is full of upheaval. It brings me joy as it really is a heavenly picture of what I suspect everyone would want to experience. It is often difficult to rate a movie relative to others. Do I like this better than some action flick or a great drama? One of the ways I've come to understand how I really feel about a movie is, when it shows up on the guide, do I find myself switching to it and watching it? For example, when the Godfather comes on - I almost feel compelled to at least give it a 10 minute look (especially if it is near the beginning) and sometimes will watch it the whole way through - it's that good. While I would not put A Good Year in that category, it is a movie that I find myself continually watching when it comes on (at this date, I've probably seen it 7-8 times - and it is often on HBO - 4/28/08). A truly great escape. Vastly superior, for example, to Under the Tuscan Sun - which received much more notoriety when it came out.",A Good Year

73,smithduke,I couldn't finish it. Russell Crowe and slapstick don't mix. Moronic movie!,1,15 April 2018,"The scenes where Crowe tried his hand at slapstick were horrible. For example, when he falls into the empty, dirt-filled, swimming pool, the story turned from tedious to utterly laughable and moronic. Crowe tries getting out the 15' deep pool by launching himself at the pool wall. Suddenly a beautiful but obnoxious woman comes along, throws his car keys at him and asks Crowe if he can swim. He says, ""Yes, but not in a foot of cow shit!"" The woman proceeds to turn on the water to fill the pool and walks away. Of course (facetious) the water worked perfectly after not being used in years, and the spray is as forceful as a firehose. Instead of moving aside, Crowe stands in the way of the jets and flails around while being pummeled by the spray. While the pool is filling, Crowe dives underwater, spitting out the ""cowshit"" pool water as if he's enjoying himself and at one point surfaces with tennis balls on his eyes. Did I turn it off at that point? No, stupid me! Crowe decides he's going to clean the house in 72 hours to show it to potential buyers. The only help he has, his winemaker, and an elderly, frail, gentleman with a broken foot. That's when I turned it off!",A Good Year
74,Zen416,Good story that could've been a bit better,6,9 January 2012,"I watched this story about a money making narcissist who inherits a beloved vineyard in France mainly because of the star power it had in it (Russell Crowe, Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard, to name a few). It's gorgeously filmed, from the grey filtered coldness of the London scenes, to the warmer golden tones used in the French countryside scenes. Visually, this film rocked. Storywise, it had more promise than what wound up being the end result. What's good: Crowe plays an obnoxious, materialistic English trader named Max who conveys all the warmth of an iceberg through a good part of the film until he pulls his head out of his backside and starts to appreciate the happier memories of his youth with his uncle (an outstanding Albert Finney) and thus re-awakens his dormant humanity. It's cool to see an unlikable character like this mature into a better person as the film progresses. Though I'm no Russell Crowe fan, the man can act and carry a film, even if he's not the nicest person off screen. Very good support from Didier Bourdon (as the guy who truly loves and works the vineyard and sees it for what it could be), Tom Hollander (as Crowe's legal friend who plays the freewheeling cad with wonderful relish), and Abbie Cornish (in an early role, playing Crowe's long lost American cousin who's trying to find her roots). What's not so good? The story kept milking the unbelievable developing relationship between Crowe's jerky Max and Marion Cotillard's aloof Fanny, a woman who clearly thinks Max is a tool but lets herself get worn down by his questionable charm to eventually cave to him. They had no chemistry with each other and it all felt forced and dragged the main story down every time they wasted time on this particular chapter. So, watch it for beautiful French scenery, for great supporting characters (who really drive the story along) or if you love movies about wine. It's not bad; it's just not really amazing either. It's just fair.",A Good Year

Russell Crowe, as an Aussie, I can take him or leave him, his accent is way off. believe me, I do know what I'm talking about. Funny that you can be a good actor and fail the 'accent test' time after time. But he is good enough. I would have liked to see, Clive Owen or Colin Prid and Pred do it. The story lacks conflict and that is the big downfall. The narrative is limp. Tho' the experience of the director keeps the pace up. The 'limegreen roller skate' is a star! I want one. I have never owned a car, but I really one that rollarskate! For all the carping, it is most enjoyable.

77,sugar_daddyo,A So-So Year,4,30 September 2007,"Every few years along comes a movie ostensibly about both wine and love making, A Walk in the Clouds with Keanu Reeves, French Kiss with Meg Ryan. In each case, our leading actor is paired against some exotic actor/actress that American audiences have neither heard of nor will they ever see again, like meeting some rare wine. But the superficial trivialities of love pale in comparison to the redemption from the vulgarities of their former lives that wine making offers.Of these three, A Walk in the Clouds is the best vintage by far. The problem with A Good Year is that Russell Crowe's character is flat and uninteresting, Gordon Gecko he is not, and somehow the audience is supposed to conclude as the director does that the big bad investment banker is in need of redemption. I am not defending investment bankers but Hollywood offends the sensibilities when the only character flaw is choice of profession. Granted ever since Wall Street, Hollywood has had a fetish with bankers as the ultimate villain, but if you want a thought provoking movie about the redemption of a banker I recommend The Family Man with Nicholas Cage if you can handle Tea Leoni.",A Good Year

The scenery is beautiful to look at, the colour and cinematography is top notch. The cast is well accomplished and play their roles well. Russell Crowe, admittedly, is perhaps a tad unbelievable as the romantic leading man type (he's more suited to action hero roles), but he has talent and puts it to good use. I would say his English 'accent' was a bit annoying though, but not totally unbearable. The standout for me would be Marion Cotillard who plays the reluctant temptress well, and is very sexy.

After all, Crowe's superficial charm winning over the smart, sexy, unobtainable woman was not really grounded in any convincing moves or even modification in his demeanor. No greater truth was reached. The plot revolving around the girl who was supposedly heiress to the land was irritating, and again no knowledge was gained (beyond all doubt, at least) before the resolution is reached. So, I look at it as that, a simple movie to watch when one doesn't feel like thinking. As such, there is a single moment I considered mildly entertaining, which was the expulsion of the Americans from the restaurant after they verbally defiled the menu... yes, Americans are slobs without any appreciation for the sublime... that's been established.

For what I saw of his performance and the film, it struck me that he was trying to do a tenth-rate imitation of Hugh Grant at his very worst of trying to perform a so-called ""dizzy"" Englishman - and yes, I can't stand any of Grant's performances either. The most astonishing thing about this film is whatever persuaded Crowe to even think about doing it, let alone finally agreeing to this totally awful and useless piece of schmaltz. If one is being generous, I suppose Crowe was trying (and desperately at that) to put ""something"" into such an awful script.

82,colinbarnard-1,A Good Film,8,13 November 2006,"Russell Crowe recently appeared on the American programme ""60 Minutes"". He stated that his favourite character from the films he has made is James ""Cinderella Man"" Braddock. Crowe then lamented that that his fans didn't come along for the ride with him at that film. Crowe thought he had enough trust with his fans, that they should have.After opening week-end disappointment over the box-office performance of ""A Good Year"", Mr. Crowe may be expressing similar sentiments about his latest offering. He has a right to be miffed.I have always thought that one of Mr. Crowe's greatest skills is reading a screenplay, and understanding the inherent quality of what's on the page. His skills in reading ""A Good Year"" are consistently on display. This is a superior, nuanced, and thoroughly enjoyable film, that has much about it to savour.At 46, I was the youngest person in my theatre for a Friday afternoon screening. The average age of the audience had to be over 60. I sat there thinking that I could be watching Cary Grant in a different era. The old cliché about ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" leapt to mind frequently.Ridley Scott is renowned for being able to frame a shot in a visually-stunning manner. This film's Provence scenes are lighted like a Van Gogh painting. Vincent even provides one of the evolving motifs of the film. Otherwise, through its tone and content, this work expands Mr. Scott's range as a director. ""A Good Year"" is probably his first ""British"" film, with many cultural references that the average (North) American viewer could hardly fathom.I wish the film well for the warmth and conviction that Messers Scott and Crowe et al have brought to the screen. I urge fans of Mr. Crowe to consider his participation in a film as guarantor that they will be entertained, and moved by something that rarely come to the theatre any more.

My late wife and I had been seriously planning to retire to France, but sadly that was not to be. After she passed, moving there alone seemed to be inappropriate. Over the years we had visited France many times, including stays at houses and Chateaux similar to that in the movie.When I first saw it, just a couple of years after her death, A Good Year took me right back to those happy days. The characters are well rounded. Russell Crowe is particularly good. Marion Cotillard is absolutely divine ... there, I've said it. The flashbacks with Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore were delightful. I shall watch it again in a year's time - or earlier if it comes on TV in the interim.So, I watched it again – almost a year down the line – and can only re-emphasise what I have said before.

Max is a very real, familiar character, and his 'inner journey' from London to Provence is reflected in a nice flow without slowing the pace or boring the viewer. Had a mediocre director been involved, the rest of the characters would end up being too insignificant and cast would be wiped away to the level of being invisible by Russell Crowe's superb performance but no, R. Scott manages to balance it all and somehow takes it from being a ""one man movie"" to a delightfully enjoyable piece of work! Guess you can't go wrong with Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, can you.

As for Russell Crowe, he is a great actor ( LA Confidential in particular), but it is unusual to see him in a light role, and he excels at it. His character Max is a cutthroat London trader who inherits his uncle's French vineyard and goes to sell it, but has second thoughts. Spoilers ahead: In the end, it came down to the choice of his job and being being a partner in the firm where he worked ( and being like his boss), or not selling the vineyard and living in France. He realized that he is much happier in France. Especially being with Fanny ( Cotillard) who he realizes is his soul mate. He actually met her as a child, and she gave him his first kiss. She also said to him ""Forgive my lips they find pleasure in unusual places."" Fanny forgot that incident until he reminded her by repeating those words. It made her realize Max was her soul mate as well. There is a line by Max that sums everything up: ""I want to spend my life with an irrational, suspicious, goddess"", and that is exactly what he will do.

You might not expect such a misfire with Ridley Scott directing Russell Crowe, but don't let the pedigree lure you in  or the presence of new Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. Plodding, horribly plotted and acted without a trace of passion, this is easily Russell Crowe's dullest performance.

88,imprator,Highly enjoyable,8,11 March 2008,"This is a well conceived romantic comedy. It is well written and the acting by all characters is good. In short, a perfect romcom.The story, of course, is not original at its core. No romantic comedy can be. They necessarily feature the same basal story - boy meets girl, they fall in love, obstacles to the relationship occur, the obstacles are overcome and boy and girl live happily ever after (or at least until the credits stop rolling). If this isn't to your taste you probably won't like this movie  or any other romantic comedy. However, most other people will enjoy the film.A Good Year is a charming movie. Whilst the main character undergoes a familiar journey of enlightenment (from a total focus on his career to a focus on his life) the movie successfully infuses originality and verve to the tale. The various twists and turns to the story are fun and unpredictable, adding to the viewer's enjoyment.The characters are likable and one comes to care about them all. Provence looks beautiful, and the vineyard setting is charming. The movie provides a luscious feast for both the eyes and the mind, and the humour is well judged  amusing, but never veering into the realm of farce.Should you watch this film? For most people I would answer with a resounding yes, but there are certainly some who will not enjoy the movie. Each to his own.Anyone who dislikes romantic comedies in general will probably not enjoy this film. I therefore suggest that anyone who falls within this group should consider other movies for their pleasure.There are also some who will find themselves unable to enjoy the film on political grounds. This is, perhaps, a surprising comment with regard to a completely apolitical film, but it is nevertheless true. There are those who will find fault on the basis that the film is supposedly politically incorrect. Personally I find it hard to sympathise with their viewpoint, but if you are a dedicated politically correct liberal you may well be able to find offence in what is a very inoffensive movie.However, I suggest that no one else should allow themselves to be guided by negative reviews (including some here on IMDb.com) from those who are politically motivated. Whilst I am sure that we all rest easier in our beds knowing that these individuals are ever-vigilant to the transgressions of politically correct shibboleths (or possibly not) please don't be misled by their zeal. There is nothing in this movie that will cause offence to any normal person.If you are considering watching this film I therefore suggest that you should disregard the reviews of politically motivated reviewers. Look for the tell-tale comments through which they reveal themselves. Comments such as those which laud the performance of the actress who plays Gemma (the one non-white major character) as wonderful whilst criticising all other actors, or comments which criticise the supposed stereotyping of French or American people. I can assure you that no normal French or American person (or anyone else for that matter) will be offended by anything in this movie, and whilst Gemma's portrayal was certainly highly enjoyable, it was definitely not the sole highpoint of the movie. All of the character portrayals were good.Summary  Highly recommended.Rating  8/10",A Good Year
89,CinemaPat,Sweet Romantic Film centered around a Winery,7,17 November 2010,"When I first saw this DVD box and saw that Ridley Scott was the producer, I thought....""no, that can't be"". But to my surprise this is definitely a Ridley Scott production. There aren't any big battles or extravagant costumes. This is plain and simple romance, further enhanced by the beautiful scenery. A genre I wasn't expecting from Scott, but he did a great job. The cinematography was great as were the actors and script.The second thing that caught my eye was the fact it stared Russell Crow. The bad boy of the outback playing a ""know-it-all"" stock broker from London who gets wooed into the wine maker lifestyle. Crow did a wonderful job and I was pleasantly surprised by his range here. His portrayal of snobby money maker turned humbled wine maker was fun to watch. It seemed like he was having fun with the role and that showed in his performance.Musically, this movie was a home run. The soundtrack is phenomenal including tracks from Josephine Baker, Franz Ferdinand and The Everly Brothers. Sadly, the official soundtrack CD is missing some of the best songs from the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the french music as well and they were all partnered perfectly with the situations playing on screen.""A Good Year"", as I said before, is simple. There is no complexity to the story, it is straight forward and doesn't pretend to be anything it is not. For me, I like films with more depth, but for what it was I enjoyed this movie. My wife seemed to really like it as well if that says anything for it.",A Good Year

91,ksundstrom,"South of France-Provence, a pleasant travalogue",3,13 September 2010,"A good film for those who want to see something of Provence in the South of France. It is also enjoyable for those tourists who have spent some months there to resee their familiar scenes and hear the familiar remarks. Otherwise, to be seen only if necessary. The film, of course, was expected to be a winner with its straight sequence as in poker: Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe, Cotilde (of Piaf film), Albert Finney and Peter Mayle, the novelist. So why did it fail to win? Because one expects more to excite one. As director and actors did their best it must be because Peter Mayles' story telling never rose to a captivating and emotional level that swept the viewer along. Mayle's story was more of a very professional advertiser's contribution to the French Tourist Board promotion film for Provence (in this remark one must assume that Mayle's story is in most ways faithfully represented in the script). Peter Mayle knows well his Provence and other areas in the South of France. He also knows Russell Crowe's choice to switch jobs as Mayle himself resigned from a highly paid executive position in an advertising company in order to live in Provence, whence came the most popular and most enjoyable of his books: A Year in Provence. Sadly his following books never reached anywhere near the promise of this first book. But by his first book he became even richer. The story shows all the set theatre pieces, a sort of travalogue: postcard views of gentle hills with well ordered vines on the slopes against a clear blue azur sky, learned talk on assessing wine's qualities and even pointing to corruption in the wine trade, the picturesque views of a village and its restaurant. Of course, there is the eccentric Frenchmen, responsible for the wine production, impassioned by his wine making and provincial traditional cooking (wild boar). The there is the local beauty (Cotilde) succumbing to Crowe's virility. A sex scene that Russell Crowe handles like a watered down version for children. Peter French provides the philosophical views of living in Provence for his young nephew Crowe, who, later when grown up, chooses money and the excitement of taking casino banking risks to make many millions. Crowe's love of the financial life requires that he quickly sell the provincial property inherited from his uncle Finney. But the story here as elsewhere is standard stuff, not intriguing, nor captivating. Even though Mayle throws in an attractive oenologue from Napa Valley who turns out to be an illegitimate daughter of uncle Finney and so has legal claims - all to spice up the story. Sex with the local girl Cotilde is also added spice, disappointingly tame, and this later awakens Crowe's child memories with uncle Finney. All this somehow turns his mind back to uncle Finney's view of a pleasant, stressless life in Provence (Bandol here, between Marseille and Toulon on the Mediterranean coast). Such a life as Finney leads is really to be preferred to a hectic, back stabbing financial career albeit with enormous bonuses and other rewards (a partnership was later offered to Crowe). Crowe's final choice of uncle Finney's Bandol house with childhood memories and a new life for him has to be taken or left by the viewer. Peter Mayle as a story teller fails here to convince viewers by making clear his inner passions when he should know how it felt when he himself made just such a decision. No real passion behind Crowe's decision is seen and so the story line leaves one dissatisfied and unmoved. With so much talent in the poker straight to win, one still wonders why Peter Mayle' story failed to take off and grip one despite every one else doing a superb job.",A Good Year
92,forgrlove-92-963793,This was delicious!!,10,26 October 2020,"This reminds me of the magical Sunday afternoon 15 years ago when I watched ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" for the first time on my big screen and first audiophile sound system. This being a Sunday afternoon too, it makes me long for another Sunday afternoon and not the hectic Monday I know is coming.
This was equally as magical and created the feeling in me of being on vacation, or in another cozier magical life! Next time we go to Europe, definitely taking the time to stay in a villa.
Most of the movie was beautiful. I found the twist in the surprise ending heartwarming! It was nice to see Russell Crowe this kind and warm. I hope we see him in this kind of character again soon. Marion Cottilard was stunning!
I am such a Freddie Highmore fan, seeing him this young and so smart was an added bonus and I admit brought tears to my eyes knowing what success he goes onto as an actor! Good for him!
I have always been a fan of Albert Finney and especially his work around this time period. He is wonderful, like Marlon Brando as he aged, graceful, cultured and full.
I can imagine anyone would love this movie and I would say it is a great stay at home date night movie, especially if the guy suggest it and had a nice wine of champagne and some chocolates, or whatever your girl likes!

Smart he know how to play with the market. Definitely he isn't the most adorable man in the City, for another hand is undeniable his talent to change the social status quo for his interests.Besides all it, he still is a great human, with a hearth to do good things, all the story change when he meets a beautiful woman with a strong ethical sense. Although his instinct sense for hunting, he is the prey, using all his charm and intelligence he start not just bring back a young prodigious boy, but a old, but not, forgot passion.

94,kallepister,Better than it's reviews,9,15 March 2007,"Sir Ridley Scott kidnaps you into an idyllic world of art-nouveau furniture, baguettes, vineyards and slow 2CVs. It's a kind of dis-accelerating approach, just like the slow-food movement. Wonderful pictures, beautiful landscapes, the Provence as the leading actress: who could ask for more in this comfy-movie? Well, Scott has several aces up the sleeves. Freddie Highmore as Young Max Skinner, Albert Finney as Uncle Henry, Russell Crowe as the adult Max, Tom Hollander as ""best friend""Charlie, Rafe Spall as the adorable Bistro-Attendance and: La Provence! If every book-to-movie conversion would be such a cinematic pleasure, we cineasts could lean back in joyful anticipation.Still, this director - being a Knight of the British Empire - is a proved clairvoyant.

97,MartinK75,Underrated,8,27 December 2006,"A Good Year is a perfectly enjoyable Sunday afternoon-type movie and an interesting departure for Hollywood heavyweights Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. Crowe is Max, an arrogant, workaholic London stockbroker who inherits a vineyard in the south of France from his recently deceased uncle whom he hasn't seen in years but with whom he used to spend summers at the vineyard as a child. Max hurries down to Provence intending to sell the property as soon as possible and then resume his fast-track life in London several million pounds richer. Things however don't work out quite so simply. Will Max grow to love the vineyard and decide to stay there instead? Will he also fall in love with a local waitress? Will he become a nicer person in the process? No prizes for guessing the answers to these questions. To its credit, A Good Year pretty much wears its unoriginality on its sleeve and makes no effort to be anything that it isn't. It's certainly as far removed from Crowe and Scott's previous collaboration, Gladiator, as it's possible to be. It's simply a straightforward, fairly sentimental romantic comedy, nicely scripted and acted with some beautifully photographed French locations. It's nice to see Crowe attempting to broaden his range; he's by no means a natural comic but I did enjoy his performance which recalls both Cary and Hugh Grant at times. He's also helped by the script giving him some very funny one-liners. The film makes full use of its lush Provencal locations with plenty of golden, sun-dappled cinematography, all the more beautiful for being set alongside the steely blues and greys of London. No reinvention of the cinematic wheel then, and far from either Crowe or Scott's best work but there are a lot worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",A Good Year
98,JJCA,seduction on film,7,3 June 2007,"this film was so amazing - not for the main story line, which although pleasant was no great shakes but for the quiet seduction of the viewer (as max) by Provence and its people. This film FELT like a sunny Sunday in Provence. The ambiance charmed even more than the characters. Unfortunately, it was hard for me to believe that max could change character so promptly as the story progressed. I kept wondering where the conniving @#)* was going to peek out, and this was distracting. After a second viewing, it was better and this didn't bother me as much. Likewise, it seemed that the love story was a bit rushed, and the interplay from his cousin and his friend just seemed wasted (although it was quite fun).If i had to compare the charm of this movie to any other, i would say Chocolat.",A Good Year

101,AurumStarFinder,"It's not champagne, but delightful nonetheless",7,19 July 2007,"First, a confession: there's only one reason why I saw this film: my recent interest in Tom Hollander's career. In my opinion, a brilliant actor, what I have seen so far has never disappointed me. Just so you know.So imagine my surprise when I reluctantly rent this, wondering why I was bothering considering that I've got no interest in anyone else involved with this film, and find that I enjoyed it immensely.One should never take films in this genre seriously. They are never going to be amazing stuff, there are too many romantic comedies and thus too many clichés. Then add the fact that this is set in France with a bunch of Brits. So now add culture clash clichés.Russell Crowe plays Max Skinner, a highly successful Londoner living the bachelor's dream. He hears that his beloved uncle Henry (an adorable Albert Finney), with whom he spent his summers as a boy (young but bright Freddie Highmore), has died, leaving him with his estate and vineyards Le Siroque in Provence. With every intention of selling, Max goes down to fix the place up and battle Henry's wine maker Francis Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and flirt with local beauty Fanny Chenal (not pronounced as you might think, played by Marion Cotillard) whilst his estate agent Charlie (Tom Hollander) and his secretary Gemma (Archie Panjabi) deal with his affairs in London. Then, out of the blue, arrives Californian Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), looking for her father: Henry. Add wine, a Smart Car with a stutter, sunburn, lavender... you get the idea, oui?Add Ridley Scott's touch. Admittedly a very good director. So the film is actually comfortably and lovingly filmed, I quite contentedly had the beautiful music stuck in my head, and whilst I didn't laugh out loud very often, the characters kept a happy smile permanently on my face. As the credits rolled, I was left with the feeling that the film had been a success in its own right, as it is exactly what it sets out to be: a nicely balanced, enjoyable film. Taken too seriously it'll disappoint you, but at no point did I think that it asks to be taken that seriously. Honest, like wine.I'm thinking that when the DVD's cheaper I'll actually buy it, I was a little sad to take it back to my local video rental shop. It's not Le Coin Perdu, but it's no Le Siroque either. Enjoy.",A Good Year

The comedy is well handled, and does not get in the way of the romance. Crowe shows just what a good actor he is, with nuance and subtlety. He is possibly a better light comedian that he is a dramatic actor.The film has a moral - an attack on selfishness and greed. Even a bad man can seduced back to the good side.Cotillard shows how a woman can overcome hurt and suspicion, and learn to relax. Sometimes being loved is harder than loving.My only gripe - we need more Albert Finney! In many ways he is the heart of the film and only appears in flashback.Another gripe!

104,mark2-1,A film that I could imagine Albert Finney making thirty years ago,8,15 April 2007,The funny thing about this movie is that it is a film that I could imagine Albert Finney making thirty plus years ago.It resembles one of those British Angry Young Men like movies that Albert Finney and Alan Bates etc. made at that time - but it is a more mellow film and it wins over the angrier films of that era with it's calm humor and gentle conclusion.My wife and I hadn't read any reviews and saw it in a movie theater today without and preconceptions. We both rather like this film and find it refreshing to see Crowe playing this type of role.We had seen Marion Cotillard in the 3 Taxi films produced by Luc Besson where she played a hectic silly character.

107,aprilindeecee,"Formulaic, but enchanting",8,19 March 2007,"""Listen up, Lab Rats"", intones Russell Crowe as he lays it on thickly while essaying a British version of Gordon Gecko in the bond markets. Archie Punjabi, as his saucy and ambitious assistant, makes these early sequences worthwhile all by herself. She's a scream! If we didn't know Crowe so well, we'd believe him, as he has all the mannerisms and attitudes down to a science. I know because I spent a score working with such people. Since we are already so familiar with Crowe in other contexts, his winning-is-everything act seems pretty synthetic.This, of course, all sets up Crowe's change-of-life experience when he visits the château and vineyard of his newly deceased uncle (Albert Finney in flashbacks) in order to execute the handover and immediately subsequent sale of the estate. The ugly Briton learns the error of his money-hungry ways and gains a new appreciation for the lessons of his youth by re-visiting the south-of-France of his youth. Ho-hum! We've seen it all before. And, this villa cannot exactly equal the magic of Enchanted April, but the characters here are not as variegated.All that being said, Crowe is resilient enough that even though we know exactly how he will change, he still throws us some surprises and makes us root for him by the end. The actress portraying his local interest is superb and has electric chemistry with Crowe. The couple playing the caretakers are equally wonderful. The photography and music are also spot on with splendid eyes and ears for subtlety and romance -- all this directed by Ridley Scott (Aliens, Blade Runner, etc.) !!?!!! I thought the actress playing his American cousin was rather weak, although she was best in her scene with Crowe's mercenary ""best friend"" Charlie.On the whole, the acting, romance, dry humor, intangibles, and witty dialog overcome the tired plot line sufficiently to make ""A Good Year"" an enjoyable way to spend two hours.",A Good Year

The movie is a bit uneven, some of the acting is contrived, Crowe is a bit wooden.But it also has great cinematography, a nice storyline and it's romantic. The story of Crowe finding his ""lost self"" and reconnecting with his departed uncle through the château and the people from his childhood is nice.

Russell Crowe plays a dishonest stockbroker who inherits his uncle's vineyard in France where he meets up with the usual quirky and irritating cast of local losers. Crowe is a fine actor, but in this film watching him attempt to do lame comedy is like Adam Sandler trying to do Shakespeare. The weak attempts at comedy are painful to watch, and the same redundant jokes keep being thrown at you throughout the film like a water torture, drip by drip. The acting is bad, there is not a normal moment to be had on the screen. The script is just plain awful, it feels like the actors are speaking badly written dialog rather than having conversations. Ridley Scott is well-known for his anti-American sentiments and he makes sure he gets his digs in the film about all of us stupid, no-class Americans, but yet he has no problem trying to market this terrible film in the USA.

114,lostein,A Delightful Way to Spend an Evening,9,10 November 2006,"As a longtime fan of Russell Crowe, I do know that he can be funny, charming, sweet and romantic, not only on film but in real life. His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special ""effected"" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out.

Is there still a place for slapstick in the 21st Century? Discuss - an interesting title for some dreadfully pointless Film Studies course but if you ARE going to try slapstick then it really doesn't work when your protagonist is a nauseating....(insert obscenity here). When Crow falls from a diving board to land face first in an empty swimming pool, you find yourself very far from laughter but rather hoping that that might be shock end to the film. Broken neck.

116,DoomDealer,A Good ... Film.,8,10 March 2014,"I like Russell Crowe. I like him as an actor and I like most of the films he's done. There's an undeniable charm to Russell Crowe and he's certainly not afraid to try his hand at literally anything, which more often than not he pulls off with style, despite not being the most natural or talented actor. Perhaps that's why he's so popular ...Ridley Scott is not one of my favourite directors, but he has produced some good films. A Good Year falls into that category for me. It's a film Scott wanted to make; a personal project, if you will. Consequently, he didn't take it or himself too seriously this time. He just wanted to enjoy himself. It seems he did, which is largely why this is such an enjoyable film (a lot of people might wish he had done the same with one or two of his other films).There's not a lot to it: it's essentially a romantic comedy set in the south of France. Well scripted and well shot, with solid performances by Crowe, Finney, Bourdon and Cotillard. Occasionally a bit silly and ever so slightly over-romanticised (living in the south of France myself, I find a fair bit of the France portrayed in the film hard to relate to), but an all-round nice film that does not require any involvement from the viewer whatsoever.

In the book, Max quits his job within four hours of the story and he is destitute. In the movie, he resigns and gets a significant golden parachute, i.e. lots of zeroes. The book has more intrigue, with much emphasis on fraud, the lawyer and people impersonating police. In the book, Charlie Willis is a former brother in law and real estate agent, and just the latter in the movie.

Abbie Cornish was solo beautiful and decent in the movie. And every cast and the cinematography really sold it. The movie was a perfect wine gave the kick.",A Good Year

A film with an unashamed feel-good factor. Crowe's character, the London city trader, takes off on a whim to investigate his inheritance in France, & the plot gets better & better as the film goes on. Crowe & Finney are marvellous, but then all the actors captured the spirit of the film so wonderfully well, as did the director. I cannot imagine what the critics thought so wrong about it. The film was beautifully filmed, well directed, well acted, had a good story & a wonderful script, with wonderful, almost larger than life, but totally believable characters!

Great characters, sharp dialog, some VERY funny bits throughout, intoxicating Provencal ambiance, intelligent and thoughtful direction. Some delightful plot turns, if somewhat predictable. Wonderful acting for a ""light"" film. Crowe is likable and complex, Finney a finely-aged charmer, Hollander funny without being stupid, Cotillard...well gorgeous and spot-on French, with a small cadre of fine character actors.It would have gotten more critical attention if it were darker and/or violent. That it wasn't, was a welcome change in itself. Critics don't generally like ""feel good"" movies. Makes you want to watch all over again...or buy a plane ticket. Enjoy!",A Good Year
122,dicksmothersjr,Some Directors Can't Do Comedy and Neither Can Some Actors,3,31 October 2007,"I love Ridley, he's done some of my favorite movies. Matter of fact, I'd say he deserves the Mantle of Kubrick as much as any living director, if not more. This being said, I have to say that, after seeing A Good Year, he should avoid comedies like Ted Kennedy should avoid girls who can't swim. He had absolutely no feeling for comedic pacing or timing and his usually stunning cinematic shots just wound up feeling tedious and inappropriate, dragging what was already an utterly uneven and slow-moving pic into the abject doldrums. However, Ripley's a virtual Woody Allen, relatively speaking, when compared to Russel Crowe's foray as a comedic leading man. Good God, his fatuous mugging and attempts at being quirky and flustered (no doubt augmented by his atrocious haircut) were absolutely painful to watch. I think, for the sake of history, it may be best to view this movie as an experiment by Ridley and Crowe to see if they could successfully navigate the waters of comedy. An experiment which, unfortunately, failed in the extreme.",A Good Year

By now, I'm really sorry I didn't see it sooner.It's a wonderful flashback to the summer holidays of your youth, wherever you spent them. It takes you to remember those days when you had no worries but to fully enjoy every new experience.It's also a journey through your present days, when you pay more attention to money and career instead of appreciating the simple things of life.And, finally, it makes you travel into the future, through your dreams of things to achieve, people to know and... to love.If possible, watch it in good company, with a glass of wine and some nice cheese. I can only point out one fault... it's too short",A Good Year
124,Drtimk,Better than the critics say,9,12 November 2006,"Like the reviews overseas,Australian critics have generally snubbed this film as bland and contrived with some nasties regarding Russell's accent and wooden comedy delivery.I thoroughly enjoyed this intoxicating film which I agree has its faults, however it succeeded in its core themes of love,friendship and beauty as being central to a well lived life.I feel Crowe does a good job as Max, an arrogant and ruthless bonds dealer who inherits a château from his Uncle Henry(Finney). Initially interested in how much money this can make, circumstances necessitate a longer stay whereby Max begins to recall his many enjoyable Summers spent with his Uncle at the Provençal château.Marion Cotillard provides the love interest as the beautiful and tempestuous Dark French girl and young Aussie star Abbie Cornish contrasts as the fair blond Californian beauty who is Henry's illegitimate daughter. Both perform well though I know Cornish is much more capable than this role requires.The movie is a little uneven at times as Max learns his lesson on what is truly important in life.Sometimes the comedy is light, sometimes slapstick, and all this juxtaposed with some sentimentality and more serious moments. Most of the characters are contrived from Max through to the peasant French verniers. However in spite of this the story unfolds in a believable way and the photography is stunning as you would expect of the Province and Scott.The women are gorgeous, the wine looks delicious and the food makes you salivate. It succeeds in its attempt to seduce and makes one a little sad to return to suburbia as I did.Finally,on Crowe.I feel there are many critics who love to pan Crowe. It has become the fashion.How he missed out on a nomination for Cinderella Man is beyond me.(Though he would not have beaten Hoffman or Phoenix). He is obviously still anathema in Hollywood and to many critics a man they love to hate because he is simply not liked.One critic criticised him in this film because he was unlikeable but surely that was the point! At least he is an actor who acts. I mean Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant and Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise.But with Crowe, he always plays his character.And a good job he does once more.All in all 7 1/2 out of 10.And definitely more delicious on the big screen.",A Good Year
125,turtlemom1,Delightful,9,27 November 2006,"Too many critics hammered Russell and Ridley for not making the bloody action adventure historic epic they wanted to see. I feel they were blind to the idea that the duo simply wanted a total change of pace for their follow up film, post Gladiator, and just couldn't open their minds to enjoy and accept this film's many pleasures. It's a romantic comedy, with beautiful scenery, a love story and a man's redemption. All the actors are perfect, and the entire film experience brings a smile to audience's faces. Marion Cotillard and Russell Crowe have genuine on screen chemistry. They're ably supported by one of the best casts Ridley has gathered. I particularly enjoyed Archie Panjabi as Gemma, and Tom Hollander as Max's friend Charlie. Albert Finney, the old fox, as Uncle Henry brought a sly warmth to the role of an uncle we all wish could have. I'd have given the film a 10 had there not been a few gaps in the plot. The 9 is understood to be for a film of this genre, in comparison with other rom-com's.",A Good Year

Or don't =) It actually depends on what you want from it. you're not gonna get any plot twists, it's just not that kind of movie. the whole story becomes obvious after 10 minutes or so. but that's not the point. it's an experience. somewhere in the movie there's a line about enjoying simple pleasures of life. this film is exactly that kind of simple pleasure. and simple does not mean primitive by any means. it's obvious that the film has quite a few Prouste allusions, but they are not straightforward, just name of the wine or memories evoked by smells. every single frame is like a bite of something incredibly tasty. if you know this feeling, if you are able to enjoy it, then you should definitely watch the movie. This movie might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's perfect.

The soundtrack is terrific, including songs by Harry Nilsson, and a wonderful Wedding Samba.You will literally fall in love with the Povence area of France in this film. My idea of heaven is to live in a Villa similar to the one in this film.The movie has heart and shows us that although the world sometimes distracts us from the things we know should be at the center of our lives, it is never too late if we remember the lessons of our youth.Take my advice and try this film and see if you don't love it too.

130,screeningroom,Ignore the negative reviews!,9,2 March 2007,"This is still another unfortunate case of people staying away from a good film because of many film critic's negative reviews. I couldn't help thinking while I was watching and enjoying this movie, what kind of cynical person couldn't at least find it mildly fun? First, the acting is first rate. Russell Crowe is very well cast in the role and plays it naturally. He's beginning to remind me more and more of a modern Humphrey Bogart. He can be equally comfortable playing serious, romantic, or comedy roles. Second, I'll watch any Ridley Scott film. Period. His direction, since Blade Runner (and even before that!), has always been first rate in my book, so I always look forward to his latest effort. Third, the supporting cast is superb! The film is fun and romantic. It has all the right elements for a light evening of movie watching. If you rent it, you won't be disappointed.",A Good Year
131,LucasNorth,A fantastic story about life,10,18 June 2010,"What I love most about the film is how Ridley Scott handled Russell Crowe's character's, Max, reuniting with his grandfather, Henry. By playing off the back ground of the south of France, Max smelling Henry's last cigar sitting on the weather beaten bistro table, he says so much more then dialogue could ever do.Russell Crowe and Freddy Highmore are the shinning stars in this film. Crowe's performance from career driven, yet lonely Max to slowly, and then finally, embracing life. And Highmore's cocky young Max. You can see Russell Crowe's Max in Freddy and Freddy in Crowe's Max. These two performances are the shining stars in a galaxy full of them. Marion Cotillard, Albert Finny, Abbie Cornish, Archie Panjabi, Tom Hollander and a surprising Didier Bourdon, under the always masterful direction of Ridley Scott, bring the well crafted screenplay of Marc Kline to life.This is a great film for a warm July night. Highly recommended.",A Good Year
132,waltond2,A little gem,7,24 January 2012,"I really enjoyed this film, a lovely story about how we lose what's important in life when we chase the money. Not an original plot, but one which deserves re-telling and with this cast and script a very worth while addition to the Genre. The comedy moments generally add to the overall film, and whilst its no 'Sideways' nonetheless there are enough bitter-sweet moments to carry the film along. I guess it didn't do too well at the box-office but I suppose that's more of a sad reflection on the conditioning of the cinema going public who are fed on a diet light in dialogue but swamped in violence and CGI. Nevertheless it is beautifully shot and really invokes a sense of memories long hidden in French summers past.",A Good Year
133,filmwatcher2002,Charming and disarming,9,25 January 2008,"I know this film was panned rather severely when it came out, and I did not go to see it. I was curious though, and watched it on cable recently. I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised and charmed. I loved the premise, the cast, the scenery and the cinematography. I thought Russell Crowe got it down perfectly - I spent several years working for a British investment bank, and in the early scenes he really captures the charismatic arrogance of that industry's most successful workaholics. The film also reminded me of the absolute seductiveness of the south of France, an area I was lucky enough to visit many years ago.A Good Year makes its point about the importance of love and keeping your integrity without being heavy handed. Although there are many silly and comedic moments, the funniest are the ones that ring true, such as how the men, after their macho tennis match, are both doubled over at the net, coughing their unfit brains out.One person commented that people seem to fall in love much too quickly in this film. But that is a lot like real life - who doesn't remember feeling an earth shift when they met their life partner? When Max is publicly upbraided by the gorgeous restaurant owner for his dangerously oblivious ways, he is absolutely bowled over. He knows he has met his match - a beautiful woman who is strong enough to not be impressed by him. He is a goner from that moment on.The high caliber of acting in A Good Year - combined with a charming script and gorgeous cinematography is what made this film memorable for me. Crowe and Cotillard are such completely natural actors. They both inhabit their roles in such a graceful way. They make their characters appealing and interesting, in roles that could easily have been two dimensional and ridiculous. You want these two to get together and be happy, but you also know that half the fun will be watching how they do it. I've learned not to trust the critics too much. They often overlook films I love, and praise to the heavens ones that leave me cold. BTW, my husband liked his one too.

It shows you that you can have everything you have ever wished for, but still not be content. The backdrop for this film is absolutely stunning. How anyone could inherit that house and not want to keep it, I do not know.

138,kjvenkatraman,Some really profound and interesting thoughts presented in a very light and pleasant way...,9,8 October 2013,"First things first - don't go by the rating for this one. Read the plot summary and decide for yourself if this one is your type. It certainly was mine.One of the best movies of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe. I know there might risen eyebrows on hearing this. But quite frankly I was able to relate to the whole movie - may be that's because I work in a similar job as that of Russel Crowe in the movie and been dreaming of a similar country-side retirement.This movie is simply so light and free flowing that there isn't a single frame in the movie that looks unnecessary or out of place. This movie beautifully portrays the transformation of a brutally and fiercely competitive trader and the changes in his view of life. The strength of this movie is Russell Crowe's characterization and the little things that point to that. Initial bits about the no-rules-in-a- war ways of trading to he lying to Uncle Henry in a game of chess indicate his raw and brutal competitive spirit. Lines about he hijacking the job from his senior during the latter's vacation and therefore avoiding vacations, about sharing credit or otherwise with a junior for a profitable trade, ""money is not everything but the only thing"" or his brief conversation with the concierge of his building - all exude varying levels arrogance, cynicism, insecurity and materialism. From that extreme the characterization gradually yet noticeably and pleasantly moves to a Max (Russel Crowe in the movie) who is willing to part with his property for which he initially went all the way to deny the existence of any daughter-father relationship between the owner of the property (his deceased uncle) and a potential claimant, one who leaves his high profile trading job for a life in a vineyard.While I see a strong effort made by the director to keep this movie light there are some subtle scenes and lines that throw-up profound thoughts. Lines such as ""it is not that this place doesn't suit your life but it is your life that doesn't suit this place"" or ""when do you see the real picture? Do you take long drives down the town alone at nights?"". This script offered immense scope to make it a lot more thought provoking and heavier but the director probably chose to just touch upon them briefly and not delve deep in to them and make this a philosophical watch. Nevertheless while I watched the movie the first time and many times after that, it posed several very tough questions to me - questions that challenge the fundamental premise we all wake-up upon, premises that keep-us going (or so do we think!). The movie can, if one wants to, get one to think about ""where the heck are we going with all this?"" or ""what the hell is all this for?"". Again as I said, some of these are not best discussed with particular reference to this movie as in an effort to keep this movie light the director seems to have indulged in some luxuries in the plot and assumptions.Overall a very pleasant watch with dashes of some profound thoughts letting the viewer decide the way he / she wants to view this movie. Watched this several times over already and still counting. 9/10",A Good Year
139,yashwantsept,An extraordinary offering from Ridley Scott!,10,20 May 2014,"Yeah we get the feeling how movies have all done this genre and exhausted them. Here comes a story about a man finding himself, sounds clichéd? probably. But what makes this movie stand out and make it likable? It comes from director Ridley Scott famous for his sci-fi and hard core stuffs like alien or gladiator and this movie is a genre that he hasn't explored before. I was wondering that maybe this movie was very badly reviewed at it's time of release and due to word of mouth it received criticism a way too more than it deserved. So there we go, I knew this was a bad movie(according to people in general) and then I fell in love with this movie in just about 10 minutes and I knew it wasn't going to be that bad, but trust me this movie is really good for people who like to enjoy the pleasures of life and what it has to offer to us. This movie I believe is an excellent work that depicts destiny and human nature that is so delicate and fragile that we tend to loose touch of it often. We get back to it but when do we get back is what matters. Russell Crowe is a natural at comedy and I wish he did more roles of this genre but since this movie generated overwhelmingly negative reviews I guess both Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe avoided this genre after this venture. Nevertheless this movie offers you a satisfaction that you have spent your time well and enjoyed it and for people who like to watch upbeat and positive movies that make you happy this is definitely recommended. Its nice how in the end all is well and I believe this movie did not get to that place artificially, its like the water that flows down a hill, you always knew that it was only going to go downwards still it is for this nature that we love to see it.",A Good Year
140,buttonwillow,Ridley Scott elevates this film beyond expectations,8,12 November 2006,"This is a fine film -- don't let the critics keep you away. It's true that Russell Crowe will forever be linked with his Gladiator character (just as Al Pacino will forever be linked with Michael Corleone) so it takes a bit of mental adjustment to accept him in a role like this, but he absolutely nails it down. The rich cast of supporting actors is equally fine in roles that are colorful but never campy. My highest praise goes to director Ridley Scott. There is a great look and feel to this film that sets it above every other film in this genre. It manages the nearly impossible trick of feeling snappy and relaxed all at once. If this film falls short of expectations in theaters, it will have a long, popular life as a DVD. It is the sort of film I can watch again and again.",A Good Year

I have never really been a Russell Crowe fan, since he's an arrogant, unlikeable, temperamental putz. All that aside, I thought I'd give this film a chance since I love romantic movies set in gorgeous locations.This movie was beautifully shot. And. That's. About. It. Everything else FAILED to deliver any shred of believability. Big time! Albert Finney was a gem, and so was the lovely Marion Cotillard, (who I feel sorry for since she had no idea what she was signing on to with this crap of a film!) but just having two very good actors does not a good movie make. The so-called ""moral"" of this story didn't exist. I mean, come on. We're supposed to believe that a hard-ass like Max Skinner can SUDDENLY change his VERY unlikeable disposition by taking a week off of work, sipping some wine and shagging a French beauty? Give me a break! And the sheer fact that they even attempted to make us believe in ANY romantic connection between Max and Fanny is insulting. They were no where NEAR the same age, and I didn't buy Freddie Highmore's face morphing into Russell Crowe's. Bad casting choice, people. And the back story about the cousin was unresolved and ridiculous. And what about the ""mysterious wine"" that was apparently hidden by Max's uncle Henry? How come that wasn't fully explained? There were far too many plot holes in this crappy story, that it's not even worth discussing anymore.If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother.

A man finding himself, coming to terms with his life, and finding his dreams that he had lost when he was a boy. Not sure a 9 even does this justice. More like a 9.9, not perfect, but REALLY good.

144,sisuwoman-1,NOT a Very Good Year!!! (The critics are right!),3,26 March 2007,"First, let me preface this comment with this statement: I love Russell Crowe. He is by far my favorite actor. So I rented this movie, even though the reviews are not the greatest. In fact, I saw Russell being interviewed about this movie, and he didn't even seem too impressed with it. (He's not one to put up a front).So, even though I really wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. Here's why: 1. The dialog is very hard to understand. Everyone either has a thick English or French accent. And they all talk really fast and kind of mumble. Very frustrating.2. The plot is stupid and predictable yet confusing at the same time. I still couldn't tell you how that's possible. Something to do with two different vintages of wine. And so help me, if the British stock market REALLY works as it's shown in the movie, then they are in BIG trouble!3. The acting is mediocre. Russell is just ""phoning it in"" as they say. Must have needed the paycheck??? The other actors, not at all noteworthy.4. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy. There was a little (boring) romance with no real emotional buy-in or interest generated. Comedy? I can't remember anything really funny in the movie. Stupid, yes. Plenty of stupid. Funny, no. It reminded me of a bad sitcom pilot. Honestly. It was that bad.So in contradiction to all the other commentaries, DO believe the critics. It's not worth your time.",A Good Year

It is actually an admirable accomplishment from one of my favorite action film makers. It has a great story, visuals are stunning as can be expected, and more importantly, wines as well as people age with style.Much of the appeal of this film is because of Russell Crowe. He's very relaxed, and it seems he's allowed himself to set loose under the guidance of Scott. They've worked together on many movies and in this one, you can clearly see the fruits of long friendship. Crowe is truly convincing as a money loving crook, who inherits his uncle's château and vineyard in Provence. He has many memories from the summers he spent there. Eventually he wakes up to the relaxed Provence atmosphere as he opens his heart and mind to the aspects in life he has been ignoring.Based on the novel of Peter Mayle (""A Year in Provence"" -fame), it has everything required to make you smile and feel good.

149,eroche,"Good movie, comment on sound track",10,11 November 2006,"This was a wonderful movie. I tried to find glitches or faults but could not. Peter Mayle, for those of you who have not read his books, tends to write wonderful fantasy stories set in Southern France. Everything works out perfectly, and it always is the story of a rich American or Brit discovering the wonderful beauty of France, learning to enjoy the good things in life, particularly the food. This movie was good in this respect, but there were several scenes in which the assumed taste of the food could have been brought out more. Example: 1/ he smelled the green ink of his uncle; 2/ when to his surprise he was presented with a bottle of wine and selection of cheeses, the editing cut short what could have been at least a taste and surprise on his face; 3/ at the dinner party, there could have been a little more detail on the taste of what must have been a great meal. Finally, the mystery of the CP wine was not spelled out clearly in the movie, although it was the subject of a 0.5 second flashback of memory. In addition, the chemistry from his visiting cousin from America and his real estate broker could have been resolved. It was a very nice movie. I loved it. However, for IMDb members, I have a question: WHERE IS THE JIMI HENDRIX MUSIC TRACK? It does not seem to appear on the album (at the Apple iTunes store) and I'm dying to hear it. Does anyone know where to find this French version of ""Hey Joe""?",A Good Year

151,Gareth_Pontin,Just a lovely film!,8,16 April 2010,"I bought this film on a whim whilst in the supermarket, not really sure what to expect if I'm honest. Well I'm glad to say that I was very pleasantly surprised! What the viewer receives in A Good Year is few hours of laughs, good times and a good story too! Combine that with stunning visuals and picturesque setting that Turner would've been proud of and that all comes together nicely into one of my favourite feel-good films.If someone had said to me ""It's Russell Crowe, playing a posh Englishman, on a wine estate"", I probably would've laughed, but he pulls it off admirably, never seeming too corny or over the top. There are also fine performances from Albert Finney and Marion Cotillard to back this up.One of the most impressive things about this film have to be the visual feast we are treated to. The location for proceedings is sublime and the cinematography just brings it to another dimension, creating an atmosphere that cannot bettered.If I were to suggest some improvements for the film, I would simply suggest making more use of Didier Bourdon, who puts in a wonderful turn as Duflot.Overall, a fine film and definitely worth a watch",A Good Year

154,sarum100,Very enjoyable - ignore the reviews!,7,5 November 2006,"This is definitely the first time I have gone to see an Russell Crowe and/or Ridley Scott film at the cinema, fully bracing myself to be disappointed and...I am very pleased to be able to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. It has a very warming glow to it - beautifully played; gorgeously shot. Anyone who isn't just a little bit seduced by Provence after seeing it needs their head (or more likely their heart) examining. The lessons may well have been taught in a hundred films before, but that doesn't make them any less relevant or resonant for the commercial era in which many of us now live...So, why the terrible reviews? I really don't know. The comedy was not overplayed in the way implied by the critics at all. To be blunt, it was not really necessary, as the warmth and effectiveness of the film and story lies in the romantic drama. The comedy is fine, but doesn't really add anything to the film. However, it does give it a very upbeat, cheerful and likable feel and maybe that is reason enough.Max's character and Russell Crowe's performance? It's in the quieter moments where Crowe really excels and shows just why someone would want to cast him, as opposed to say Hugh Grant, in a film like this. His reactions to memories and the things that other characters do and say are just so much deeper and more real than Grant is capable of: which is why Grant always comes off as the same character in these films (a variation on the Grant formula) and Max comes off as real.It almost seems as though the critics have a film with this plot pegged into a box: because they can only see (and can only expect to see) a Hugh Grant characterisation, they cannot accept anything other than a Hugh Grant characterisation. Whereas the actual reason that Crowe doesn't come off as Hugh Grant is because he isn't channelling that kind of characterisation at all. This is a very different kind of film.Also, the critics seem to be completely off the mark in assessing the character, when they say that he starts off a bastard and ends a bastard too. Actually, this is far more about unearthing other qualities - not completely rejecting those 'bastard' qualities that he begins the film with, but refining and diluting them, as he becomes more and more adjusted to his past. He doesn't change, he opens his heart and mind to qualities that he has been ignoring within himself. You can see that other Max from the moment he opens the letter telling him Henry is dead - but he tries to resist the feelings that are clearly there, in large part because he doesn't want to face the fact that he has let his Uncle down - and all of the guilt that is allied with that.The film is not the best film I have ever seen. The questions it asks are fairly fundamental, but they aren't startling or especially thought provoking.But the film is highly enjoyable, from start to finish; and it's warm, something that is pretty rare in films these days.So, to end, clearly I am not in tune with the critics - but then, increasingly that seems to be the case nowadays. I just think that I see completely different films to them...",A Good Year

Also, this is one of those movies that make you think that Ridley Scott was lucky in doing ""Blade Runner"".Although the movie overall gives some delightful and funny moments, the only spoiler I offer is: There are NO surprises in this obvious storyline. Read the plot and think of a happy ending for it, and you already know what's going to happen before seeing the movie.Besides that, the dialogs are unnatural, and the characters are cliché and shallow. Russell Crowe plays the typical knows-it-all cold-hearted and womanizing yuppie. Didier Bourdon, Isabelle Candelier and Jacques Herlin play the also stereotypical angry french family. You just don't manage to have any sympathy for Russell Crowe's character because, as his uncle says in the beginning: ""You learn nothing from winning, but losing makes you wiser"".

And I was just not moved to laugh at the tired stereotypes of Frenchmen. I am not being PC - just bored. So the French are volatile, dirty and obsessed with wine and sex - so what - been there, done that - not funny. I saw this film with a friend who said Russell Crowe was ""out of his depth"". It seemed a strange comment as the film is just not very ""deep"" but I think I understand what she meant. Crowe was hot as a gladiator in a dramatic film, but in modern dress and a cute comedy he is just a stick.

So even if this movie is not so bad, I can assure you that it's full of clichés! I liked the part of the story which was about materialism, and choices you have to make in your life... but this film can't be a great one when it's based on the ""cliche"" that every french real estate man would like to provide to it's English customers.But can we expect an privileged urban American to really understand and put into images le ""terroir""?

It has a deliciousness to it, an innocence through the memories it depicts, the scenery, its atmosphere, a certain facial expression, and the good, natural acting - something is unique to this movie!It's like an honest conversation with an old friend with a nostalgic and magic touch to it but wrapped up in an easy-going general mood. ""I wish I were in this movie"", I thought this morning after having it watched yesterday for the third time since last summer. ""But you are!"" came an answer from my head. We all are, in a non-intrusive and light kind of way, the viewer way, viewer who is left with an image or sensation lingering (probably the house and the garden) or humming a piece of soundtrack some days after having watched it...
Cannot help thinking what a follow-up would be like...15 years later...the now mature Fanny-Max couple, maybe with children of their own, still living in beautiful Provence and not missing some scattered memories of Henry?... Like an adventure that carries on across time, with new layers of wisdom and deliciousness, simple but profound, a deeper understanding of his uncle and life, present life and life he had left behind, at the same time not forgetting the simple treasures like a good glass of wine and good company...And of no lesser importance are the vines, which are now producing a sought-after unique wine, right Ridley?Would be so lovely to find again the feeling of this film in another one!Update April 21

From the 3rd viewing I was hooked. Now, over 20 viewings later (never ever a movie has been able to do this to me!), I know every line and even bought a red wine from the region (and I'm not a red wine person!), I still enjoy the beginning with the impeccable acting of an adorable Freddie (what a pity he had to grow up!..) and my favourite part still remains when Max arrives at the chateau and is flooded by memories or when he takes the shots.

I live in Brussels, and when I want to feel the sun on my back, see the vermilion-red wine colours, recall known authentic French couples like the vigneron and his wife, I just pop the DVD in and let it wash over me. Russell Crowe seems suited to the role, and his transformation is sublimely summed up by Fanny's remark ""...It's not that Provence is not suited to your life, it's your life that's not suited to Provence"", not forgetting the young Max's indelible apprenticeship as a youngster with his multi-coloured uncle. Albert Finney (Max's uncle) launches - to a M'Cenroe-esque young Max tennis player - the phrase that has now entered the UK sport and education fraternity ""...You'll learn more from losing than from winning!"". Tilts at cycle cheating - Max shouts ""Vive Lance Armstrong""from his Smart - and at wine debasing - the ""Coin Perdu"" wine is anything but gut rot, or good for de-rusting metal. These are brief treasures in a well thought out screenplay. Why, towards the end of the film, does the camera dwell longer than before on the Van Gogh painting in Fanny's restaurant?

Every stereotype of the financial services industry and Provence. Done better elsewhere. The only person I liked was Crowe's assistant. The look wasn't even Provence. I lived there 5 years. It looked and mood was more like Spain. The writing was uninteresting. All this pompous morality about the vines. None of these people deserved to have things turn out well.

182,villigord,Well Chosen Collaboration Between Russell Crowe & Ridley Scott,10,18 November 2013,"A Good Year certainly never received the accolades it so much deserved. Another great collaboration between uber talented method actor Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, the director who guided him to Oscar fame in 'Gladiator' some six years prior.Based on a Peter Mayle book, the film does the book excellent justice and even manages to make the cinematic transition without losing or adding much in the process. Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximillian, the cold, power hungry trader who spent summers as a lad in Provence, France with his eccentric English Uncle Henry, while learning the finer things in life. Sadly, for the last 10 years of Uncle Henry's life, Max neither visited or contacted him. When asked by his assistant, Jasmine, why there was no communication for so long, Max glibly replies 'that's probably got something to do with my becoming an a**hole.' The story line is obvious, but it is absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work. As always, he is gorgeous to look at, and his trust in Ridley Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here – a nice break from all of the heavy (and often heavy handed) Oscar bait bio-pics he has otherwise excelled in.The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Everyone works well together and the chemistry between Crowe and Cotillard is unmistakable. Freddie Highmore captivates as a young Max. He was perfectly matched with Albert Finney's blustery Uncle Henry. Genuine respect and friendship between the two is noted. Marion Cotillard is a gorgeous Fanny Chanel: note the resemblance to Kate Middleton, which is eerily obvious. Australian Abbie Cornish is cute and vulnerable, and pulls off an American accent like a native. The Good Wife's Archie Panjabi is understated as Max's knowing assistant, who takes jabs at her boss at every opportunity, and hilariously reserves a tiny two passenger Smart Car for him at the Hertz counter in France. Music by Harry Nilsson had me diligently searching for my 'Nilsson Schmilsson' CD.You were right, Max - we're not here for the dental plan. Winning isn't everything, its the only thing.

Russel Crow as a broker has justified his role and his acting is really impressive.The setting and scenery of the place is breathtaking.

I really expected to lump this film in with those...But I was very surprised to find how much I enjoyed it! It's such a sweet little movie. But films like this can really bring out the cynic in reviewers. Todd McCarthy's review of the film pretty much embodies this.I wouldn't really call this a typical rom-com either.

187,pvotsis,"""A Good Year"" actually a pleasant surprise",9,1 March 2007,"I finally decided to see this film because it's Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott teaming up for something new and different; a romantic-comedy-turned-romantic-drama. After seeing such negative reactions, I figured I'd give the film the benefit of the doubt. What I found was that watching it was a pleasant surprise. I can see why people were turned off by this film. The first 35-40 minutes are slow paced (despite the quick editing and assorted camera shots) and the story takes a while to develop beyond what the viewer understands from the previews. Nonetheless, Scott shows two different environs that are both beautiful in their own way; the sleek, bustling metropolis of London and the stunning beauty of Provence, France.What's strange is that it seems for this first half hour or so, the script resembles more a romantic-comedy like that of a Hugh Grant film, and is quite boorish and unoriginal. After about 40 minutes into this, it seems Crowe finally becomes comfortable in the role he's given and the tone of the story changes completely once risk and tragedy are involved. The story takes on some darker elements and thus the viewer can invest themselves into what's going on, because a lot of things start happening for Crowe's character.The story itself is about an old Englishman who has a vineyard in the French countryside and his nephew who lives with him. This relationship is reinforced brilliantly in the film and is one of the strongest aspects of the story. Scott gives the audience some endearing memories of Skinner and his uncle years ago, with fantastic visuals all along the way showcasing the French countryside at its finest. Finney is wonderful as Max Skinner's (Crowe) uncle, injecting comedy and pathos into the story and the character. Ol' Man Skinner bites the dust many years later, and because he never left a written will, the estate went to Max. As stout as Finney was, the star of the movie is, of course, Crowe. He really works hard to bring life to an otherwise mundane character. Crowe brilliantly portrays the free-market cutthroat pig terribly well. Perhaps it's in his nature to be a jerk, and he's excellent at being just that in the first half, nearly carrying the film along the way.Things take a turn for the better in the film when an unexpected guest arrives at the estate just when you think Skinner is going to rid himself of this last adage of a life he has forgotten. Skinner's journey in the film is wonderful to watch as during the early portions you see what a ruthless SOB he is. When news of his uncle's death arrives, he takes a brief moment to mourn and think of times past, yet as soon as he's back in the office and with his cohorts he's the same devilish opportunist. It's great watching Skinner slowly changing and rediscovering himself as the story picks up and as fresh characters are (re)introduced into his life.Marion Cotillard playing the French love interest in this film is stunning and plays her part convincingly enough opposite Crowe. Tom Hollander is great as Skinner's lawyer/friend, offering comedic relief during the most dramatic moments of the film. This is my first exposure to Marion Cotillard, and I must say she seems like a fine actress, though her role was fairly simple. She injected some beauty and tempestuousness to her role and was mighty fine to look at.Really, about Crowe, I don't have any clue as to why critics panned this so much. I think it's become a trend in Hollywood to sh*t on the guy because he's not ""likeable."" He's still one of the few actors who really plays his character and doesn't play himself on-screen, despite what critics say. He delivers a fine performance, blending humor with self-pity, arrogance, fondness, romance, and above all, pathos. The film itself is very good and touching. It showcases beauty, friendship, kinship, and love. It has some mighty fine directing by Scott with some luscious visuals, a nifty score, and a great performance by one of(if not THE) the finest actors on the planet. I enjoyed what transpired and it was refreshing and interesting to see Crowe try something new and intoxicating. Easily one of the ten best of this past year.8/10",A Good Year
188,stuartmathie-01693,Too long and unfunny,3,8 October 2019,Watched it on holiday in montangro since there was nothing else on. So many pointless scenes. Annoying how Ridley and crowe can make something so poor.,A Good Year

Who had the bright idea that Russell Crowe was a comedic actor? He was way in over his head on this one. And the script...... my teenage daughter could have written a better script than this. I hope they didn't actually pay the writer real money. There are not often many movies I watch that annoy me so much that I feel compelled to write about it - but this is one of those.

I a writing this review a year into the global COVID-19 pandemic so traveling the globe now isn't an option.I have been to The Provence Region of France and this film brings me right back. Yes it's a bit corny and Russell Crow is not one of my favorite actors but I enjoy it each time I see it. A plus for young Freddie Highmore as young Max.Other films that I enjoy that give me a similar feeling are Summertime, A Year in Tuscany and Call Me by Your Name.",A Good Year
192,federicone,Plot summary is wrong.,8,29 September 2006,"The American woman does not claim that the land is hers, but tries to know something about his past. Ridley Scott exploit his good taste to create a charming atmosphere, in which Russel Crowe is just an extra piece of the story. The landscapes, the Provence feeling, the interesting women, and the enchanting world of wine makes you fly between the clouds and wonder: ""what if I leave my job right now and start living the real life?"". Russel Crowe successes in playing a clumsy business man who realizes he has to make a change. Albert Finney minor appearances are brilliant. It is a movie about feelings, enjoying life, and finding yourself. You have to see it.",A Good Year
193,MaryFranzSL,Crowe and Sir Ridley didn't miss... the critics did.,9,16 November 2006,"This will not be one that makes a bunch of money, but in a day and age where films like Saw III or movies depicting a stereotype of a Russian immigrant top the box office, I'm pretty certain that's not a bad thing when it comes to judging what's worthy and what's not.The critics are wrong. Russell and Ridley delivered and delivered well. There have been very few romantic comedies that I've enjoyed.... even romances are not on my top 10 list. But this one was different. When I go to a movie, I expect to be transferred... I expect an escape; and that is exactly what I received. London was familiar... not much difference between the rat race there or here. Provence, however, was a place where time seemingly stood still. Max had changed, but his roots had not. And that's exactly what he needed. I was there with Max... remembering what was good, falling in love, experiencing regret and having that very painful yet liberating human moment when you realize you've become something you were never intended to be.My mom and I are usually exact opposites with film. She's usually covering her eyes watching something I picked, and I'm usually nodding off at something she's picked. This time, we were both smiling at the same parts, laughing at others, and desperately wishing to be a beautiful French café owner in all the right places! (And I should mention, too that Mom just returned from a Mediterranean cruise and was nudging me saying... ""Did you notice the cypress trees?"" ...tipping my hat to Sir Ridley for bringing France to life.) The critics expected something mind-blowing. There are no tigers, just a few scorpions, Ridley's wife wasn't murdered, we didn't relive the life of a great person, nor did we encounter any battles at sea. But had the critics opened their minds, they would have taken a journey nonetheless... one of rediscovery and tough lessons... and some laughter along the way. Too bad for them! I enjoyed it thoroughly! Thank you Russell Crowe and Sir Ridley once again for a wonderful film!",A Good Year
194,critter-26,A tasty vintage,8,13 October 2006,"A Good Year is much like Peter Mayle's other books  shortish, picturesque, sometimes mouthwatering, generally light and definitely charming.To that end, this film does the book excellent justice and even manages to make the cinematic transition without losing or adding much in the process. (Max has however become a blend of Wall Street's Gordon Gecco and Capt. Aubrey  a cold power hungry cut-throat exterior with a bit of a romantic hedonist hiding a Depardieu-like charming buffoon locked inside.) Sir Ridley Scott makes it clear that the real star here is the Provencal countryside in all of its golden sun soaked glory. Russell is the fulcrum that moves us from one beautiful scene to the next, lightly shuffling and dancing in over-sized pajamas with a suit jacket and a tie for a belt.And oddly, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.As obvious as the story line is (both in the book and the film) it remains absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work, hammy or no. He looks great and his trust in Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here  a nice break from all of the heavy (and often heavy handed) Oscar bait bio-pics he's pigeonholed himself into recently.The rest of the cast is picture perfect. I've been waiting to see when Freddie Highmore would play a young Russell and he's lovely here, big eyed and gracefully gawky as young Max. He holds his own against Albert Finney's lovingly blustery Uncle Henry. Marion Cotillard is gorgeous as Fanny and also sturdy enough to hold her own against both Max and Crowe himself. Abbie Cornish is pretty and sweet and her American accent is damn near perfect. Isabelle Candelier is a colorful counterpoint to Max's stuffy British ways, but it is Didier Bourdon who nearly walks away with the picture. His is a character we haven't seen done a million times before and whose eyes hint at a story equal in richness to the Château itself. Archie Panjabi is Max's assistant, a character created for the film. As the all knowing and mischievously wicked Gemma she appears ready to run away with this picture. (And as always watch for a cameo by Ridley Scott's longtime partner Gianina Facio  I won't spoil your fun by telling you where she appears.) Again, there is nothing new or groundbreaking here. It will be compared to Under the Tuscan Sun and a long history of countless other films of this nature  an attractive woman or handsome bastard gets in touch with who they really are, gets back to basics and becomes who they were always meant to be.Forgive me for taking this path, but the wine/film comparisons are inevitable with this one.Like most of the films made today the fresh elements in this film come from the particular vision of the film maker, the chemistry of the cast and the way all of it can come together in a charming and palatable fashion. In other words, the blending of the key ingredient's.It all comes down to being a matter of chemistry, craftsmanship and preference. Chemistry causes the grape to ferment and become wine. Craftmanship and experience make that wine something worth drinking. Chemistry amongst the elements of a film  story, cast and setting makes these pieces form a cohesive whole. Craftsmanship and experience make it a palatable film.And the rest is simply a matter of taste.Though it lacks the crisp originality of a sauvignon blanc, the hipness of a pinot grigio or the bold edginess of a Cabernet, but the elements here come together to make a film that plays pleasantly over the tongue like a decent rose  easy to sip and enjoy and given the chance could well leave you with the warm glow of a late summer afternoon.But enough with the wine clichés! You could easily take advantage of the value of a matinée or opt to wait for DVD, though neither will do the scenery justice. This sweetly charming film will hold up equally well as a date movie, a mid week escape or something that you can take Mom to.Worth a look.-Roo's Reviews",A Good Year
195,james-sullivan-6,A Good Couple of Hours,10,8 September 2009,"This film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe as the successful but initially empty Max Skinner, is a great example of the diversity Scott and Crowes' collaborations can offer, though this will not be to everyones liking - and there will be many Gladiator and American Gangster fans who will be squirming in their seats as they watch it.The opening minutes of the film reveal a young Max in Provence - a young boy already driven towards winning irrespective of the methods needed to do so. From here we move to London and scenes from Max's fast-paced life, with hectic market trading victories being conducted during the day, and some no-doubt expensive celebrations ensuing through the night.And long this might have continued- but for the death of Max's only relative that he is aware of- his uncle Henry (played by Albert Finney). From here we are taken into the main chapter in Provence as he attends to the sale of his uncles estate, meeting various characters along the way, one of which is the beautiful Fanny Chenal - whom Max pursues romantically despite running her off the road in his ""little yellow rola-skate"" (a Smart car!).This film is a gentle, beautiful, and often tender reminder of what matters in life, as we witness Max's realisations as to his nature, his life, what he has, and what he does not have. There is nothing particularly new, ground-breaking, or startling about the films contents in themselves. It is a delight to watch- due to its visuals, soundtrack and light humour - however I would not be surprised if it provokes a not-to-critical self-examination in many of it's viewers minds.A film of wide appeal in terms of demographics - it won't set the world alight but not all films have to do they?",A Good Year

If you want a movie were you have a good laugh and come out feeling happy, this is the one for you. The critics may not have liked this movie, probably the usual anti-Crowe crowd, but ignore them. Like the previous writer you have to see the French countryside on the big screen. The sound track is pretty cool as well.

Possibly somewhere that you would really want to go and with someone that you really would like to be there with. Location was just beautiful and casting was excellent. I wanted to move to a small town in France. Its a moving story that leaves you wondering what you are doing with your life. You should see this film.

However, in all honesty, I found ""A Good Year"" to be a charming, more ""high-brow"" romantic comedy compared to other similar fare. The presence of Albert Finney adds wonderful nostalgia and Russell is funny without pretense. I would have liked a little more character development regarding his love interest, but I believe that Ridley Scott was more interested in the relationship between Russell's character and Mr. Finney's - and rightly so. The setting was perfect and I agree with Russell - the best way to watch this would be with a ""good glass of red and a piece of cheese."" Cheers to you, Ridley Scott!",A Good Year

All actors well cast, with supporting characters giving equally even and credible performances as the leads, with particular note of the quick and witty inlays from the legal sidekick Charlie. The main story is about Max - a man who has achieved much in his career as a London stockbroker, who manages, despite his occupationally acquired ADD, to access important childhood memories during his return to the French vineyard he spent priceless summers at just in time to redeem the magic in his life. The film does not become too heavy nor give it all away with obvious conclusions, however the final exchanges between the main characters were a little syrupy.

I could do with a lot more of artists just coming out to play as they do here.My only regret - the movie hints at some sources of conflict between Henry and Max, such as Henry's mental health (I.E. The delusion/fantasy of dancing with Amelia Aerhart), and the unsuitability of a ""bad influence"" uncle as a main caregiver for a child. Even making allowances for a fluff piece, why would anyone, even a total jerk, have broken things off so completely? That needs some fleshing-out.",A Good Year

We were not disappointed in our choice. It is the ultimate feel good movie, which leaves you at the end with a contented smile and no wish to join the outside world. The photography was wonderful, the French accents real, everything in the film portrayed France as I know it and London and the Gherkin as well. This is a film which will please the young city suits and their girlfriends, as well as the rest of us.

206,bunkys,Must have been a different movie with the same title,3,15 August 2008,"Did I see the same movie as the last multi-starred reviewers? Yes, Provence is amazing but I am going to rate the movie on sound, acting and script. Provence can't help but be gorgeous. Russell Crowe is talented and once again he does a great job here even if the movie is totally cornball. (and not good cornball like a Cary Grant comedy.) I had trouble with the 'creative' part of the film, the writing of the characters etc. There's a couple of scenes where Crowe's character is having 'flashbacks' involving his uncle. (Finney always the best, but very little of him, sadly.) The soundtrack with lyrics takes over the whole scene and I thought 'Uh oh' some heavy-handed Hollywood stuff is happening now. And there was plenty of that. Why do we need to explain scenes to people through the words in the music? It's not a musical and yet it is. I suspect it's a late addition to beef up what some editor may have felt was a 'weak' scene...although I enjoyed Crowe's wanderings through his lovely estate. OK now the acting. Beautiful women, yes, with lots of cleavage...but I just didn't buy any of the female characters... now this is the fault of the scriptwriter I know, but the love interest expounds on how hard it is to get close to her but a couple of days and one date later they're bedded down. We all should be so ""deep."" Hmmm. Knock knock here's your long lost cousin just coincidentally making her appearance RIGHT NOW...just in the nick of time! Seriously the 'American' girl has a fantastic body, but I'm afraid needs a few more years of acting class as does most of the eye candy in this movie. Beautiful women need to be able to act, too. Many of them can and we know who they are, they just weren't in this movie. I don't think 'cuz' nailed the accent either. She seemed to roll in and out of some speaking pattern that troubled her.Although Crowe's secretary was very interesting and in his age bracket-- she is, of course, overlooked...I have some reasons why, but it's kind of late for that...her cleavage was as good as anyone else's! Then she's brought back in at the end of the movie, sadly buying his steel and more steel apartment and hitting on an underage rocker. Boy that's so funny. (sic) Also Tom Hollander a great actor, just stuck in this movie like some long lost drug addict doing provincial theater...he was wasted and too good for this role.The idea that Crowe and his love interest were close to the same age when they were young (or ever!) was just laughable. And the French stereotyped 'cook, maid' and her vine sniffing husband were characters taken right out of a 1940's movie. Just desperately tacky and uneven characterizations as well. I fault the script and director for those problems. Read the book instead, or better yet read Ferenc Mate's book: The Hills of Tuscany. It's not Provence but it might be better.",A Good Year

Warm and charming while fast and furious. I loved the scenery, beautiful Provence and though the moral of the story is not new, the movie will make you smile, laugh and think about your life and your choices. It will induce you to follow your heart. The mix of French life and American business creates a pace that's just right. Its not one of those slow romantic movies that will make you fall asleep while watching beautiful Provence. Russel Crowe will keep you nailed from his fast job in the stock market. Soon he'll reveal much more in view of his childhood memories and a meaningful world will open and charm you. He has got part of that magic we saw in ""A beautiful mind"" - you won't regret watching this movie. A mere 6.7 points does not do justice to this movie, so give it a chance.",A Good Year

All the characters were well-cast, in my opinion, and added to the enjoyment of the story. I have watched this several times with friends and it never fails to entertain. Between Peter Mayle and Ridley Scott, I feel the chemistry would support another shot. How about Hotel Pastis?

I tried to sneak out to watch The Departed, and I got into the other movie right at the peak. Just then, a policeman walked in and my pulse started going like crazy. I waited about 2 minutes, then casually walked out, but I realized he wasn't there for me. I went back in and tried to enjoy A Good Year, but it just felt lacking. There wasn't really a plot. The learning that goes on with Crowe is all old learning. So now he can enjoy life, and not just invest in the stock market. Big deal, nothing is accomplished.

Crowe, whom I consider a good actor, was highly lackluster in his performance, and the girl he falls in love with, I don't remember her name, is played very poorly overall. The story is very pieced together, they never really spend any time developing the love story he just kind of immediately falls for her and thats pretty much it.

But in my case my disappointment with the movie was boosted even more because I happen to read Peter Mayle's book on my last holiday in France when we where traveling with our good French friends taking some rest from pretty intense year in an urbanized and impersonated place. I must admit, i didn't had enough patience to watch it carefully. The main reason was that everything shown in the movie was wrong from the way securities are traded to the essence of flirt. The movie offers the viewer to look at the world with the eyes of a man that lives the life where to get anything he needs to pay the money, to resolve any conflict he needs a lawyer and to win lady's hart he has to fight for it. Although at the end the main character is making very illogical for him gesture, he never actually gets out of his shell.

It is a very good film, dare I say ""great"" film, with excellent acting, casting, cinematography, directing, editing*, music, & writing. I'm a sucker for a good romance, but this film is more than a romantic comedy/drama.Maybe it's one of those films that has to ""grow on you"" (however, I liked it the first time I saw it) and its high qualities become more evident with each subsequent viewing. The cast & crew are chock-full of talent and now that Marion Cotillard has won so many ""Best"" acting awards, people may give A Good Year another look, as they explore her filmography. I hope so, for the viewer's sake and for the film's sake.Maybe the film did not do well because of the timing of its release. In San Diego, it screened the same time as the new blonde Bond was being introduced. Maybe the ""chick flick"" label frightened the men away and the Ridley Scott-Russell Crowe duo (which may conjure-up visions of blood, swords, & violence) frightened the women away.For whatever reasons the critics disliked- and the public didn't see- the film in the theaters, I think A Good Year deserves another look, a la DVD. Hopefully you'll enjoy the story and appreciate the lessons-learned, as well as the scenery and humor. If it doesn't ""hit you"" the first viewing, give it a second look. *There are a couple of glitches with continuity, but overall the editing is quite good, especially with all of the flashbacks.",A Good Year
216,lambechop,Better than a lot of RomComs but not brilliant!,8,27 February 2007,"It would be easy to go on about the fantastic photography, the fact that the French didn't like it, but that's all been said. Simply put this is a good, solid, well made film, the type they say they don't make any more. At the centre of the film is Crowe, who does the part well, having read the book and feeling a little disappointed in the character, Crowe brings it to life by not taking it too seriously. He doesn't 'burn up' the screen, but tends to settle into the role and allows the other actors room to play with what could be considered under written parts. Well may be not, this is after all a comedy, it's not a deep character study, don't come looking for one, this is just fun. Good looking fun. Ridley Scott is quoted at the start of the book as being one of the primary inspirations behind the story having been written, being a long time friend of Mayle. So when you hear that they don't make them like they used to, well they do, just watch it and enjoy!",A Good Year
217,DavidHPrice,Perfect,10,26 December 2006,"This movie is perfect. All aspects are so well crafted by everyone involved. Performances are brilliantly directed and creative. The cinematography is beautiful. Dody Dorn's editing style truly makes the film unique and tremendously fun. The range of the sound mix from subtle to extreme flows with the story perfectly. I was transported to France, and more importantly, into the characters. The attention to detail from all artists makes this the best film of the year. This movie has greatly inspired me and influenced the way look at film and life in a way I never thought possible from this genre. Sir Ridley Scott has made me (a man who only loves epics) chisel this film in as a favorite, and is a director to be honored and celebrated.",A Good Year
218,shubhojeet-kundu,'A Good Year' grows on you like a sublime Wine.,9,9 November 2011,"There are very few movies today which inspire you to enjoy the subtle and finer aspects of life. 'A Good Year' motivates you to see the aerial view of life. Ridley Scott has made an unintentional master piece which grows on you with each passing moment. The art direction and the over all atmosphere is amazing. It makes a subtle satire on the human craving for quick and more materialism. The sound track is great and perfectly supports each frame. French country sides have been framed in the best possible poetic manner. 'A Good Year' has much more substance than some of the suggested reviews. With some very natural acting, not only from Cotillard and Crowe but from every supporting caste this movie provides you the much needed comfort zone to relax and appreciate the phenomenon called life.This is a gem. And it will shine slowly.",A Good Year
219,magf,9,10,11 November 2006,"Thank you so much Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and company for a most delightful 2 hours. I guess I didn't watch the same movie as a lot of critics did but then I never do or very seldom do. I use to faithfully read the reviews when trying to figure out what to see but have been lied to and led astray by to many so I don't really read many now. They have sent me off to some of the most Godawful movies that I very seldom go at all now. I make up my own mind.I do make a point of going to all Russell Crowe movies as I know they will be high quality. Russell Crowe has wonderful comic timing and shows everything on that most expressive face of his and in his eyes. He doesn't miss a beat. Wonderful actor. Ridley Scott , magnificent director in bringing so many different worlds to us the lucky fans.Not all movies have to be Oscar bait! I highly recommend this movie to take you away from all the woes in this world.Again.......thanks Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.........job well done.",A Good Year
220,boofmunce,Quality,8,11 November 2006,"I enjoyed this movie, it had class and character with some lovely ladies. Also I enjoyed the London footage with the contrast against France. Crowe, I think did very well and I was surprised at the end because I didn't now it was a Ridley Scott movie. It would now be interesting to read the book to see how closely it is represented. All things seemed to fit, and it was evident in last encounter with Crowe and his French girl from the scene of when he was a boy at the pool. Great romantic portrayal of an English French relationship. The movie also maintained a good level of humour encased with good vocabulary. I had heard this was a good movie and am glad to able to cement that in words.",A Good Year
221,ribas-gh,I Love this Movie,9,12 May 2016,"Romance, Drama, English Man, French Woman, From London to French Provence, Between Banks and vineyard a total paradox! The movie is about dreams and memories from childhood that can turn out into unexpected way... But they stay the things that really matters and for which a person may really fight for! The cast is fantastic, Russell Crowe & Marion Cotillard are making a cute romance besides of other great stars and withing a sweet light comedy. I just Love this Movie !and I watched it several times, for me its inspiring, making me believe that every one can change his life and follow his dreams when it comes to find true love and the real meaning of life and happiness.",A Good Year
222,helenfmb-707-438379,I love this movie,10,16 August 2013,"I watched this film twice - thoroughly enjoying as a piece of first class entertainment - then I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes. I have no idea why it has only aggravated one star. I just doesn't make sense to me! Sometimes the critics blindly follow each other and get it quite wrong. They've got it wrong on this occasion. I've seen films that have two stars on Rotten Tomatoes and are truly awful. This film IS funny, it IS charming, it DOES give a true ""feel"" for the South of France, the locations are gorgeous, the soundtrack is great, and the performances are first-class. The young ""Max"" won a well deserved award for his debut rôle, and Russell Crowe shows his versatility by playing a character unlike any other I've seen him play - certainly with wit and humour (contrary to some of the critics opinions). The movie is peopled with all sorts of interesting characters (many of them French) and is by no means a conventional ""rom-com"". I highly recommend this film if you want a bit of uplifting and good-to-look-at entertainment.",A Good Year
223,stuart-731-231734,I wish this was my life....,10,13 May 2018,"Critics hate this movie and it has a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes... So What!It is a lovely movie filled with the beauty of life and what should be important but often isn't.. I truely wish my life was like this and thoroughly enjoyed escaping into this world for a while..Great performances, directing & production... It feels real and that for me is exactly what this type of movie should be..",A Good Year
224,Elektra20,Visually soothing yet not memorable,5,22 May 2009,"Despite being aware that this film was going to be predictable I expected more from it. Being certain that it would evoke the philosophy of wine, the picturesque life in French Provence and contrast the dilemma between a hectic agenda dictated by materialism and a soothing existence filled with childhood memories in a romantic vineyard, I was ready to be captivated. My expectations were soon pulverized by its facile approach to a promising subject for the deep thinker. It's appealing to the eye with simple characters being portrayed with a certain charm. The British and French cultural encounter is described with shallow humour and an instantaneous love story. Perfect before bedtime, setting your TV on sleep mode will do no harm.",A Good Year
225,abhinandanmahajan,a movie with all the adjectives falling for a right remark,9,24 February 2014,"Well, this movie may not be a top notch for critics as stars say.. but it isn't meant to please the acclaimed portals.. a splendid light movie with a superb village backgrounds.. amazing performances by all the actors and delightful background music that leaves a sine curve of violins and melodies enticing your senses long after they phase out.. would be disrespect if no words go for wine and food always a high note in peter mayle's writings.. with luscious green vineyards, glasses n plates always filled with red and inviting colors, taste buds surely push watcher rushing towards cellar and cork openers.. it truly pushes you to brink where you think is life all about shares and silicon valleys, sore bums over chairs and running tubes.. will not the emotional states run rich with dew strolls, birds' chirps, morning fog, unlaxing chairs and sun shines.. with visions of cobbled streets, distant chimney smokes, patinized structures and sun tanned cheeks.. that is what movie is all about and not the savages of correct facts and dumb nick wicks.. a beautiful movie with even better message leaving tints of absolving flavors in colonized souls..",A Good Year
226,frances-37,A very enjoyable film with lots of laughs and excellent performances.,8,5 November 2006,"A demographically mixed audience seemed to enjoy this film very much. The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra ""punch"" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love, trust, and friendships.A ""Great"" date movie. The local scenery should definitely be seen on the ""big"" screen and not on a DVD! Tho not ""Oscar"" caliber"" it is why most film goers go to the movies; pure entertainment and escapism. Ridley and Crowe have achieved that goal. A ""Great"" date movie and worth the price of admission",A Good Year

228,craig_oliver,Love this movie.,9,10 February 2019,"I first bought this on DVD, many years ago. On the sale rack. Sadly overlooked by many. One of my all time faves now with a great soundtrack.The cinematography is just beautiful. Both of London and Provence. It's light, romantic, and funny (in places). Other reviews talk about the film reminding you what is important in life (life over work), and I think this does this well, without be typically Hollywood about it.Hollander is brilliant. Best film I've seen Crowe in. And I think this may be the first film that I saw Cotillard in before she broke into the mainstream.I love it, and I would encourage you to watch it.",A Good Year
229,jwdahlheim,Perfect,10,2 February 2016,"I totally love this film. I always watch it when I am sad and after wards I am happy, so I am more than just a bit biased. To the movie, it starts really cool with showing how it is as banker in London and what a prick you need to be to actually make it in such a business. But then the longer you watch the more you get to know the person behind the banker Max Skinner and how important his uncle was. Its simply heartwarming. To the end it is just like a good movie or love movie should be. The music is so wonderful, the classical sound makes you feel like you are in France enjoying the summer, magnificent. As I said for me it is the go to movie if I had a bad day. I truly recommend it its worth watching!PS: this is my first rewiev sorry for the mistakes and bad English",A Good Year

When I feel lost or disconnected with my aspirational self, this film is the one I turn to. It's filled with many European qualities - qualities of thoughtfulness, empathy and complex simplicity as well as the aesthetic architecture.

233,martinoldsberg-1,Possible parody?,1,24 October 2010,"The only interesting thing about this film (in the tired genre ""Go-to- Provence/Tuscany-and-find-your-true-self"") is that it's done by Ridley Scott. Maybe even that isn't very interesting, but the man who directed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" will always prick up the ears of quite a number of people, expecting to see something at least vaguely resemblant of the talent in those films.""A good year"" is bad on such a level that you're waiting for a resolution that confirms your suspicion that this is a parody. However, that never comes. Instead we get low-level farcical characters and corresponding acting throughout the entire thing and nothing to seek comfort from: no hidden messages (or if so, I missed them), no f*** you signs indicating ""I'm playing tricks with you: of course I know that this is trite twaddle, but ..."". (I thought the speeded up shooting of Crowe's car in the roundabout would be the giveaway. Not so. That was ""funny"".) Even the dog -- normally solid actors in lousy pictures --is ludicrous.It's bewildering, but not of such an interest that one should waste an hour and a half of one's life watching it.If you honestly like this sort of thing then you are to be congratulated: there are thousands of films from the 20's and 30's in exactly this vein. Most of them better.",A Good Year
234,wecaz,Back to the old french town,8,27 October 2013,"I am talking first about the surroundings. I am impressed by the way how the French country side has been depicted in the movie. There are streets, houses and restaurants. We can feel the life. It has been quite different than the hustle of city life. The scenes are very soothing.Secondly, there are many smile moments. The timing is superb and it makes them natural. The scenes around the swimming pool are hilarious. Main characters are fully developed. We see them grow during the run of the movie. Marion Cotillard looks beautiful again. I wish there would be more usage of French dialogs. All in all, it is a good watch.",A Good Year
235,TheMentalKid,"Not a good movie, but a grand one.",9,19 August 2007,"A Good Year is about a man and his journey to find, not himself exactly; but more where he belongs. Max Skinner is an investment broker, (and a good one at that.) After success at work, we find out that his uncle Henry has passed on, leaving Max his château and vineyard in Provence. We also find out that this particular place holds much sentimental value to Max, as this place contains the best memories of his childhood. But alas, our character (played by Russell Crowe) refuses to let that factor sway his decision from putting the estate on the market as soon as possible. But happiness, relations, memories and love ensures and Max finds himself questioning his decision on selling... A materialist, emotionless England? Or, a heart-wrenchingly beautiful château, vineyard and lady, (Marion Cotillard) in Provence?A Good Year has had a mixed critical response; and thus I believe it is one of those movies where you yourself have to watch and make up your own opinion on. Here is mine: It was a truly moving film. With a soundtrack that melds perfectly, beautiful cinematography, superb acting (and accents) and brilliant directing... A Good Year couldn't have been grander. The script, however, left more to be desired. It isn't a life-changing movie (unless the scenery compels you to make a move to France), but I wasn't after that. Instead, I was delivered a light, romantic dramedy, and to say I liked it would be an understatement. I saw this whilst on a plane, after 5hr wait, from Singapore to Japan! Cheers!",A Good Year

Big city in Great Britain, where the main character controls stock trading and he never has a free time, because he doesn't want to loose his lucrative job.There is also countryside in France, where people lives their peaceful life, grows grapes and produces vine.Movie like this could been extremely boring and sterile, but the director made it the way, that you will like and you won't die from boredom.This movie was also flavored by some jokes, which is also good :)",A Good Year
