0,TheLittleSongbird,"Book fans may be underwhelmed, but Tim Burton fans will be spoiled",7,2 October 2016,"'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' is not one of Tim Burton's best films, with 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' being two of my all-time favourite films, and still get much enjoyment out of 'Beetlejuice', 'Sleepy Hollow' and his 'Batman' films.It is however one of his better films since 'Big Fish' along with 'Frankenweenie' and 'Sweeney Todd'. Much better than 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Dark Shadows' (as well as his worst film 'Planet of the Apes') at any rate. As an adaptation of the book, which is excellent by the way, 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' is not a good adaptation, in fact as said it is a poor one, but as none of Burton's source-material-to-film adaptations are faithful treatments of their source material this was to be expected.On the other hand, 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' has a lot to recommend on its own terms, which is in all honesty a much fairer way to judge. It is patchy yes, but it to me was often very enjoyable and got the feeling that Burton is regaining his touch. Starting with the problems, some of the first half, while setting the scene and the context of the story very well, did feel jumpy and rushed and things are left a bit too vague and hanging out in the open without explanation. The editing, again in the first half, felt on the disorganised side.Asa Butterfield has been criticised. Personal feelings were mixed regarding his performance, he looks the part but has a tendency to be stiff and not as emotionally involved as he should be. This said, this was always going to be a potential problem due to how the character is written, with much of his dialogue being internalised. Judi Dench and Chris O'Dowd (who should not have attempted the accent because it did not suit him at all) are squandered in their roles.Conversely, 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' looks fantastic, with lots of sheer beauty and a Gothic touch (unmistakable Burton visual style really). The special effects are also very good, especially in the climax like the 'Jason and the Argonauts'-like skeletons, while the film is exquisitely photographed. The music is fitting, with a moody gloom but also pathos, but no themes that stand out as unforgettable (like much of Danny Elfman's score for 'Edward Scissorhands' or Howard Shore's opening theme for 'Ed Wood').The script is playful yet sincere, exploring death and grief sensitively but with a darkness without being traumatising. Sure, some of the film is spooky but not in a way that will make parents outrage about unsuitability for their children (a very old IMDb and internet cliché that has become overused and extremely irritating). While there are problems with the story in the first half, the second half is deliciously dark, forebodingly gloomy, impishly humorous and poignant. There are memorable scenes here, such as the bombing, the chemistry between the two young characters and especially the thrilling climax.Burton's style is unmistakable in its Gothic darkness, impish humour and in-your-face weirdness but not in a way that distracts from the storytelling, instead adding to it (unlike a few of his films in recent years), with an otherworldly atmosphere and spine-tingling thrills. Not all the performances completely work, but most of the cast come off very well. Top honours goes to a fabulous Eva Green, and Terence Stamp is always great value and sterling support. Ella Purnell is very affecting too, while Samuel L. Jackson is campy fun as the antagonist (not a necessary character necessarily but a comedic touch here and there did bring some levity to the predominant darkness and emotional wallop).On the whole, patchy but very enjoyable taking it on its own merits. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
1,Leofwine_draca,"Watchable, but weak",5,18 August 2019,"Tim Burton's latest is another family-friendly gothic adventure full of CGI effects and a tiresome plot involving stereotypical villains and their monster minions with murder in mind. It's based on a novel which appears to go out of its way to copy bits and pieces of HARRY POTTER, X-MEN and the like to tell of a children's home occupied by kids with mutant powers. Jane Goldman did the script, and critics might feel she's working on autopilot here.This is a watchable film with plenty of visual flourishes, but it does feel like Burton is trading on past glories. Established actors like Rupert Everett, Eva Green and Judi Dench are all given very little to do in order to make way for the CGI spectacle. The effects are generally good, although there's very little we haven't seen before. The JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS-inspired set-piece is my favourite moment. Asa Butterfield's hero is as weak and vapid as the actor was in HUGO, with Ella Purnell stealing all of her scenes in a sensitive performance, even if Burton has made her up to look like Christina Ricci in SLEEPY HOLLOW for some reason.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
2,SnoopyStyle,inventive world,6,9 November 2016,"Jake (Asa Butterfield) is an outsider Florida teen. His grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp) used to babysit him telling him about Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) who ran a home for peculiar children in WWII Wales. Now, Abe is believed to have dementia battling non-existent monsters. With his dying words, Abe tells Jake to go to the Loop and September 3, 1943. Jake and his father Franklin (Chris O'Dowd) travel to Cairnholm in Wales on the advise of psychiatrist Dr. Golan (Allison Janney). Jake goes to see the children's home to find it ruined after getting bombed by the German on that 1943 night. He encounters the peculiar children who take him through a cave and back to that 1943 day. Miss Peregrine had created a time loop on that day for her children to live. They are hunted by Mr. Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) and the other Hollows. They eat the children's eyes to keep some aspects of their humanity while other Hollows have turned into roving monsters. Miss Avocet (Judi Dench) is a Ymbryne like Miss Peregrine who can transform into birds and save peculiar children in their time loops. Mr. Barron experiments on them to find immortality. He had found Avocet and consumed her children.This is an imaginative world from the book and the vision of director Tim Burton. The story is a bit too jam packed. There are a lot of exposition scenes. There is a big important one to start the second half. I can't help but wonder if it's enough for the children to battle one monster as a first movie. The sequels could explain everything afterwards. It would be much simpler and more compelling. When the first monster invades the children's home, it is horrifying. It is as scary as a traditional horror movie. The eye eating scene is creepier than many horror-porns. The monster seems unbeatable but then this idea changes. The children with their powers seems perfectly capable of defeating the Hollows which puts the whole idea of the scary invincible monsters into question. This is a terrific world coupling Harry Potter and X-Men that Burton has envisioned. The story does have some deficiencies.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
3,Horst_In_Translation,A relatively simple movie that is well-executed,6,4 August 2017,"""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is an American 2016 film and at this point the most recent release by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Tim Burton. This 2-hour film is based on a book by Ransom Riggs and Jane Goldman was in charge of the screenplay. The first-billed cast member is Eva Green, but the central character is played by Asa Butterfield that many of you have seen in Scorsese's ""Hugo"". Anyway back to this one here: As pretty much always with Burton, the fantasy is at the core of it all, but there is also a pretty realistic perspective and somehow with his approach Burton managed to turn squirrels and all kinds of birds into something magical, perhaps shows how fantastic they are without us even recognizing. Green did a fairly good job too I would say but I like her in almost everything, so I am a bit biased here. Same for Samuel L. Jackson, who is fun as always and the looks are also quite memorable, like a sinister Don King almost. Sadly despite a nice introduction, his villain character never gets as good as he could have. Quite a shame. And Judi Dench is in it too, but she is really wasted unfortunately in here. I wished her character could get at least a plot twist or anything at the end and we find out she is in fact evil, but nope. There are more known names in here, but the only one I want to mention really is Terence Stamp because I like him quite a bit and he is pretty decent too.Back to the title of my review, I think there is a clean structure here. First we are introduced to the protagonist, his mannerisms, his family, his struggles etc. Then we are introduced to the location in the film's title, the house where most of the crucial action plays, and all the characters living in there and finally there is the major conflict with the antagonist played by SLJ and lots of danger and action in general. Sadly, I would say this 3rd part is perhaps when the film was at its weakest as it seemed a bit to me as if they sacrificed a bit of the clean structure and compelling writing for entertainment purposes and I cannot approve of that. Had they kept the original level, I might have given it an even higher rating. While Jackson sure looked scary, I never felt the danger aspect as his henchmen were almost nonexistent in terms of both screen time and impact on the story. It's all Jackson and as we see his character stumble through the picture, it becomes obvious Burton as always made the antagonist look rather weird than pure evil, also in terms of his actions, so they would not lose the younger audiences. But they may lose many of the adults, including myself as the character was written horribly and never seems up to the challenge despite a great actor like Jackson and also the menacing looks.As a whole, there are certainly some big flaws with this film, but there are even more convincing moments in terms of acting, writing, character development and the plot in general. It's certainly one of 2016's finest in terms of fantasy. I urge you to see it and I m really sad they messed up so hard in the last third of the film. Final note: Great use of Run Rabbit Run, at least as good as in Get Out.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
4,Prismark10,Too muddled for muggles,6,29 October 2017,"Tim Burton brings his distinctive visual style and homages. He gets an eye catching performance from Eva Green as Miss Peregrine. However the story fails to gel, it is not without interest but the ending comes across as contrived, even nonsensical.Jake (Asa Butterfield) is a kid living a dull life in Florida. He was brought up believing his grandfather's (Terence Stamp) tall tales.When he finds his grandfather dead one evening with his eyes missing, Jake ends up visiting Wales to a children's home his grandfather talked about.What Jake finds his a home stuck in a time loop in 1943, children with special abilities but they are also in danger as another entity has been following Jake who also discovers his own special abilities.It is good that Burton has avoided casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter in this movie. However despite the striking visuals, Jake is too bland as a hero, the film lacks excitement and fun. The plot is too muddled. It was aiming to give that Harry Potter vibe but fails.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
5,mark.waltz,Too much of a vile thing creates bile.,3,2 November 2017,"Seemingly determined to copy every idea he had utilized in his early classic films, the overly creative Tim Burton shoves too much together in this overlong fantasy that is high on technical achievements and low on taste. He's replaced substance and exposition with style and effects, overdoing the grossness and taking away the subtle class that made his early films completely charming. Young Jake great up with his grandfather (Terence Stamp) sharing adventurous tall tales with him, and when the old man drops dead, finds himself living them. That part of the story I can completely relate to, and while the idea is nice, the execution behind it is way off balance.The carved shrubbery from ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the bizarre monsters from ""Beetlujuice"" are utilized in various ways, but the creatures are disgusting, as are other various elements of the film. Pirate like skeletons ripped straight out of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" make this Burton's ripping off himself. It's obvious to me that Eva Green's character was meant for Helena Bonham Carter, and that other Burton regulars were replaced as well in their archetypal roles. Samuel Jackson is actually made up to resemble Beetlujuice and isn't nearly as amusing. Judi Dench gives her all as the ghost of Jake's grandmother, but is outshouted by the noisy effects. By the time this was over, I had a huge migraine.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
6,claudio_carvalho,Delightful Original Adventure,8,15 November 2016,"Jake (Asa Butterfield) is an outcast teenager that adores his grandfather Abraham 'Abe' Portman (Terence Stamp) that used to tell stories of the orphanage in Wales where he was raised to him. When Abe is murdered in his house in Florida and has his eyes removes, Jake sees a monster and his parents take him to a psychologist. Jake asks to go to Wales to visit the orphanage and his psychologist agrees. His father Franklin Portman (Chris O'Dowd) travels with him to Wales and Jake discovers that the orphanage was bombed in 1943 by the Germans. When he decides to visit the ruins of the orphanage again, Abe finds a girl and soon he learns that the orphanage, the headmaster Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) and the children still exist trapped in a time loop. But they are in danger since monsters are hunting them down. And Jake has the gift of seeing monsters. What will Jake do?""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is a delightful original adventure directed by Tim Burton. The fantasy is a sort of X-Men and is highly entertaining with lovely characters and evil villains. Despite the confused idea of time loops, the film entertains adults and children. My vote is eight.Title (Brzil):""O Orfanato da Srta. Peregrine Para Crianças Peculiares"" (""The Orphanage of Miss Peregrine for Peculiar Children"")",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
7,nogodnomasters,But I am ordinary,9,22 September 2017,"Jake (Asa Butterfield) is left clues to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The mystery unfolds slowly to him and to us. He is pursued by Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) a shape shifter. The film becomes a combination of Harry Potter, X-men, and Ground Hog's Day plus Tim Buton's creepy effects.This is an adventure tale that takes a good hour or so to develop, however that is not to say we are not entertained along the way. Part of the thrill is making the discovery with Jake, which is why I say so little about the plot.Guide: The US rating is PG-13. There is no swearing or anything sexual...but all great stories are love stories. SPOILER ALERT There are monsters and there is eye gauging. People are seen without eyes and eyes are being eaten. I would consider the film suitable for any kid who already watches horror films.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
8,kosmasp,Peculiar or not?,7,15 June 2017,"I haven't read the books, so I can't talk about the differences at length. I read a comment from another reviewer who is furious about the movie, because of all the changes. You have to remember when a beloved book gets made into a film, it's almost impossible it'll meet what you had made of it in your mind.Also as this is limited (running time mostly), it won't have everything the book had. Even Peter Jacksons adaptations could not have everything Tolkien had written in his book (at least not in the version that was running in the cinemas). Having said all that I hope this prepares you in case you do want to watch this. This is light and fun (with dark themes of course) and aimed to our inner and outer child. It does a good enough job taking us away and entertain us. That's good enough in my book (no pun intended)",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
9,Sleepin_Dragon,A little disappointed in this.,5,15 October 2016,"A typically bizarre film from Tim Burton, one which showcases his vast capacity for imagination, the weird and wonderful. There were some very good elements, some of his creations were cleverly drawn and well realised, a dark film in some ways, too dark for some younger viewers. I loved the scenes in Wales and Blackpool, places not normally seen on the big screen. Some fantastic special effects as you would expect. The main problem I found with it, is haven't we been here before so many times. The stereotypical female character, dressed in black with a quirk, the only significance is that she was played by Eva Green and not Helena Bonham Carter. Not to say Green wasn't good in the role, I just feel she's a better actress then this. Dame Judi Dench was woefully underused, Was Butterfield lacked a little bit of sparkle and charisma as the lead.Imaginative,fun, just instantly forgettable. 5/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
10,classicsoncall,"""As I was saying, some people are peculiar.""",8,2 March 2017,"I'm surprised at the relatively low rating for this picture, 6.8 as I write this, and not quite a year since it's original release date. The story has some of the magical qualities of the Harry Potter series, and the fanciful whimsy of Burton's own ""Big Fish"" and going back even earlier, ""Edward Scissorhands"". After reading some of the negative reviews on this board, I chalk that up to the film's uneven treatment of the series of books on which the movie was based. I'm not familiar with them myself, so I imagine my own rating would have been lower if I was invested in the story and the characters. On the face of it though, I liked the imagination and creativity put into the characters of the peculiar children in the story, and the time loop element was rather unique as well. The acting seemed a little stiff though, it probably would have helped if there were more humorous interactions between the players. The business of the Hollows consuming human eyes to attain humanity and immortality was a bit grim, but on the flip side, the special effects involved were fairly imaginative, particularly during the skeleton battle against the monsters. So all in all I wasn't put off like a lot of viewers seemed to be, and the movie seems to be a pretty good candidate to watch with one's family so the kiddies can get a look at a whimsical adventure that can fire up their own imagination.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
11,lee_eisenberg,We're not the same (or are we?),7,7 February 2017,"First, I should admit that I've never read the book on which ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is based. I had never even heard of it until the movie got released. I understand that the movie changed some things, but on its own, it's a fun movie. After an unusual turn with ""Big Eyes"" (one of his best movies), Tim Burton returns to focusing on misfits with this one.I saw connections to some of Burton's previous movies. There's the issue of the veracity of an elder's stories (Big Fish) and the role that the ""strange"" people can play in stopping a potential threat (Beetlejuice). But more than anything, it's a nice, enjoyable movie. Criticism that I read was the casting of Samuel L. Jackson - the only non-white cast member - as the villain. Maybe so, but he's the sort of person who can make any character cool (and he doesn't even have to use the word that he tends to use in every role). I'd like to eventually read the book.Not a great movie, but fun.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
12,jboothmillard,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,6,27 October 2016,"I saw the trailer for this film, based on the novel by Ransom Riggs, it looked good, and I got particularly excited that it was by director directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), written by Jane Goldman (Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class). Basically Abraham ""Abe"" Portman (Terence Stamp) has told his grandson Jacob ""Jake"" Portman (Hugo's Asa Butterfield) stories for years, about his childhood during World War II spent at ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" on the coast of Wales. Jake gets a frantic phone call from his grandfather, he and his drugstore co-worker Shelley (O-Lan Jones) rush to his house, Jake finds Abe in the woods behind the house, he tells Jake to find ""the bird, the loop and September 3, 1943"", then he dies. Following advice from his psychiatrist Dr. Golan (Allison Janney), Jake and his father Franklin (The IT Crowd's Chris O'Dowd) travel to Wales to find the children's home of his grandfather's stories, but he and his father find it was destroyed in a Nazi bombing during the war. The next day, Jake returns to the destroyed house, he is greeted by some of the Peculiar Children, they take him through a cave on the coast, this is in fact a portal going back in time to 1943, there Jake is taken to Miss Peregrine's Home, headmistress Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine (Eva Green) and the residents, the ""Peculiars"", possess unique abilities. Miss Peregrine can transform into a peregrine falcon and manipulate time; teenager Emma Bloom (Ella Purnell) is aerokinetic, she is lighter than air, so wears lead shoes or a tether to stop herself floating away, she can manipulate air and create bubbles underwater; and teenager Enoch O'Conner (Finlay MacMillan) can resurrect the dead and bring life to inanimate objects. Other Peculiars include pyrokinetic (fire emitting) teenager Olive Abroholos Elephanta (Lauren McCrostie); invisible boy Millard Nullings (Cameron King); super-strong young girl Bronwyn Bruntley (Pixie Davies); young girl Fiona Fruanfeld (Georgia Pemberton) who can control and maintain plants; young boy Hugh Apiston (Milo Parker) who has bees in his stomach; cute young girl Claire Densmore (Raffiella Chapman) with an extra sharped- toothed mouth on the back of her head; stylish boy Horace Somnusson (Hayden Keeler-Stone) who through a monocle can project his dreams; and the masked Twins (Joseph Odwell and Thomas Odwell) who later reveal themselves as gorgons (turning people to stone by their gaze). Miss Peregrine explains that she is part of a class of Peculiars known as ""Ymbrynes"" , she also explains her manipulation of time, a time loop, she has her time loop permanently set on September 3, 1943, the day of the bombing, she can rewind time back 24 hours, so she and the children can live, never ageing and hiding from the outside world forever. Jake finds out that he is also a Peculiar, with the ability to see monsters invisible to everyone else, these monsters are former Peculiar humans transformed by a failed experiment, they are now ""Hollowgasts"" (or ""Hollows""), led by shapeshifter Mr. Barron (Samuel L. Jackson), they hunt for Peculiars to eat their eyeballs, enough to become visible, but with glowing white eyes. Jake discovers in a letter from Abe that Barron is stalking a time loop in Blackpool, England in 2016, at a seaside carnival, created by Miss Esmeralda Avocet (Dame Judi Dench), who can transform into an avocet bird; Barron raided the loop and killed Avocet's children and is trying to repeat his experiment with even more Ymbrynes. Returned to 2016, Jake realises a hallow is close to finding the home, he goes to warn his new friends, but he is followed by a visitor on the island, an ornithologist named John Lemmon (Rupert Everett), in fact it is Barron in disguise, he also reveals he disguised himself as Dr. Golan. Barron reveals he tried to find the home previously, by getting information from Abe, but his Hollow companion knocked him out before he could answer, as Dr. Golan he encouraged Jake to come to the island, in hope to guide him to the time loop, with Jake as his hostage Barron is able to force Miss Peregrine to come with him. The children, Jake and Miss Avocet are left behind, Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape, just as the raid bomb drops, killing Malthus, meaning that Abe will not die in the future, it also means that the time loop is closed, leaving Jake and the children in 1943. Emma uses her ability to raise a sunken ship from the bottom of the ocean so that they can travel to Blackpool and rescue Miss Peregrine, they find the time loop on Blackpool Pier and travel to the future, where they use their abilities to fight the Hollows. Barron's Hollow and Wight accomplices are killed, Jake frees Miss Peregrine and other captured Ymbrynes, Barron disguises himself as Jake to confuse the children, but the last remaining Hollow arrives, Barron is unable to see it, so is killed, Jake then kills the Hollow after his death. In the end, Jake says goodbye to the children and returns to the present day in Florida, where Abe is alive and well, he gives him a map to other time loops, and over time periods Jake is eventually able to find his way back to love interest Emma and the children. Also starring Kim Dickens as Jake's Mom and Louis Davison as Victor Bruntley. Butterfield, Green, Jackson and the other cast members do well, the story and plot is just about understandable, and the special effects and weirdness of the whole thing are what you'd expect from Burton, it is a worthwhile dark fantasy.

13,Quinoa1984,"a welcome return to Burton's light-and-twisted cinematic tableau, with some caveats",7,30 September 2016,"The 'defense' I'd use for Tim Burton's return to the world of misfit outsiders in the realm of fantasy (I can almost hear MJ about the break out into ""Remember the Time"" with a flash-cut to Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, even Sleepy Hollow to a degree), if it does need to be defended (and I think it does slightly), is that this is the director appealing emotionally to the audience and doing it well. Does this mean that every moment is logically sound? No, it does not mean that, so maybe the movie doesn't conform to the old Narrative Triangle where we got the ethos-pathos-logos thing going. But I'd rather have Burton be on fire making a MAJOR work (which I think this is to an extent) bringing his creepy and intentionally deranged visual sense and getting that right, not to mention most of the humor, than to see him slumping all around or relying on CG.In this story that you certainly have seen before in some form or another (whether it's through seeing some other YA novel turned to the screen or, let's see for comparison, of course X-Men can't be avoided and I'll get back to that, but also Addams Family and, oddly enough, Inception), as a young person discovers through a family connection that there is *another world*. Of course he has known this since he was little - I really enjoy the framing here, though I had to put some thought into this being what the movie actually is like, of a grandpa telling a child a story about his weird little friends with these strange 'abilities' as a bedtime story, as told by Terrence Stamp - but put it out of his mind once it became time for Children to Put Away Childish Things(TM).But when Grandpa dies due to something rather spooktacular, Jake decides to look into it, and it leads him to Wales where he discovers through a ""loop"" (like time-wise) the world of Miss Peregrine's Home for Pectuliar Children resides in September of 1943, on the day leading up to when the home will be bombed by enemy fire. So we get to see this host of 'Peculiars' as they're called, and naturally the feeling is that this will be akin to when we get to ""Xavier's School"" in X-Men - certainly, for some reason (call it writer's intuition, or unintentional homage/the usual thing with YA stories), the dynamic between Jake, Emma (the girl who can fly if not tethered to the ground), a boy with a jealous/angry face all the time who can implant hearts into things and make them move, reminds us of Wolverine/Jean Grey/Cyclops. A little.But the difference here is that they aren't being trained to fight (then again neither were those at Xavier's school in theory), but are being targeted by dastardly creatures (a scenery-garbage-compactor with Samuel L. Jackson, one of my favorite things about the movie overall), and have to find a way to survive and fight back. So there's a lot to this story, and one of the things I noticed was much more exposition than in other Tim Burton movies; you may get some in Beetlejuice from the 'old times', but only just enough to get you by. Here, it seems like there are a myriad of rules when it comes to these 'loops' and who can see the peculiars and especially in the third act things become complicated. As far as the 'plot' goes, it's often messy, stuffed, even at two hours it's crammed in with information that, if you haven't read the book, I'm sure will leave you questions. It certainly did me. And as one more knock, Asa Butterfield is one note (not altogether terrible, just stiff) as the lead, which leaves it to everyone else to pick up the slack - which, to be fair, many of them can and do. Also, Chris O'Dowd is wasted (such as the parents seem to be in this story).So why recommend it? Because, especially for the first two thirds, it feels richer in texture, style and in how the actors relate together and the emotional context of things comes out than I've seen in a fantasy film from Burton in a long time. And on its own it works as as a delightful and often dark-for-kids (as it should be) story of overcoming fears and that feeling of being 'different' as a mark against someone. Even in that messy third act where the story hurdles along, there's always something new or exciting visually, a creation or bunch of characters (including an homage to Jason and the Argonauts!) that kept me engaged and entertained. I keep thinking that if I wasn't such a ""critic"" and enjoyed it as a casual movie-goer I'd like it even more-so. I can't help but see flaws in it, but it doesn't keep me from wanting others to see it and discover it for themselves.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I hadn't read the book but so what, I haven't read the book of most movies based upon books and I still enjoyed them.I struggled to find this movie enjoyable. To begin with the acting seemed forced and mechanical. But even putting the acting aside I faced another problem. What is going on? In their efforts to get us from the exposition to the climax to the end I felt rushed like I was on the final round of Family Feud. There was no fluidity. There was no real link from one action to another. I know I have the problem of trying to insert logic into movies and it tends to only frustrate me. There were a lot of inconsistencies and they were only increased with the introduction of ""the loop"" (a temporal loop created by the inbreens (sp) to protect the peculiar children). Don't ever put a temporal loop in your movie unless you're ready to deal with a host of paradoxes.I was frustrated with the plot, frustrated with the inconsistencies and frustrated with absence of answers. One thing this movie did do for me though, it gave me a keen interest in reading the book just to know what really happened.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Asked to sort out a movie for them to watch,I remembered seeing enchanting clips for a Fantasy Steam Punk movie, (genres which her son is a fan of) which led to me finding out how peculiar these children could be.The plot:Being close to him during childhood,Jake would hear stories from his uncle Abe about spending time with at Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,and joining Peregrine and her children in fighting monsters during WWII. Going to visit Abe,Jake finds him with his eyes missing,and is told by Abe in his dying breath that he must go and find Pergerine in WWII. Convincing his dad Franklin to take him to where Abe claims the Home is,Jake finds himself entering a peculiar time loop.View on the film:Crossing the hands of time between 2016 and 1943,director Tim Burton & cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel unwrap a delicious blend of dark Fantasy and ultra-stylised Stream Punk. Entering Peregrine's Home,Burton decorates the surroundings with lush candle wax Gothic colours giving the playful skills of Peregrine's Children an underlying atmosphere of horror. Crossing swords with a great Ray Harryhausen tribute,Burton links his Gothic cool with a startling Steam Punk edge,lit by the slo-mo bombs of WWII,and welded by Burton using the ""out of time"" Blackpool Tower to give the flight of fantasy a metallic shine.Turning time in adapting Ransom Riggs's book to a swift 2 hours,the screenplay by Jane Goldman opens up its own loops in time,via being rather vague on the passage of time,and Franklin just being forgotten about! While these flaws do glare,Goldman sweeps over them with delightful dips focusing on the ""peculiar"" aspects of Burton's outcasts,and the mix of Fantasy and Steam Punk allowing Goldman to tie a ship sailing romance with a sharply bitter,eye-gauging dark Fantasy.

18,FlashCallahan,And a mint for you.....,2,30 October 2016,"After a family tragedy, a boy named Jake follows a series of clues that lead him to a mysterious orphanage on a remote Welsh island. There, he discovers a community of children with unusual abilities, and learns he is destined to protect them......Burton has a distinct eye for his wonderfully steam punk/Gothic tastes when it comes to making a film, so this should have been a match made in heaven when this landed on his desk.But apart from the wonderfully odd characters that roam the world of Burton, this falls flat, and sadly it fails miserably.Butterfield must think he has a curse on him because with Enders Game and this, he's a franchise killer. It looks wonderful, but special effects alone do not make a film, and why does O' Dowd have to have an American accent? I haven't read the source material, but surely they could have tweaked something somewhere.I was expecting something beyond the bizarre, harking back to the like of Beetlejuice with a hint of Barker via Nightbreed, but instead I got a mix of The Golden Compass and A Series Of Unfortunate Events: At Blackpool Pleasure Beach.And because I'm so used to seeing Burton Regulars I couldn't help but keep comparing Green to Bonham-Carter (even though she is wonderful), and Depp in the Jackson role, because we all know by now, Burton brings the best out in Depp.I will go back to it one day, I may change my opinion, but for now, it's one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
19,trashgang,A bit too childish,6,13 November 2016,"I do watch and follow Tim Burton's flicks closely but this time I didn't like it at all. I can't say that I was attracted to the flick at all especially the first hour of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.Even as most reviews are positive for me it was a bit too much of blah blah going on and not liking the character of Miss Peregrine. Was it Eva Greens fault, I don't know, but for me she was doing what she's always doing nothing more nothing less. On part of the effects I can't say a negative notice but just what I have seen at the theatre was weird. It was a full house and sometimes people were laughing it out. For example the huge monster being shot and falling exactly were it should fall, into the era done at a crime scene.I didn't laugh at all. Some things were okay with the creatures and especially Barron (Samual L Jackson) I did like and had the Burton touch. He was creepy and full of satire.But it's made based on a book for children and it showed. Dark Shadows (2012) was a bit of the same. I guess for me Tim's flicks do work when they are animated like Frankenweenie (2012) and of course the cult classic The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), written by Tim.But who am I not liking it, so many did. Seen the advertising at the theatre weeks before release it all looked stunning and I became peculiar but have seen the flick, not for me this time.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0,5/5",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
20,christopher-underwood,it really doesn't seem to matter whether you believe or not,7,8 January 2018,"Watched this with one of my granddaughters and rather enjoyed it. I have never been particularly drawn to the world of Tim Burton but have to confess that here he displays a considerable hold over a seemingly disparate cast whilst always ensuring that the picture looked good. The beginning was intriguing, mysterious and involving. It was also well paced and we seemed to race into picture that I had feared I might sleep through. No fear of that, even if it does lapse a little in the middle, we are soon up and running for a resounding finale. My main trouble was when the film decided to take the absurd plot, time loops and all, seriously. Here I found myself glazing over and wondering if the young lady with me was following it. No worries it really doesn't seem to matter whether you believe or not, the characters are appealing, what they do amusing and it all makes for a truly exciting conclusion.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Somewhere near the middle, somehow it changed into a comedy for children, with over talkative bad guys and quirky battles. It didn't even make sense near the end.I can only imagine Tim Burton had an idea that was dark and filled with horror, but also hope and pride in the main characters, while the studios imagined something like the Three Stooges with puppets and this is the result. There is no other explanation for the incongruity of the script and plot.Eva Green was actually brilliant in her role, the rest quite average. The special effects were average as well, despite their ambitious scale.Bottom line: a desperate clone of the Harry Potter movies, with clear issues in story telling. Tim Burton must regret his decision to accept to direct this.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
22,JamesHitchcock,Harry Potter Meets the X-Men,7,28 October 2016,"Jake Portman is a troubled Florida teenager, who becomes even more disturbed when his beloved grandfather Abe is brutally murdered. On the advice of Jake's psychiatrist, his father Franklin takes him to the island off the coast of Wales where Abe spent part of his childhood in a strange children's home. When they get there they discover that the home is now a ruin, having been destroyed by a German bomb in 1943, but Jake finds that by entering a cave on the island he can travel back in time to the period when the building still existed.When I saw this film in the cinema recently, I was surprised to learn that it is actually based on a novel, because it seemed to me that Tim Burton had simply concocted a story by combining elements from two successful film franchises, ""Harry Potter"" and the ""X-Men"". (The part played in the story by a sunken liner also recalls ""Titanic""). From the X-Men franchise we have the idea of a community of humans with superhuman powers (called ""mutants"" there, ""peculiars"" here) who are feared and hated by normal people, from whom they often need protection. From the Harry Potter films we have the idea of children with special powers in a boarding-school setting, with Jake standing in for Harry, the home as a smaller version of Hogwarts and its headmistress, Miss Alma Peregrine, as a younger, sexier, female equivalent of Albus Dumbledore. (Note the similarity of her forename and his). From both franchises (and various other films involving witches, wizards and superheroes) comes the idea of beings with special powers who can use those powers for either good or evil. Barron, the chief of the evil peculiars, corresponds to Voldemort in ""Harry Potter"" or Magneto in the ""X-Men"".The most original feature of this story is the idea of the ""loop"". Miss Peregrine belongs to a special class of peculiar known as ""Ymbrynes"". ""Ymbrynes"" have two special powers. They can transform themselves into a bird- in Miss Peregrine's case a peregrine falcon, hence her name- and they can manipulate time. Only Ymbrynes can create a loop, an area of space-time in which it is always the same date and into which non-peculiars cannot enter. Peculiars make use of loops in order to take shelter from the outside world, which makes Ymbrynes particularly valuable in the peculiar community. (Peculiars in general can be of either sex, but Ymbrynes are always female; we meet another one, Miss Avocet, in this film).It will come as no surprise to learn that Jake himself is a ""peculiar"", as was Abe. (Franklin, however, is not a peculiar; the condition can skip a generation). He is therefore able to enter into the loop, travel back to a world where it is always 3rd September 1943 (the day before the home was destroyed) and meet Miss Peregrine and her charges, a group of children and young people who all have some peculiar power. He discovers, among others, a girl as light as air, an invisible boy and a girl who can control the growth of plants.He also discovers, however, that the seemingly tranquil world of the Home for Peculiar Children is threatened by the same dark forces that killed his grandfather and that he has a vital role to play in the fight against these forces. Another thing this film has in common with ""Harry Potter"" is an implied parallel between the evil characters and the Nazis; if anything that parallel is even stronger here. We learn that Abe is neither British nor American by birth, but Polish, and escaped to Wales from Poland in the early forties. The name of the monsters in the story, ""hollowgast"", seems deliberately coined to evoke the word ""holocaust"".In this year of grace 2016, films about children or teenagers transported to a fantasy world and caught up in a desperate good-against-evil struggle no longer seem particularly original. ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is one of a number of attempts to repeat the success of the Potter format. ""The Golden Compass"" and the three ""Narnia"" films were not too bad- indeed, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was excellent- but it is noteworthy that no film has been made of the other two entries in Philip Pullman's trilogy and that the ""Narnia"" franchise ran out of steam after three out of seven books. Some films of this nature, however, ""The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising"" being a case in point, have been frankly dreadful.""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is not as good as ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", but it is at least as good as the other films mentioned above, and far better than ""The Seeker"". The acting is not particularly memorable, with the exception of Eva Green's Miss Peregrine, but what lifts it above the ordinary is Tim Burton's highly developed visual imagination, bringing the Home and its Peculiar inmates vividly to life and creating a strange, dreamlike world for his characters to live in. 7/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
23,Hellmant,Definitely doesn't live up to Tim Burton's best (in the slightest).,7,5 October 2016,"'MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tim Burton's new dark fantasy adventure, based on the 2011 young adult novel (of the same name) by Ransom Riggs. Burton directed the film, and Jane Goldman (a frequent writing collaborator of director Matthew Vaughn) wrote the screenplay. It tells the story of a boy that travels to a mysterious orphanage (on a Welsh island), after his grandfather is horrifically killed, that's filled with peculiar (but very gifted) children. The film stars Eva Green, Asa Butterfield, Ella Purnell, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris O'Dowd, Terence Stamp, Judi Dench and Allison Janney. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it underperformed at the Box Office (due to it's $110 million budget). I enjoyed it, but it definitely doesn't live up to Tim Burton's best (in the slightest). Jake's grandfather, Abraham (Stamp), has been telling Jacob (Butterfield) stories about a magical place, filled with kids with special powers, since he was a very young boy. He also told him about vicious monsters with tentacles, that Abraham had to fight (as a child), and a beautiful headmistress, named Miss Peregrine (Green), that watched over the gifted children. Miss Peregrine is a Ymbryne, according to Abraham (in his stories), which can change into a bird and control time. The children's powers ranged from turning invisible, to controlling air. After Abraham is mysteriously (and very violently) killed, Jake (who's now 16-years- old) travels to the mysterious place, on an island off the coast of Wales, with his father Franklin (O'Dowd). Once there, Jacob learns that the stories are all true! The movie (like all of Tim Burton's work) is visually stunning, and quite beautiful to watch. There might be a little too much CGI, for some people's tastes, but I still enjoyed it. The film is very dark, violent (especially for a kids' movie) and weird (like all of Tim Burton's films); and that's why I liked it as well. It's also got plenty of action, and fascinating characters. While the performances are all good (especially the always amazing Eva Green), the characters are slightly underdeveloped though; and the drama is a bit forced (and lacking any true emotion). The story is also a little too complicated, and somewhat hard to follow. It's far from a perfect movie, but it is entertaining; it's definitely better than Burton's last couple films.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRwrYi1UcY",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Perfect for all the family... except when it isn't.,6,13 August 2018,"For the most part, 'Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children (2016)' plays very closely to the pretty-much patented 'young adult' formula, except for the fact that much of it skews slightly younger than you'd expect and, in the process, seems to make for excellent family fair. That's why the occasional flashes of real darkness - including some fairly grotesque monsters, a tangible sense of threat that does more than just loom and a set of villains who often literally eat the eyes of their foes on-screen - are all the more pervasive and perplexing, seeming to reduce the accessibility of a story that's honestly better suited to those it scares off. Still, there's entertainment to be had in the predictable plot and the hammy villain, played by the always energetic Samuel L. Jackson, is having more fun than any of us or the rest of the decent but generally dull cast, which really shows and adds to the enjoyment of his scenes. The picture may be a little dry overall and it can get kind of dull, but it's not bad by any stretch and is even pretty enjoyable at times, too. 6/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
27,ThomasDrufke,Tim Burton's X-Men,5,2 October 2016,"Tim Burton has tackled almost all of the genre's, and done most of them very well. So who doesn't want to see him go back to his adventure-fantasy comfort zone with Miss Peregrine? It's billed as Tim Burton's X-Men, and I like that comparison a lot. It definitely has certain similarities to a mutant story, but with Burton's flare for obscurity and peculiarity. Let me start off by saying that I really liked the premise and set up. Not only are the characters similar to X-Men, but the story slightly resembled Days of Future Past. I love the time travel elements and links to World War II. But the rest of the film just didn't live up to the promise of the trailers.As delightful as some of Burton's films can be, I find the unevenness to be one of his biggest detractors of his otherwise intriguing ideas. For some reason, the second half of his films don't have the same cohesiveness that the opening's do. With Miss Peregrine, we are set up with a much more grounded take to a heightened story than I thought. You certainly get to see the impressive and outright strange abilities of the young children, but it isn't taken into any extraordinary levels, until later. The second half is flooded with ridiculous and over-the-top 'peculiarities'. That's would be all fine and dandy if the first half didn't set up an already intriguing story without all of the added strangeness.As for the performances, Eva Green is the only one that really stood out here. She seems like a perfect fit into a Burton-esque drama. Her line delivery and presence just speaks Burton. She's also the only character that kept my attention from beginning till end. Sadly, she's not really in it all that much, even with the title having her name. We mostly focus on Asa Butterfield's 'Jake' and Ella Burnell's 'Emma'. Of course, there is some romantic tension, but it never leaves the constructs of a typical teen angst drama. I just didn't buy into it.There's a ton of cool things about this movie, but by the time I left the theater the whole idea just felt tiresome. But with all this said, I would still be open to another entry in the series, just include Eva Green a little more and don't fall into clichés, Burton. You're better than that.+Premise+Eva Green is perfect-First and second half are completely different films-Romantic chemistry was hard to buy into5.9/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
28,MLDinTN,steals too much from x-men,5,4 June 2017,"The whole idea behind this movie is just too much like x-men and it just doesn't seem original. For example, x-men has a wise man running a school for kids with special abilities, while this movie has a wise woman running a home for kids with special abilities. And each kid has there own, unique gift. So this kid, Jake, in Florida is close to his grandfather. He finds him dead with missing eyes and sees this giant, monster creature. So Jake's dad decides to take him to Wales, a special place that his grandfather talked about. There is where he discovers a ""loop"", a door in time that allows him to go back to 1943 and meet Miss Peregrine and her special kids. What he doesn't know is that the bad guy is following him, trying to find the loop. And in case you couldn't guess, Jake has a special ability, he can see the giant creatures that suck people's eyes out. That part was rather gross, the eating of eyes so that the bad guy, Barron, and his friends can become immortal.So, of course the kids team up to battle the bad guys just like in x- men. Main difference is this film must have had a smaller budget because the special effects are not quite as good.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was worth over 2 hours of my time.

Mainly, he is closest with his Grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp), who babysat him a lot when he was younger. Abe's bedtime tales of a home in Wales which housed a bevy of peculiarly talented children were mesmerizing. Now, Jake gets a call from Abe and must speed up to his house an hour away to make certain the old man is okay. He's not. Out in the woods behind Abe's house, Jake finds him dying, with his eyes missing. Moreover, a huge skeleton-monster tries to attack the teen, with the lad only escaping with a well-timed gunshot from a friend. Soon, Jake finds a letter inside a book which directs him to go to Miss Peregrine's Home for PC. A grief counselor thinks its a good idea for Jake to go and his author-biologist father (Scott O'Dowd) has time to take him. Once there, Jake finds that the house was abandoned long ago when it suffered a hit from a German bomber in WWII. Yet, when Dad goes birdwatching, Jake finds that Emma, Olive, and the rest of the Peculiar Children come to lead him into a time warp, where its always the day BEFORE the bombing and the children are safe. Huh. Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) smokes a pipe and takes good care of her charges; she can shape-shift into a bird when it suits her. The other kids have fantastic abilities, too; one can grow giant plants, another is invisible, still another can project his dreams from an eye camera. Yet, two evil groups of folks, the Wights, led by Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) and the Hollows (monster skeletons) are out to find the time warp where Miss P's brood lives. It is there the Jake discovers his own peculiarity; he can see the Hollows where most folks cannot. This will ultimately set up an epic battle between the feisty children, led by Miss Peregrine, and the wicked forces. But, can Jake stay in the time warp to help them? Doesn't he have to go back to Florida? This film is a dazzling visual experience, taken from the YA books by Ransom Riggs. First, the cast is great, with Green, Butterfield, Stamp, Alison Janney, Jackson, Rupert Everett, and all of the rest doing mighty fine work. Then, the film has been shot in near black-and-white, with only a pale shade of color seeping through. Now that's quite an interesting angle! Naturally, the sets on the Welsh island are terrific, as are the historic costumes, and Burton's one-of-a-kind direction of the weird and unusual. So, truly, don't miss this MISS!

But in this case I'm going to make an exception, because this may very well be the dumbest film I have ever watched. And that surprises me, because overall, I think Tim Burton (director) does some pretty good stuff.The first problem I have with this film was the acting. I was not impressed, except for perhaps Ella Purnell and Terrance Stamp. Appearances by Allison Janney (who I like) and Judi Dench (who I like) were too brief to be noteworthy. Of particular note (but on the negative side of things) was Asa Butterfield (the main character), whom I just didn't feel very convinced by; and the worst most foolish performance I have ever seen by Samuel Jackson (his Capital One credit card commercials are much better!).Then there is the lack of character development. At least for most of the peculiar children. And trust me, during the first half of the film -- which dragged like a ship's anchor in the desert -- there was plenty of time to enhance our understanding about the peculiarities of most of the peculiar children.Some of the visuals and special effects were quite good, but as usual, special effects and visuals can't carry a film, just enhance it.I don't think I've ever given a film a ""2"" rating, but I am this time.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The tone of this young adult movie was dark and the balanced light entertainment of say Harry Potter didn't arise so that the storyline didn't really match the more serious flavor of the movie. This fusion of the television Heroes (2006)or The Lost Room (2006) themes doesn't really connect on a consistently emotional or intellectual plot level as the movie intended. This peculiar movie of peculiar children suggested an attempt by Tim Burton to replicate the dazzling innovation of Edward Scissorhands (1990), but what he achieves are snippets of some creative new gimmicks that various children can display along with horror like features.

36,The-Sarkologist,X-men for Kids,5,1 October 2016,"When I first saw the trailers to this movie it reminded me of another series of movies that I have recently watched. Let's see – a group of children with special powers, living in a house that is cut off from the rest of the world, and all of them being taught by a tutor who is immensely more powerful than them. Gee, that sounds a lot like the X-men franchise, and I probably would have written it off as a children's version of the X-men if it wasn't for the fact that I thought that it was based on a book written by Ronald Dahl, and that Tim Burton was the director (though there was no sign of Johnny Depp in sight). As it turns out it wasn't (it was written in 2011), which has changed my opinion of it once again.Anyway the film is about a teenager named Jake who doesn't seem to get on all that well with his peers. However one night he is asked to go and help his grandfather, but when he turns up there he discovers that his grandfather has been murdered and a rather nasty monster lurks in the swamp out the back of his house (the film begins in Florida). We then have a flashback where we learn that his grandfather used to tell him these stories of a house that he stayed at during the war and the children that lived therein. However, when he reveals these stories (and the accompanying photographs) to his peers he is basically laughed out of the class room.Anyway, back in the present he is taken to a psychiatrist at the insistence of his parents (namely because he believes that he saw a monster kill his grandfather) and they agree to travel to the island off the coast of Wales where the house was supposed to be located so that he can see that this house no longer exists. As it happens when he does find the house he discovers that it was destroyed back in World War II when a bomb from a German bomber fell upon it. However there is a catch – when he decides to go back to check out the house again he steps into a cave and finds himself back in 1943 just before the bomb hit. As it turns out the house exists in a time loop which is basically the 24 hours prior to the bomb falling on the house. Normally they would choose what is considered a 'perfect day' however due to the bomb they had to bring it forward to a day that isn't particularly all that great.Anyway, the whole reason they exist in this loop is because, as it turns out, there are some peculiars who didn't want to hide. Rather they wanted to become immortal, however the ritual ended up going horribly wrong turning them into monsters. It turned out that to be able to return to their human forms they needed to hunt down the peculiars and eat their eyes. Mind you, even though they are hidden away in the loop doesn't mean that they are free from these monsters, but the thing is because they are different they do need to hide themselves from the rest of the world (namely because the rest of the world, or the normals, don't particularly like peculiar children).As I mentioned at first it reminded me a lot of the X-men, and the more I watched the film the more it seemed to be taking from that particular series. In fact now that I have learnt that the movie is based on a book from 2011 as opposed to a book by Ronald Dahl, makes me feel that this movie is just a reworking of the X-men franchise and targeted to children. Not only that but the acting was actually really, really bad, which is quite surprising coming from a movie made by Tim Burton. It felt very stilted and wooden, and the characters really seemed to be forcing their lines. While it isn't necessarily something that I pick up, it was really obvious in this film.Mind you, while we have the typical trademark Burton film-making, and while the film was actually really entertaining, in the end I felt that it could have been a lot better. Sure, the fact that it is a rewriting of the X-men did annoy me a little, but it wouldn't be the first time that a film (or a book) took somebody else's idea and reworked it – in fact there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that. This film itself was, and I mentioned, entertaining, particularly with Burton's style. However, what really put me off the film (other than the fact that one of the Loops was hidden in Blackpool, which made me scratch my head somewhat because it isn't as if Blackpool is actually hidden out of the sight of the world) was the acting.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
37,Reno-Rangan,The innocent peculiar children versus the monstrous peculiar adults.,6,24 December 2016,"I thought it should have been a Steven Spielberg film, but he would have compromised on the visually frightening negative characters. Particularly from the little children's angle who are the regular target audience for a theme like this. Even in his recent 'The BFG', you know how the giants were portrayed. So Tim Burton was the right choice and he did his best. But not everybody agrees on that, even I was slightly disappointed. I mean technically it sounded so awesome, but the story was not that impressive. Because of too familiarity, except the peculiar characters.It was based on the young adult book of the same name. The story of a boy named Jake. After his grandfather's murder, he goes to Wales to find the children from an island home about the stories he had heard when he was a little. He discovers they are intentionally stuck in a time loop to avoid their enemies from striking them. But what they feared is about the come true, so now how they plan to defeat after half a century hiding from them is to be told in the rest of the segment.As a children's film fan, I wanted to like it, but not fully satisfied. It was a two hour long film, the first half was an introduction that we saw everything from its trailers and teasers. So I lost interest in those parts, but once the clash between the good and bad had began, the film started to give something new. Again the final battle at the fair should have been designed better. I thought Samuel L. Jackson was not untilised well.The major issue with the film was the narration not trying to take a big step in the story development. Felt like they are aiming for a sequel, so they are avoiding to give out everything in here itself. Similar to the first 'Twilight' film, which was too boring drama. It is almost out of the big screen now and the rating further going to drop. The film critics bashed it, but seems most of the people and film fanatics enjoyed it. I hope they will make 'Hallow City' and I'll be waiting for that.6/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
38,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,4,10 March 2017,"Boy, do I get easily scared! And surely, this movie proved that for me. Though most of the peculiarities were more disgusting than scary, but still. I don't know if children will enjoy this movie, though I guess that wasn't what the film makers where aiming for. The story is interesting, though kind of confusing, especially when dealing with the loop holes and all. But all in all, satisfying enough, with a solid villain, a happy ending and a strong final battle scene. The performances were really good, however the romance was weak. I mean, I could see the girl being attracted to the boy, but the guy seemed to have no chemistry with her, more like he was awkward around her. One other thing that I didn't like was the soundtrack, especially the one during the action scene (reminded me of an amusement park music). Finally, some of the special effects looked fake, though maybe they looked better in 3D. So, 4 out of 10.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
39,TheMovieDiorama,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is...well...peculiar.,6,27 February 2018,"It's safe to say I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan, I find that his imagination takes over and detracts from a story. I was worried he would do the same here. Guess what? He did. A young teenager finds his grandfather dead, his last riddling words spark Jake into unraveling the mystery to his sudden death. He eventually discovers an alternate time loop that consists of children with special powers known as 'Peculiars'. We're talking invisibility, levitation, pyro-kinetics, a boy spewing bees from his mouth and a young girl with another mouth on the back of her head. Suffice to say, this was Burton's interpretation of the X-Men. Some of these peculiarities are useful and thoroughly explored, others are just shown once. On top of this we have 'Hollows', demented creatures that desire to eat the eyes of 'Peculiars' so that they can return to human form. Hmmmm how best to describe these ghastly creatures you might ask? Easy. Slender Man! Imagination aside, Burton has crafted yet another creative world. There is no doubt he is a genius when it comes to creating fantasy realms. The problem is, he doesn't focus on developing a coherent and compelling story. Guarantee atleast 90% of the dialogue is exposition. Explaining the vast amount of rules involving time loops, alternate realities, peculiarities and the primary antagonist...it's too much! It's overstuffed. It's important to include scenes where the characters just interact naturally without having to progress the story so that we can relate to them and become emotionally invested. It started off well, and then quickly descended into explanation hell. Apart from that massive issue, this film works as a family fantasy adventure. The visual effects were pretty decent for the most part, except the 'Hollows' who were terribly animated. Performances were serviceable. Asa Butterfield struggles occasionally to act with expression, but he does hold the film. Eva Green looked the part and was the only captivating performance. Not Burton's finest, but it is watchable.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
40,Tweetienator,Peculiar Storyline Wanted,5,6 November 2016,"Tim Burton made some flicks I consider as unique and done with great skill but Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is in my view just a mediocre work of his output. I didn't read the books so I can't compare them but what I mainly miss is something like a (new) story - everything in this movie is already told x-zillion times (e.g. X-men, Harry Potter, Vampire Academy etc. pp.) before (and better and more interesting) and therefore the movie is predictable to an extent of boredom. Also some of the scenes are simply just terrible (stupid) - the fight of the skeletons against the monsters (movie switches to comedy, at least the pacing is wrong and the scene feels out of place to me), or the scene in the home-house where the monster first breaks a door easy and eats the old lady pronto but hunting the kids to the top of the house it takes almost hours to break the next door... So on the plus we get the burtonesque stunning visual quality of the movie, but the ingredient most wanted and painfully missed is a peculiar and interesting story-line (wordpun intended) - which make so many of Burtons movies outstanding (Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, Corpse Bride etc.) . Well, the movie is not a bad one but not much good: interesting for fans of Tim Burton who want to watch everything he directs and for fans of the books.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

43,subxerogravity,Very Peculiar indeed,7,2 October 2016,"When I first herd about this movie, my first thought of course was that this is Tim Burton's version of the X-Men, which pretty much rings true. Miss Alma LeFay Perigrine is a part of a group of humans actually called Peculiars, born with uncanny abnormalities that make all the rest of us hate and fear them. She looks after a group of children who are peculiars and gives them a safe place at a home caught in a time bubble, away from humans who would do them harm and other monsters that would as well.But despite the X-Men similarities, I have to admit that the film is unique, I'll give it that. Mostly for doing what everyone else is not doing. I went into the theater expecting some sort of combo between Marvel comics and JK Rowling, but this Tim Burton film is a little tamer than what I expect from an action adventure these days.I like the film, but it definitely took me off guard with how light the fantasy thrill ride was on this. I was expecting a roller coaster, but instead I got the tea cup ride. The film really focuses on emotion. Asa Butterfield plays Jake, a kid who prematurely lost his grandfather, who takes him on a posthumous adventure to deliver a message to Miss Perigrime. Jake's love of his grandfather drives him and it really shows on the screen.Chris O'Dowd was funny as Jake's father, Franklin, a man who seems to be climbing up a steep hill trying to connect with his son, which has a lot to do with his not so great relationship with his own father, played by Terrance Stamp (He's also Jake's grandfather, who Jake gets along great with). O'Dowd was my pin point of what was really clicking with the story as it goes over some serious and real issues in a very entertaining way.Sam L. Jackson is also in the movie (As he is in everything), as the main villain of the story. He was also very entertaining as he was equally menacing and humorous, freighting us with his disturbing look and actions while poking fun at cliché plot holes you've seen in so many superhero movies. I would recommend seeing, as it's worth experiencing, but you have to keep in mind that if your use to the more slick glossy feel of other Sci-fi Fantasy superhero movies this has a little more depth and substance than you're use to.

Tim Burton is not exactly sane. But what difference does, in a world of increasingly insane? Too bad for Terence Stamp, which is a good actor. Also, all respect for Eva Green's mother, the exceptional French actress Marlene Jobert(which has no contribution in this film). Neither Eva Green is not bad but, from now on, it would be better to confine only to ads like Christian Dior's Midnight Poison campaign.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Turns out all the stories are true. Has Jacob finds the special place, his full feeling of being overjoyed is short lived when an old enemy of Miss Peregrine named Barron(Samuel L. Jackson) who is very powerful is coming for her, how will all this play out? An all entertaining film, coming from Tim Burton who like director Stanley Kubrick, turns weirdness into art. Asa Butterfield does pretty good, so does Ava Green, and the rest of the cast are pretty good. The effects are descent also, but there are moments where the movie slows down, and it gets a little boring in spots, and Chris O'Dowd has Jacobs father is so non existent in the film to the point if he was written out the film, would not make a difference.

46,stevendbeard,Tim Burton's Junior X-Men,7,4 October 2016,"I saw ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"", starring Eva Green- Penny Dreadful_tv, Casino Royale_2006; Asa Butterfield-Ender's Game, Nanny McPhee returns; Terence Stamp-Valkyrie, Wanted and Samuel L. Jackson-The Legend of Tarzan, Jumper.This is movie is directed by Tim Burton-Alice in Wonderland, Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands, Batman-and I guess you could say that this is Tim Burton's version of a junior X-Men, without the costumes. It's based on a series of books by Ransom Riggs, so this might be the start of a new franchise. Asa is a teenager that finds out from his grandfather, Terence, that there is a whole other world out there filled with all kinds of creatures, both good & bad. Eva runs a school for peculiar children and peculiar here means they have super powers. Eva herself can turn into a bird, specifically a peregrine. Each child has different powers; one can make plants grow, one can control fire, one is invisible, one is super strong, one can control bees-yes, I said bees- and one controls air. There is more but you get the idea. Eva also controls a time loop that she resets every day. The time loop keeps everyone the same age and the time period they are in, is 1943. FYI: There are other spots across the world where someone else is doing the same thing with the time period loops, and they all know each other. Samuel plays the bad guy. He wants to experiment on Eva and kill the kids to enhance his own powers and longevity. Samuel can change his shape to look like anyone and he has a squad of giant creatures called 'Hollows'-about 15-20 feet tall-at his beck and call to help in his mission. The effects are great and the fights are energetic. Keep an eye out in the amusement park scene, and you might spot Tim Burton. There are a few other good cameos; I remember seeing Judi Dench and Allison Janney. It's rated ""PG-13"" for fantasy violence and peril and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes. I really liked this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
47,alindsay-al,A below average truly bizarre film,4,24 July 2017,"Tim Burton has always been an eccentric director so when I saw the trailer for this film I had some hope that of could be good but this film is just a pretty forgettable experience. The premise of the film sees a young boy run into a house of extraordinary children led by miss peregrine. Asa Butterfield plays Jake in this film and my goodness this is one of the !most boring plain protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. He doesn't have any interesting qualities and just complains through the majority of the movie and I just really didn't care about his character in this film which was a shame. Eva green plays miss peregrine and she is really good in this film, she is delightfully over the top and she was really fun to watch in her role. Samuel l Jackson plays he villain in this film and he is so fun to watch in this film, yes he is over the top but you can tell he is having a lot of fun in the role which oozes onto the screen. Unfortunately though I found pretty much all of the peculiar children to be bland and have nothing particularly new about them or interesting about there characters. The story has some interesting use of time travel and I found some of the lore used in the story to be particularly cool. But the actual story is pretty boring to watch, Jake has family problems that you really don't care to see and a romance that is a bit weird and that you really don't care about. The script has some pretty funny dialogue in it especially from Jackson that will make you laugh. However, the drama falls pretty flat on it's face as you really won't care about any of the dramatic situations. The style of the film is inconsistent, when with the peculiars the film is very lavish and bright and it is cool to see all of these powers. Though when you are dealing with Jakes family problems the film is very drab and dull, the pacing is an issue with this as the first half of the movie pretty much is all like this. Also to the controversy in this film, even though marketed as a family film this film should be kept away from young kids at all cost as there are some pretty terrifying things in this movie especially for young children. Overall this is a below average movie that unless you're a big fan of Tim Burton can be skipped.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
48,iquine,Expected Burton Creativity; Retread Story,7,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)With all the ingredients there to make a delicious meal, the special seasonings were left out. The story revolves around time travel and a boy's literal and adventurous search for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, its existence as well as any remaining living children. The boy gets some clues that lead him through a time warp of sorts and he learns how this home and its inhabitants have been living in a special place in time. The interweaving of points in time and things that occur are moderately easy to keep track of but not overly engaging or compelling. The highlight of the movie is the bizarre cast of children with interesting and unexpected powers which unfortunately very few of the powers have an impact on the story. Thus is the creativity while very clever, fun and unusual felt shallow. Many of the styles did remind me of Beetlejuice, which was great. The climax of this movie also didn't feel like it fit with the carefully constructed first 2/3's. Too much glossy CGI that ran counter to the rest of the movie.

51,Amari-Sali,Another book adaption more focused on making money than what made the book worth adapting in the first place.,6,1 October 2016,"OverviewWhether you've read the book or became interested due to the trailer or the name Tim Burton, beware. For while you may be entertained enough to not notice the two-hour time length, you will be left feeling the time could have been better spent.Main Storyline For quite sometime Jake (Asa Butterfield) was perhaps the only one who really connected with his grandfather Abe (Terrence Stamp). He would babysit him and tell him all the tales of his adventures, and even once those tales became a fantasy to Jake they stayed with him. However, with his grandpa old it seems he takes those old tales more factual than ever. Making his shocking death, in which Jake is the first to find him, and Abe rehashes information dealing with his old fairy tales strange.Yet, even with thinking grandpa may have been delirious, he needs to see if maybe those stories are true. Leading to him taking a trip to Cairnholm in Wales. A place where he discovers many of grandpa's stories being true, including the monsters who likely killed him.HighlightsThe main thing praiseworthy is that some of the things the movie cuts, like us drowning in Jacob's ordinariness, are gone. Also, while arguably too much of it was cut out, it was nice that the time between meeting Jacob and being introduced to the peculiars was slimmed down. But perhaps the thing most noteworthy is despite this film being two hours, what remains of the magic which is Tim Burton's direction makes you so lost in the special effects and beauty of the movie that you don't really feel it.CriticismWith that said, if you are someone who reads the book before the movie, expect your usual feelings of being upset. Mostly because it seems this movie was not made to start a franchise. Starting with the topic of the characters, I honestly feel like the changes made weren't really for the better. Now, let me begin by saying that part of the issue stems from none of these characters being allowed to naturally develop. Which, unfortunately, leads to them personalities feeling amped up, especially in the case of the pecuiliars, to make up for it. For whether it is Enoch (Finlay MacMillan) coming off as more of an ass than I remember or Eva Green, as Miss Peregrine, seemingly channeling Helena Bonham Carter in one of her more quirkier roles, you are left with so much personality but no substance behind it. Heck, even Butterfield, who usually is quite adept at playing awkward and introverted characters, just seems off his game in this movie without the ability to develop his character into some semblance of a person. Transitioning to the story, this is where the lack of development really hits. For while, some of my feelings likely come from reading the book and thus thinking my perception of characters aren't met, at the same time it is hard to ignore certain issues. One being how the film completely ignores creating a sense of mystery or building up to anything. Let's take Emma's (Ella Purnell) relationship with Jake, or even hers with Abe, for example. Her relationship with Abe is omitted entirely, thus leaving her as the girl with the power to control air. Then hen it comes to the Jake relationship, she pushes him away throughout the movie and the parts in the book dealing with how they came to fall for each other are cut. On top of that, the issues which come from liking your grandpa's ex are omitted as well as Jake's inexperience with girls. Making the build toward them eventually kissing feeling more like an obligation for a young adult novel adaptations than a culmination of everything that happened thus far. It doesn't end there, though. Frank's (Chris O'Dowd) development is cut in terms of his rocky marriage, his relationship with his father, as well as his feelings about being his age and still drifting from one dream to the next. But the biggest issue, as noted above, is that the film lacks mystery and build. Something which makes the reveal of the hollowgast and Barren anti-climatic. Not just because their look was revealed in the trailers, but also because Barron and his associate aren't treated as monsters lurking in the shadows. They are spoken as if they are formidable creatures which kill indiscriminately. However, there isn't much in the way of lurking in shadows and while they keep some of the killings which happened on the island, they, you guessed it! Don't have the type of build which brings some form of fear, anxiety, or even excitement. I mean, between the hollowgast looking like a rejected monster from a Guillermo Del Toro movie, seeing Ms. Peregrine kill the one who killed Victor and decided to come back for seconds (because they are in a loop she always knows when it is coming), or how Samuel L. Jackson as Barron is played as some sort of comical villain, it ruins whatever sense of fear you should have. Because, honestly, the way Jackson plays Barron is like he is auditioning to be the first Black villain of an Austin Powers movie. Think of his role in Kingsman without the lisp and him being rich.Lastly, the final battle and ending were terrible. So terrible the trailer for A Dog's Purpose had me more on an emotional roller- coaster. On The FenceWith that said, while Barron's comical dialog and actions put a damper on how fearful the hollows should have been, this isn't to say they weren't funny. Also, while the battles with the hollows weren't as life or death as I'd like, it was hard to not be entertained by the use of CGI in showing them destroy their environment and how the actors interacted with them in combat.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

54,jadepietro,Oddly Satisfying,8,8 October 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: An imaginative surreal sideshow that oddly conforms to a  predictable formula.  GRADE: A / B  SYNOPSIS: A young man finds love, adventure, and peril as he discovers  an interesting entourage of misfits.  JIM'S REVIEW: Mr. Burton's films celebrate the eccentricities and  uniqueness we mere mortals strive to obtain. His steadfast love for the  grotesque and macabre have served him well in the past. His surreal  vision continues to thrive in the present as well in his latest outing,  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The film is a perfect  match of filmmaker and inspired material, that being, Ransom Rigg's  book of child oddities and free spirits.  ￼The set-up itself isn't very original and leans on an overused plot of  a gathering of unique individuals with superpowers who band together  for their own protection as they fight evil forces. But this version  falls somewhere between the Harry Potter mystique and the anti-  superheroes of X-Men fame. Those latter mutants lived together in  Professor X's mansion and used their super strengths for good, while  these misfits take up residence in a parallel dimension avoiding human  contact, with more storybook rather than comic book charm, circa 1940.   This freakish lot does live up to the film's title with their many  quirks and a beguiling sideshow quality, plus an overabundance of CGI  effects to constantly hold one's attention. The crew of misfits include  fire-starter Olive, an invisible boy named Millard Nullings, Emma, a  floating ethereal lovely lassie, and the shape-shifting proprietress  herself, Miss P., plus many other bizarre lodgers.  ￼No, the world doesn't understand them or even know their whereabouts.  That is until Jacob Portman (Asa Butterfield) stumbles into their  existence via his grandfather's tall tales, (shades of another Burton  film, Big Fish). He travels to a small island and discovers a time-warp  ""loop"" that transports him back in time to Miss Peregrine (Eva Green)  and his tribe. It is there Jake falls in love and helps to rescue his  new friends from a white-eyed villain (Samuel L. Jackson) and ghoulish  monsters.  The film is gorgeous. This dark fantasy adventure is a visual delight,  as are many of Mr. Burton's past enterprises. The film invests heavily  in special effects and the wow factor to enhance the movie-going  experience. The director's keen vision is on display in many surreal  moments that are technically impressive, especially in its memorable  underwater sequences. Bruno Delbonnel's photography, Chris Lebenzon's  editing, and the glorious production design by Gavin Bocqueet help  capture the off-kilter atmosphere.  ￼However, story-wise, the screenplay by Jane Goldman lacks wonder.  After a slow and lengthy exposition in the real world, the film finally  establishes the characters and their dilemmas well enough when it  finally loops into its more interesting time warp. Then it keeps the  action moving from scene to scene. Yet the interplay between the  characters takes a secondary role to the CGI upstaging, as marvelous as  it is. (By the way, Mr. Burton pays nice homage to early visual artist  Ray Harryhausen along the way.) But the young lovers' relationship  never really builds and appears to be a mere after-thought that is  sacrificed for the thrill of all of the state-of-the art artistry  involved. The film is strictly a visceral joy ride, albeit a  fascinating one.  The cast are merely pawns on a playing field of technical wizardry. The  young cast redeems itself well enough. Mr. Butterfield and Ella Purnell  as his love interest are indeed charming, though somewhat bland. Mr.  Jackson provides more buffoonery than menace. Chris O'Dowd as Jake's  father remains a poorly developed enigma. Supporting turns by Terrence  Stamp, Allison Janney, Rupert Everett, and Judi Dench are nice  additions in their somewhat abbreviated roles. Only Ms. Green, playing  Ms. P. as a demented Mary Poppins mother figure, brings the ideal sense  of whimsy and intensity to make a lasting impression.   ￼Creative, the film is. Emotionally inert, it is too. Still, the  imaginative surreal world of Tim Burton is a semi-nice place to  visit...anytime.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

56,rgkarim,Being Peculiar Never Felt So Disturbingly Fun,8,1 October 2016,"Another weekend, another chance for Hollywood to take a book and turn it into a film. The review today is on Miss Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children, a story that certainly screams for someone with an odd sense of direction to make. Therefore, someone like Tim Burton is perfect to lead the production of this book and bring that weirdness to the screen. Robbie K bringing another review, hoping to help guide you on your movie viewing needs. Let's get started!LIKES  Tim Burton weirdness  Decent visual effects  Felt like a book  Ella Purnell and Eva GreenAfter Big Eyes, people were missing Burton's weird touch in the cinematic world. Thankfully, the strange director has returned and delivered in spades, bringing his usual bag of tricks into the mix. Peregrine's home alone looks like something out of a bizarre dream, with its residents mirroring Burton's twisted sense of fun (e.g. mouths on the back of their heads or experimenting with the dead). Even the antagonists certainly look like something pulled from the occult particularly the long limbed, multi-tongued sightless Hollows that hunt our heroes. The underlying theme is that Burton's edge is all over this movie and brought out in decent visual effects. Burton's team use a combination of make-up and computers to create these weird wonders, with the make up being the more realistic and impressive component. Another positive was how much it felt like a book as opposed to a big budget movie production. Miss Peregrine isn't a movie about explosions, action, or sappy romantic outings, but rather it focuses on the story and character development. I found myself enjoying the formulaic presentation especially the climax at the end that brought everything to a close. It was nice to see a movie not get lost in the big budget special effects and focus on the characters instead of the stunts. And the writers get credit for a dialogue that fits well with the story. With such a large cast it is hard to analyze all their acting styles, so I'll focus on Ella Purnell and Eva Green. Purnell's character Emma brings the most magic to the film as Burton abused her air bending ability to unlock the secrets of the looped world. Ella's combination of smug fun, determination, and compassion make for a winning combination that one can't help but latch onto. Eva Green was awesome as always, bringing her brooding, hard edge to the forefront and curbing into a role that was centered on caring for her kids. It was nice seeing her in a role that wasn't an antagonist, and she fit so well with the cast. DISLIKES  Didn't match up with the books  Wasted potential on powers  Cheesy visuals at times  A bit disturbing at times I can't lie, I haven't read the books, but based on the summaries from Wikipedia (and the fact there are multiple books) it's safe to say that the film does not follow the novels. There is a lot of similar elements, but the movie took a lot of liberties with the story to cram it into a two hour run time. Much of the changes were to give a friendlier atmosphere for younger audience members, but my research also reveals some other major changes that may highly irritate fans of the series. One major change involves deleting some important conflicts described in the books. Another major change is that they combined plots from other books to not only bring the story to completion, but give a decent ending in case the movie tanks. And yes, they even changed the villain in this movie so they could have a role for Samuel L Jackson. But with all the changes for the movie, one thing that they seemed to not expand on were the powers of the kids. The kids have some really cool peculiarities, but most of them didn't get to show it off much outside of a few parlor tricks. Oh sure, they got a few well timed moments to use their powers to accomplish something, but outside of two of them, they didn't do much. Even the Hollows failed to do much, despite the fact they had the weirdest director to abuse those powers, which made the movie a bit lamer. And when they did get to use their powers, they often came out cheesy, often presented in a manner that would maximize the 3-D viewing. This was especially true for the Hollows whose lumbering forms did look freaky, but again very fake and designed specifically for the 3-D visuals. Finally, the disturbing dislike. Yes, Burton's imagination crosses into this realm often, but this particular flick took it a little far at times. Seeing children playing with hearts, or having eye balls ripped out only to be eaten might be a little bit of a stretch for some. True it does fit with the darker theme of the movie, but it's a shame to see the mature boundary moving to a younger age. In addition, the Hollows might be a bit scary for some younger members. THE VERDICTWhen it comes to book themed movies, Miss Peregrine's is certainly one of the odder to appear in a long time. Burton's twist is back in spades and he has crafted a very intriguing film that will appeal to many audiences. However, Burton's crew dropped the ball on a few things including plot points in the film, disturbing twists, and use of the kids' powers. I can't recommend this one in 3-D though, as I don't think the effects will add much to the film. Still, I think this film is worth a trip to the theater, just exercised caution. My Scores: Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
57,invisibleunicornninja,Boring,4,18 February 2018,This movie isn't really worth the energy to watch or talk about. The plot is boring. There is minimal conflict. Everything that is explained is later ignored. There is actually a paradox that is created in the movie in which the entire movie shouldn't have happened and I wish that that had translated into the real world.,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
58,WeAreLive,I liked it,9,20 October 2018,"So the story was almost about time travel but yet it isn't like the ordinary time machine movie. It really felt like a movie of it's own, nobody else seems like they've made a movie similar to it.It also was cool with the kids having powers, which everyone had different abilities that I wouldn't have thought of on the spot. It's almost the equivalence of having a super power to only shatter glass, it's not an everyday thing you hear among the words of ""super powers"".Even though a lot people don't like this movie but me personally I enjoyed. I guess if this is not the type of movie you are looking then I guess you would be disapointed.This is like if X-men was directed by Tim Burton nothing more",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
59,begob,Laboured whimsy - 2 bleedin' hours!,4,18 November 2016,"A shy boy heeds the dying words of his mysteriously murdered grandfather, and ... I dunno.Groan. First up, this director has no idea how to tell a story. He can frame great images, add touches of imagination, but cannot change gears on a satisfying narrative. The scramble to make sense of a nothing premise is really poor. There is a core scene, at the moment of bombing, but it doesn't tie reality into the fantasy.Second: why does Eva Green waste herself on juvenile directors? Her voice is a five course meal, nobody can match her close-ups, and she moves beautifully. And Sam Jackson confirms his clown career.Photography is great, but mahussive amounts of CGI. Music majestic so it can carry the can on a scooby doo story looking for a meaningful climax.Basically, this is a pitch for another fantasy TV series. Stay clear.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
60,bkrauser-81-311064,Sadly Un-Peculiar,7,11 October 2016,"Despite seeing this film more than a week ago, I have been avoiding reviewing it. Not because it is a particularly loathsome film or because it's a particularly big disappointment. To put it simply there is very little to say about Miss Peregrine that hasn't already been said. Everything about the film is basically spelled out in the trailer and despite having a name-brand director whose history of odd images usually has some kind of merit to it, Miss Peregrine remains, to put it bluntly unpeculiar.The film is based on a trilogy of time-travelling young adult novels written by Ransom Riggs. We follow our seemingly normal protagonist Jake (Butterfield) as he traipses through ""time-loops"" to uncover the mystery of his grandfather's death. While doing so he comes across Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children which smuggles its young wards into these time-loops to protect them from villains, ne'er-do-wells and the odd muggles. Jake must then face off against a plague of invisible villains all while trying to convince his father (O'Dowd) that he's not completely off his rocker.As to be expected from the studio that continues to churn out X-Men (2000-present) movies, Miss Peregrine spends an awful lot of time building it's world and painstakingly maintaining it throughout the course of the film. Time-travel can be a cruel, timey-wimey thing concerning story structure thus watching the film beam-balance over the usual pratfalls is a wonder all it's own. Especially given the fact the movie crams in two out of three books into a single 2-hour film, I'm amazed nearly nothing collapsed in on itself.Yet the movie not stretching into a mobius strip up its own a** is about the only thing really worth celebrating about Miss Peregrine. The acting is serviceable, the cinematography and special-effects are just north of Alice in Wonderland (2010) (no matter how many Jason and the Argonauts (1963) references you add to it) and the themes are right there in the pudding. It's a straightforward heroes-tale that fills the screen with old-fashioned, morose filigree. The kind that would have made the Tim Burton from twenty- years ago the obvious choice to helm the project. Yet like Rip Van Winkle, Burton seems to have just woken up and is unaware that Harry Potter, (2001-2011) The Hunger Games (2012-2015), The Maze Runner (2014-Present), The Divergent Series (2014-Present), Narnia (2005- 2008) and Percy Jackson (2010-2013) already exist.It's clear the studio was aware these properties exist, and seeing no future for this particular franchise; 20th Century Fox in their all-seeing wisdom decided to cram most of the Peculiar Children trilogy into one characterless film. It's a shame too because the story has so much to setup. So much that, when the inevitable book jump rears its ugly head, the gear change is enough to give any unsuspecting audience member whiplash.If anyone were to benefit from further movie installments it arguably could have been the villains led by Samuel L. Jackson. Their plan, ambitions and all-around look (somewhere between the monsters of Resident Evil and a brood of Hot Topic fans) could have morphed into something interesting if given a wider birth. Unfortunately their purpose in the movie we got is just so perfunctory. That and their menace is totally undone by zany pranks that feel like they were rejected from Home Alone (1990).Miss Peregrine works in pieces and if taken out of context of being done before so, so, so many times before, it kinda stands on its own. Yet if ever there was a poster-child for the common phrase ""the book was better,"" this movie is certainly it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
61,moviexclusive,"Tim Burton puts his own delightfully quirky touch on this bestselling Edwardian fairy tale, but is still a much better imaginative visual stylist than compelling storyteller",7,1 October 2016,"Tim Burton would seem the perfect candidate to direct the big-screen adaptation of Ransom Riggs' bestselling young-adult novel of the same name – after all, Burton's beloved creations the likes of Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Jack Nicholson's Joker and Johnny Depp's Ed Wood have each been defined by their respective peculiarities. It is therefore no surprise that the titular kids are an impressively eccentric bunch, including an adorable little girl with a hungry jaw at the back of her head, a brooding teenage boy who can animate non-living objects and dead creatures, another relatively more good-natured teenage boy who stores bees in his stomach, a pair of twins who look like dolls and hide their faces under canvas sacks, and a teenage girl who can control air and wears ornamented lead boots to keep her from floating away into the sky. There is a little Burton in each one of these delightfully quirky individuals, and it is no surprise that they are the primary source of the film's joy.Just as delightful is Eva Green's eponymous headmistress, played with just the right balance of wit, whimsy and lunacy. Her peculiarity is her temperament – flinty and authoritarian when enforcing her insistence on strict punctuality and yet sensitive and motherly when looking after her children's emotional wellbeing – as well as her abilities – as an ymbrine, she is not only able to transform into a falcon but also manipulate time, the latter of which she uses to create time-loops to protect her 'peculiars'. Unlike Burton's go-to actor Johnny Depp, Green steps into her role with delicious relish without sucking up all the air, shining without overshadowing her teenage ensemble. Burton also creates an enchanting villain in the form of shape-shifting, pointy-toothed Barron for the reliably bad-assed Samuel L. Jackson to sink his teeth into, his character one of the bad 'peculiars' called a 'wight' who feasts on eyeballs and hopes to kidnap Miss Peregrine to steal her temporal powers.Over the course of his four-decade career, Burton has established himself as one of the rare filmmakers with a clear, distinctive style for artisanal creepiness – and there is no doubt seeing the mix of weird and wonderful that it is well-suited to this material. Even so, Burton has always been a better visual stylist than a storyteller, which is precisely where his latest falters. Like the book, the story unfolds through a 16-year-old teenager named Jake (Asa Butterfield) who lives in present-day Florida, still reeling from the death of his grandfather (Terence Stamp) and obsessed with the stories that the elder had told him about a strange orphanage on an island off the coast of Wales. There is a lot of exposition in the first half-hour to set up Jake's discovery of the children's home, and yet curiously not enough to root us to his emotional loss and corresponding desire for closure. That missing connection becomes even more apparent as Jake struggles to find his place with his newfound company. Should he make a new home with the children at the orphanage, consigning himself to living in a permanent loop of the 24 hours before the bomb by the Germans destroys the home? Or should he return to the life he knows? Before the arrival of the scenery-chewing Barron, Jake's dilemma pretty much drives the narrative; and yet, the film's most important 'peculiar' (oh yes, there is good reason why Jake should discover the home) is ironically its dreariest, as a consequence not only of dull character work but also of a flat and affectless performance by Butterfield. It also explains why despite the delectable weirdness of Jake's companions, the movie remains curiously lethargic, especially when it shuffles from past to present to let Jake catch up with his bird-watching dad (played by Chris O'Dowd with a wobbly American accent).Thankfully, things get considerably more exciting during the last third when Jake steps up to lead the rescue mission to save Miss Peregrine from being devoured by Barron. Their mode of transport is a sunken ship which one of the characters resurfaces from the depths of the ocean by literally blowing the water out of the vessel. The barnacle-encrusted ghost ship eventually docks at Blackpool's North Pier for the action- packed finale set in present-day, where a series of CG stop-motion battles involving faceless tentacled creatures called 'hollowgasts' – including one with an army of Ray Harryhausen skeleton warriors – offer a gloriously wacky yet thrilling finish. The time-travel element does threaten to get unnecessarily twisty at times, but Burton manages to keep it fascinating and end on a charming note with an epilogue that sees Jake travel across continents and time to be with one of the girls from Miss Peregrine's home whom he fancies from the start.As a film that bears the Tim Burton name, 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' is replete with his twisted touches – not only in terms of grotesquerie (think a platter of eyeballs with their tendrils intact, slurped up like spaghetti and meatballs) but also in singular surreal images (one that stands out is Jake tugging one of the girls down the beach as she floats above him like a balloon on a string). Burton ensures that the production looks great – from cheerfully drab Floridian bungalows to elderflower-and-wisteria-toned monochrome thickets, the sets are terrific and the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnelis lovely. Yet the storytelling is staid where it should be riveting, detached when it needs to be engaging, and conventional when it could be spooky and exciting, which is somewhat to be expected when you look at Burton's oeuvre and yet inevitably still mildly disappointing.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
62,mike48128,Not as good as a Harry Potter Tale but not without it's charm,7,11 November 2017,"Imagine having peculiar powers or abilities such as being lighter that air, being invisible or changing into a Peregrine Falcon at will? Being able to twist the fabric of time to create a ""loop"" of immortality but with the ""catch"" that leaving it causes rapid aging and certain death? It's a good movie for the first half, with atmospheric and beautiful scenery in Wales and a group of children with special abilities ""stuck"" in 1943 the day before their house gets blown up by German bombs. Kind of like ""X-children"" but magic is involved. Jake is the grandson of Abe and Abe warned him about his special ability to see invisible monsters. He is guided by Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a shapeshifter and masquerades as Jake's female psychiatrist Dr. Golan as well. So he travels to the U.K. to the Welsh countryside to solve the mystery. Here's where it gets really bizarre and stupid: A group of these ""shifters"" perform a ridiculous science experiment (Crazy Barron plays with electricity) that turns them all into spirit vampires that must eat eyeballs to stay in human form! Jake is the only one that can see the monsters within these people and the fact that they have white eyes with no pupils. The last third of the movie zig-zags everywhere in time including 2016 at a Naval Pier. Jake finds his way back to 1943 to be with Emma (Ella Purcell as a fetching long-haired blonde). It starts out great and ends up a muddled mess with an abrupt ending. It's not one of Samuel L. Jackson's best roles, either. A very weird Tim Burton movie.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
63,valadas,Amazing visual effects,7,6 October 2016,"This movie has amazing visual effects indeed. But it has more than that. It tells a fantastic story which is thrilling enough. Of course in this kind of stories we must always take for granted some episodes, scenes, developments and omissions whose suitable logic we demand on realistic ones. We must take them for granted even after making allowances to the fantasy. A young boy has got is mind full of fantastic stories told to him by his grandfather when he was a child. After the tragic murder of his grandfather he can discover that those stories were true and he ends up by traveling to an island in Wales where he finds the home his father had told him about run by a charming lady and inhabited by peculiar children with extraordinary powers but who are object of a hunt by evil creatures of whom our young boy must defend them. Then the story develops itself in curious travels in time and space through time loops between 2016 and 1943. A struggle between evil and good is in the spirit of this movie after all and some sentimental aspects are not discarded too. A movie worth to be seen for those who appreciate this kind.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
64,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Aesthetically stylish but still dripping with Burton's trite clichés,2,18 April 2017,"Tim Burton was told early-on that his work was innovative and witty, and as such, his style has more or less remained the same for over thirty years. With the exception of his film 'Big Eyes', all of his works are these hideously campy things drenched in goth stereotypes and heavy makeup. While this may have been creative in the 1980's, it just looks like he's scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point. His Gothic style suits a certain type of story, but he has a habit of butchering the most imaginative of ideas, from Dark Shadows (once a mystifying 1970's television series) to Alice in Wonderland (that Mad Hatter gave me the creeps). Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is just another notch in his belt, and he has managed to take an eerie but quaint and beautiful children's novel, and warp it into this grotesque sideshow where we have monsters eating fake-looking plastic eyeballs, dancing theme park skeletons with dubstep music in the background, CGI effects that look like something out of a video game, lots of ""bird cr!p"" jokes, and of course all those Tim Burton trademarks, from the usual blonde, big-eyed main female lead, to the thick eyeliner, to the way in which he finds a way to make even the most dazzling of scenes feel hokey, tired or just plain stupid. I only ever read the books once, back when I was in junior high, and I don't recall them being like this at all. The old photographs which were once a plot device are nothing more than just a prop. I guess the acting was alright, although not very memorable for me (I will concede that I found that Lauren McCrostie, who plays a character reminiscent of Charlie from Stephen King's Firestarter in some ways, steals the show in her on-screen presence).Maybe I'm being too pretentious here and making too much of a judgment on the film, but I just felt like other directors could've done so much better. At over two hours in length (credits included), it seems too silly for most adults and too scary for most children. Maybe Burton was hoping for a common ground with his audience instead of targeting a specific demographic? I really don't know. I guess when you read a book, you've sort of been poisoned by that book. It gets into your mind and convinces you that nothing could ever hold a candle to the original work. But seriously, what were they thinking with this? The soundtrack is unmemorable (though to be fair, it isn't really terrible either), the scenery looks surreal and plastic despite its WWII era in Wales setting, the main character was so mundane that it was unrealistic at best, and the overuse of computer effects did nothing at all to help matters. And don't even get me started on that Enoch character and his ""puppet"" routine, which I think Burton had a little TOO much fun with. Were the cast and crew and producers high when all this was filmed? Don't get me wrong, weird isn't always bad, but there are two types of weird - there's the fun and creative kind of weird, and the campy, ridiculous, false and annoying kind of weird, the kind of weird that hipsters like even though it is more mainstream and commercialized than anything else.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
65,Screen_Blitz,Tim Burton's visual methodology strives enough to make up for the tainted script,7,4 January 2017,"If you are fan of visionary director Tim Burton, chances are you know mostly for his distinct visual style, a style he's possessed since his signature debut in the comedy-horror 'Beetlejuice' in 1988. Burton has embraced a Gothic visual modus and macabre atmosphere that has most often made his films more of visual spectacles than films with compelling storytelling. This dark fantasy inspired by Ransom Riggs's best-selling novel series of the same name sees Burton continuing his signature trend with his dazzling visual methodology that manages to outplay it's occasionally clunky script. Written by Jane Goldman, frequent collaborator of director Matthew Vaughn, this film translates it's compelling source material with fine, but occasionally sluggish style-over-substance flick that only succeeds on embracing Burton's typical visual grandeur than coherent storytelling. Enter sixteen-year old Jake (played by Asa Butterfield), a young teen inspired by the extraordinary adventures of his grandfather Abe Portman (played by Terence Stamp) to seek out a mysterious foster family raised by the witch-like Miss Peregrine (played by Eva Green). The family consisted of children gifted with utterly bizarre abilities including a child who can manipulate air and breath underwater, another with an invisible body, one with a monstrous mouth at the back of her head, another with the ability to light things on fire with her bare hands, the list goes in. As the young man is drawn into their unnatural world, he learns the secrets of their family that put their lives in grave danger against mysterious monsters that pray on them.With Tim Burton operating behind the camera, it is predictable that this strives for bizarre and spooky imagery that immediately hits you with reminiscence of Burton's previous works. The world of the titular character's mysterious habitat is drawn with an authentic 1940s-era production design and spooky imagery of characters with creepy CGI anatomical abnormalities and corpses with eyes hollowed out; just enough bizarre scenery to give elementary-school aged kids to the heebie jeebies. The make-up done on Eva Green's Miss Peregrine to give her a Maleficient-like appearance is pretty nice to look at as well. How Tim Burton's visual heft manages to tower over the storytelling however, comes as the film's prime disappointment. The first hour follows a 'X-Men meets Harry Potter' plot introducing a series of uncanny characters through long, convoluted exposition. In the process, the characters then introduce a time looping element that is should have made the plot more interesting but only adds more needless confusion to the already mind-boggling plot, and it's not until the roughly the hour and a half mark when the story begins to make reasonable sense. At that point, we are granted with our heroes engaging climatic showdown against creepy Slenderman-like creatures followed by a fight against devilish, glowy-eyed Samuel L. Jackson (an odd casting choice) filled with slick special effects and CGI. By the end, it fairly makes up for the sluggish narrative as does the performances. Asa Butterfield does a fine job as the protagonist but it's only disappointing that his character falls short of interest. In the midst of the crowded cast however, Eva Green is easily the standout in the performance department, giving a profound portrayal as the titular supporting entity.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a slick dark fantasy spectacle that is gracefully held up by Tim Burton's signature visual appeal above Jane Goldman's blemished screenplay. In fair words, Tim Burton's effort on rendering Ransom Riggs's popular source material come to somewhat satisfying results, even if it falls deep under the flairs of Burton's magnums opuses.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
66,pyrocitor,A feast of the eyes,7,4 October 2016,"You can immediately see what would attract Tim Burton to working on Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As far as his studio is concerned, it's for all the wrong reasons. Drawing from the most successful book ever spun out of a 'Creative Writing 101' writing prompt, Burton, like author Ransom Riggs, is drawn to the images. Twins in creepy, Gothic, circus bondage masks; a boy ensconced in a mask of bees; a Shirley Temple doppelgänger with gigantic fangs lurking amidst her curls - it all screams of Burton's Gothic camp. And the big-budget studio tween fantasy romance surrounding the pictures? Like Riggs' story, it's capably spun, but even more transparent about its underlying silliness. Taken generously, Burton's Miss Peregrine is a sly performance-art piece taking the p*ss out of the monolithic Divergent/Hunger Games style tween blockbuster. Like Burton's Shirley Temple surrogate, it's innocent on the outside, lazily going through the motions of plot and angst, but all the while waiting to bare its fangs of savage humour and abrasive oddness. And these precious glimmers don't disappoint.Initially, it's easy to cry autopilot. For its first third, Jane Goldman's screenplay largely snores through its beats of awkward outsider teen Jake being mental health shamed after a family death. It's irksome to feel the film rushing so heedlessly; Riggs' novel actually did a commendable job of concisely conveying the stigma of teen anxiety, but it's handled so offhandedly here, it's merely one more moot point in a stage-setting prologue that feels bored with its own existence. An early creature scare is a highlight, but even this feels too disinterested not to slide off. Things do take a turn for the fun when Jake mopes his way to Wales and stumbles across the titular home - Burton's 'X-Men for circus freaks' - but even this feels sadly by the numbers. It's too grounded in broad humour, solemn exposition, and gobbledegook about time loops for the weirdness to sufficiently steer. The main standout: the outstanding set direction, whisking from the muggy claustrophobia of the Florida suburbs to the rustic beauty of a near-deserted Welsh island with such vibrancy you can practically taste the saltwater spray. Still, you can practically feel your brain settling in for 'Tim Basic's Home for Bland Hollywood Tosh.""But then: a couple of moments too brazenly bizarre to gloss over. A pair of Welsh teenagers bursting into non-sequitur gangasta rap. A slow-mo WWII bombing set to the chipper ""Run, rabbit, run,"" cheekily straddling the boundaries of taste. There's Enoch (charismatically sullen Finlay MacMillan), who reanimates Toy Story-style disfigured dolls for vicious, stop-motion gladiatorial combat. Then, along comes Samuel L. Jackson and his shock white hair/eye/fangs combo, who's having an absolute ball breezily soaring over the top. Watching him beaming as he licks his fingers, chowing down on an elegant buffet of children's eyeballs, a realization finally kicks in. To Burton, the film is still all about the snapshots, the plot a vacuous nonsense excuse for a series of fun vignettes and bonkers imagery, and, in many cases, a sniggering sense of ""nah, they'd never let me get away with that - would they?"" When it comes to the grand storyline of a conflict as old as time between 'peculiars' and 'bad peculiars,' Burton is as glazed over as Chris O'Dowd's (exquisitely charming) deadbeat dad. He's only interested in the antagonistic context insofar as it allows him to put Sam Jackson in a Metropolis-meets-Forbidden-Planet helmet and watch smoke pour out his ears and his eyes fall out. He only allows trailer stinger fantasy vistas of a stolen romantic escape to an underwater ship for the chance to sneak in a panorama of bemused tables full of skeletons beaming like a still from Friends with fish squirming out of their eye sockets. The baddies - the ""Hollows,"" ferociously spindly monsters with javelin-stilt feet and disturbing tentacle tongues, are cheerfully far too disturbing for the target demographic, but also sneakily riff on Burton's own Jack Skellington design. And That Climax: pitting the stilt-walking Skellingtons against an army of Ray Harryhausen skeleton warriors in a freakish carnival brawl. Set to dubstep. It's so demented it's hard to decide if it's the stupidest or most awesome movie moment of the year. And you can practically see Burton shrugging at the execs, a sh*t-eating grin on his face, and tittering - ""Y'know - for the kids!"" Speaking of, the cast's, for the most part, are chirpily enjoyable background fodder. Asa Butterfield is inoffensively amiable, but so flat he doesn't so much speak his lines as yawn them, while Ella Purnell appears to keep sneaking glances off camera as she valiantly trots out another icky Captain America: Civil War 'I loved your grandparent; now I love you' subplot with commendable dignity. Thankfully, Eva Green's titular avian headmistress is exceptionally funny and intimidating, working more nuanced, edgy shrewdness out of a side-eye smirk than the material deserves. Cameos from Terrence Stamp (perfectly cast, but snoozy and checked out) and Judi Dench (delightfully blustery, but painfully underused) are cute, too. Still, it's unquestionably the Samuel L. Jackson show. His blips of screen time steadily situate him as chortling narrator/peanut gallery, and his launching into a patently volcanic Jackson rant (""I had to spend three days watching BIRDS in WALES!!"") lends a level of cathartic closure for having survived the wet burp of a first act. It's rare to see such a functionally gratuitous supporting performance overhaul the tone of an entire movie, but it's only through his winking, ravenously silly performance that the film makes sense - Burton isn't buying into the drab tween trappings so much as poking at their insipid dopiness, and (narrowly) succeeding.

71,RforFilm,"Tim Burton brings his style, but has trouble adjusting story elements of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children",6,26 October 2016,"You really have to feel for Tim Burton these days. He's still a highly imaginative director who has some major classics under his belt like Batman, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and of course, The Nightmare Before Christmas. There's no denying that his German Expressionism-style has given his films a look that's all their own. His recent output however, like Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows have failed to connect with his fans, as if they guy is afraid to adapt to his true style. Even Big Eyes, which I loved, seemed more like a traditional Hollywood film rather then a visionary's realized project.The closest that Burton felt most at home was with Frankenweenie, a stop motion animated movie that felt like a classic family-horror film from a black and white era. What that film had was no heavy computer animation that seems to be more in use by Tim Burton. I understand that CGI makes up most of the effects in Hollywood, but Burton is in his prime when he isn't using it. So how does he proceed with live action movie-making? He either needs to stick with original ideas or find stories that seem like his niche. In comes Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Young teen Jake Portman (played by Asa Butterfield) has great connection with his grandfather Abe Portman (played by Terrence Stamp), who told his grandson stories about his years during World War II and time spent a home for special children as run by Miss Peregrine. It comes as a shock when Jake finds his grandfather out in the swamp who asks him to find a bird and a loop before dying. Wanting to abide his grandpa's wishes, he gets the okay from his psychiatrist, Dr. Golan (played by Allison Janney) for him and his father to travel to where the home is, Wales.Jake's father thinks that his son wants closure, but is unaware of bigger quest involved. When Jake finds the home destroyed, he's greeted by a bunch of the peculiar children, who take him into a cave that's a time loop, sending him to 1943. They then take him back to the house, which is seemingly fine and where he meets the intimidating but kind Miss Peregrine (played by Eva Green). This is where he learns about the Hollows, peculiars that are monsters after a failed experiment. They're lead by shape shifter Mr. Barron (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who seeks the other children to eat their eyes. Will Jake be able to help the children, stop the monsters, and find truth to his grandpa's history?The good news is that this story is up Tim Burton's alley. The story of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, which is based off a novel of the same name, does give the director to add a lot of his creative flair with some great designs and sets (not to mention a skeleton fight that's paying homage to Jason and the Argonauts).The casting is also good as Asa Butterfield continues to prove a charismatic presence as does Eve Green who almost seems like a darker Mary Poppins. Tim Burton seems ready to go with this idea, and for the first hour, I was completely engrossed with the plot, but then the second half had to start. While it's not a bad way to go, but with the sudden jumps through time and many of the characters separating, you start to wonder whether this would have been better as a Netflix series or something? The problem this movie has is the same as many other young adult stories have as adaptations; trying explain the world and plot exposition under it's two hour running frame. This almost does, but you could tell the script was having trouble. If the story had been tighter and more focused, I might have called it a welcome return to live action for Tim Burton. Otherwise, it's standard.I'll give this six photos of peculiar children out of ten. It may have messy parts, but it's such a good-looking mess that I can see how fans of the books would probably be willing to overlook those parts. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children should probably welcome many people, though I might visit only once more.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

73,petra_ste,Do you want to know what killed me?,7,2 December 2020,"This is one of those ""mid Tim Burton"" movies, not up there with Ed Wood, Batman Returns or Big Fish but not down the well with Alice in Wonderland or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory either.Burton seemed like the perfect choice to deal with the material (adapted from the first book of a young adult fantasy series), as the director has always been enamored with bittersweet stories of creepy/poetic outcasts. The result is watchable but beyond its full potential.Young Jake (Asa Butterfield) loses his beloved grampa (the great Terence Stamp), who used to tell him incredible tales from his youth before being mysteriously killed. Jake visits an island in Wales to find out his grampa's stories were true: he finds a school with a group of superpowered children and teens, tutored by Miss Peregrine (Eva Green, always interesting).The headmistress and her pupils are stuck in a time loop in an ever-repeating day of 1943 - which Miss Peregrine resets every evening before a Nazi bombardment destroys their mansion - hiding from a group of sinister creatures hunting them.The first act is a little slow but the second gets genuinely compelling - I was on board with the movie at that point. There are some neat ideas: the ""peculiar children"" of unusual skills enjoying a sheltered, unending youth but unable to grow up and lead an actual life; Miss Peregrine Groundhog-Daying her routine, from answering the same phone call again and again to slaying a monster always attacking at the same hour. There were enough ideas for a whole mini-series in this section of the film.Sadly, the last act peters out into something conventional and nowhere as intriguing, the typical showdown with the Bad Guys™ - including a ghoulish Samuel L. Jackson, a usually fantastic actor who here hams it up like (appropriately) there is no tomorrow. The rules of time travel established earlier get sloppy and confusing; the themes of choice and loss get a very hasty ""love trumps all"" resolution. Pity, there was a great concept back in that second act. It's also weird how the script desperately hastens to tie up all loose ends, whereas the source material ended with an effective cliffhanger (and the book series is still going on - five novels and counting). I appreciate giving some closure in case you don't get to make a sequel, but this felt like deliberately torpedoing any chance of a second movie.Parental advice, this isn't for smaller children (younger than 10). The tone is mostly lighthearted but, in typical Burton fashion, there are creepy creatures (which look like they swam all the way from Silent Hill) and grotesque moments, including monsters gorging on their victims' eyeballs... yeah.6,5/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
74,bankofmarquis,Tim Burton creates another unique world,7,10 October 2016,"This review is for a film based on a book that I have read and really, really enjoyed, Ransom Riggs' MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN.Like many people, I was drawn to this book on the table at the bookstore based on the ""peculiar pictures"" featured in the book. These real life black and white photos inspired Riggs to write about a world of ""Peculiar"" children whee each one has a ""special skill"" and I read this book pretty quickly. When I heard about the movie, I thought 1 thing - Tim Burton better direct this thing, it is right up his alley.And I was right. MISS PEREGRINE is a weird off-beat film with weird off-beat characters in weird off-beat locations facing weird off- beat villains directed by the King of Weird and Off-Beat.If you like that, you'll like this movie, which I do and I did.Eva Green is perfectly cast as MISS PEREGRINE the person who is charged with watching over and protecting her group of ""peculiar children"", she is a sort-of mysterious and darker Mary Poppins who has a peculiar strength of her own. Her Miss Peregrine is quick, stern, strong, wicked and funny. A unique combination that is perfectly served by this unique actor. The rest of the cast is suitably cast for their roles, Asa Butterfield the ""normal"" kid that falls into this peculiar world, Terence Stamp, the grandfather that sends his child on his quest, Rupert Everett as a ""bird-watcher"" (believe me, there is more to him than that) and Judy Dench as another watcher of the ""peculiars"". All jump in with both feet and seem to be having fun with this field. Allison Janney and Kim Dickens are wasted in small, slightly larger than cameo roles. The big ""get"" in this film is Samuel L. Jackson as the main villain. Unfortunately, he seems to be miscast. His tone and cadence is jarringly different from the rest of the film and he just doesn't fit into it.But this film is about the visuals more than the acting and, make no mistake, this film is a TIM BURTON FILM, no doubt about it. He has built yet another quirky, off-kilter world that is interesting to look at and a wonder to behold. Think EDWARD SCISSORHANDS meets SWEENEY TODD meets BIG FISH and you get the idea. I know Burton is an acquired taste and most folks can only take him in small doses, but I like what Burton creates and was very fond of this world.Is this a perfect film, no? The battle at the end of the film left me a bit flat and the fact that they needed to shoehorn in every one of the children's ""peculiar"" traits to help succeed is admirable in it's attempt, but lacking in execution.All in all, a fun afternoon at the movies, one that is creepy and kooky during the Halloween season. Family friendly for the most part which is a rare treat indeed.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
75,Anurag-Shetty,A delightfully weird film.,8,11 October 2016,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a movie based on the novel of the same name. Jake(Asa Butterfield) uncovers clues to a secret, that extends throughout time. This leads him to discover Miss Peregrine's(Eva Green) Home for Peculiar Children. This place is a house in Ireland, for children with special abilities. Jake soon finds out other secrets about Miss Peregrine, the children she takes care of & other people like them. This puts them all in grave danger. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is an amazing film. Director Tim Burton has flawlessly brought to the screen, everything author Ransom Riggs envisioned in his novel. Also, this movie is right up there with other memorable Tim Burton movies like, Batman(1989), Batman Returns(1992), Edward Scissorhands(1990), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(2005), Alice in Wonderland(2010), Dark Shadows(2012) & Frankenweenie(2012). The visual effects are fantastical. All the kids' powers look wicked cool on screen. The 3D definitely amplifies, the overall viewing experience of the film. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel, beautifully captures the exotic locales in the movie. Eva Green is outstanding as Miss Peregrine. Asa Butterfield is brilliant as Jake. Samuel L. Jackson is mind blowing as Barron. Judi Dench is superb as Miss Avocet. Rupert Everett is impressive as the Ornithologist. Allison Janney is spectacular as Dr. Golan. Chris O'Dowd is hilarious as Franklin Portman. Terence Stamp is awesome as Abraham 'Abe' Portman. Ella Purnell is great as Emma Bloom. Finlay MacMillan is good as Enoch O'Conner.

The main flaw in this film is that, the massive acting talents of Samuel L. Jackson & Judi Dench are not utilized too much. Both Jackson & Dench barely have any screen time. If Jackson's character had more screen time, this movie would have been, even better. Apart from this minor annoyance, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a must watch.

76,dave-mcclain,"somewhat entertaining, but a little TOO peculiar",4,4 October 2016,"""Peregrine"" is a type of falcon, and the word has been used in music, business, transportation and the military and has also been applied to places, people and, most relevant to this movie review, characters in literature. Why such widespread and diverse applications of that word? Well, the peregrine falcon is large and very fast. The female is larger than the male and, typically able to fly at 200 m.p.h., making it the fastest creature on earth. Peregrine falcons are versatile birds, strong hunters and, as migratory birds, are found practically all over the world. Also, their feathers are a combination of white, black and blue-grey. Some of these characteristics may have started sounding familiar to those Movie Fans who enjoy children's literature, particularly American author Ransom Riggs' 2011 best-selling novel, and/or its identically-titled big-screen adaptation, ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" (PG-13, 2:07).As a fantasy film depicting a strange and original world, maybe the best way for me to start describing the movie is this: It's a combination of ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""The Woman in Black"", ""Divergent"" and ""Groundhog Day"". This film takes place primarily on an island off the coast of the British territory of Wales – where it is always September 3, 1943. Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine (Eva Green), who can turn herself into her namesake falcon, has created a 24-hour time loop at an isolated orphanage where she can protect a group of ""peculiar"" children with unique abilities. These children include Emma (Ella Purnell) who is lighter than air and can also control air, Olive (Lauren McCrostie), who can start fires (the powers of those first two being reversed from the characters in the book), invisible boy Millard (Cameron King), freakishly strong Bronwyn (Pixie Davies), Fiona (Georgia Pemberton), who can control plants, Horace (Hayden Keeler-Stone) who has prophetic dreams and can project them like a movie and Enoch (Finlay MacMillan), who can reanimate dead animals and people. There are also children whose peculiarities include a beehive in the stomach, an extra mouth and a paralyzing visage. Miss Peregrine knows that society would be unable to accept ""her"" children – and that they are constantly being pursued by humanoid monsters, led by a Mr. Baron (Samuel L. Jackson), who eat the children's eyeballs.For everybody's protection, every day is the same at Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children until they are visited by a teenage boy named Jacob ""Jake"" Portman (Asa Butterfield), who has peculiarities in his family. After his grandfather (Terrence Stamp) dies under mysterious circumstances, Jake's father (Chris O'Dowd) takes Jake to Wales where the boy can (hopefully) get some closure by investigating the strange and wild tales that gramps used to tell Jake about an island orphanage. As his father is off pursuing his hobby of bird watching (and befriending a fellow ornithologist played by Rupert Everett), Jake soon finds himself in Miss Peregrine's time loop. Miss Peregrine and the children for whom she cares are happy to meet Jake and have something new happening in their lives. Jake, who's unhappy with his life in 2016, is tempted to stay at the orphanage – partly because of his growing romantic interest in Emma (much to the displeasure of Enoch), and partly because he may hold the key to saving this peculiar and (mostly) sweet group of misfits from their unrelenting, unsympathetic evil pursuers.""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" effectively creates an original and fantastical world, but isn't always a lot of fun to watch. Some of the children's peculiarities are interesting, while others come off as just plain weird. Of course, ""weird"" is director Tim Burton's specialty and many Movie Fans like that sort of sensibility. However, I, and another member of the ""Movie Fan Community"" Facebook Page staff, found much of the film kind of off-putting. The set-up is interesting and parts of the movie are somewhat enjoyable, but the story's prevailing mood is pretty dark and a bit depressing, while the audience is left with no clear explanations for what is going on and some of the plot points are a little confusing. As movie reviewers, we're not passing judgment on the book, but merely evaluating what we saw on the screen and asking the one question we always ask when judging a movie: Is it entertaining? While fans of the book and/or the fantasy genre and/or Tim Burton's peculiar style of directing may well enjoy this movie, it's our opinion that the average Movie Fan will find it lacking.

77,MihaiSorinToma,An interesting idea,8,8 September 2017,"When a youngster discovers his grandfather dead in the forest behind his house, he senses something suspicious, so a letter he receives post-mortem only confirms his beliefs. He sets with his ignorant father to a remote island where he meets the famous Miss Peregrine who will present him an unknown world which seems to fit him better than the reality he knew before. Meeting a beautiful girl makes him even more attracted to the fantastic world but there are dangers to uncover, which point directly to his deceased grandfather. He must learn his powers in that world and do his best in order to protect his potential new home. It's a fantastic world which brings an alternative to a lonely boy, facing him with a hard situation in which he must act promptly. His attempts will prove to be clumsy, to say the least, but will eventually lead to a favorable situation. If the imaginary world as a whole is a good idea, well implemented and beautifully animated, the details and especially the teenage actors are the actual let- down. The main character, despite being very clumsy in almost everything he does, he doesn't seem able to make you believe his trauma, thus making everything look superficial.

Adapted from the novel of the same name by Ransom Riggs, the story travels through time and tells of strange kids with special abilities. With a cast of solid adult actors and a large group of young talent and no shortage of special effects, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is certainly an interesting and entertaining movie, but I couldn't help but think there was something more that didn't quite fit within the bounds of the film.First, as a novel adaptation, many of the plot points are explained rapidly and felt rather rushed leaving viewers unfamiliar with the intricacies of the book a bit lost as the character jump through time loops and witness unexplained superpowers harnessed by the individuals in the film. There is a nice mix of spookiness and comedy as this YA adventure plays out but I would have liked to see more of the horror aspect played up.

But at some point, I found it, it's dark and a little bit scary. I only watch it because Asa Butterfield was in it. Still, I can't say that I don't like it. Because of some reasons, I like it.Eating children's eyes? Really? That is the way to deal with it? I find it quite disgusting. I mean they could have chosen the other way to deal with that damned white eyes problem rather than this way.What I like of this film is that living that one day over and over again. Some films show even though you turned back in time, you can't stay in the same place that you stayed the last time. But in this film, the theory is quite different. Different doesn't mean not good.

85,CANpatbuck3664,"Weird But Endearing, Miss Peregrine's is a Decent Addition to the YA Franchise Crowd",7,11 December 2016,"I try to go into movies being as impartial as I can but when it came to Miss Peregrine's I did have some bias. Most of the more recent Tim Burton movies I have seen, I flat-out didn't like them. I haven't seen Big Eyes, or Frankenweenie but I thought Dark Shadows and Alice in Wonderland both sucked. So it wasn't till I saw the trailers for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children that I started to come around. It's hard not to draw parallels to X-Men but I hoped it could be it's own thing. In retrospect it was and admittedly Tim Burton was a good pick for a director to bring this material to life. It didn't work for me completely but considering the state of the YA genre (Divergent, The Seventh Son and The Host) this wasn't too bad.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Jake (Asa Butterfield) is your average teenager that gets bullied. He begins the movie by talking about how he feels like nothing he does ever matters. He has a minimum wage job and bides his time until his dad Franklin Portman (Chris O'Dowd) asks him to go check in on his grandfather Abe Portman (Terrence Stamp). Jake reflects a little on his relationship with his grandfather, how he used to babysit and tell him fantastical stories about how he grew up in a group home for special children. There was a girl who could float and a boy who could project his dreams onto a screen like a movie projector for example. Jake believed him completely until his class laughed at him and his parents told him that his grandpa was just disguising the truth from him. Their relationship deteriorated after that and they hadn't been the same.On the way there, he gets a call from Abe telling him to go back and that it wasn't safe to be there. Jake shows up anyway and finds his grandpa's place ransacked and the screen door ripped apart. He goes into the woods behind Abe's place and sees a monster in the shadows. It runs away but he finds his grandpa there missing his eyes. Jake tries to go for help but Abe grabs him and makes him promise to go visit the island with the group home and to enter the loop. Jakes has no idea what he's talking about but he promises to do so after his grandpa passes away.After having seen Miss Peregrine's I'm kind of confused with what age group the book is for. The movie deals with some pretty dark subject matter with children's eyeballs being eaten and Nazi bombs being dropped. But without giving too much away, the way the movie wraps up is pretty lame and seems like how you would finish a book for smaller kids. It didn't ruin the movie for me but I found the tone to be a little inconsistent.What makes this movie suitable for Tim Burton is some of the weirder touches that I mentioned above. I can't always get on board with his Gothic style but I thought he kept it tempered enough that he did a good job creating interesting looking characters. The environments look great, the special abilities are fun and are surprisingly edgy. The movie doesn't explain the rules of this world very well but that's more of a problem with this type of movie. This was a great match between the material and the right people to put it on the screen.Sometimes it's a great leading performance that really pushes the movie over the top. This is not one of those cases. Miss Peregrine's had some really great supporting performances but Asa Butterfield was really wooden as Jake. I get Jake is supposed to be detached but he was so stone-faced and unresponsive, it hampered how much I wanted his character to succeed.To be fair, some of the actors/actresses were really putting 100% in. Eva Green regularly chews scenery in whatever she's in but she's always fun to watch. She's subtle here compared to movies like Sin City: A Dame to Kill For or 300: Rise of an Empire and the movie is better for her being in it. Samuel L. Jackson is the really hammy one though but he's sharing the screen with Asa a lot so he needed to bring it for the both of them. This was also a great job by Terrence Stamp, it was nice to see him playing a good guy and he brings some warmth to Abe and his relationship with Jake. Emma Purnell was the best out of the peculiar children.I can't say this was a home run but I liked it well enough. I think it will find an audience and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel for it. There's space in this genre now that The Hunger Games has come and gone. It's not always an easy mix of the darker elements and it doesn't completely miss some of the genre clichés but it's different enough that hopefully people will pick up on it. Even if it doesn't stack up against Harry Potter or even the Hunger Games.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Tim Burton is like fine wine. He just seems to get better with age, as this movie is a good indication of.The movie starts out with a boy named Jake Portman who is believed to be mentally unstable with the only person truly believing in him being his Grandfather, Abe. Abe shares with him stories of a place he'd been to as a child, a home for peculiar children with astounding abilities or powers - a safe haven of protection from the outside world. But when Jake finds his Grandfather dead and with his eyes removed, he is driven to follow in his footsteps ... to find this home himself and get closure. His psychiatrist agrees, thinking this would help Jake with his issues. Based on this recommendation, his parents reluctantly agree.When Jake arrives, the house is dilapidated and ruined - or so he thinks. When he runs into the very same children his Grandfather described to him, at the same age as they were back then, he knows there is something much deeper and hidden behind the scenes. So, he enters their world to find out what exactly is going on.This is a wonderful movie with awesome special effects, acting and cinematography. The story was well wrought and comes full circle nicely. All questions are answered satisfactorily. You are whisked away into a world of intrigue and fantastical mystery, and when you are in the ""loop"" with Jake, you don't want to leave. The characters were all developed well and had a pivotal part in the overall story.I highly recommend this movie for adults and teens alike. This is Tim Burton at his best.

87,SquigglyCrunch,An Original Concept Weighed Down by the Plot Holes Involved When it Comes to Explaining Time Travel,5,12 November 2016,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children follows a young boy who discovers a secret, unseen fantasy world where people, mostly children, live with supernatural abilities. Either that or Asa Butterfield has inherited dementia from his grandfather. The concept itself is kind of interesting. Have we seen it before in the land of generic Hollywood movies? Yes. But the way it's presented in both the trailers and in the film itself is very different from others before it, like X-Men or Harry Potter. The word 'peculiar' is perfect for describing the feel of this movie. And the way it plays out is, while confusing, intriguing to say the least. The peculiar children themselves are just that, mostly. Their abilities are often far-fetched and really not what you as the audience would expect. Unfortunately a lot of these characters were revealed in the form of advertising, so very few actually came as a surprise. What I did and didn't like was the consistency, or rather lack of. The characters range from having actual abilities to just being a certain way. I liked it because it made it seem just that much more bizarre, but I didn't like it as much because not everything always fit perfectly into the film. One thing I will say that I didn't like about the peculiar children, however, was often their abilities. It seemed like more often than not, especially as revealed by the end, the children's abilities seemed like they existed almost solely for combat. Sure, not all of them are, but a large portion of them certainly seemed that way. I don't want to give away the children's abilities for those who are hoping to avoid spoilers, but you'll probably understand what I mean by the end of the film, if you watch it. Another gripe I had was the sheer amount of plot holes. Yes, this is a time travel movie, and yes, it unfortunately does make the attempt to explain time travel. Many a film has fallen to this impossible task, and this is no exception. While it finds a cool way to explain it that I think could actually be perfected and who knows? Maybe it already is, but I found myself confused more often than not. And yes, I certainly tried to piece it all together, but it simply didn't always make sense when the characters tried to explain it. The special effects were kind of terrible too. I found that almost every CGI scene came off as glaringly fake. It was so blatant it kind of hurt sometimes. The fact that someone looked at this and said that it was acceptable for a 2016 audience. Did it look awful all the time? No. But more often than not it was just fake-looking. Also the opening scene was horrendous. I already didn't have particularly high hopes for the movie, and that did nothing to help. The movie made a desperate attempt to make the audience relate to the main character, and instead he came off as completely unrealistic and just plain stupid. It tries to cram a decent amount of meaningless exposition into one of the first lines to give the audience the impression that Jake was a generic high school boy with anxiety, and it was terrible to watch how incredibly unnatural it was, both in delivery and writing. As for the performances, they were fine. Nothing to write home about except Asa Butterfield. The best way I can describe his performance is that of a brick with a note attached that has been thrown through a store window. It sucks at first, but when you read the note you learn that it's from your son, and it says that your cat, which has gone missing for more than four days, has been found and safely returned home. While your relieved, it does little to compensate for the window and you just wish your son would have figured out a better way to deliver the news. Basically Butterfield delivers as good a performance as a brick for the first few scenes. He's wooden (or clay in this case) and not at all into the movie or the performance, but later manages to get his act together enough to pull off an okay performance. I just wish he could have been okay right off the bat, instead of wasting our time with the first bit.Overall Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has a, while not new concept, intriguing and somewhat originally presented one. The story is cool, as are the children. However, issues with acting, time travel plot holes, and the special effects weigh this movie down to just something not worth mentioning. In the end I'd probably still recommend this movie because at least it's not boring, but it's nothing to get excited about.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
88,harryplinkett14,An unpleasant mess,1,5 October 2019,"Not only is this a total mess of a film, but it's an unpleasant one. And that really puts me off.You see, it's a kind of a fairy tale about weird children and weird monsters that haunt them. The only problem is that the children are as monstrous as the creatures stalking them. In other words, one ends up watching abominations on the screen from beginning to end.But as I said, apart from being unpleasant, the film is a mess - in terms of storytelling. Story is both extremely convoluted and non-existent. Untangle this mess, and you have virtually no story. Also, you have no characters. Technically, there are dozens of them, but they are all wafer thin, including the protagonists. We just don't care for them. Moreover, the villain is poorly developed and comes across as useless. He isn't scary, and his motivations remain obscure. Then there is the tone, which shifts in confusing ways, something Burton is known for, unfortunately. And finally, there is the ending, which provides no payoff for the audience. It's more confusing nonsense, and I guess an attempt is made to make it romantic, but it fails abysmally.This was another attempt by Burton to create a film with a million weird and often grotesque creatures, which become so self-indulgent that it forgets all about the plot or characters. The producers really should have intervened here.All in all, I give this film zero stars. I was tricked into wasting almost two hours of my life by a director who really should have known better at this stage in his career.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
89,p-jonsson,Quite nice family movie,7,25 February 2018,"Before I start I should perhaps mention that, although I consider this a family movie, it is perhaps a bit on the scary side for the youngest member of the family. Anyway, personally I liked the movie and so did my kids. It did have time travel in it which I, in general, utterly dislike but it is a Tim Burton movie so it was already a foregone conclusion that it would be a wee bit bizarre anyway and it had Eva Green, which is one of my favorites, in it so that kind of made up for the time travel crap.The movie starts of by Jacob watching his grandfather being murdered by some mysterious being that only he can see. Of course everyone believes that he was hallucinating and so off we go with hospitals and shrinks and so on. Finally his parents allow him to travel to the island of Cairnholm in search of the mysterious Miss Peregrine.From their on we wander into the wonderful world of ""Burtonesque"" bizarreness, fantasy and general weirdness. Naturally Jacob meets Miss Peregrine and her kids. Kids who each have some peculiar talent each more weird than the other.Naturally there are a some bad guys lurking in the shadows as well. Bad guys intent on destroying Miss Peregrine's shelter and ... well, let us just say that they are not exactly concerned for the children's wellbeing. I liked the bad guys. Both in their half human form and their more scary monster form. I especially liked Samuel L. Jackson as Barron, the boss bad guy. He really made an excellent performance.The one person I did not like was Jacob's father. Apart from being a jerk he looked like he was on drugs or sleeping pills throughout the entire movie.On the whole this was perhaps not the best of Tim Burtons movies but it was still a good and enjoyable one. Decent special effects. The story worked despite the enormous paradoxes introduced by the time travel stuff. The characters did a fair performance. I did not regret the 2+ hours I spent on watching it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
90,James_De_Bello,6.5/10,6,9 December 2016,"After his grandfather's death, teenager Jacob (Asa Butterfield) decides to embark on a journey towards a Welsh island about which his grandfather used to tell him weird stories that he claimed to be actually true about his life. When Jacob gets there he is ready to accept that those were only fairy tales, yet when he discovers Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children he discovers he might just have found a world where he belongs and much, much more.Bruno Delbonnel as DP, Jane Goldman as screenwriter, Eva Green as leading lady, Samuel Jackson as the villain and Tim Burton as director are all elements that combined to this quirky and fascinating premise, indicate towards something to be excited about. Unfortunately, this picture does not deliver the adventure we might have imagined, yet by all means it manages to carry you to a colorful, wacky world that I might actually want to revisit sometime.If there is something you know you will get when watching a Tim Burton film that is impeccable production design and art direction, this one is no exception and quite the contrary it might just be his best looking film and I don't mean that lightly. The frame ratio is unusual and immediately helps in giving the movie this retro tone that really fits it. Moreover, the material is just perfect for interesting visual flare and the whole filmmaking team rises to the occasion. This film is simply beautiful to look at and in a way that really absorbs the viewer into the world. There isn't any flashy imagery or CGI extravaganzas thrown at the screen for the sake of it, it is brilliantly shot by Delbonnel who makes the most out of the magnificent design put together by the art team. The two just complement each other in what is a picture that oozes with stunning visuals that don't have the need to call attention to themselves and support the story in its every beat.All of the beautiful imagery described above surrounds a world that is lively and believable, filled with great, unique characters that are easily distinguishable both because of their peculiarities, but even better because of their personalities. Jane Goldman is a fantastic screenwriter, especially in this kind of genre and once again she gives proof of being able to write instantly recognizable, relatable and vivid characters. The cast fills her pages perfectly and overall establishes great chemistry between each other and a dynamic that is jumpy and funny without ever loosing a touch of emotion. Eva Green is a great actress and when put in this kinds of roles she always shines distinctively. You feel for all of these people and really like being in their company in their quirky and adorable house. Furthermore, there is a really touching relationship established from the get go between Jacob and his grandfather played beautifully by the great Terence Stamp. It gives the film a deeply emotional value from the get go and never looses it going on.Where the movie, really unfortunately, looses itself is in the forwarding of plot and story. It is just too f**king convoluted for its own good. The mythology established is way, way too complicated and just unnecessarily so. It starts delving into time traveling in a way that isn't clear in the least and then it adds another subplot for Jackson's villain that is even more convoluted. Halfway through I was already getting lost in the logistics of it all and started not even caring about the consequentiality of the events anymore. Fortunately it is a film that lends itself very much with the audience just rolling with it, but still there was no way to make heads or tails of so much that was going on.And the worst part is that it was so frustrating, because the rest of the elements are just so good you would like to get lost in these characters, but you just can't and it is very unfortunate, this was a film that deserved slightly better than it got and it is sad to see it fall short of the amazing content it managed to grace the audience with.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
91,coreyjdenford,Not very peculiar,6,2 October 2016,"This is my review of Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children (spoiler free)*** (3/5) Director Tim Burton is a very weird and peculiar person and has had quite a strange and rather long career trajectory than most so it seemed that he was the right fit to make a film like this. Based on the 2011 novel by Ransom Riggs it turned into a rather strange bestseller for people who seemed to want a horror, story but in the film it seems to go for the familiar edge rather than the, peculiar edge and doesn't seem to go for the same originality as the book. Essentially it's X-Men (an X-Men movie that Tim Burton never made) but with children and seems to still the darker Gothic look that he is famous for, but just because it's darker doesn't necessarily mean it's better and this also goes for the idea of the longer the film the better much like Steven Spielberg's The BFG, which had the idea of being overlong and rather tedious. Unlike The BFG were almost every scene was outstaying it's welcome this, makes sure that every scene makes a larger and peculiar impact.Every child has a unique special ability and with the character development it only focuses on the main characters and only give the other children a very small showing of their peculiarity, also the mains taking the reins to make sure that the story goes their way. At first the story focuses on Jake (Asa Butterfield more grown up) who is a very strange hero and doesn't realize he has a peculiarity but as the story goes on he starts to discover it and all that time he thought he was normal living a normal life with his father, (Chris O'Dowd) until his grandfather (Terrance Stamp) tells Jake that he isn't as normal as he thought. However his father seems to think that Jake is going through a few mentality problems, so Jake tries so hard to tell his father that he has powers. Predictability is a strong sense with a story like this and all the time the story goes it feels even more predictable.Miss Peregrine (Eva Green making yet another appearance in a Tim Burton flick), shows Jake that he is more special however her unique ability in the book as a peculiar that takes control of time in a time loop, in a scene that's with the home about to be blown up by a Nazi bomb Jake gets the chance to see Peregrine's ability as it's quite spectacular but it's a rare moment that could have been longer and better executed. The story seems to go very fast towards the happy ending but as it goes on it's pace is just trying to speed along through the mentality and through, the time loops that it wants to get to the point pretty sharpish, a good thing as that is something the BFG and the latest X-Men didn't do.As a movie like this has a giant ensemble of characters there are only a few that make a decent impact Jake the hero, Emma (Ella Purnell) a girl who can take control of air and is as light as air and has to wear these special made of lead to keep her attached to the ground, Miss Peregrine as stated above and the villain the leader of the hollowghasts Barron (Samuel L. Jackson making an appearance in yet another giant movie), who tries to end Miss Peregrine's and her children but as predictability is the strength in this movie you probably know that he doesn't succeed. It's not as dark as other Burton movies anyone remember Beetlejuice? It's still an enjoyable rather non-peculiar tale and there is still loads to admire even with the speedy plot.Despite the predictability and the rather lumbered and speedy plot lacking in character development this a rather decent addition into the ever growing weird and wonderful genre. And rather striving for originality it takes the plot of another film with peculiars as the main characters does it remind of X-Men? Because it should lest we forget another weird and wonderful addition to Tim Burton's ever growing career.VERDICT: While neither as dark, nor as peculiar as you'd expect from Tim Burton there's still much here to admire.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

93,Ramascreen,Another magical masterpiece from Tim Burton,9,25 September 2016,"#MissPeregrinesHomeForPeculiarChildren is a Tim Burton movie through and through. There are elements of ""Frankenweenie"" in it, there's a little bit of ""Big Fish"" too and ""Edward Scissorhands"" as well, full of goth and oddities, if this film had been directed by somebody else, it would've done the story disservice because the world and the characters that author Ransom Riggs created in his novel are pretty much in Tim Burton's neck of the woods. Some might even describe this as the X-Men movie that Tim Burton never made.Scripted by Jane Goldman (""Kick-Ass,"" ""X-Men: First Class"") I don't want to give too much away here but let me briefly tell you the plot which focuses on a young kid named Jake (Asa Butterfield). One day, an incident befalls his grandfather, which then leads Jake to visit Wales, the location of the orphanage from his grandfather stories. In his search, he encounters the peculiar children that his grandfather had talked so much about and they lead him to Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) who explains to Jake that she is a ymbrynes, which is a peculiar that can create time loops which then keeps their place safe but it also means that they're stuck in a certain day of a certain year. All of this must be done due to WWII and the monsters, hollowgasts that hunt down peculiar children for their eyes. The leader of those hollowgasts is Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) who'll stop at nothing in his quest for immortality.MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN is an adventure film that's wildly mesmerizing, and because the kids have powers or special abilities, it's also full of visual wonder, the movie magic is in high gear for most of the time. It takes someone with an active imagination like Tim Burton to bring an already imaginative story come to life on the big screen.Part of what makes Ransom Rigg's novel special and popular is that it contains vernacular photographs as a guide to put together the narrative. Burton incorporates some of that into the film but they're there mainly at the beginning, just to set up the context. The design for the hollowgasts and what they eat to sustain themselves or to survive, some might see it as too scary for younger viewers, but I see it more as gnarly. But that's the thing though with many of Tim Burton's family adventure movies, they're never meant to walk on egg shells. They are fairy tales that find beauty in the dark and they bring out courage in characters that society marginalizes, and MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN is no different.The kids featured in this film are so adorable, once you get past or get used to their peculiarities, and some can be shocking, you'll find them to be absolutely adorable. And once they start teaming up and working together, it's so easy to cheer or root for them. Those who know me well know that I'm a huge Eva Green's fan, her involvement is definitely this film's big attraction to me, but I think she's just absolutely perfect in this role, Green has that natural instinct when it comes to playing mysterious powerful character, she previously showed it in ""Penny Dreadful"" series and now she unleashes that same vibe for this film. I guess you could say that MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN is kind of like Mary Poppins meets X-Men meets Tim Burton, and it's a winning combination.-- Rama's Screen --",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
94,jamiedarlow-37510,Surprisingly creepy and fantastical adaptation!,7,5 April 2020,"Based on the book series by Ransom Riggs, Jake (Asa Butterfield) is a troubled young man who is fascinated by a story his grandfather told him when he was a boy. After his grandfathers untimely death, he is obsessed with finding out the reality behind this story and goes to a scarcely populated town in Wales where the orphanage in the story is said to be. The main highlights of the film are when it gets really dark and takes a sinister turn; for example, Enoch (Finlay MacMillan) likes to taunt Jake upon their meeting and this brings a couple of intense scenes with Enoch bringing dead material back to life by shoving a heart into their chests. The villainous antagonists are also ridiculously spooky; Slenderman-esque creatures that crave children's eyeballs to feast on in order to morph into humans.... it's as creepy and darkly comic as that sounds! Really top end 12a certificate stuff and that's when Burton gets to work his magic and project beautifully grotesque imagery on screen.

95,doug_park2001,"""We don't discuss the future here""",9,5 October 2016,"After witnessing the horrible death of his ""dementia""-stricken grandfather, with no one believing what really happened and everyone assuming that he has ""mental health issues,"" Jacob Portman finds himself back in 1943 at Miss Peregrine's home on Cairnholm, an island off the coast of Wales, immediately after his grandfather left the wartime safe-house to join the British Army. Miss Peregrine's home is for ""peculiar"" children, and Jacob's company there includes weightless and aerokinetic Emma, with whom he quickly falls in love, pyrokinetic Olive, invisible Millard, and several others. The gothically beautiful Miss Peregrine is an ""ymbryne"" who can turn into a bird and manipulate time. *Note: Some of the names, ages, and abilities from the book have been changed or reversed, and for the sake of simplicity, there are fewer children.* There, Jacob discovers his own ""peculiar"" abilities and the important mission that awaits him.The first two-thirds of this film (from the director of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Corpse Bride"") more than justify sitting through all of it. In terms of sheer originality, ""Miss Peregrine's Home"" rivals the Harry Potter series, the Oz stories, and all but the very best of Disney. That being said, it probably isn't for really young children: Some disturbing monsters and death imagery, along with a fairly complex plot. No serious gore though: Most ""tweeners"" or older can most likely handle it. There are a number of truly beautiful moments along with some keen nuances regarding who's really crazy, what's really real, the fine differences between people, and the unique strengths and weaknesses that make up every individual. MPHPC is expertly filmed, with some breathtaking visuals of Cairnholm, and the acting by most of the major players is equally great, with special kudos going to Eva Green as Miss Peregrine, Finlay MacMillan as Enoch, and Ella Purnell as Emma.Unfortunately, things start to derail toward the end, degenerating into some of the worst action-horror clichés at the climax. The ending's very pretty but is so hurried that it's a little hard to make sense of. It seems that MPHPC's makers couldn't quite pack the essential story-line of Ransom Riggs's novel into two hours, a common problem (i.e., pacing) in so much of today's filmmaking. I would have welcomed another 30-60 minutes of this, but oh well. Seeing this film made me all-the-more eager to read the book.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Almost everyone but me has heard of this book and was eagerly awaiting the film. Not knowing the book I was excited to see the film because I know someone in it, and although a fan of some of Tim Burton's work I can't say I like all of it. However, this film is one where Tim Burton has produced his very best. Miss Peregrine is a dark tale of monsters, family and friendship showcasing a cast of well know actors and some up and coming stars. I'm not going to even try to explain the plot except to say there are good guys, bad guys and a series of time loops designed to keep the peculiar children safe. Samuel L Jackson was a great twisted villain and Ella Purnell who played Emma, able to manipulate air whilst clomping around in enormously heavy lead boots, was able to portray emotion with a mere look as well as her body language, is certainly making a name for herself and justifiably so.

Tim Burton was the perfect choice to direct this movie, because the creepy tone and style match the book perfectly. Some elements of the plot don't make very much sense, but that's ok, because despite it being somewhat convoluted at times, it's still very enjoyable. The only people in the cast that I think could have done better are Asa Butterfield and Samuel L. Jackson. I liked Asa Butterfield in ""Ender's Game,"" but here, he delivers almost every line in a flat and wooden way. He couldn't sound more uninterested if he tried. (If he was even trying at all, that is.) As for Samuel L. Jackson, his role is a little too over the top. I like when actors have fun, but they can overact, and Jackson's performance in this movie is an example of that. I enjoyed the story, and especially the cinematography. Every shot is so perfectly, that it's hard not to get immerresed in this movie's world. I know that's an odd thing to praise, but it's just so well done.

Samuel Jackson plays the Mr Barron character with wit and charm but he sure is a delight.

100,ayoreinf,Too egotistical and not honest about it,7,13 October 2016,"I've read the novel, before seeing the movie. In fact, I made a point of finishing it before seeing the movie. That's the reason an otherwise nice film, that I would've ranked 8 got to 7.You see, I don't mind the director and script writer changing a book a bit here and a bit there. Actually, I wouldn't even mind if they decide to re-imagine the story, as long as they're being honest about it. Tim Burton was honest about it when he re-imagined Alice in Wonderland, and I liked him more for his honesty. That's not what happens here. The movie starts fairly close to the novel with minor changes. Most of them unexplained, but as they were minor I thought to myself I shouldn't be fussing too much over minute details. I should've known better, when a movie based on a novel starts with tiny insignificant changes just for the changes sake, it hardly ever stops there. I've long complained about the egos of script writers and directors getting in the way of the final product. I've said at least once already that I find it very much like an intellectual theft. A script writer and a director practically steal an original idea and then treat it as if it was their own property.The changes taking place in the second half of the movie are pushing it way too far beyond the novel. They take the plot into places the story couldn't go to, and shouldn't go to. Had it been their own story, it would've been their right. But it wasn't, and then it's simply dishonest. And it also misleads the audience, who paid for being misled. Other than this complaint, it's a nice enough movie, who's similarity to X-Men is only skin deep. Not every story about mutations fighting for survival is the X-Men. Of course there are some similarities, but there are even more obvious differences, which are clearer in the book, but I've already complained about that, so that's about it. Not all that bad, but too egotistical and dishonest about it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
101,ritera1,An agitating mess,5,5 December 2016,"Very information heavy. A gaggle of characters, over and over, broadcast quite a bit of backstory capped off with a very pedestrian action ending.The kid (who wasn't that good) has a lot of backstory with grampa. Then he has a lot of backstory with Miss Peregrine. Then Miss Peregrine has a lot of backstory about Jackson's bad guy character and the other bad guys. I didn't read the book but thought the story was groping for clarity at every step. Talk, talk, talk.Then I was also uncomfortable with how they sexualized what was essentially a female character in Emma well under 18 years old. Although the actress is 20, that didn't help.Nevermind the inconsistencies. Jackson's bad guy knows the kid is going to the island to try and find the Miss Peregrine home. He knows where the old house is. He knows that a loop would be nearby. He doesn't stake it out? Doesn't search around himself? Nevermind that one of the creatures actually finds them but is killed by Peregrine. (And who made that outline of the dead creature? Time was rolled back so it should not have been there.) So two of them found the house as one was killed and one killed a kid. And what was that other entrance that the kid went into where Jackson followed? The entrance and exit were the same up 'til that point.Apparently one of the creatures kills one of the kids previously off screen. Peregrine roll back time on that one? The invisible kid's clothes are not invisible but the creatures' clothes are? Peregrine's clothes also turn into a bird? Jackson's bad guy shape shifts and so do his clothes? Where'd that kid get those hearts? It was the only peculiarity that required objects. Emma initially ejects the water from part of the ship. Okay. But everything was soaked. But ejecting the water from the entire ship made it float to the top? And everything worked after being soaked?And I was totally confused what Jackson's final experiment actually was going to do. And going back to the beginning it was even jarring between the initial credits and the first shot. It was then I knew I was in trouble.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
102,nicolechan916,Extraordinary,8,16 October 2016,"As with anything Burton creates, this is a magical film with a dark finish. Like Alice in Wonderland (2010), Burton has created an adult version of a children's fairy tale story. If I was a kid, I would definitely be freaked out by Burton's films, even though the story is targeted towards children. The colors, costumes, settings (basically the mise-en-scene) heavily affected the film's outlook. They complemented each other well, and you can expect the features of any Burton film to be in complete harmony with each other. I was really quite impressed with the film, and enjoyed watching it. The acting was pretty great. Butterfield is a good casting choice for his character, as he has that curious, good boy look. Him and Purnell have good chemistry together, though one has to not think too much about who their mutual contact is. The rest of the peculiar children cast did a good job in their roles as well.But the person who really astounded me, was Eva Green as Miss Peregrine. She plays her part so impeccably, and her make-up and costume does so well to compliment her character, that it creates a phenomenal persona. On the other hand, I could not take Samuel L. Jackson seriously. While his character did come off as a little scary, his speech felt a little more comedic than it probably should have been.As for the story, it did follow the lines of something that would appeal to children. Plus, the characters are children too, so it resonates with the targeted audience. I just did not like the way the film ended. It fast forwarded and condensed a month into two minutes. While they did explain how time loops worked in the film, the ending was too fast and confusing to comprehend, which also made it feel too easy.Overall though, an enjoyable watch with great settings, music, and directing.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
103,austin0731,Miss Peregrine's home for gifted youngsters?,6,2 October 2016,"Great set pieces and costume design, as most Tim Burton films, the abilities of the characters in this film were also very well met to fit the odd tone of Burton's work. Great characters and quite an interesting kick off point for a potential trilogy? Although it has very obvious similarities to the X-men including the themes of being an outsider and such I personally feel that it did manage to differentiate itself from Marvel's X-men. Mostly through this Tim Burton vibe that this film quite strongly possesses. Although I liked the characters and the overall premise of the film I did find it quite predictable and nonsensical at times, lots of unexplained things too. Quite a lot of things were 'too conveniently placed' and sort of just happen to be there, and was just too predictable with no surprises throughout. Also about the characters, there were many others that just seem a lot more interesting but get very few screen time, most notably the twins. Although towards the end we finally get a look at their abilities I do find them by far the most interesting and mysterious characters who I personally would've wished to explore more. One of my biggest issues however was with the villain of the film, Samuel L Jackson's portrayal of the big bad just comes out as odd. His motivations weren't well realized and his presence was not really felt until the later quarter of the film. Perhaps more build up from the beginning would give me more of an understanding of this villain.Also as it seems all so obvious that this is a story of fitting in and being an outsider, I don't feel at all that this is presented in a good way at all. I did not find this aspect empowering or such but just strange, it was as if the creators were trying to say that seeing these other guys with strange abilities somewhat makes everything good and therefore makes Jake feel better, or different about himself. There are obviously great intentions behind it but the creative choice made just seems extremely odd a choice to have made.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children tells the story of Jake who's grandfather has just died. He had told him a story about a home in whales for children who have weird abilities. Jake goes but finds out it was burned down but when Jake goes threw a cave he finds the home of peculiar children owned by Mrs Peregrine and that they are living threw a sort of loop and they reverse every day. The children in this movie have special abilities like OK right. One is as light as a feather and can float in aid and can breath threw water. One can make weird doll creations. One can set things on fire by using her hands. Then there are the others who weren't seen too much,one was invisible,there were two twins that didn't have a power to be honest,one had a mouth at the back of her head,one little girl was the strongest girl in the world,one boy could show his dreams to people and lastly there was a girl that could like make things grow with her mind.

From the beginning it was very mysterious and terrifying but as movie goes and Jacob finds peculiar's movie just takes turn in amazing fantasy. Throughout movie Burton tries to hide details but they are almost every time so obvious and as movie is going more towards end it loses it's potential. Last 30 minutes as much as fun they were more than that they were dull and boring that much that drama in those scenes was laughable. As for visual effects and scenes movie just very beautiful and feels like fairy tale but very dark one. At the end movie totally turns for romance and emotions which was fine but not preferable. There was a lot of moments that are just skipped and throws us in different scene immediately. Eva as Peregrine was incredible, from charm to emotions she was great. Asa (Jacob) and Ella (Emma) felt like the lead characters and everything was about them, they are good both in their roles. Samuel L Jackson was Barron and it seems like he picked that role because it seemed fun to him but on screen he was not that intimidating despite his darkness rather character that you would laugh to. 2.5/4",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
106,pontram,Great until the Finale,7,17 August 2017,"Great Actors, great Visuals, a nice Story, and a renowned director - what could possibly go wrong with a movie ?Well, almost nothing for that matter, but some things nonetheless went wrong with 'Miss Peregrine'. First, Eva Green. While it's always a pleasure to watch her, she is clearly underemployed for her possibilities, which we had the honor to witness in the series 'Penny Dreadful'. Next, the time loop concept, which is a paradox in itself - the first question that occurs is why people do not age inside a loop, despite they live a linear non-looped life. Which is practically eternal life, something that the bad guys want for themselves and do not see that they would only have to ask for nicely ? - Well its doubtful that someone like Ms. Peregrine would maintain a personal loop for those monsters... - And next, the villain is somehow colorless, even if it's Samuel L. Jackson, and even if he and his fellow Monsters do eat their victim's eyes before/while/after killing them, which (the eating) is quite graphically shown, including a big heap of extracted eyes. Which leads me to another question, who is the target audience, adults or minors ? - I also had to scratch my head about the sometimes used term 'soft parts', which in my translation only means genitals, not the eyes.But those are the smaller malfunctions. The real failure of the movie begins when it gathers speed, after (Spoiler ahead) an absolutely breathtaking scene with a sunken shipwreck that is brought to life by the children's abilities (ignoring any physics and the reason why this ship sunk, of course - where is the big hole in its bottom). Before that, the movie is quite entertaining and fulfills its purpose of introducing us to its world and its characters, never boring, though a bit slow paced. But, to add another facet, at this point every possible mystery the movie had until then, is revealed and gone, which is also disastrous for a environment that breathes mysteries. There is nothing more lurking around the corner than a bunch of monstrous not-so-much-frightening thugs.So when the movie is clearly announcing that ""now it's showtime, please fasten your seat belts"", which is after 1 hours 30 minutes (!), it actually slows down and processes the way to the end in a series of rather less impressive, less imaginative events. I had the impression that the director and writer lost their interest in their child after those one and a half hours, after they brought it to life so well. And despite the movie's anti-climatic direction, it also feels more and more hasty executed towards the end. There is also a moment which shows that the abilities of two of the children alone, if used much earlier, would have saved the day with ease.However, on the bright side is, that finally the main characters - a young boy and a girl - are sympathetic and reasonable, although some of their decisions are not quite comprehensible. While watching I thanked Burton for every minute I did not despise Jacob or Emma.And of course visuals and scenery are simply a pleasure.That I still rated it 7/10, considering all the criticism above, may show how near this was to a masterstroke.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
107,imizrahi2002,WOW! i am truly surprised at all the negative reviews...,8,4 October 2016,"i've been NOT liking tim burton movies for a loooong time...they LOOK great but usually fail to deliver storywise...or executionwise, as with the planet of the apes...how did he mess that up? too much 'look', not enough character development, etc...it DID look good. ;-) but i LOVED this movie...and, btw, where is eva green in the credits? that's a bit weird...not having the actor's name whose character the film is named after. at least in part. the whole thing felt very harry potter to me. but darker. which i think a lot of people weren't expecting. then OTHers were expecting the book. a movie is a movie. the book is the book. whether you or i like it or not. if nothing else, isn't it great that there's at least 2 similar works if you like one of them? just think if there was only the OTHER one! ;-). i agree with one reviewer who said the first half was better than the second...but that doesn't mean the second half was bad. i had a good time with this one...despite the darkness of the film(which i don't mind if it fits the story. which it did), i still felt like a little kid on a Saturday afternoon in the safety of the movie theater...",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
108,SpoilerAlertReviews,Peculiar is just a polite word for bizarre.,6,30 September 2016,"Well, it's exactly as the title suggests. Peculiar indeed. I think ""peculiar"" is just a polite way of saying bizarre, but it's Tim Burton's kind of bizarre, so it shouldn't be that much of a shock if you're familiar with his work, and if you're not, I suggest you watch some of his awesome catalogue, especially Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish and any of his stop-motion work. We've established I don't read nowhere near as much I as would like (it's a choice between book or cinema time?) so I haven't read Ransom Riggs' titular novel on which this filmed is based. However I am aware of Jane Goodman doing the screenplay, who's best known for her work on The Kingsmen, X-Men First Class and The Woman In Black. Asa Butterfield is becoming quite the unlikely child hero, previously playing Hugo in Hugo and Ender in Ender's Game, this being next venture as Jake, an unknowing peculiar who goes to Wales in search of the truth surrounding his Grandfather Abe, played by Terence Stamp. He, of course finds the mysterious house, and meets Eva Green's Miss Peregrine and the rest of the household's inhabitants, a bunch of bizarre children with extraordinary abilities. Miss Peregrine is like a darker version of Mary Poppins, all-knowing yet quite enigmatic where as the children are as bold as anything. The house is like a wee cottage version of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. There's going to be some bright new stars from this bunch of young casters. Especially Ella Purnell, hot stuff, Lauren McCrostie, Hayden Keeler-Stone who looks like a child version of Patrick Stewart! And Mr. Holmes' Milo Parker who I immediately recognised from Robot Overlords. He's quite the actor but a little disappointed he didn't get much screen time here. It's quite scary for a children's film, and possibly too confusing looping time-travel in there. But this is a Tim Burton movie after all and I can't comment if the book is the same, but the children are being hunted by ""Hollows"", no-eyed monsters with elongated limbs, who have an appetite for eyeballs. Seriously, they're quite gruesome. One thing I can say about the book, is that Samuel L. Jackson's character was written into the movie and does not appear in the novel, himself being fabricated for dramatic purposes, which does seem to be the weak link in the film. Jackson being the chief of the ""Hollows"" leading a band of worser-still peculiars. He actually finds it hard not to curse, but this film won't be making any of his mofo montages on YouTube. Still, he does good playing bad and is actually quite enjoyable to watch. Aside from Jackson's role, the plot on the whole is quite flimsy, or it just doesn't fit well together and feels quite messy. A lot of it being quite anticlimactic, even Jake's peculiarity isn't wholly amazing and leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" As his grandfather's pet name for him hints at something bigger. Another thing that bugged me was the casting of Chris O'Dowd. I'm happy to see him, being a massive fan of the IT Crowd but why cast him and make him put on a fake American accent? It didn't work and was off-putting. Can't say I noticed much of Butterfield's accent but O'Dowd's was awful, maybe not awful, but just wasn't him. What was good is that it is entertaining, and doesn't feel 127 minutes long so that's a good sign. The special effects are good but not great and Burton had to get some stop-motion animation in there somewhere, which was great but quite sinister. Reminded me a lot of Ray Harryhausen's work from original Clash of The Titans and Jason and The Argonauts. Colleen Atwood, Burton's regular costume designer, does her usual magic, dressing the peculiars. Surprisingly no Danny Elfman on the score this time round, but Mike Higham and Matthew Madgeson do a good job though there's nothing memorable from the score. Florence + The Machine do a great end credit song. Being a 12A it's difficult to know who the target audience is, it's not really children friendly and could well be a source of nightmares, but it isn't grown-up enough for adults to enjoy, like Pan's Labyrinth, maybe Burton got lost between the two resulted in the mix. It's mediocre but still entertaining, just missing impact or something truly spectacular. Ransom Riggs has release two more books as part of a trilogy so it would be interesting to see if the next books are in the pipeline.

109,destinylives52,Both Entertaining And Disappointing,6,16 January 2017,"After the mysterious and gruesome death of his beloved grandfather, Asa Butterfield (playing the lead role) discovers that his grandfather's tales of children with super powers and the monsters that seek to kill them are all true.What begins as spiritual healing for Butterfield ends as a wondrous adventure that is also terrifying as he is introduced to Eva Green (who plays the title role) and her home for peculiar children. Each visit strengthens his bond with Green and her charges, especially for a floating, teen girl. Happiness that has eluded Butterfield in his own world is finally found in ""Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children,"" but one mistake will jeopardize not only his own life, but the lives of all his new friends and love interest. Butterfield and the peculiar children must learn to be brave and fight the monsters that have come to kill them.My most memorable, movie moment of ""M.P.H.F.P.C."" is the scene that shows how the monsters came to be, and why they need to kill peculiar children. It may be a bit too much for little kiddies, so parents beware.""M.P.H.F.P.C."" gets a mediocre grade because it has too many shenanigans. Some of the peculiar children have powers that can devastate an enemy quickly, yet they don't take advantage of them or they wait until the last minute to use them. Granted, some are little kids and have never been in combat, but the older children could have easily instructed the little ones on how and when to use their deadly powers. **SPOILER ALERT** One older child (I'm being nice here, because she looks like she is 25-years-old) has the power to generate so much oxygen from her body that she can float a sunken ship, yet she can only put out about 20 seconds of air to pin the lead monster against a wall, after which the monster is free to do more damage? Get the hell out.I found the first two acts of this movie to be entertaining, but the last act — where most of the shenanigans take place — left me questioning what the hell the filmmakers were thinking.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
110,iantrader,So much talent but disappointing,3,26 November 2016,"This should have been a really good movie - based on a book, brill actors (love Eve Green, bit part for Dame Judy although it was hardly worth her while, Tim Burton directing - WOW!) - but it falls short. In fact, I lost interest half way through.Trying to work out why and the best I can do is that I had no vested interest in the characters, the plot was plodding and very predictable and there were no elements of risk to the characters that I could care about. Hey ho...I'm surprised Tim Burton took this script on as is. A slow first half and then a plodding second although if you like monster attacks when you know the heroes are in no danger (if so, come back when you've grown up a bit) you'll probably disagree. It might have been a better book but I'm not inclined to read it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
111,caseynicholson,"Enjoyable, But Complicated",6,20 October 2016,"As soon as I saw this movie, I came home and had a phone call with an uncle of mine. He asked me what I'd been up to for the evening, and I told him I'd just got in from the movies. He asked me what I had seen, and that led me to trying to explain to him the plot of ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"". If you've seen it, I would suggest that you try to explain it to someone else. When you do, I think you'll agree that while it may be enjoyable, it is a bit too complicated.So what is the movie about? A time traveling youth gets sent on a mission to stop a fellow group of evil time travelers from doing harm to a group of characters with fantastic powers who have taken refuge from the world by living in a single day in time that they repeat every single day of their lives by rewinding the day over and over again. So, basically a mix of the ""X-Men"" movies with ""Groundhog Day"". Only to make things all the more complex, there's a bit of a family drama involved, a bizarre love triangle between a pre-teen, a young man and his grandfather (seriously), and various monsters and shape shifters.All that said, this is not a terrible movie. In fact, it's quite good in some regards. But it has a very complicated plot--perhaps as complicated as ""Inception"", if not more so (but not as enjoyable as ""Inception"").All that said, while this is far from a bad movie, I have to go with 6/10 stars here simply because of the fact that I didn't find it to be of the caliber of what I tend to give a seven or above. Perhaps it's close to a seven--but there are lots of sevens out there that I like more than this film. It's worth seeing, and if you're into teen fiction it may float your boat.

112,palavitsinis,Didn't live up to expectations. Pretty nice though,7,9 February 2017,"Reading about this film and its story line, I did expect more from it. Loved the idea and the concept as it unfolded in the beginning of the movie, loved the atmosphere, but somehow I felt that a specific ""wow"" element was not there. Still cannot explain why, but this was my feeling.Don't get me wrong, I did not expect to see Prof. Xavier's school with mutants, etc., but I did wait something more. Peculiar was right to the spot as a word cause that's what these kids were in the end. The movie was really Tim Burtonish, which is a good thing always! Photography was awesome as well as the scenery and setting of the movie. Samuel L. Jackson was amazing as well, both in his acting but also in terms of his character!

The character development was alright for what they had, but still pretty sloppy as a whole. 2. The story didn't really get you into it if you haven't read the book such as myself. It takes a while for you to get into it in that standard, probably about thirty to forty minutes or so.3. The action is a little bland. It doesn't really feel like there is any stakes at all. 4. The chemistry of the characters is very hit or miss. Some work out, some don't. Overall, it is a alright movie. Well acted, entertaining, but not well story driven or character driven.

114,danielharden,Xavier's school for gifted youngsters,6,11 October 2016,"From the director of Edward Scissorhands and the Nightmare Before Christmas and the Writer of The Woamn in Black and Kick Ass comes the story of peculiar orphaned children, invisible eyeball eating monsters and the love story between a teenage boy and an old woman who looks like a teenage girl... Its better than it sounds when you put it like that. Miss Perigrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a film that fairs well for director Tim Burton's signature style and looks to have promise but all in all is balanced out by a rather bland story.Tim Burton was a perfect match for this project. The story and characters fit with Burtons horror-for-children catalogue of films with its; eyeball removal, creepy twins and animal hearts this one kid sticks in everything. Burtons visuals and his direction are not for the easily frightened of children but for those who enjoy his other films this may be a good pick. This film is recognisable as a Tim Burton film and so if you are a fan of Burtons work no matter you age I would recommend you watch this if you haven't already.The acting is fair, nothing special except for Eva Green as Miss Perigrine for the seemingly short time she features in this film so perhaps more of the title character would have been a nice change to the script.Where the film falters for me is the narrative. The bond between Jake and his grandpa was alright and the search and discovery of the home was rather interesting, but after that there isn't anything of interest. The film suffers from instances of failed logic such as the so called ""perfect day"" they live over and over in a loop and Emma's power of having air do ""whatever she wants"".... except let her walk. The final act is where the narrative lost all interest for me as it was too clichéd for my liking. Also I am not sure why Jake couldn't stay with them in 1943 as he didn't have anything to really live for after his grandpa died so I would think being wanted and welcomed into a family would appeal to him but for some reason it didn't.Overall, Miss Perigrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a Tim Burton film which could have done with more of the title character as well as some of its other big star names *cough* Judi Dench *cough*. Furthermore the script could have done with several more amendments. It's an okay film at the end of the day and my advice is, if you are a fan of Tim Burton or the book this film is adapted from, then watch the film but if not then maybe watch it on Netflix one day if you are bored.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Following a decade of either unmemorable or downright terrible films, Burton's latest is nevertheless closer to his earliest work. The trademark striking visuals manage to somehow make up for a disappointing and formulaic script that never manages to avoid the inevitable period X-Men comparison. Eva Green's generic and usual copy-paste presence leads a very strong albeit underused supporting cast that goes from opulent set-piece to opulent set-piece with more fun than commitment.

Biggest problem with Miss. Peregrine is, that movie is clearly targeted to younger audience, but wit its scenery it is time to time too scary for younger viewers. Story wander and even makes you a little bored, before it star to find it's way. Many times you feel, like there is not enough story to tell and many scenes has forgotten to cutting room floor, before it has found again and then suddenly attached to almost completed movie. Movie has a lot of odd imagery, Typical to Tim Burton, but the story just doesn't find any magic with it. Visually beautiful movie stumbles to its cleverness and odd characters remains just clever visuality without a point.Miss Peregrine is a convenient movie to younger audience, but more mature audience it doesn't reach. After all it is nice to notice, that Tim Burton has his skills to fascinating his audience and produce some interesting ideas. Is Miss. Peregrine worth of movie ticket?

117,Solnichka,Surprisingly good,9,22 July 2017,"Accidentally got sucked in to this film, and that's a compliment. Never would have watched it by choice, and that would have been my loss. The film suffers only from a lack of character development, as each of the children could have used more of a backstory to explain things. However, the story line is captivating once the slow start is overcome. Perhaps Samuel L. Jackson is a little miscast here (especially after watching his silly turn in KINGSMEN), so luckily his screen time is minimal. The acting is pretty good all things considered, although Judi Dench is kind of wasted in this film. Overall, it's very enjoyable, however, assuming you have the ability to willing suspend your disbelief for a few hours. Don't compare this film to Harry Potter or other stories: Look at it on its own, and it's quite good.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
118,cnycitylady,'Peculiar' indeed.,8,9 June 2017,"Is Tim Burton's latest film trek into the wonky and wonderful perfect? Of course not; it's confusing and a little unclear, but is it the most Tim Burton we've gotten in a long while? Yes, it absolutely is.Burton handles the scary, at times out-of-bounds children's story like a professional, and what's more, like one that loves what he's working with. He takes all of the dark elements and places them under a magnifying glass to keep the creep factor and even unnerve you a little with the terrifying slender men who want the children. He brings color and magic to this world of science and science fiction, crafting a film for both children and adults.Perhaps the one flaw in this fun romp through time is the heart of the story. Are we supposed to care for Jake, (Asa Butterfield) his grandfather (Terrance Stamp), Miss Peregrine herself (Eva Green) or Emma (Ella Purnell) one of the many Peculiar Children? Though the story itself clearly follows one of these characters, it is abundantly apparent that the soul, indeed, the very life of the story flows from one of these other characters, but which one is it?Ignoring this flaw is easy at first, but once the story evolves into this heroic, horrifying and heartbreaking tale that includes death, love and redemption, it is easier to see that something is missing. And that something is the something that would have elevated this movie from good to great.All in all though, a fun family film that is reminiscent of ""The Golden Compass"" and all of the childhood magic that still lives within us all. 7.5/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Most of the good things about the movie, however, were in its set-up. I really liked the introduction of the grandfather and the mystery that surrounded this home. You're not sure whether or not it exists, and I liked that intrigue. Jake was introduced well as a character, even if they didn't utilize him the best they could have. I think the film's strength was whenever we visited the home. Eva Green was great in this movie as an off-beat, strange headmaster of the house. She probably gave the best performance in this film. And I liked the attention to detail Burton gave with all the individual abilities of the children. We see a wide variety of abilities, and they're different from ones that you would see in something like X-Men. They're not necessarily powers, but rather idiosyncrasies. In the trailer, you see a girl has a mouth in the back of her head. It's more of a visual oddity rather than a superpower, and I think that was an important distinction for them to make.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
120,fillerruth,It's not a Tim Burton's Masterpiece but you will enjoy it,5,28 September 2016,"I am a big fan of Tim Burton's movie and like his direction and storytelling style. I like his story pick up and the way he executes the suspense of a story, that was good and enjoyable. Tim Burton already made some very good movies and most of them are fantasy. I am not a fan of fantasy movies but I like Tim Burton's fantasy movies. That's why I was eagerly waiting for this movie and finally the movie releases.Well, Some of the audiences already told the story of this movie is very similar to X-Men. Actually, I am not telling this but this movie's story is a little bit similar to that story. I am not revealing the main point but it is true it has some similarities. This is not a problem but some people really feel cheated and thought this is a remake or nothing new movie. The another negative point is too much CGI scene. It is true for a fantasy movie the CGI is very important but excessive use of Computer-generated imagery may ruin the story. I think this movie has this two big problem.Tim Burton's direction was good but it is not his best performance as a director. He already delivered some far better movie than this. The set design and the art direction was good and very relevant to the story. The story is good but nothing new and sometimes you will feel this is the origin story of some X-Men characters. Performance wise Eva Green as ""Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine"" is very good and I loved her acting. Samuel L. Jackson was good and Asa Butterfield was also good. the background score of this movie is not bad but not so good. The script is not bad and the story telling style is very typical for a Tim Burton movie. The excessive CGI is sometimes digestive for the audience and I think they will not like this.It is one of the most anticipated movies of this year and after some good and bad superhero films it is a big release so you can try this.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I thought it was just going to be another one of those musicals (Nightmare Before Christmas) that really got on your nerves (except Nightmare before Christmas was actually good). However, it wasn't. There was actually a really strong emotional story-line. I could actually connect with the emotions and feelings that the actors portrayed.I thought it was really cool how there was time-warps (they called them ""loops"" in the film), unique monsters, villains, and characters. All of the children's ""peculiarities"" (special powers) were different as well. I was expecting laser eyes, transforming, and mind-reading. However, Tim Burton took a different route in this particular film. All of the children's special powers were kind of ""carnival-like."" One girl floated and controlled air, another guy brought inanimate objects to life, while another small child was super strong. There were others as well, but I won't spoil all of them for the viewers. Tim Burton definitely took a unique route from this aspect. This film also did an excellent job describing time ""loops"" and the blending of the past and present eras. As the rest of the world continued, all of Miss Peregrine's peculiar children were living out the same day in 1943 for an extremely long time, an era during World War II.

123,evan_harvey,"Gothic, dark, off-kilter, sometimes silly",8,5 October 2016,"Loved it. It's dark, Gothic, off-kilter and refreshing cinema. The story of strange children with bizarre gifts was a welcome story after the glut of dystopian, adult-hating, children-save-the-world YA rubbish that has beset our cinemas (and book stores) for years now.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is itself from a YA novel, but it's deliciously strange and non-mainstream. The first ""reset"" scene is wonderfully strange and unusual. The plot isn't about the world being destroyed. The villain is (mostly) crazy and unusual. The peculiar children have ""abilities"", but they're unusual and diverse. It's nice to see strange abilities that are not what you expect and even seem to have no real purpose (although the film does use them to their advantage).Eva Green was wonderful as the dignified Miss Peregrine. Asa Butterfield did well. The other peculiar children were good. Samuel L Jackson was a fantastically unhinged villain (for the most part).That's not to say that it is perfect. The first three quarters are excellent. The last quarter is less so. It's a dark tale, and there are stakes. The plot is good, although the villains are a little under-developed in terms of their motivations. The climax is a little unexciting, and Samuel L Jackson descends into silliness at the end (which I assume was to lighten the mood a little). The love interest between Jake and Emma is unconvincing. The ending is a bit rushed.However, I was impressed enough and the strength of the film is enough to overcome it's flaws.8 out of 10.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

125,Brevin_Campbell,"Nice try Tim Burton, but you have failed",5,12 October 2016,"I was looking forward to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Hoping this film would be something close to the X Men, but it Tim Burton did it. However what I did not realize was this was actually based on a young adult novel of the same name and man does it show especially in the first few minutes. From the very start the movie goes at a very slow and a bit drawn out pace making it take longer than it should take to get everything set up. The story line is also not at all what I wanted it to be as it deals less with the Perculiars and more with the young boy named Jake whose grandfather tells him about this magical place and he desires nothing more than to go there and find the very thing his grandfather told him about before he dies. The main issue with this film is Asa Butterfield's performance. Cause it is soo bad like really bad. He never makes me buy into Jake at any point. I never care about what Jake is really going through in this film. It just such a lackluster performance and it is really disappointing as well.Jake's dad is also really stupidly cheesy and idiotic and his role makes no sense either. He doesn't act in a way a father would act and some of his actions just feel really strange and weird. I defiantly didn't buy into him at all as this kid's father. Hell I didn't even think he cared about his son very much. Tim Burton does go all out in his final act giving us the fun X Men like film I wanted from the very beginning with him having Samuel L Jackson and the Perculiars face off in a epic showdown that I only wish this whole movie could of been like from the very beginning. Eva Green is also really good as Miss Perregrine as well. Her look and attitude makes for a very fun performance and was one of the things I wanted more of but sadly was disappointed with her not showing up into the second act. This film while is a good try by Tim Burton fails as it is still to connected to its source material and probably would have been much better if it tried to move away from it",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
126,sjarja,I loved the book - and i appreciate the effort,6,7 November 2016,"This movie can stand on its own legs .. however it is shaking a little. Imagery and visuals in general are well done for the most part - but the CGI effects are VERY below average and actually did mess with immersing into the storytelling. In fact - sometimes i thought they were worse than computer game cutscenes from several years ago. Odd animation, strangely exposed textures and kind of uninspired design. I did like the casting as well as the acting by pretty much every cast member... or every cast member that enjoyed a little attention. (except Jake)My biggest problem with the movie was that it went very little (aka not at all) into the relationships of the children and/or Jake. I cared very little to not at all for Jake... because he showed almost no character development or concern regarding his surroundings. I mean - he is time travelling, meeting all those peculiar people .. but instead of being excited - he rather appears to be annoyed or bored. Because the spotlight still is on him - the other children enjoy fairly little screen time ... and so it is hard to believe that there was any serious friendship between them and Jake. There is also the problem with pacing in the movie. It does spend a very long time (about the first third) with Jake and his family. His father and mother play absolutely NO role in the later acts of the film. They have no impact on his decision making or any story related incident. So it does feel like the time with them was kind of wasted .. as it also does not tell what kind of relationship Jake has with his family (well - it tells you that it is a dysfunctional family .. but does not go any deeper)All in all - i am happy that the movie exists. I am still disappointed with it - but would not want to miss it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

To be short:+ Eva Green - she makes a great characterIt's like a X men prequel, but not so interesting... The same ""school for special children"", girl throwing fire, another one air, etc...For some characters you don't understand until the end why are they ""special"", ex the ""twins"". By the way, twins ""specialty""( like Medusa from Greek mythology) would be more than enough to destroy the monsters, why bother to fight with them a long two hour movie when is enough for the twins to take their masks off and look in the monster direction and transform it into stone?Scenes with the skeletons running out from the ship to fight the monsters - very much like the ones in the ""Lord of the Rings""I don't understand why all special children have to be maintained in a time loop to remain children...If there is the ability to handle time, why not letting them grow and remain young?Whatever, I left the cinema thinking that I could use better those 2 hours..",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
128,The_Celluloid_Sage,Even Eva can't save this one,5,6 April 2020,"I really wanted to like this film, almost convinced myself I would like it actually. Based upon a marvelous book by Ransom Riggs, directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and starring the enchanting Eva Green (Casino Royale), Judi Dench (Best Exotic Marigold Hotel), Rupert Everett (Prince Charming in Shrek) and the always amazing Terence Stamp (far too many classics to mention) this looked liked a sure-fire banker in every possible way. Only I didn't and it wasn't. It was entertaining enough for sure, but just somehow managed to miss every mark it was probably aiming for.Dubbed as Tim Burton's X-Men, a film he self classified as a anti-superhero film there were unfortunately just too many convoluted things happening, plot holes, inconsistencies and changes from the book, which is what actually made it worth turning into a film in the first place. Now I do appreciate that a books audience is not necessarily a films audience. The two mediums are different and generally have different demographics they aim for (that's not to say one cannot enjoy both though). Those are just some of the issues at hand here in what could have been a magical and mystical film that captivated you.I suppose the first issue here must be the script. Kingsman the Secret Service was not too bad as a screenplay but X-Men: First Class and Future Past were not the best. Here she made far too many changes for it to work effectively. Perhaps an occasion where the writer of the novel should have had more say (that does not always work though). The second issue here to my mind is Tim Burton, and it saddens me to say that. Whatever happened to him in 2005? Sure he had the odd wobble here and there but generally the guy was a banker from Beetlejuice to Corpse Bride with a couple of forgettable and forgivable films in-between.But something happened after then. Willy Wonka, Sweeny Todd, Dark Shadows, Alice and the list goes on. While still visually interesting and his style, the films themselves just fell flat from what was his trademark unique traits. Unfortunately, this film also shows that the master of the gothic and weird has not regained his magical touch yet. Visually the film is fantastic with some excellent set design even if the film generally is a little washed out and pale.If you have read the excellent book you already know the basics of the story line here. Jake (Butterfield) learns of an accident that befalls his grandfather (Stamp) and eventually ends up traveling to Wales with his father. While there he discovers a magical portal back to 1943 and the orphanage his grandfather had told him so much about in stories, despite Jake's father's protestations. Here he meets the peculiar children that his grandfather spoke about so fondly, including Emma (an impressive Purnell). He also meets Miss Peregrine (an excellent Green) who runs the house and looks after the children in a kind of Gothic Scary Poppins way. Perfectly cast.Jake soon learns about the problem they have and the time loop keeping them where they are. He also eventually learns about the evil creatures that are after them and their leader Barron (A hammed up Jackson). Acting generally is average, though Jackson is personally annoying. He seems to be unable to turn down any script that happens to pass his house, never mind any that are actually sent to him. The rest of the cast are passable and do just about enough. Unfortunately the likes of Green, Dench and Stamp are not actually in the film enough to keep your interest, especially in the latter half and mostly their abilities are largely wasted.The script gets very messy towards the end of the film and it really does feel like they tried to cram far too much in without having the time. Another major scripting issue is with the very tame (and lame perhaps) romance between Jake and Ella. There was no chemistry there and I was left wondering why she would be interested in him at all. It just didn't work in 'this' film. Ultimately, some bad casting choices (Butterfield) and a rather dull script lead to a rather overall dull film. There was no sense of awe or mystical excitement that the book created. Burton must surely take some of the blame for this, despite an average script he obviously seemed happy with.It is unfortunate that the novel was written when it was. Had it been written when Burton was at the height of his magic and Eva Green was the experienced sultry actress she is now then I'm sure this would have been a truly stunning and magical experience. As it stands, it is another miss from Burton and another wasted literary to celluloid conversion. Eva Green is awesome for her actual short screen time and the other actors are not really around enough to impose themselves. Visually impressive at times and a treat for the eyes with a reasonably enchanting score, this one ultimately fails to deliver its hype.

129,thisseatofmars,"Named for the bird, get it? Oh, how whimsical! (By the way, I've never read the books.)",5,14 November 2016,"Tim Burton should avoid the UK from here on. Whenever he makes a movie with a UK slant (like those awful Alice in Wonderland movies) the 'touched' quality of Burton's films mutates into whimsical tedium. The runtime for Peregrine is two hours. It feels much longer, and so much could have been cut.Is this a bad movie? No: it's a movie for young children. Instead of a dark fantasy like Sleepy Hollow or Edward Scissorhands, Peregrine is more content talk down to the viewer and explain every picky detail. What's worse is that there're far too many people with distracting makeup, hair, and accents. Everyone who's not an American speaks in breathy tones or comically prim British accents. ""Oh, how marvelous!"" / ""Indeedy!"" / ""Quite!"" And so on. But the cast helps round things out. Eva Green is as talented as she is beautiful (so, ""quite,"") and the lead, played Asa Butterfield, does well with what he's given, despite that his character is about as interesting as frozen dough.) It's always a pleasure seeing Terence Stamp light up the screen, and it was a surprise seeing Chris O'Dowd here, although I feel his comic talents are wasted by playing such a bore. The scene introducing Samuel L. Jackson and his cronies ""feasting"" was darkly hilarious, but Jackson's fang-teeth make him lisp now and then. Truthfully, I don't think Jackson has much range as an actor, and he doesn't bring much to Peregrine. However, the climax of Peregrine is appropriately doofy cool: so not all of Peregrine is bad.Peregrine's greatest sin, however, is that it's slow. We don't actually get to see the fantastic children until 40 min in, and it's at about the hour mark that Butterfield's character finally brings the plot up to the others. Until then, the film constantly introduces new plot elements, locales, characters, and other stuff without resolving any but a few of them during the last 30 minutes. It's world building, but done too thick and slow.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

But as I don't know the book I can only judge from what I see on the screen. I had seen trailers for this movie and I thought it might be good for a young man with learning difficulties that I take out from time to time.I really enjoyed this engaging fantasy - and so did the young man. It's perfect viewing for 8 to 14 year old's - and it has a lot to offer for the adults taking them! The story-line is a good yarn and the visuals are delightful.The pace of the movie is good and the characters are very amusing. I think this movie will stand the test of time and be a regular feature on TV in years to come at holiday times.If you are in two minds about the movie, I would recommend that you give it the benefit of the doubt. Take a young relative as an excuse to go see it on the big screen. You could do a lot worse with two hours of your life.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
131,sanjin_9632,Not a masterpiece.. but not as stupid as any Transformers movie,7,5 November 2016,"First I would like to say that I like Tim Burtons films and as far as I can tell, I've watched all of his films, some multiple times. I like the slightly twisted note he delivers on almost every occasion. Of course, the material he uses (Alice In Wonderland, Batman, Sweeney Todd, etc.) often already has a dark and twisted mindset behind it. Before writing this I read one of the reviews which said: Tim Burton's 3rd best film, simultaneously giving out 9 or 10 stars, which is absurd. This is pretty mediocre for Tim Burton. The last time he really delivered was almost 10 years ago on Sweeney Todd.This film has a lot of Tim Burton in it, as far as realization goes. Good cast (especially the female cast), costumes, scenery, effects (somewhat), but it cannot compare to the likes of Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, Beetlejuice, Edward etc. One particularly peculiar thing about this film is that its story is not as interesting or original for that matter. I can't help but be reminded of Professor X and his students.Tim Burton's not to blame for the slightly unoriginal story line. Nor is Jane Goldman who wrote the script. Everything in this film seems familiar and I think I can tell why. Ransom Riggs, the writer of Miss Peregrine (the book trilogy) used elements from different sources (books, films, graphic novels, etc.) and changed the names to serve his purpose. It almost seems as though he took his favorite characters from his childhood and changed them a little to create *something new* (in reality nothing new at all). The whole thing seems like a goth children's book. Interestingly, Riggs' partner, Tahereh Mafi, an author herself, has written The Juliette Chronicles about a girl that can take living organisms energy. Sound familiar? That one has Rogue written all over.. Back to Miss Peregrine.. There is almost no element of surprise. The story is as predictable as they come and I imagine the book to be predictable too. One difference (of many) between a book and a film: While reading, one has to use his imagination. When watching, you don't have to imagine anything. You're already exposed to someone else's imagination. Films are much more predictable than books, in general. Nevertheless, taking into account what's shown in cinemas nowadays, Miss Peregrine is still way more interesting than most films. If I had to choose between a mediocre Tim Burton flick and a Transformers movie, I would pick Burton 100/100. 6.6/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

133,jay-techie2007,Watchable but It Takes Some Patience to Get to Enjoy It,7,1 October 2016,"It should have been Jake's Visit to the Home for Peculiar Children as Miss Peregrine had a very little role to play in the movie. The movie has a terribly vague first half but once it unwinds the whole story - largely a thriller second half catches up on where it lagged in the first one. It may not be a ""must watch"" but you will surely enjoy the climax. Story (8/10): To be honest, the plot of the movie is really good. I loved a couple concepts like home for peculiar children, time loop and actually ""peculiar"" powers that the kids had which we haven't really seen in any of the movies yet. The issue was with the screenplay which was all over the place in the first half. Very vague and at many times we wondered - what's going on and more than that - why is it going on?? To the extent that I pretty much dozed off. However, the second half is actually good where the whole story unfolds and it explains the entire scene and how the central character, Jake, fits into the entire context. While I understand that the plan was to build a suspense and curiosity in the first half but, at the same time, it cannot be vague as well. Acting (7/10): The movie was largely shouldered by Asa Butterfield, playing Jake, and, surprisingly, Ella Purnell, playing one of the peculiar children at Miss Peregrine house. While their pair looked unconventional but their chemistry was great. The acting with all the expressions gave a very real feel to otherwise unconventional situations in the movie. Disappointing was Eva Green, playing the title character, wasn't so much impressive in the limited screen time she had. And the humor added, wasn't helping, while the pipe wasn't really adding anything to the personality projected. On the contrary, Terence Stamp had his presence felt more than her. Samuel Jackson had a good cameo as the antagonist. Judi Dench had pretty forgettable minutes in the movie - almost unnoticed. Overall, the movie does a decent job in the acting department. Direction (6/10): Tim Burdon does a great job with pretty fresh and young cast. The second half was really where the movie came together and the lead cast had a great role to play there. The length of the movie is just right. However, the editing in the first half is terrible and the parts just don't connect. On the other hand, the climax was great and pictured well. The way the last fight was showed and the tricks were pretty believable from the children point of view.

134,trevor-82944,Kids Sure Are Scary!,4,30 September 2016,"Since 2011, it has been the modern-day equivalent of Mary Poppins, telling a twisted story of a magical nanny who protects children from the horrors of the outside world. Now, Tim Burton teams up with screenwriter Jane Goldman to adapt Ransom Riggs' novel to the big screen. The result? Well, I hate to say this: I really wanted to like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, but just couldn't. When your movie requires lots of frightening imagery unsuitable to the nine-year-old's innocent mind, then this type of story should remain on paper.The opening credits already warn us of the type of movie we are about to watch: newspaper clippings are shown of the peculiar children, including one little girl with super strength and two twins who dress like clowns. Everything that follows from here is an occasional terrifying scene held together by scenes that add little enjoyment or emotion.This story revolves around Jake, played by Asa Butterfield (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, Hugo), a teenage boy as dull and pathetic as his on-screen believability. He wants to be an explorer, but is too chicken. Yes, I know. It sounds just like every other child protagonist ever doesn't it? His closest relationship in his Florida home is his dementia-struck grandfather, who told stories to him growing up about these peculiar children. It's the only type of love he can get, as his father is too much of a jerk to pay any attention to his son, not like I cared about any of these characters.But then he and his father are forced onto a trip to a Welsh island where Miss Peregrine is said to house these peculiar children. Basically it starts when a mysterious creature gouges out grandpa's eyes. It's a terrifying sight, but it's not like the situation itself is heart-stopping or anything.Anyway, they get to the island, which does in fact feel appropriately cold with its cool colors and striking back-lights, thanks to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (Amélie, Inside Llewyn Davis). On this island, he time travels by cave back to 1943 when these peculiar children were still living in the currently abandoned mansion run by Miss Peregrine. From here, you'd expect the movie to finally get started with the mystifying peculiarity promised in the trailer. Well, it does for the first fifteen minutes when we are introduced to the kids, but everything else after that just falls under the usual kid's movie format that is dumbed down too much for teens and adults to handle. Which leads into my next complaint......Which is the unfortunate fate of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children to receive a PG-13 rating despite its clear targeting towards anyone under the age of 11. I would in no way call this suitable for kids, as the images of children with teeth at the back of their head and putting hearts into inanimate objects to bring them to life are the product of nightmares. But it's not just that, but an invisible boy walks around naked, and there is plenty of talk of Nazi Germany sending bombs onto the island; definitely not suitable subjects for children!In fact, I don't know of anyone who will enjoy this film, as the quality of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children otherwise is below average. None of the actors stand out in any way, the CGI is worse than Suicide Squad, and the children are not given anywhere near the amount of screen time they deserve.I also have a gripe against the way the main problems in this movie are solved. Basically, by the third act, the kids get themselves to the villain's hideaway in the most unbelievable way that feels uncomfortably similar to Battlefield Earth. Then after they get to the island, believe it or not, but their solution to fighting the bad guys involves throwing junk at them as if we're watching Home Alone 6. I'm sorry, but when your climax involves a ""kids outsmart the grown-ups"" concept like that, you're asking for trouble.If this movie was suitable for anybody, I'd say it is best for teenagers after they got high off of the hottest pot they could cook up, so that they can watch the disturbing images of bad actors in peculiar situations with laughs all around. It sounds a bit harsh to say, but after looking at the marketing of this film and the rating it received from the MPAA, that's the truth.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

This is a Tim Burton's film, and as a Tim Burton's movie, it leaves no one indifferent, for better or worse; and in this case it is for the better. We get to enjoy his imagination creating this world for the big screen and making the audience enjoy their time in front of it.The story is well-developed, it has a good rhythm and before you know it, you are embarking yourself in a journey towards a fantasy world where you will forget about reality and just feel one more of the gang. I haven't had the opportunity to read the books (but now they are in my to read list), but there are some differences with the books, which looks like they were made on purpose so the story flows at a better path for a movie. Speaking of which, the path might look a bit slow at the beginning, when we get introduced to Jake's life and what is going on, but then it start to get faster, step by step, but faster and in a non-stop mode.Among the cast we find some familiar faces, like flawless Eva Green, also a sight for our eyes and ears, whose character reminds us a bit of the one she plays in Penny Dreadful, at least physically. But the main character of this movie is Asa Butterfield, who stole our hearts in ""The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas"" and ""The Invention of Hugo"". He is the one whose story we follow: we laugh with him, we cry with him, we get afraid with him and we enjoy this fantasy world with him.Definitely, a movie to enjoy either with your family, or alone, and to be reminded that we all are peculiar, and that does not mean a bad thing, just enjoy who you are and forget about the rest.

138,paradux,Rubbish!,4,1 October 2016,"If you are made in any way uncomfortable by this review, imagine how I felt writing it.If anyone had ever suggested to me that it was even possible, within the current laws of Physics as we know them, for Tim Burton to make a bad film, I would have suggested that the parents of such a person were never properly married; and then suggested a trip to the nearest alley to settle the matter once and for all.Yet, astonishingly, here we are.The one single thing that Burton's films have personified since the start of his amazing career is .. joy. Every film Burton has made, even the lesser ones, somehow managed to express the joy of being alive and having experiences that one can share with the viewer.Then along comes this travesty...? A more correct title would be something like ""Harry Potter's Evil Twin"" because it seems at best a wasted effort to riff off the happy spirit of Hogwarts -- only without any happiness or spirit at all in evidence.The story itself is a cross between a horror film and a hackneyed drama. It is not a comedy in any sense of the word, notwithstanding the horrific casting choice of Chris O'Dowd -- an actor known for comedy! -- as Jake's dad.I was shocked and horrified at the number of children in the theater. Then I realized -- and this is the real horror -- that they too had noticed the word ""school"" in the title and were looking for Harry ... in all the wrong places, as it turned out.I have a rule I learned I learned from reviewers older and wiser than myself. It is called the ""20 minute Rule"" and it essentially says that if a film fails to engage you after 20 minutes, pack your bags and leave the theatre.I stayed because I felt a duty to warn other IMDb members - especially those with young children -- that this is not the film you were expecting.Possibly not even the film Burton himself was expecting.It is moody, morbid, spooky, badly written and not much fun to watch. Butterfield is one of the most charming young actors in the biz but even he cannot give this production the warm and friendly ""happy halo"" it so desperately wants.Eva Greene is competent as always. it is always a joy to see Stamp back in front of the camera lens, and Sam Jackson remains the undisputed most over-exposed actor in the biz.

140,Growlyted,"Loose Adaptation, Good Burton.",7,8 October 2016,"I enjoyed this as a Burton film, although it was very loosely based on the novels. I know that Riggs has approved the changes, so I was prepared to have an open mind. Characters have been altered and this will definitely disappoint some viewers. In the series, Emma has a fiercer personality and uses fire. Olive is younger and is simply light. She does not control air. While initially annoyed by this switching/enhancing, I accepted this choice at the cinema. I thought the Peculiars were well acted and I still cared about them. Unfortunately the villain is too goofy, compared with how the Wights are portrayed in the original. The darker scenes have been left out or toned down for family audiences. While the novel ends on a cliffhanger, the film has an embarrassing fight sequence and a happy conclusion. I enjoyed the visuals, some of which are stop motion or non CGI. The house and grounds are perfect. It's good Halloween viewing.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
141,ty-jensen,A forgotten Tim Burton movie,5,10 October 2021,"I seen Miss Peregrine in the cinema and I praised it but after awhile I realized I was being hasty. I just revisited Miss Peregrine, its okay.The acting is good, Eva Green and Sam Jackson are hammy. Asa Butterfield is good but I understand why some feel he's lame. Having said that, the characterization is just okay. Jake is likeable but bland, he keeps on asking questions. The kids are bland but you don't want them to die. Enoch is annoying but I still don't want him to die.The story is messy, some things don't make sense. I'm not a writer but I know writing time travel stories is tricky mainly for movies. I guess the time travel stuff is carefully written in the novel. Jake quickly leaving the loop is forced since his dad doesn't care about him. Now that I think about it, his dad's attitude should of been explained.The visuals are a mixed bag. The film looks nice except for the present day island scenes which looks similar to most of the Harry Potter movies. The effects are mostly practical since Tim Burton doesn't like CGI. The monsters are awful digital creatures. Burton loves stop motion animation so he includes some here.Overall, Miss Peregrine is okay. The film is Harry Potter mixed with X-Men in fact its a Fox film. Its family friendly but not too much. If you're looking for a dark fantasy movie, you may want to give it a shot.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
142,bonniejoy-978-68763,Letter to Tim Burton,6,7 April 2017,"Dear Tim Burton,Thank you! Thank you for a wonderfully silly movie! Yes, you had this series of books gift wrapped for you, and a lot of fans are probably angry that you didn't take full advantage of them. Even as someone who's not read the books, I'm a bit disappointed myself (at least with the second half).The first half was really good with developing the story, atmosphere, characters, their abilities (which are visually great), and Eva Green was terrific as the title character. Whether or not they are just like the book, I will let the actual readers say for me. For the most part, the actors all are really good, even if they're not given much to work with. The person playing the main character, Jake is identifiable. The idea of the ""peculiar"" children being stuck in one time frame for years is intriguing and I wish was explored more.It's the second half of the movie where you lost me completely! Where do I start? 1) Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. He can do great characters, and at first does great shapeshifting as Jake's psychiatrist to get info. However, not only does this guy sound like he's dying to swear his head off, but he just talks and looks silly. Anytime he knocks on a door I expect to hear him say, ""Heeeere's Baron!"" Also, the bulgy eyes and mad scientist hair look outrageous. 2) The confrontation at the pier. OH MY GOSH!!!!! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! I can't watch that whole scene or say this paragraph without bursting out into laughter! One of the kids brings skeletons to life to fight off the monsters trying to destroy them! That whole scene has got to be the silliest confrontation in any PG-13 movie ever!!! Anytime I see those skeletons fighting I keep waiting to hear the ""Remains of the Day"" or ""What's This?"" songs playing in the background. I heard it wasn't in the book, so the fact that this is in the movie makes it all the more silly. Not to mention, I think that was put in to just remind the audience, ""You're watching a Tim Burton movie."" I had to pause a couple of times to laugh my lungs out, and almost could not continue; it was that hilarious! 3) How it all should have ended: Miss Peregrine keeps protecting the ""peculiar"" children from these monsters that want to eat their eyes, but later it's revealed that two of these children could turn them into stone if their faces were revealed. Why weren't they put out in front of the enemy as soon as Miss Peregrine saw signs of danger? The battle would have been over within five seconds. 4) The oh so predictable romance. I heard that in the book the main character falls for a tougher girl. Why was she downgraded here? It's cool to see her fly, but that's about it. She's barely got a character arc to her. So, even though you've angered lots of fans of the book, I'm not angry. I'm disappointed you didn't go all out dark on the story, but at the same time I found a new movie to make me laugh on a bad day. So for that I thank you. But next time, don't be tamed by Hollywood formulas, especially when adapting an original idea. Thank you, Bonnie",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
143,mirkobozic,X-Men meets Home Alone,9,5 October 2016,"I went to see the movie today. My sympathies for Burton pretty much equal those for Woody Allen, which means that I can't be completely objective. If you read Burton's book ""The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories"", you will certainly find parallels to the children in the movie in terms of their ""peculiarities"". Burton does love to play the weirdo card-he type-cast Johnny Depp for all eternity-just instead of that, he expands the quirky factor to a whole group of characters. Mrs Peregrine(masterfully portrayed by Eva Green) is the mistress of a secret, secluded school for children with various sorts of supernatural powers, who are stuck in a time loophole where they don't age. The main character is a boy called Jake, who gets into contact with the school after the death of his grandfather, who had been telling him stories about the school from his travels. Once he gets to Wales where the place is supposed to be located, he discovers the truth behind the stories he was told and runs into Samuel L. Jackson in the disguise of a hideous monster. The aesthetics and visuals of the movie are brilliant, with the Victorian architecture and costume design. The cast is quite convincing, and the characters of the children are believable and individualized, which is great. The invisible boy and the girl in the steel shoes come off as especially emotional and cute. The point Burton tried to make is that we all have our peculiarities and that it's perfectly fine to be different. The message might not be revolutionary but it's been dished to the viewer in an attractive way. Script is where the film starts showing cracks. The whole idea with a group of characters with special powers looks like an elementary-school equivalent of X-Men. Hey-what's more adorable than a little girl with the strength of Hulk? And then add some Home Alone-style fight scenes, and what you end up with is this. All in all, very enjoyable, though not very inventive. And a Welsh inn called The Priest Hole provides for a less than subtle punchline, which provides the one thing that was missing here-adult humor.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I'd happily have watched this - even several times - with my daughter, during her teenage years. But any other time? - if I must.
It is little more than a hotch-potch of other stories, knitted together by a nice idea of a time loop (viz X-Men, Groundhog Day, Time Bandits).
Oh, and some nice acting, let down by shockingly forced accents across the board, especially Asa.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
145,RLTerry1,A Classic Burton Film! Worth Watching.,6,1 October 2016,"Surprisingly exciting! Twentieth Century Fox brings another YA novel to the screen. Tim Burton's Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (from here on out noted at Miss Peregrine) is both a fish out of water story combined with a magical adventure that mildly comments on the human condition. Of all the YA movies that have been produced over the last few years, this one provides a much more dynamic experience than many of the others. Burton delights audiences with the classic Burton style that many of us have grown up with. In more recent years, I have often commented that he is essentially a parody of himself--a.k.a. Burt Porn (as coined by my friend Leon in Germany)--not true with Miss Peregrine. Get ready for a return to the class Burton that brought us timeless movies such as A Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. The great cast is supported by the appearances of Samuel L Jackson and Dame Judi Dench. From Florida to Wales, this movie is sure to whisk you away to daring adventures requiring rather peculiar abilities to defeat those who would seek to take what isn't theirs to have.All Jake (Asa Butterfield) knew was his ordinary life. He had a rather blah home life, an eccentric grandfather, and a job that he hated. Until one day, something peculiar happened. In his grandfather's dying breath he told Jake to find the island. With his parents finding his sports of what he saw at his grandmother's death to be quite bizarre, they forced hi to visit a psychiatrist. Upon finding a mysterious letter, Jake is determined to find the home in which his grandfather grew up. Accompanied by his cynical father, Jake returns to the island where his grandfather grew up. Only he could never have expected the adventure and run of this life that he will soon find himself. Stumbling across the children's home ran by Miss Peregrine (Eva Green), Jake teams up with the most unusual but fascinating people who are in a rush against time to defeat those who are out to destroy them.If I had to name one takeaway from this film, it would be that it reminds me of the 1980s/90s Tim Burton before he ""went down the rabbit hole."" It combines his surreal and Gothic filmmaking style juxtaposed against his flare for the colorful and bizarre. Although it is not an original concept by any means, if you're a fan of Fox's film adaptations of or the animated series X-Men, then you will likely enjoy this movie! Not having read the book, I cannot comment on the film's alignment and commitment to the literary work written by Ransom Riggs; but, from what I have read online--even the author himself--is pleased with Burton's translation from page to screen. Very few directors would have been so successful at bringing this story to life more than Burton. Despite an apparent successful translation from book to movie, the film suffers from an overload of mythology, exposition through dialog, and lacks the thrills to completely balance out the former two elements. Although this movie may feel like one that you have seen before, it does offer a glimpse into Burton's prime years and perhaps offers a hope that the acclaimed visionary director can once again impress us with his fantastical but highly effective cinematic storytelling.One of the most successful elements to the X-Men's plight as individuals born with peculiar abilities is the fact that they are human. They hold onto their humanity (the good guys anyway). Miss Peregrine's children do not appear to offer the same level of humanity as their X-Men counterparts. The impact of the X-Men's abilities is felt not only by the X-Men themselves but by the community at large. For the most part, Miss Peregrine's children's abilities largely leaves no impact upon themselves or others. Almost plays off more as a convenient plot device than character attributes. Hugo's Asa Butterfield's fake American accent does not really suit his character of Jake. In a world of fantastical dynamics and depth, he plays off as a boring, flat character. In screen writing, it is vitally important for the writer to cause the reader/audience to love the protagonist and/or love to hate the antagonist. I found it hard to love Jake or truly hate Barron (Jackson).So, the movie may not have the amazing principle cast that we are accustomed to in a Burton movie; but, it does still contain Burton magic and some exciting and beautiful visuals. It is also a lot of fun to watch! In addition to being fun to watch, it contains some rather disturbing imagery and cringeworthy moments. But that's par for the course with classic Burton. One of my favorite parts in the movie is the action-packed climactic sequence accompanied by dark humor. It's a great combination of humor and visceral conflict. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch this weekend, then this one is a solid pick! Furthermore, if you desire to get a glimpse into a morse classical Burton film, then you'll find utter delight in this one as well.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
146,paulspencer-90394,Imagine The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe on acid,5,6 November 2016,"First off, the filming in this is great. It is a masterclass in light and sound. As a director Tim Burton can fill the screen like no one else.The problem for me is the story. If a character does not provide anything for the protagonist or antagonist, get rid of them. If two characters have similar traits, merge them together, all part of the process to get the running time down to a reasonable level.Now we know that the book is part of a series, so we have a similar situation to Harry Potter, which characters are going to be given time in the first film, and which ones will be important for any sequels. So the writers have to balance between plot and character introductions. And here in lies the issue.There are times when some of the characters were speaking, and I was admiring the background. It might be that it is a children's book, and therefore a children's film, and apart from Hunt for the Wilderpeople, these sort of films do not really interest me.I have a feeling I might change my mind with a second viewing, and I may pay more attention to the dialogue than the direction; and Tim Burton hardly puts a foot wrong in that respect. There are times when it reminded me of a silent German expressionist film, and if any student wanted to learn about light and shadows, they should certainly watch this if only for that reason.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

149,Pramitheus,Tim Burton's X-men,6,5 December 2016,"I am sure many are familiar with the novel of the same name but I wasn't and thus I don't know about the time it was published but a school with children with superpowers, mentored by a super-human and an extremely confusing time-line does sound a bit too familiar in 2016. As I am a fan of Tim Burton, I was very excited but much of it fizzled out after the first half-hour or so. Still, I managed to watch it so here goes.STORY – Jake, is the grand-son of a mysterious man, Abe. Jake's parents tell Abe that he has dementia and that is why he tells all those strange stories. One day, Abe is attacked and in his dying hours he gives Jake a cryptic message to go to an island and meet Miss Peregrine and save the Ymbrynes. He convinces his father to travel to Wales and in a chance meet he travels back in time and meets Miss Peregrine and her Peculiars. There he comes to know that there are multiple groups of Peculiars who live in time-loops to stay as immortals and are guarded by these mentors who control these time-loops to save them from the evil Peculiars who want to kill them to eat their eyeballs!? Gross. Now these evil Peculiars have their goons called Hollows who basically carry out their bidding BUT they are invisible. Now, here comes in Jake, who has the same power as his grand-father and that is that he can see those Hollows. So he should help the Peculiars and help preserve their time-loop. Now, this is a pretty simple story where a misfit is entrusted with a huge burden which he should overcome to be accepted and triumph as a hero. So, to be fair the whole plot is predictable. Still that shouldn't have been a problem if Tim Burton would have upped the ante and made the whole scheme feel not only a war between Hollows and Peculiars but one which could also affect the mortal world.DIRECTION – Tim Burton has a style of his own. A characteristic, dark-humour along with an artificial set which gives the feeling that the film is set in a not-so-realistic place. Here that feeling was a bit diluted in nature. I remember watching Sleepy Hollow and the creepiness factor was so high. Or even a bright movie like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with all it's colors and dance numbers had a creepy feeling to it. Miss Peregrine's doesn't live up to that expectation. The outdoor shots feel dull and bland. The time-loop system isn't established properly leading to fair amount of questions and plot-holes regarding it's effects. The powers of each of the Peculiars, especially the Twins, aren't used properly. You can say that it is according to the book, but in the 21st century, you can't always go by-the-book. People have become far more logical and they can see through shoddy writing. I loved the stop-motion animation that was mixed in with real-life during Enoch's demonstration of his powers. THAT felt creepy and disturbing. The finale felt very, very lame. As I said there weren't any stakes and the use of a single frame for every action, kick, punch didn't increase the intensity. The CGI was okay. Again, the ending was not clear because the time-loop theory, at least to me, wasn't explained.ACTING – Acting was nothing spectacular. Everyone had a one note theme and no wow moment. I particularly loved Pixie Davies as the super-strong girl. She had small moments where she really shone. Hats-off to Cameron King as Millard. Being invisible and still emoting is a difficult job. I was expecting that there will be some scene where he will get to show his face but he didn't and hats-off to that. The teenage romance of Jake and Emma is so boring, particularly because of Asa Butterfield and Ella Purnell's lack- lustre performance.It felt unnecessary and avoidable because Asa Butterfield can't emote when his grandpa is dying, then how is he gonna emote LOVE, which is a difficult emotion in itself.Eva Green and Samuel L. Jackson stroll through their roles as the two opposite poles of this peculiar world.FINAL VERDICT – The whole film felt very dull and drab. I know, Tim Burton's movies have that kind of a feeling but usually his movies urge you to snuggle under a blanket in winter and watch his movies because his movies have lot of emotions and plenty of acting which even increase the stakes which are apparently very small. This movie falls flat and to be honest, it was difficult to make my way through this. If you have read the novel and if you think you can connect with it, then sure, go ahead and give it a try. Casual movie-goers can give it a pass.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
150,anandrajeev979,"A Refreshingly New , Visual treat filled with Magic and Fantasy- Burton's Best Yet",10,15 December 2016,"As expected from Tim Burton this film excels at delivering a fantasy/action-adventure flick like it promised. Tim Burton's vision is as usual delightful and this it's accompanied by charismatic leads Eva Green , Asa Butterfield and Ella Purnell. Even though it's delightful and entertaining it does have some pros and cons. First of all Tim Burton's Direction is top notch using every element of surprise , magic , fantasy and peculiarities to their best extent.Eva Green has done a fantastic work and is a very wonderful character in form of Miss Peregrine.Other than her Asa as Jake and Ella as Emma are also very charming and beautiful.The story is new and has various elements which actually adds very well upto it. The other thing is that the concept of film based on peculiarities is also very nice and it only adds more to the visual experience as every one loves to see children wielding special powers.It may sound like X-Men but from the point of view of a fantasy flick it's actually better than it as comic films are mostly highly clichéd, Secondly the characterization from Miss Peregrine to Jack to the twins is exactly what I wanted to see as when every character gets proper exposure to the big screen , only then a film works.Samuel Jackson as the villain Barron is terrifying both in appearance and in his doings.Also what I liked about this movie is that the story doesn't get into a straight line , it has many elements of surprise and little turns plus it has its base as a innocent child curiosity and essence of childhood indeed. Even though it may feel clichéd but the ending is a Happy one and it will sure bring a smile on your face. Each character in few action sequences use their powers or peculiarities to the best and that's what I loved most about it.Simply stating I love Magical and Fantasy Movies and this is among the Best of them .Easily this beats this year's BFG , Pete's Dragon , Warcraft and When a Monster Calls. Final verdict- This is Easily Tim Burton at his best so don't miss especially if you love Tim's Work.

152,yourfavoritecritic,The First Thirty Minutes were Great!,4,3 November 2020,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the latest young adult adaptation which is directed by Tim Burton and stars Asa Butterfield, Eva Green and Samuel L. Jackson. This film is about a boy named Jacob, who stumbles across a mystery that makes him travel through time to discover Miss Peregrine's home, which is housed to children that have special abilities. Now I'll be honest, I really wasn't looking too forward to this film, Tim Burton's last couple live action films haven't been very good and overall I haven't been a fan of the recent trend of young adult novel adaptations as a lot of those movies just feel cheap and rushed. However I really dug this film, at least for the first hour. The movie opens and it has a really slick editing style, with striking shots that gave me such an indie horror movie vibe, that I got the impression that I may be in for something special, but that mood fades once the protagonist arrives in Wales to discover Miss Peregrine. I'm not saying the movie got horrible after that but it was just a tonal shift from something that I was seriously digging. The rest of the movie focuses on Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children, and for the first 40 minutes it is quite interesting getting the introduction to all the characters and seeing their abilities are pretty cool. Unlike most young adult adaptations, Burton was able to create a movie that felt like it stuck to its dark material and didn't shy away from being scary, which is something I cant say for most movies from this genre. I'm not sure how much of the source material Burton stuck to but he brought forth his own weirdness to it that didn't feel like over-the-top Burton-ness. Though there are some things that due deserve praise in this film, it sadly has a lot of things weighing it down including a very weak and lifeless performance by Asa Butterfield who is normally very good in the roles he's played. However here, I don't know if he was directed to speak all his lines as if he doesn't care but he does. Also the last half of the film takes a turn for the worst by having a really stupid, over-exaggerated climax with skeletons straight out of Army of Darkness, luckily though Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding and really elevates the finally act. My only other real problem with the film is it doesn't explain itself thoroughly, and left me questioning the logic of some things brought up throughout. So this isn't a perfect movie but it's fun for what it's worth, and I'm sure many kids will get a kick out of the film, I just wish it would have maintained that tone at the beginning throughout. Overall I do recommend this film as it is better than most young adult adaptations, and I would like to see a sequel to this film only if it doesn't get as stupid as that third act did, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children gets a 4/10.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
153,bartonj2410,Whatever happened to Tim Burton?!,4,2 October 2016,"Tim Burton strikes me as a pretty peculiar man so he was the right fit for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, a film based on the novel of the same name by Ransom Riggs. Burton has disappointed me recently and I haven't really enjoyed one of his films since Sleepy Hollow back in 1999.Jake Portman (Asa Butterfield) is a boy who doesn't really have anyone close to him, except for his grandfather. When tragedy strikes at home and Jake is left feeling more alone than ever, he goes on a journey to Wales to find out if there was any truth to the fairy tales he was told by his grandfather as a child.Stumbling across Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, that his grandfather visited regularly when fighting in the war, Jake soon meets its inhabitants and Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) herself. Hearing her speak of the danger the the children could be in, Jake makes a connection between that danger and the cause of the tragedy at home.This is very much a family film however, where I think it will lose both adult and child audience members is the fact that it really is quite a boring story told in such a dull way. Tim Burton has made fantasy films before but there is no sense of awe or wonder as there was in something like Edward Scissorhands. The screenplay from Jane Goldman is massively disappointing considering the work she's done on the likes of Kick-Ass and Kingsman in recent years. I enjoyed some of the film but for large parts I was bored thanks to some incredibly drab characters.The film certainly has a visual appeal but even that was ruined by a final act that descended into utter stupidity. Up until then, I thought the effects were really quite good. Then came the moment a crew of skeletons fend off the enemy creatures from the children. All I will say is that the skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts looked better.Coming to the performances, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children makes a massive error in having Asa Butterfield in the lead role. He hasn't done much of note in his career so far and I just found him so bland in this film. Samuel L. Jackson's villainous turn is just laughable but the film's biggest crime was not having enough Eva Green, an actress who would have done the film a massive favour.The use of time travel is something that hindered the film for me as well. Events towards the end don't get explained very well at all, leading to utter confusion as the film drew to a close. I'm sure I won't be the only one who thought so. Overall, this is just a totally forgettable film from Tim Burton.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

This movie is the type of movie that can be imagined by almost any kid. As kids, we imagine places with creatures, colors, where everything is possible and there are no boundaries. I happened to be raised in a family with quite a bit story tellers. While some of my uncles could really trespass the boundaries between scaring and horrifying, from time to time, they certainly helped me imagining places, creatures and many, many possibilities. One of the scariest tales was related to a boy. My uncle called him ""the shadow boy"". It was like 1978 or 1979 so, long before any character with such name. This one scared me because he would show up during birthdays and family reunions and he would not be visible to all but the children. His hair would be dark and spiky and his eyes would glow in the dark. So, in the evening I'd be afraid of the dark because of him. This movie is good.

158,davish_wulf-1,"The worst since ""Charlie""",4,19 December 2016,"I had no expectations at all before I went to see ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" at the cinema. Burton's quality was expected, but I wasn't quite impressed with ""Alice"" 2 neither.... and I preferred not to read anything before catching eyes on this. What can I say? Characters lacked charisma and interest. Miss Peregrine is nothing more than a secondary character in the whole story, dark, bland, failing to glue me to her past or present or even future. This coming from Eva Green, who's an excellent actress, but I'm afraid her acting skills fell short in such a confined space of a story. The characters.. Asa Butterfield was a sad choice, he wasn't great in ""Hugo"" and his cardboard lines on Peregrine's turned his part sometimes a pain to watch, there are lines there lacking so much soul and convincing that anyone on the street could have done better and what a sad choice for his father (Chris O'Dowd) I just can't see him playing a good part, there's something very twisted about this guy (sorry).Huge eyed Ella Purnell gave that odd Burton touch to the movie, but the whole air puffed girl concept... nah... actually the story, at least in the movie, is as appealing as watching a carousel ride. It's colorful, interesting in the beginning but after some spins becomes boring, senseless and a pain to watch until the end. The CGI was ridiculous at some points, the creatures were cartoonish, but that kind of cartoonish look that looks ""unreal"" compared to the overall photography of the movie. I have nothing against Burton's sense of style, his darkish atmosphere, loony looking creatures and mix of reality and fantasy.. but this movie was a mess from end to end. Comparing this with the perfect ""Headless Horseman"" is like comparing art with a rushed up sketch. The movie has it's moments though, the boat scene was nice and perhaps the trademark for future reference, but as in ""Chocolate Factory"", it all starts well and ends up in a mess.I really wish Burton would finally dedicate himself to some classics like ""Dracula"" or a werewolf story. A Dracula made by Burton, now that would be interesting. Even a ghost story (a spirit horror story)... that would be great, not to mention dwelling in the norse mythology with a fantasy Viking movie... or a classic ""Sword's & Dragon's"" style movie.. one can only dream and I doubt that Burton will someday turn his attention to this fine things, waiting for a good director at last.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

That's why I gave it a 5 and not higher. Sorry Tim, I usually love his work, one of my favorite films of his Alice In Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, trust me this film is nothing like his other works. I think it's because he didn't want to use that many visual effects in the film and why not? This film calls for visual effects, it just does.I will tell you why the film needed more visual effects. One the story is about a kid who goes to this magical island to figure out what killed his grandfather. He meets these kids who are peculiar and they have many different talents.1. There's the girl who can create fire with her hands. I think if they have used better visuals it could have been cooler, instead of what it is. Ooh I can heat up a tea with my hands, big whoop.2. A kid who has bees in his body and he can spit them out at you. Umm okay how is that a talent? No offense but that was kind lame.3. There's a kid who can lift tons of weight over her head. Which is cool. But I think it would have been better visually if they had shown her lifting more items over her head instead of pushing a couch to one side of the room.4. a girl can float into the air and control it. Okay that was pretty cool but it could have been better.And let's talk about Miss P here for a moment. She can control time and turn into a bird. Umm okay that's pretty neat but I think a director like Burton could have created that into something awesome and not just ooh look I turned into a bird. Oh don't get me started on the acting. It was okay but it could be much better. It was a bit dry for my taste.Like I said at the beginning of this review. They changed the ending. I am so annoyed at this. But I won't ruin it for you if you haven't read the book then you'll probably enjoy it. But if you read the book you'll be sitting there saying Whoa! Hold up! They changed the ending completely from the book! Trust me, you'll say it.Wait for this one on Redbox or DVD. It's okay but not worth the price of admission.This is not the Tim Burton you knew before.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
160,jpc-34200,Tim Burton's pointless special effects escapade.,5,4 October 2016,Tim Burton is a very peculiar person and this film was an average special effects with the kid Jake having a mental health illness called dementia and his grandpa reading a bedtime story. And his dad calling the psychologist. Tim Burton has made more splashier special effects like Beetlejuice. But this one is filled too much confusion. The problem is that I was confused by the time loop. Allison Janney and Samuel L Jackson showed Jake there was a difference between reality and fantasy. The movie was entertaining but boring too. Miss Peregerine played by Eva Green is a disciplined. The special effects are one of the aspects that don't fail. Judi Dench isn't in that much.

The story-line was really enjoyable as well. I didn't give it a full 10 stars as I think the characters could have been developed a bit more, especially the main character, Jake. There was a bit of an emotional void with his character.The story starts with Jake in current time and place. Due to a tragedy that happened, Jake starts seeing a psychologist. Eventually his family and psychologist are on board with Jake taking a trip with his dad to Wales.Jake was very close to his grandfather and his grandfather told him astonishing tales while growing up. The trip to Wales have to do with those stories. Jake wants to find out if there is any truth to them.The story evolves and you follow Jake on his journey and his own story seeing people and things that only Jake can see. I can't say more without giving up the story. Beautiful scenes with a mysterious story make this a great watch.*Spoiler Alert* The only thing I can knock off for this was the lack of emotion and inability to know the main character better.

It is otherwise bolstered by impressive performances and visuals, with just a hint at some of the themes that could really prove Peculiar Children as the next big fantasy franchise. For all its flaws, enjoyment can still be found within Peculiar Children and while the premise's potential may not have been perfectly executed this time round, I wouldn't turn down a second opportunity to see the world created by both Riggs and Burton, especially if we get more of the same from Eva Green.FULL REVIEW: goo.gl/81Z0lA",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

166,Anaslair,"Please, please read the book.",7,26 February 2017,"I read the book several months ago and there is a lot I no longer remember. However, I do recall a feeling that the movie did not transmit. Of course, a lot changed from the book, from Emma's powers to Miss Peregrine being so young and chirpy to several other details, not to mention things that just sounded silly and without any purpose other than get the characters to do something or get the story to proceed in a certain manner. But mainly many things felt rushed. Some things were just plain dumped which could have worked well and in some instances did, in others it didn't. Also, if there is one thing that makes me cringe it is insta-love.Tim Burton created a new character only because he wanted to work with Samuel L. Jackson. This could have been a really good thing, if played right. However, the bad guys in the book were so much scarier. This dude had the potential to be terrifying and he only managed to do so in the first scenes when he didn't spoke. Then he just came across as silly, at least to me.Hey, it's still a Tim Burton movie. Awesome CGI, sound effects, etc, etc. Lots of clichés as well. As usual, if you have not read the book you will enjoy it a lot more.It was pretty good, not awesome. And I have the feeling the ending is going to ruin the next two books of the series for me which remain unread.Bottom line, please read the book.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The mostly young actors do a fine job. But I consider Mr. Burton's masterpiece to be ""Beetlejuice"", only because of the way he weaved his quirky characters and odd monsters with the music. After leaving the theater, I didn't remember any music from ""Miss Peregrine's"". Some of the scenes are truly epic, and Samuel Jackson and his crew do well as the meanies.

Well, maybe it's not worse than, but rather on the same level. See, to suicide squad I didn't develop any expectation, but to this movie I did. I was sure the characters will be compelling, interesting, not stupid etc etc etc. I couldn't be more wrong.Right off the bat, we see the stereotypical social-anxiety type of hero- No, should I say protagonist. He sure is no hero. Anyways, we see him in one of the most cliché' kind of openings - Him saying something to a pretty girl and she not responding since he's lame & unattractive. That was the moment I gave up on the movie. A few minutes in and that's it. But I kept watching, since I was with friends at the time. As the story progresses, I learn to hate the main character more and more because he is so lame and stereotypical. Even the bullies, who guided him in the wrong way, are stereotypical and predictable.When we saw his love interest in the movie for the first time, it was predictable it was her. There was no development to that. They missed a few steps.Somewhere in the end of the middle of the movie, suddenly our clumsy, social-anxiety'd, scared as a toddler protagonist takes the initiative and becomes the charismatic leader. Which was also predictable. I don't mind this movie being predictable as hell, OK? The problem is EVERYTHING in this movie misses development, steps towards the goal. They just skip into it instead letting the characters develop. I couldn't finish the movie, I forced my friends to switch the movie.One of the worst movies I have ever watched in my entire life.

172,ppilf,Two hours of chaotic meaningless CGI and special effects,3,31 March 2017,"This movie's title and trailers made it look really interesting to me, but it was a big disappointment. The special effects and film production were great, but that's all that can be said good of this film. The story, plot, and characters are just a mishmash of bizarre convoluted nonsense. To put it bluntly, the story is just plain stupid from beginning to end, even for a children's fantasy. If you were to ask me about the acting in this film, it'd be hard to answer because there really aren't any scenes with enough coherent dialog for any serious acting. This movie is best described as two boring hours of chaotic meaningless CGI and special effects. My recommendation, even to children, is don't waste your time and money on this let-down.This movie is a substandard effort by Tim Burton. His movies are never mainstream Hollywood, and are a bit quirky, but they usually do have a degree of quality in the story, script, and art, as well as the special effects. But not this one. I'm beginning to think I'm correct about aging great movie directors/producers, like Ridley Scott (Prometheus). I think they decide to rake in a load of retirement money by cashing in on the huge demographic of young and dumb 12-year-old movie goers. The film makers abandon their usual standards, and make brainless CGI action blockbusters for the big PG movie dollars. Well.. maybe sometimes you can't blame them.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Myself, I never read the books, I just wait for the movie.
Rant over, now the film.
I found it to be a good family film (Mabey not for the younger kids) with plenty of thrills and laughs. It was well acted with an easy to follow story line.
The ""bad guys"" were a little bit over the top but then again, this is a fantasy film.

176,kevin-38242,Magnificent cinematography and engagingly wacky acting doesn't excuse total lack of coherence,5,10 January 2017,"The cinematography and visual effects go some way to rescuing this film from being a complete turkey. Eva Green and Samuel L Jackson do a fine job of portraying eccentric characters that couldn't possibly exist in the real world, and contrast nicely with the bland, everyday-ness of Asa Butterfield and Chris O'Dowd (who deserved better, frankly).My grip with Miss Peregrine is the same as it is with most fantastical movies made for a mainstream audience -- the film-makers have assumed that because it is fantastical, there is no need for it to make any kind of sense at all. There's nothing wrong with having an invisible boy or a girl with teeth in the back of her head as story elements, but effect still has to follow cause, and the basic principles of logic still have to apply. Otherwise you might just as well end the story with ""and then he woke up."" People still have to act like people, unless there is a good reason why they don't.Any story involving time travel needs to be handled very carefully, because the paradoxes involved easily lead to a stupid, meaningless plot. It needs to be explained how a teen-aged boy can be romantically involved with a woman of ninety who just happens, by some quirk of time travel, to look like a kid. I'm prepared to suspend disbelief to the extent of women who can turn into birds, but I'm not prepared to believe -- even for the purposes of storytelling -- that a person can live ninety years in a repeated day during the Blitz and still have the mannerisms and emotional reactions of an adolescent. Not without some explanation, anyway.Unfortunately, the movie is full of jarring oddities like this.

178,dareent-amethyst,If you're looking for simply an entertaining movie and nothing more,7,13 November 2016,"Tim Burton and Asa Butterfield are the two reasons why I saw this movie. Having not read the book I have no idea what the story is going to be like and I have nothing to compare the plot to. Reading the other user reviews i figured many people are disappointed that the movie was not nearly as good as the book. However, as someone who has never read the book I honestly enjoyed the movie. The movie has Tim Burton written all over it. The beautiful topiary garden especially the dinosaur reminded me so much of Edward Scissorhands. Miss peregrines home for peculiar children (the movie) is creepy and definitely not suitable for children. I am pretty sure the twins, the hollows, and the scene with eyeballs are enough to give children nightmare for weeks. Personally I am not disappointed. I liked the plot, the animation, the various peculiarity of the children, although there was something off about miss peregrine that I'm not sure what. I also liked the fact that there was a mixture of comedy, horror, action and fantasy one movie. 7/10 3 more missing because the movie didn't really appeal to me. It was an entertaining movie but when its over, i don't really think about it. I didn't really connect with any of the actors or the story. It was simply a fun to watch movie, but not a must watch. I guess this is another reason why many people are disappointed. Tim Burton's movies are known to be haunting and hard to forget, this one on the other hand, is quite dull.

179,darthMisaskernew,"Tim Burton is back, and it's about time!",8,19 August 2017,"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a freaking awesome movie. There was very little to dislike from it. Tim Burton had a bit of a stinker period in the last few years, starting with the unnecessary Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and climaxing with Dark Shadows, which was one of the dumbest films of that year. But Burton is back with Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children, a movie that serves almost as a love letter to his old films. The plot is super Tim Burtony and revolves around a massive star-studded cast full of very popular names. These people don't distract from the film at all and most of them actually become their own characters...like, you completely forget that they are even the actors at all. Even Samuel L Muthaf***in' Jackson sorta becomes his own character, and he's Samuel L Muthaf***in' Jackson! I think what really moved me about the film is the touching story that a lot of weird youths like myself could relate to. I grew up the weird shy kid who was into bands like Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Avenged Sevenfold, and Korn, and you bet I dressed like generic fanboys of those bands too. I never really had many friends living in San Antonio, and not much appealed to me besides the weird. Tim Burton was the absolute king of weird, and his films like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and of course The Nightmare Before Christmas will forever hold a place in my heart. I'm sure if Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children was made in my early childhood, I'd love it just as much as I do the others. This film is super interesting and I hope Burton makes more like it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
180,Tellyvixen,Maybe a hint of Tim Burton,5,6 June 2021,"Heavy use of color or light filters doesn't give the film atmosphere, it just makes it feel cheap. Most of the production cost must have been used on special effects as those are pretty good. There is a hint of Tim Burton with the monsters and the attempt at atmosphere but he just missed the mark with this film. Though I like the invisible boy, I didn't think much of any of the other child or teen actors. They just fell flat. Eva Green is the highlight of the show, Samuel L. Jackson really hams it up and I think he did enjoy himself in the role but he somehow doesn't work here as the main villain. Unless she really wanted to be in the film I don't know why Judi Dench was there, she had maybe 5 minutes screen time & anybody could have played her part. The general plot got lost along the way and they never found it. There is some entertainment value to it and you could do worse to waste an afternoon away.

The strange and tortuous plot had a number of glaring incongruities and it is difficult to see how Tim Burton could have missed them. But he did. Otherwise, well cast. Asa Butterfield and Ella Purnell are both class acts and manage to deliver gravitas at the appropriate moments. Eva Green is also an underestimated actress. She plays it more or less perfectly. Samuel L Jackson, equally a legend and a class act, struggles to bring his unconvincing character to life. He lacked real menace and baddie conviction. The movie lurches from scene to scene with little thought put into the transitions and continuity. It was a dreary experience. I really wanted to like the movie, but by half way through I was irredeemably disappointed. The ending was lacklustre, unsatisfying and confusing. As a teenage boy would I chose to spend eternity with a hottie trapped in eternal youth or would I go back and see my Grandad? Seriously??

After all the anticipation and expectations, this is one I wish I'd missed. I am not familiar with the book so can't say whether it follows the book closely or not. What strikes me is a kind of Harry Potter syndrome that prevails lately. A number of books and movies have come out depending on mythical creatures, heroes with special powers and monsters that are scary and seem indestructible. As movies these also depend on a grand musical score that foretells what reaction to have. Light music equals a humorous moment coming up. A rising theme equals something is going to happen, etc. Special effects go into high gear. Loads of special effects, atmospheric photography, and in general, throwing all the external accessories at a weak story. It makes for a boring movie. I'm not much for watching old movies on TV yet the contrast between having a genuine story to tell versus the attempt to dazzle with music, bells and whistles, exposes a lack of substance. It is my opinion this is what's missing with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.

185,gloriahur,"Great visuals, Not so great story",6,22 October 2016,"Tim Burton's visual effects and the display of quite peculiar and spooky settings were, as always, sensational and eye-catching. I could see that from the trailer already, and I could also see that the concept of the movie was common and mundane. There are children with special abilities living in a special place and this main character boy joins them to ""save"" them somehow. This similar storyline is found in too many other movies, that it was so easy to expect what would happen event after event.One thing that was notable in the scenario was that there are time loops that no one else than peculiar people can find. These time loops are supposed to protect them from the hallowgasts, but after all, I don't see the point of it because they can actually come through it. But still, they're supposed to be the villains and be defeated by the children who can shoot fire, fly, etc. Frankly, I really don't understand why they were defeated so easily. Samuel L. Jackson barely did anything- why didn't he kill the children in the first place? AND it doesn't make sense that he was killed by a hallowgast of his own side. Another thing that I didn't quite understand was if this was a children's movie or not. The story was too uncomplicated and childish for anyone over children's age to watch, and the image and effects were too violent for children to watch. There are many other flaws in this movie that I didn't mention, such as how Emma can suddenly fall in love with a boy she just met, and how he can't really do anything to help them. Knowing that the screenplay was profoundly changed from the original novel, I don't quite find it agreeable to having it changed so much for dramatic effects.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

It was pretty to watch and well done but that was about it. I also want to specially point out how horrible acting actor Asa Butterfield did playing Jake. I mean, when he needed to show emotion it was like a youtube video actor without any previous emotional actor training. The story started off good with some sciency stuff explaining it til the Jake came across the home for Peculiar children. I get the fact that it is still a fantasyish and I know how Tim Burtons movies are most of the time but the plot holes here was soo big and so frustrating they were not ignorable. I mean the movie starts off, like I said, trying to explain the powers of the kids which gets you interested but towards the middle they just completely give up on explaining them and everything is more fantasy then Harry Potter. I wouldn't mind fantasy if you didn't sell it as a interesting sci-fi superpower movie. However, the children has some amazing powers and their enemies are obviously inferior to their powers but still, infuriatingly for example, a kid that is strong as an elephant wont fight because she is a kid, Miss Peregrine wont go back in time (her power) to get everything better. Towards the end there a couple battles and for a lack of a better word are utterly childish with stupid solutions and IDIOTIC conclusions.

The subtleties in everything, the colours slightly off, the 'different' familiar and grotesque, dreamy and dreadful: it's why we love Tim Burton. More timeless and classy than any X-Men could ever be. Glimmering moments, just shy of being key to anything, offer their full heart to enchant us onlookers. Now that's all fine & proper but somehow it is off. Or perhaps, speaking of Burton, not off enough, if that makes any sense. Something's missing anyway. Tim Burton convinced me of his mastery with many memorable films, until directing the second-most disappointing film of all times (after Star Wars Episode I): Alice in Wonderland. He appears to fall into routines. Then again even the storytelling deteriorated steeply, to the point where even the routines were off. Alice was plain horrible. This film is not horrible but it also isn't what I hoped for. It isn't radiating the heartfelt bittersweet Tim Burton so aptly summoned throughout his career. The story is some sloppy, interchangeable standard. The characters sparkle here and there yet never come to shine. He did not pour his heart into this one it appears.Also, as an Eva Green fanboy, I know what she's capable of. Tim Burton didn't use her to her fullest, didn't allow her to consume us, the children or a mediocre Tim Burton. She went starving. Eva Green sure plays her part well nonetheless, nuanced and shiny in broken perfection. It's just that this whole film is incomplete, done in halves.

Quite simple, if you appreciate the director and the genre you're gonna love it. It is a solid and placid story kept together by a very great acting (especially if you think they mainly are children but you're gonna love the way those children act) and you can tell he must had fun making the movie all over it. After a long run of hipster movies for teenagers, Burton know how to make cinema fresh again. I'd take this over any Marvel/DC movie or Disney live action remake. This was also the first time I felt actually immersed in the 3-D effect of the movie. It was the first time in a long time that I felt like that extra $4 was worth it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
190,quiqueperique,"Not so peculiar, more like average",6,30 September 2016,"First of all I haven't read the books but my brother has and he said the movie is not even 30% accurate to the book so I get it why the book readers are hating it. If you are expecting a truthful adaptation of the novel maybe skip this one.Now in my case as a non reader of the book I had no big expectations for this movie and after watching it I can say it is not a bad movie but it is not very good either. I think it has a good story but it is missing something to make it stand out.I like Tim Burton and he clearly was the right choice to direct I mean his aesthetic works perfect with the tone of the story this feels like Big Fish meets Edward Scissorhands, that being said I think the story felt a little flat.Kudos to Eva Green because she is the only, and I mean the only person in the cast worth mentioning, she fits the character of Miss Peregrine perfect, very mysterious and powerful but with a kind heart, contrary to Asa Butterfield who as Jake felt completely forced and not even relatable. The other adults, even Samuel L. Jackson as the villain, were forgettable. And the kids, who I thought were the ones that were going to stand out, only Ella Purnell kind of didOverall it is pretty average movie with great direction an a clear vision but a cast and a story that were flat. That is why I'm giving it a 6. Not so bad but not so good",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
191,hennyxu,Not Peculiar Enough.,7,5 December 2016,"We all know how strange a Tim Burton movie can be, from Edward Scissorhands to one of the best BATMAN movie ever made, however his quality of work has been lacking lately. With movies like Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows, one would wonder if he will ever make a good movie again. Even though Miss Peregrine isn't one of his best works it is however quite peculiar.In my opinion, Tim Burton used to be a unique director who was able to put his dark twisted vision on the big screen balanced with a good story. This balance has been shattered with his work lately, with too much emphasis on visuals instead of story. Miss peregrine isn't going to make everything better; however it is quite clear that Tim Burton it trying to get his carrier back on track. So what makes this movie so interesting that it has compelled me to write a review? Well Miss Peregrine isn't a true Tim Burton movie. Visual wise he is holding back and story wise it is quite mediocre; however the combination of the two creates a stylish movie that will hold your interest. Hell, Danny Elfman didn't even do the music so that is really something right?The following will discuss the movie in the following order: - Story - Character development - Three act structure - Music - Overall OpinionMiss Peregrine is a movie about self-discovery and acceptance; it starts with a boy named Jake, played by Esa Butterfield, whom is sad and confused after the death of his grant father. After a while Jake receives a package from his grandfather with instructions/notes telling him to go to a special home in Wales. When he arrives at this place he discovers that peculiar things are happening. I'll leave it at that and to simplify it for some look at it as x-men or harry potter crossed with Gothic themes.The three-act-structure in short: A mediocre beginning, great middle, mediocre ending.The main protagonist is Jake played by Esa Butterfield; it is a shame that this character doesn't really grow much throughout the movie. Yes we do see a cliché hero arc where he changes from a normal boy into a hero; however it would have been better if he had to struggle more to get there. The reason for this is mostly the script but I think Esa's performance might have negatively affected the character. What's wrong Esa? You were great in Ender's Game and Hugo! But I digress. Esa Butterfield's performance was bland and really the low point of this movie.The main antagonist is played by the great Samuel L. Jackson. Man he loves this character. Every time when you see him on screen he is chewing up the scenery. He is over performing and he loves it. The supporting cast consists of Judi Dench, Terence Stamp (yes General ZOD), Ella Purnell, and the beautiful Eva Green. The only one worth mentioning is Eva Green, because she is truly carrying the movie. Her presence sets up the movie atmosphere and her performance is, as always, perfect.The music isn't done by Danny Elfman but by Michael Higham and Matthew Margeson and that isn't a disappointment. Their music does a perfect job of setting up the mood and it rightfully underscores the movie. Miss Peregrine is a good movie worth watching if you wish to have a good time. It is one of those movies that everyone can watch with ease without huge plot points or unnecessary drama. It truly is a shame that Tim Burton didn't go one step beyond to make the visuals a little bit more Burton, however what we got was a good peculiar movie for all. Watch it with not too high expectations I will promise you it will not disappoint.I will give this movie a 7.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
192,calypsokidd,A disappointing failure for Tim,4,29 September 2016,"Tim Burton changed SO MUCH of the original story and left out even more that outside of the characters involved the film version of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is hardly recognizable with the book, and even the personalities and the abilities of the characters have been changed! I can't even begin to list all of the changes that have been made (and none of them for the better). The fight scenes that Tim invented are absolutely comical and the acting of Asa Butterfield, who plays the lead character Jacob, is so bad it brings back memories of Channing Tatum at his worst. I love the works of Tim Burton and wanted to come out of this film saying that it's the best film that I've seen so far in 2016 but instead I have to call it an utterly disappointing failure.

194,cyclerrollie,More Of A Cult Classic Then Anything Else,6,26 December 2016,"When it comes to this film I envision it becoming a cult classic in later years, similar to some of Tim Burton's other films. Speaking of Burton, I find this film a very odd choice for him to direct. Like the Alice In Wonderland films, I never thought I'd see him directing something like this.The film has it's highs. The acting of Ella Purnell, Eva Green, and Samuel L. Jackson is really good and deserves awards. The film's setting of Wales is a great place to have a movie set. Seeing Allison Janney in this type of a film was also a treat as I love her acting and voice.Other than that though, the film has some lows. One of them is the acting of Asa Butterfield, which is cringe-worthy at times. It appears as if he was never even invested in the film at all. The final act is very rushed as well, with the film jumping through the climax rather quickly.Fans of Tim Burton will watch this one for years to come, but I won't be watching it too often after this initial viewing.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
195,moritzmeyerautor,"Not quite up to Burton's best, but also not a let-down.",7,24 February 2017,"It's not hard to see, what of this story captured the attention of one of Hollywoods greatest storytellers. Tim Burton always had a soft spot for the outsiders, the misfits and, well, the peculiars of this world. And Miss Peregrine just has a full bunch of them. So, what could go wrong with this director on such a tailor-made project?As it turns out: A couple of things. It's been quite a while now, that Burton delivered a movie, that has the magic, while also emotional qualities of his early works. You can't help but think of Edward Scissorhands while watching this movie. At last he would have been a perfect fit in this group of not extraordinary, gentlemen but kids. These kids are overseen by Miss Peregrine, a governess-like figure, superbly portrayed by Eva Green. She cannot only transform herself into a falcon, but also manipulate times. With that ability, she creates a so called ""loop"", which puts her and the kids in a groundhog day situation. They relive the same day over and over again, which keeps them from aging, but also away from the real world. Thus, they are safe from any threats to them, of which the most dangerous are the ""Hollows"": invisible, eye-eating monsters from some Guillermo del Toro movie. In comes Asa Butterfields character Jacob, who is the only one, who can see and hence kill those creatures, an ability, he inherited from his grandfather. He once lived in Miss Peregrine's home, as well, but left to go after the Hollows. It's his mysterious death right at the beginning of the movie, that sets the whole thing in motion. There sure is a great, fantastical movie in here somewhere, and we get a glimpse of it in the first half, when Burton introduces his child/teenage characters. A girl, that is so fragile, you literally have to hold her tight to keep her from floating away. A young man, who can give live to his own weird, creepy dolls. A boy, who can project his dreams through his eye onto a wall. It almost seems, as if each of the characters in the movie represent a certain aspect of the director's personality. For Burton aficionados, there's a lot to love and discover and I'm pretty sure, this is the part to which Burton felt most dedicated to. The movie collapses, when it comes to the third act. The whole story about time loops didn't seem very plausible in the first place, but it becomes even more confusing, when we learn about the origins of the evil Hollows and the group behind them. They are led by Samuel L. Jackson, who stands in for Johnny Depp to deliver yet another completely ludicrous performance in a Burton movie. There are a couple of very chilling moments in the film, especially in the first part of it. But this sense of creepiness is entirely washed away by SLJ's cheesy performance. He acts like a bad parody of ""The Joker"" and just goes full-on to chew every scene. At no time did I take him for a serious villain. I really felt like Burton had no interest whatsoever in this character or any of the stuff outside of Miss Peregrine's home. So, I liked a lot about this movie, notably Eva Greens performance, the references to previous Burton works. The children characters also worked well. They are not just young X-Men with superpowers, it's more like they don't really know what to do with their talents. I found this very credible and I think, that young adults can relate to that aspect. On the other hand the teenage romance didn't work as good as it might should have, but at least it didn't bother me. So, unfortunately the movie doesn't hold up to its promising opening. It wasn't a disappointment at all. But neither was it up to Burton's best works.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
196,bluecouchpotato,Disappointing and unconvincing,5,24 August 2017,"I had this film on my watchlist for a long time based on a trailer I saw when it first released, but missed seeing it in the theater. I was excited to see that it was available to stream.I read the trilogy first and loved it so was curious to see how the three books would be condensed into a single film. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed and that disappointment didn't stem solely from the book-to-film transfer.While the cinematography was effective and definitely captured the mood conjured up by the books, the characters felt really flat to me, and badly cast. In particular, the characters of Emma and Miss Peregrine were not convincing. Even Jacob seemed stilted and less 'filled with wonder' about his new world than I expected. Similarly, the story line felt increasingly disjointed and unconvincing as the film progressed.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Somehow something has gone horribly wrong.... When the kids are chased near the end I couldn't care less if they would get caught or survive. Simply because their characters remain bland and uninteresting and therefor are impossible to relate to. Beit Harry Potter, X-men or Nanny McPhee: all these, somewhat different, movies about or with children that are ""outiders"" make you take in an interest in how their characters evolve throughout the story.

Sure, the visuals are very nice, and you gotta like the quirkiness of it all, especially if like me you like magical movies, but come on, what about the story? I haven't read the book so I can't say how much it got butchered but I can comment on the quality of everything else here. The main problem is that there is no plot. There is some A to Z semblance of a plot but who really cares about any of it? I don't know. Everything just falls flat, is lifeless and stiff. It was a torture to watch from the very beginning. It had no atmosphere, the acting was terrible, even from Chris O'Dowd. Only Eva Green was relatively good but the script was so bad that even she didn't have much to work with.Maybe it was a movie for kids and I just didn't get it? Even so, the kids should be disappointed because there was nothing in this movie to draw me in, no suspense, drama, absolutely nothing. Just a bunch of scenes stitched together. And Burton is the director? You wouldn't be able to tell. His muse (Helena) abandoned him and he can't make a good movie anymore? I'm seriously wondering, what the hell was that?Maybe it wasn't a one-star movie because not all of it was so awful, but because it was SO disappointing, I can only give it one star.

210,Whingewood,"Inconsistent story, weak villains, boring main characters",5,9 October 2016,"(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)The trailers for this made it seem quite interesting (despite the pretentious title), and is also directed by Tim Burton.The story hinges on the fact that among the 'peculiar' people there are some that can create time loops; havens that exist outside of time where they live the same day over and over. Time travel/manipulation always sets off an alarm bell for me, as it usually leads to either incredibly lazy writing or a massively- inconsistent plot. In this film we got the latter.Without going into detail, there were many cases of inconsistencies that meant it was difficult for me to stay immersed in what was going on.The villains of the story were hyped up a lot as something to fear, but they were either incompetent or over-confident (or both!). I find that Samuel L Jackson always gives enjoyable performances, and I thought he and his character were great in this, just not as the main villain (a guilty pleasure of mine is liking his performance as Octopus in 2008's The Spirit; a truly awful film that I recommend you never watch).With Tim Burton directing it, you'd think it would be another amazing film. However, I tried to think of the last one of his film's that I actually enjoyed. I had to go onto IMDb to find out, but it was 2003's Big Fish. That's thirteen years since I last enjoyed a Tim Burton film. At least as far as I'm concerned, he's living on past glories.Back on topic, this film was mediocre. The main characters were boring, which is a shame because the background characters (the kids at the school) were great. Quite disappointed overall.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Despite some intriguing story elements and a promising first act, it sadly ends up being OK.",5,2 October 2016,"Just to clarify one thing: I don't hate Tim Burton at all. In fact, I kinda love his work. He has a very unique and imaginative vision, seems to have a tasteful choice for actors (besides Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter), and can really pour his heart and soul in some of his films like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Corpse Bride"", and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". But, just like any director, he has his missteps also. Some of his recent work is very lackluster and, at times, flat-out bad (Planet of the... BLAHK!).But I was still excited for this particular project of his. I haven't read the book, or knew much about it, but when I saw the trailer I got my hopes up. Maybe this will be his big comeback! Asa Butterfield is an actor I like, the imagery is appropriately dream- like and the source material seems to fit his style perfectly. It even has the screenwriter from X-Men: First Class!So I went to see the film with a few of my friends in a theater of around 15 people and 25-30 recliner seats. I couldn't wait to see another great Tim Burton movie!And for the first half of the film... I genuinely enjoyed it! Sure, it does take some time for Jacob to reach Peregrine's home, but once he does... I couldn't help but smile like an idiot. The world that Jacob enters is fascinating, the visuals are exceptional, and every one of the peculiar kids are very interesting side- characters. I wanted to learn more about the girl that could lift boulders over her head! There is also this kid that can project his dreams into film... how cool! The first act always left me with questions that I was excited to hear about when the plot kicks in.And then the plot kicks in...That is where the movie starts to run out of steam.I could tell there were a lot of story elements in the book just from watching the movie, because in the second half a lot of it felt crammed in. Whenever I try to follow the story as best as I can, there's always this one subplot that makes precious little sense. It also doesn't help that the villain is weak and his motivations are somewhat vague.The climax is pretty abrupt and Burton sadly delves into a few clichés that aggravate me. A lot of it felt by-the-numbers at that time, and I was sorely disappointed.That's not to say that this was a bad film, because it isn't. The acting (especially from Eva Green) is competent, the whole film is imaginative in its story and visuals, and somewhere buried beneath lies a great film with lots of creative ideas and appealing whimsy. But the plot is messy, the main character is bland, the pacing is at times uneven and, in the end, it's just another average YA adaptation that had loads of potential.VERDICT:+ Visuals + Well-cast, especially for Eva Green + Imaginative + Sense of wonder in the first act + Solid directing + Interesting side charactersVillain - The hero is underdeveloped - Plot is messy - Pacing is uneven - Unconvincing love chemistrySCORE: 5.5/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Each peculiar got to show off their unique talent and it was much more exciting, scary, and fun -- unexpectedly, the ending was more entertaining than I'd imagined it to be, rather than creepy). I also felt that the movie flowed better than the book and I liked the movie version of Ms Peregrine much better than the book version. The movie was obviously faster paced. I would say one downside was that because of this we didn't get to see how the relationship between Jacob and the peculiar children (particularly Emma) developed as we did in the books.

The first half of the movie is excellent and many people will be on the edge of their seat throughout. The second half is most comparable to a can of cheese-wiz. Sam L. Jackson had no place in this role and the movie could have been significantly better if someone was else was cast in his stead. While I admire the work of Sam, this felt like a knock-off reprisal of his role in the film Jumper. On a final note, I would not take children under the age of 14 to this movie. The movie seems like it makes for a good family movie in the trailer, but there were a few scenes that even had me (a grown ass man) disgusted and horrified in a way that only Tim Burton could dream up.

The ending did seem a little flat and I am not sure why - I think it was an emotional response as it seemed like the correct ending, but just didn't satisfy- hard to define. The boys also found some things a little scary in it - so they thought that it wouldn't be suitable for kids younger than them (13 & 14). the acting was mostly very good and you did get to know the characters reasonably well.If I was able I would have given 7.5 instead of 7.There is potential here for more movies in this fantastical world and I hope that this transpires. It does make me want to read the books.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Strange people living unusual lives right among us, but invisible to us. Their relationships strained by their circumstances and the dangers they face. A hero thrust among them, challenged to help while torn about leaving his own world behind. All good. But then, the Hollywood script conventions hit and the mood is ruined. Violent adults threatening the children, monsters that must be fought, a love story between two emotionally underdeveloped teens, the climactic battle fought against all odds, and finally, the unlikely reunion. I just wish that Hollywood had another plot, and another tone. So tired of the same...",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

It's the kind of movie that should've either stayed a book, be 3 movies long, or pull a ""A Series of Unfortunate Events: A Netflix Original"" and gotten a series. I mean come on, the plot is 3 stories long, and that's just THIS part of the story, in total there's 6 books plus extra stuff.I read the books first, and yes read the books, they're awesome, top notch, everything I want in a book. This movie, however, as someone who read the books, is rushed, a tad annoying, and THEYVE CHANGED PEOPLE AROUND!Olive is supposed to be a little girl, who is lighter than air. Emma is supposed to be fire gal or whatever. Bronwyn is supposed to be the same age as Emma and Jacob, NOT JAKE BTW HIS NAME IS JACOB. Fiona is supposed to be a messy haired mute, and has a smootchy smootchy thing going with Horace(or Hugh I honestly can't remember). And, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Miss Peregrine a tad extra ""peculiar"" than in the books? I feel like she's unnecessarily odd.Now I may have been able to look past all these character changes, had the plot been spot on. However it was not. This film, on multiple occasions, felt like it required me to have read the books to fill in the gaps. This point of no return in the movie comes at like the very end of the movie? It doesn't set enough time aside to deal with anything in regards to, for example, the villains motives, or develop the villains in such a way, whereas I somewhat sympathize with them, to a point of understanding their point of view, but disapprove of their way of getting their desired results.All in all, it's not very good, read the books yall, they're awesome.

220,Jarodaily,Coming from someone who has read all 3 books,6,28 September 2016,"The first few parts of the movie lived up to its original story, introducing Jacob and the rest of the main characters, the peculiars and Miss Peregrine. But if you watch closely, you'll notice that Peculiars were hunted by Hollows and have their eyes taken. That's one thing that'll make you cringe in the first few scenes aside from the peculiarity switch of Emma & Olive. I already forgiven Tim Burton and understood what he has in stores for us fans if he switch the peculiarities of the two main character but then half way on the movie, you'd clearly be like...WTF because they missed out A TONS OF IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE STORYLINE/TIMELINE. They never even mentioned Hollows in human form as Wights, which is a big issue because there's like a huge difference between hollows and wights. Jacob never even gets to control Hollows in the movie but his peculiarity in seeing hollows is in it. There's some sort of a love triangle thing going on between Olive, Emma and JAcob that makes Enoch jealous. That was not even in the book. And Olive is a kid, watdaheck? I'd give this movie a 6 and this is an act of kindness and generosity. As a fan, after watching the movie, i felt so disappointed as it lacks a lot of important points in the book that SHOULD HAVE MADE IT IN THE MOVIE. Addison was not even there, they never even get into the part where Miss PEregrine got injected by some vaccine making her loose her ability to turn back into human form.... enough said, enough ranting.

Well, remember that information because an hour and a half into the movie...you will have learned nothing more than that. Me and my grandmother were looking at each other saying when is something going to happen? The story was very flat. It's 1 or 2 site gags with a lot of needless chatter and basically plays out like a Reality TV show but showing the parts you DON'T want to see. We shut it off an hour and a half into the movie... Think of it like this. If this movie were told by a story teller, he would clear his throat, open his book, and say ""a boy finds Ms. Peregrins School for Pecurliar children"" then he would pause and just stare at you for an hour and half while puffing his pipe. Tim Burton might have been quite the story teller when he made Edward Scissors Hands, but since the re- imagining of Charlie and the Chocolate factory where no one failed to point out that Johnny Depp was acting like a Coked out Michael Jackson and the fact he cast that 1 Indian Littler person to play all those terrible Techno Hindu Munchkins and now this Hunk of crap rip-off of Harry Potter or name any other British children's books, Lemony Snickets Etc, the guy should have retired in peace years ago like George Lucas should have before he ruined his first 3 movies with Sub-par CGI.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
222,herman-787-132796,A dark fantasy that failed to deliver,5,5 October 2016,"I know Tim Burton's name for the first time when I saw ""Batman"" (1989) (his work such as Beetlejuice never imported to Indonesia), and I saw several of his outstanding piece of work such as ""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Sleepy Hollow"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Sweeny Todd"". From my experience Tim Burton's ""peculiar"" that he is very strong in visualization. It's kinda like a child's unstoppable wild imagination. So I expected so much from this movie This movie is about a community of human with special abilities that choose an awkward way to live their live, repeat one day life by creating magic loop These humans are children with special abilities that under protection of an adult protector. The film starts with Jake Portman (Asa Butterfield), a regular teenager living in suburban Florida with his awful parents and also a worker in supermarket. Since he was about 4 or 5 years old, he already been told a fantastic adventure story by his grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp), that Abe admit is his real life adventure. As years goes by, Jake's torn apart between his believe in Abe's story and the science that he learn at school that there are no such things as multi tentacle tongue monsters or children with special abilities. But these stories about monsters and ""special children"" suddenly seem like they might hold some dark truth to them after one night he found out his grandfather Abe killed with both his eyes taken. Before Abe take his last breath, still manage to ask Jake (he always call his grandson Tygritus – Tiger in Polland) to go to Wales and find Miss Peregrine. And the story goes, that finally Jake found the house only to find out that the house already burnt down on Germany bombing in Sep 3rd 1943, driven by his curiosity he entered that house and meet these peculiar children accidentally. These children then brought him to a place and magically he swan his own eyes the same house his grandfather told him about, in the same place that he know that already blown away by Germany bomber plane. Then Jake meet Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) who is capable of transforming herself into a falcon and the ability to manipulated time – which she is not the only one that can do this.Miss Peregrine has been able so far to preserve in an endless cycle (like one of Tom Cruise sci-fi movie ""Edge of Tomworrow"") the day prior to the fatal bombing by creating secret magic ""loops"" in exact time. Then Emma (Ella Purnell), the sweet blonde who has to wear lead heavy boot so she doesn't fly away. There's Olive (Lauren McCrostie), the redhead who has to wear gloves cause There's the girl with a ravenous mouth hidden on the back of her head. The invisible boy ""Wilard""who likes to play tricks. The 8 years old girl who can make things grow super fast. The 12 years old boy who can use his eyeball to project image and finally the weird masked twins (and wear a weird costume). Frankly I got a very big hope for this movie, that I wish this movie is more then just some human with special abilities torn in good and bad side (oups...does this sound like X Men?), but turn out to be ""X-Kids"". In my personal opinion this movies shouldn't take 2 hours, because almost one hour the visionary Tim Burton failed to develop mystery chemistry into the mind of audience, even though Tim already succeeded snap my mind through the tragedy of Abe death and the creepy glance of Baroon (Samuel L.Jackson) in the first 15 minutes, but then my curiosity is just like vaporized into the air.Tim Burton waste to much time to explore things that I think is not even matter to much for this movie that even didn't work well – like the emotional between Emma and Jake or the supper. I think is a bit better if Tim just cut it to the chase where Emma finally proof that to Jake that he also a peculiar kid (Jake can see things what others can't).If there are things that this movie do is the well done performance of Eva Green as Miss Peregrine. She played the character in such style, and since I and many most of audience in my town never read the book – Eva succeeded gave us a cruel Miss Peregrine in mind, her performance really gorgeous with dark gown, really portray a vigilante, wise and always beware lady killer.And so Samuel L.Jackson, that not just soft lens for evil eyes – as usual his long experience that made all that gesture that he is so evil. The rest? Well, they play along, not bad, but just play along. The action parts? The only thing that still eye catching is the multi tentacle tongue monsters and a little bit surprise the weird twin kids really have deadly abilities.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
223,Krusader_Donkey,DHKR: Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,9,2 October 2016,"The best way to describe this movie is a strange combination with childish creativity and whimsy mixed in with a healthy dose of dark, adult, and even scary moments. Obviously, this being a Tim Burton film, that's to be expected. Although, it does has moments where it actually is quite brilliant and breaks through the mold that the previous, more uninspired recent films done by the same director. Alice Through the Looking Glass, while not really a terrible film, fits that category. It had creative ideas in it, but it barely utilized them to the fullest potential.Miss Peregrine's HPC, however, is everything that Through the Looking Glass had going for it, expanded more in depth, and had a much better story holding it together. The children all have their weird powers and oddities, most of which have been seen from the trailer, but others show a great deal creativity. One child can project his dreams in a prophetic style and broadcast them like a movie projector. Another, not exactly seen from the trailer, had the ability to use hearts and make puppets out of otherwise nonliving beings. The twins, heavily advertised in the trailer but kept as secret as possible, quite possibly have the scariest looking powers you will see.Another shining greatness in the movie are the villains, a group of Hollowghasts and evil Peculiars lead by Mr. Barron(played by none other than the great Sam Jackson). Originally, they were a group of scientists that wanted to gain immortality by extracting the energy from certain Peculiars, but instead they ended up as the disturbing, invisible Hollows(Which look kind of like Slenderman, but have long tentacles in their mouths). Some Hollows actually regained humanity by devouring the eyes of the Peculiar children.If there's a single fault in the movie, it would have to be the main character. Asa Butterfield is just annoying in this one. His character has no real problem, honestly, I just disliked his voice in this one. It was that strange mix between adolescence and maturity that was grating to hear, and clashed with the many British accents that makes it seem like he doesn't belong. However, seeing that he's supposedly from a different time and country in the story, so I guess I can't really complain. besides, its one tiny fault in an otherwise great movie.Go out and watch it if you're a fan of Tim Burton or just like dark children's movies in general.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
224,kirkir-17920,Mostly Bland Movie with good Ending,5,4 November 2016,"During the vast majority of this film, I came very near to falling asleep. Half of the actors clearly did not care about their roles, and the story was very clichéd and predictable. While being creative (as usual with Tim Burton) this movie was your stereotypical adventure film with some very low-quality acting. I can name about a dozen films off the top of my head with this exact premise: A kid who is the son/daughter of a famous (fill in the blank: wizard, demigod, magical figure, whatever floats your boat) is ordinary until he/she finds out he/she has some sort of magical power. Co-incidentally, some mysterious evil force is trying to take over the world in the process, so the new kid (who has become very powerful) now has to stop the evil force with the help of some friends. These movies are all overdone, and have nothing to be taken from them. They are bland and predictable. I would expect someone like Tim Burton to be better than this, but obviously he has taken a real nosedive. This movie was nothing special. It was just a typical fantasy movie with no important morals, walking close to the fine-line of 'Cash grab.' I did enjoy the ending however. Not because it had a clever twist or an original concept, but because Sam Jackson's Barron was spectacular. He was a three-dimensional character who scared you and made you chuckle at the same time. Jackson really deserved to be in a better film with such a good performance. Overall, I would not recommend this. The movie's not awful, but it's just bland and tasteless.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
225,anaahnu,"Can't say I liked it. Can't say I disliked. The movie's good, but I excepted more",8,6 October 2016,"Baleful and beautiful. The Iphone Age vs the Great World War era. A young boy, almost completely consumed by the environment (including his parents, mediocre and stupid as they are, and a good-natured psychiatrist). The only man he loves is his granddad, and this is where the weird things start, because old Abe's got some dark secrets. Really dark...When the story begins to untwist, there are some nods to most well- known stories about magical academies (remember Prof X, remember Dumbledore!) There's even a slight touch of the Whoniverse, and not only because time on the island is so tricky... There is the headmistress, Lady Peregrin herself, sharing motherly love and comfort with a child's corpse. There are the wicked wights, whom I'd compare to Nazis: so much alike, so equally creepy. There is a Tinker Bell (blast thee, Disney's, for the only American mythology we have, we get it from thee!) Though she's not Tinker Bell really: just a meek girl, being borne by Jake's hands throughout the WWII. The real hero doesn't show up (he only phones from time to time), so Jake has to take his place and protect the school.The end of the film (not counting Samuel L. Jackson's magnificent, frightful performance!) looks much more like a soothing bedtime story than Burton's ""brand"" horror. The last battle and its consequences are... just what one should expect in a typical Hollywood movie. Jake lives an ordinary life (though he's still psycho - or so I hope), and shares some moments of quietness with the lassie in blue. That's not what I wanted. Really, I don't know what is worse, the soppy fairy-tale ending we get or a drama (perhaps, a melodrama) which we didn't. Maybe it's good: the viewer can think himself, what the end could really be.There's a lot to think after the film. (But nothing left for the heart). A good and reasonable work: Tim Burton really has reformed after his 2010th 'Alice' failure. If not the fact that it is non-emotional. It doesn't spoil the story; perhaps it doesn't pretty much suit for me, but I approve the fact that many people like it.

Why should anyone be afraid of a creature who dies from a crossbow bolt, like a normal human? I don't care if it's 4 meters tall, has tentacles in it's mouth and is invisible...it dies like a human! The bad guys cannot accomplish anything on the grand scale, they can be killed by a guy wielding a shotgun! Or by a boy with a crossbow. Come on! These were by far the worse bad guys I have seen in a movie. The children were much more powerful than the ghasts and the main antagonist had no useful super-power.

Or maybe these other works of art were inspired by the book, it's really hard to tell at this point.Peculiar children hiding from people for safety because their gifts make them dangerous (very 'X-Men'), protagonist relating more to his humanity side thinking he doesn't possess powers but he actually does (so 'Sky High'), time-loops that reset the last 24 hours of a specific date (uhm, hello May 10, 1994 prison world of The Vampire Diaries!), a tired love story and many more.I haven't read the books so I can't relate to readers complaining about the changes they made to the film. As a viewer however, I could say that Tim Burton's touch is impossible not to be felt in every scene. At least, there's something to hold on to if you enjoyed his other works.The film is an almost-there attempt to be something special in a sea full of similar genres. It builds the hype but it falls flat up to the very end. The acting is not outstanding except for Miss Peregrine herself.Should you watch it after you read the book?

Time loops, protected supernatural children, nazis, invisible scissor handed demons. We've kind-of seen it all before, in more coherent packages. This movie's crazy plot is really quite absurd.But if you can get past this, there is a lot to like. Eva Green's accent and presence is nothing short of a delight. The young protaganists love story is charmingly developed, and , as always in Tim's movies, the special effects are bizarre, colourful and a delight.Despite the movie's plot getting lost between the book's storyline, and something more screen friendly, it's still a nice way to spend two hours.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
231,daretostruggledaretowin,Another young adult novel adaptation,6,10 October 2016,"Saw this with my daughter and fiancé recently at the request of my daughter. She had read the book and enjoyed it so was interested in seeing the adaptation. Despite some minor variations, the film stayed mostly with the plot of the book apparently. Having not read the book, I cannot comment on these differences at this time.What I can comment on is the apparent phenomenon of adaptations of young adult fiction novels into films. A string of formulaic, dystopian type thrillers came on the heels of The Hunger Games (2012). The Hunger Games actually does have a redeeming message about class, although by the end it reveals itself to be ever so slightly a reactionary message. The Giver (2014), however, an apparent Hunger Games clone, has an entirely Ayn Randian objectivist message that I don't recall getting from the book when I read it as a teen. I do remember it being influential on my thinking as an angsty youth who suffered as an individualist beneath the wheel of conformism. I calk it up to youth. Seeing the adaptation of the Giver years later revealed it to me to be a profoundly reactionary, right-wing message. A utopian society where there are no poor, no wars and not crime but there is also not individualism sounds a lot like Cold War anti-Communism in the context of a few years of radical thinking and praxis.This brings me to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016) directed by over-rated ""auteur"" Tim Burton. First, the plot has the unfortunate odor of blockbuster super-hero type films that have flooded theaters with mediocrity lately. The message appears to be that ""peculiar"" is ""special"" and that ""special"" means that you have super- powers to do things that are what Hume would define as miracles: ""a violation of the laws of nature."" This is maybe a liberal attempt at teaching that people with disabilities are valuable to society, but fails to convey this message as all the ""peculiarities"" of the children are supernatural things that are in fact very useful in a number different context. Rather than disabilities they are super-abilities. Tim Burton follows a string of shitty films including the bastardized remake of Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), the incredibly boring Corpse Bride (2005) and the profoundly awful Alice in Wonderland (2010).Some of Burton's early films including Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994), Beetlejuice (1988) and Mars Attacks (1996) were rather inspired. However, at this point Tim Burton's aesthetic is tired and run down and his films are commercial, CGI-infused visual spectacles that attempt to make up for lack of good story telling by offering a lot of flashing lights on screen.Miss Peregrine kept my attention and did have some interesting moments and ideas, but it suffered from the society of the spectacle pathology of CGI obsession and constant action rather than character development and commentary.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I think she picks up good things.The main character was amazing. I like his personality and he has a good stereotype.The girl who floats is so enchanting! She seemed a bit shy.All the other children were so cute and made me want to reach out and grab them, a simple thing yet a culmination of impetus. I actually have an interest in children.

She does like younger kids. :) I'm still interested in Tim Burton's art and movies, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and the other people who work with him. If I am an Eva Green fan, I need to be with all other Eva Green fans, which may now be like the whole world. I'm not much of a home movie watcher, but I may consider it. If anyone else is considering, I did watch thru Netflix some, tho the movies are inexpensive usually, I found before. It's amazing to have some hold on the lives in public of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp because you can relate to film buffs on the matter when the topic arises. Because they did Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, they go around the world with an aura of greatness about them. I guess they are generous with their skill in love. It's a mystery that happens to many great people. :) I recommend being a fan and posting online, like here on the IMDb Message Boards, and including them in your blog.

235,UrAverageMovieCritic,A great but flawed movie,6,9 June 2017,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie as I'm a fan of the x-men, but this is nothing like x-men at all. And to the IMDb reviewers who are saying that this movie is bad because it has ""horrible acting"", had ""no plot"" (????), or because it was ""boring"", that is purely subjective and does not detract most people from enjoying the movie. This movie's main weak points lies objectively in these three areas: BAD EDITING, BAD USE OF CHARACTERS/BAD STORYLINE, and CONFUSING TIME LOGIC.BAD EDITING/POST-PRODUCTION: I've noticed that there are a lack of visual or narrative cues for transitioning from the current scene to the next. This is especially evident when they travel back in time. There is basically no easy way to tell that Jake is in the present or the past unless you try hard to search for cues in the background. They should've color graded the scenes in the past to make it look more vibrant than normal — giving it that dreamy and idyllic feel. Also the scenes shot in the present are too vibrant themselves, possibly too natural even, and so it doesn't really have that cinematic vibe to it.BAD EXECUTION OF CHARACTERS/BAD STORYLINE: To me, it seems like none of these characters have mastered their powers yet. Assuming that they have more to learn, I don't understand why Miss Peregrine didn't train them to the full potential if she knew that the hollows were still out to get them. Just imagine Olive's full potential with her power, she could probably be a human flamethrower compared to the kettle heater that she is now. Granted I haven't read the story so I don't know if they can ""upgrade"" their powers, but all these characters could've had the potential to defeat all these hollows without a sweat if they've used their powers wisely.CONFUSING TIME TRAVEL LOGIC: The time travelling logic they've used in this movie doesn't make sense at all. It feels like the writers based their logic on what they think time should be, NOT on how time actually functions. Also I know that this is a fantasy sci-fi movie, but technically so was x-men and they at least had some convincing scientific theory or explanation to explain their phenomenons. The mere ""recessive gene"" explanation wasn't enough to account for all the rather complex powers the peculiars have.I think if they hired some better cinematographers that actually knew how to properly color grade a movie or how to properly frame the narrative in a non-confusing fashion, I would've enjoyed this movie just a bit more.

It's time for you to learn what you can do.Jake: But, I'm just ordinary.Unfortunately I was let down by this movie. There was so much potential here and with a good trailer playing in theaters and on TV, this movie had me with high expectations. If you plan on seeing this film and you have seen the trailers, just remember this review and if you have read the book, do not go see it in theaters because you will probably hate it. I have yet to read the books though. So if you are in my boat, this review is for you!Long time Tim Burton fan, I was deeply disappointed with how much he held back in this film. I believe this film would have done a lot better with more of an eerie feel like the trailers had portrayed and like so many of Tim Burton's films carry. I felt that this story was watered down. Aspects that could've contributed to the peculiarity of the film would be the music, cinematography, and characters. I must say that the score of this film is beautiful in itself but when you pair it with the film it does not carry as well. It needed to be darker and a bit sadder, especially through a few scenes that called for it. Also in contrast to this, the music needed to come to life in scenes of discovery and adventure when the movie was displaying a fantasy world to the audience and I didn't feel the music at these times.Bruno Delbonnel was the director of photography on this project and a job well done I must say. He is known for his work on Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Amelie and Inside Llewyn Davis. Three great examples of great cinematography, especially Amelie. I felt his touch come out in many scenes throughout the movie and it actually reminded me of his earlier work on Harry Potter and Dark Shadows (Johnny Depp). Unfortunately, this type of cinematography was not prominent throughout the whole film. I believe the choice in a dull reality than a colorful fantasy world works for most films but for this film it could have been done differently. Jake's reality was well told regarding a dull color scheme and his mundane life, but his fantasy world should have been consistently darker with some muted colors.Characters were so odd in this film. The disinterested and unloving father, the workaholic mother. Shelley, I don't even know exactly who this was in relation to Jake? A co-worker I think, she had the most peculiar performance in my opinion and her screen time was minimal at the beginning of the film. I could only imagine how well each one of these characters contributed to the books and made it more clear as to why Jake wanted a life more than his own but in the film it didn't work as well as it could have. Miss Peregrine had an excellent role when she was first introduced but as the film continued her character personality began to subside. I really enjoyed the character of Enoch played by Finlay MacMillan. He was exactly what the film needed in both personality and his peculiarity. A bit of edge and scary storytelling through his character. I did enjoy the movie even with all the points mentioned above. The action scene toward the end of the film was superb and clean which is a job well done for the younger audience. The costume and design of the film was excellent and the story was still very imaginative and creative. I would love to see this film turned into a series because there is still so much content and potential for this story. One that would be better suited for a TV show with multiple episodes and seasons.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
238,aan_ke,It could've been so good...,5,19 August 2020,"But at the end I had like so much questions, and also a lot of scenes where my mind blocked because there were quite a few irregularities, which is sad for a movie that seemed so good in the trailer.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
239,rob_dierenvriend,Very interesting movie,8,11 October 2016,By the trailer i could already tell that i would have mixed opinions about this movie. I was wrong. This movie is one of those movies that has comedy for the whole family and manages to mix that with a undertone of horror. Same with the locations. The plot is also very unique with many possibilities and surprises. It also has good characters. Although it uses many clichés the story still feels fresh and good. It never get's boring and never fails even though it uses things like the clichés and jump scares All together it is a good movie for whoever likes a mix of comedy and dark humor done RIGHT unlike Scary Movie and it's sequels. The one who made this movie is truly peculiar.,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

241,jibranahmad,Vanilla or Frankenstein,3,17 February 2017,I am not sure whether to describe my view of the movie as a vanilla or Frankenstein. The movie was very plain and without excitement. I could say with confidence that the entire movie was quite predictable and done before. That brings us to Frankenstein. The movie craftsmanship itself seems like it was directed to be a bit of every other popular movie plots. The love story seems like a remake of time traveling movie. The creatures seem to be a bit part of Harry Potter and some other movies. It certainly did not seem to be adding much creativity to plots that seems very reused.,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
242,LedyMissy,Gray Lush Green,7,10 November 2016,"I've never been so glad to be proved wrong this time. I thought this movie would be boring.First note to take is the visual. A wide range of breath-taking grayness of rain and pickled beauty of lush green garden.This is how you work fantasy on screen. With peculiarity of reality and a dash of lone journey.The movie shines for the most part, thanks to the Tim Burton-ness.The only bug is that some action scenes are a bit too... clunky chunky, and childish. Kinda remind me of early Spy Kids, but without the enthusiasm of the whole kiddie stuff its predecessor has. It's the one off-note from the movie which I don't admire. Though not ""all"" action scenes are bad, some of them did do justice to get you a grip.Asa depicts Jake's character development greatly, along with Eva's stunning Miss Peregrine. I see a lot of work puts into acting, and I commend that.Except for the villain. The movie had potential to be something better. A masterpiece, if not for: - Some clunky action scenes - Somewhat weird, ""for kids"" villain (I need to remind producers, ""it's okay to create a wretched and powerful villain, instead of a shallowly portrayed one, especially for a movie this peculiar"") (Because this is a movie with children as mains, that is not aimed for children, pg-13?)Things I'm thankful for: - Jake is a well-portrayed character, in all scenes - Miss Peregrine is lovable, and perfect - Some action scenes are cool - Stunning visualNevertheless, it definitely has potentials to gain a 9/10 score. And I'll give 8 for the most part (good first half, and some second half). That, and minus 1 for weird childish action villain stuffs, it doesn't belong here.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
243,jamesthecat-67828,Tim Burton Continues His Downward Trajectory,4,7 October 2016,"After viewing 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children', the only two reasons I can think to recommend it are Eva Green and some lovely visuals.It becomes apparent that early on all of the kids in the film are one- dimensional, they have nothing interesting about them apart from their 'peculiarity' (mouth at the back of their head, invisibility, etc), Tim Burton and Jane Goldman don't humanise them, they're just defined by something superficial.There is no emotional climax, as the story is so muddled and full of expository dialogue. They explain at length about all these different time loops that they must visit at certain points, and how they can revisit certain points, see certain characters again, but not see others, blah, blah, blah, it's just baffling. I was a big fan of Donnie Darko, so it's not like I'm not versed in complicated time-travel movies.Some of 'Miss Peregrine's...' faults could be overlooked if we cared about the lead character, but Asa Butterfield's acting is so wooden, I just didn't buy his performance for a minute. Why bother with a phoney American accent? Have him be English, or just get an American actor to play the part. His love interest, played by Ella Purnell, is much more charming, but like the others, her character doesn't feel fully realised.Unfortunately, this is just another 2016 major disappointment.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
244,jennanazareno,Nice visual effects but plot not so good.,4,5 November 2020,The plot is not so strong to capture the mind and the heart of the audience. I felt like I gained nothing emotionally. I think every film should be able to leave a mark in the mind and heart of its audience in order to be called worth-watching.,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
245,iller1234,Better than expected,8,2 January 2017,"First off I have to come clean with the fact that I usually love Tim Burton's movies. I like the art, adventures and believe they bring something unique and fantastical to the otherwise bland Hollywood scene when it comes to fables directed to audiences above 10 years old.I expected a flop because of the low score, but Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children doesn't disappoint one bit. Because of this I find it meaningful to include the most prevalent critiques mentioned from reviews as I give you my own 2 cents. The criticism I've read thus far point toward 1.Sloppy/confusing second half 2.Bad acting and 3.Shallow character building/different from the original book.The story is complex and engaging from beginning til the end, revealing only a little bit time to time as it goes on. The mystique thus continues throughout the movie and gives the viewer a better chance to identify with the main character Jake (Asa Butterfield) as he unravels the secrets. The story is really interesting, the characters in it are fascinating and even the romance is working and enhances the plot. It is obvious in ways that should be obvious and complex in ways that should be complex. There are subtleties and meaning in the relationships and they are well thought through (for being a movie of it's kind). Sure the movie picks up and gets more action oriented towards the later half, but I feel it is well timed and well executed.As for criticism regarding the acting I just totally disagree. While Asa Butterfield doesn't shine as the main character, Eva Green, Samuel L. Jackson and Ella Purnell all do. Eva's interpretation of the caring and controlling Miss Peregrine is spot on. Her facial expressions themselves tell everything about the character. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect for the role, and Ella creates the needed link between the peculiar world and the normal. I'm otherwise easily put off by bad acting.Tim Burton makes his followers proud with this one. He sparks our imagination and gives us another reason to continue watching kids movies. I'm so grateful to directors like him and we need them when so much of the storytelling these days are pre-written with an algorithm to draw the most people in.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
246,Chiefbukowski,When did Tim Burton decide to abandon story telling?,1,12 October 2016,"It's official. For a number of years now it's been suspected that Tim Burton had lost his love for story telling and this film just confirms it. There exists no story whatsoever in this film, which is an achievement considering it is based on a best selling novel with a coherent story. For me this film was made just so Burton could live out his fantasy of recreating Ray Harryhousen's famous stop motion skeletons. Which he does badly, and to an odd ambient trance soundtrack so out of place it made the Mad Hatter disco dance in his awful Alice film look like art. The acting is awful considering the talent at his disposal, the exposition is so clunky and the dialogue so stilted I feel sorry for the actors. You can really tell Burton just didn't give a rats ass about giving any direction to them. Which would have made sense had the visuals been fantastic, but no, they were clichéd, old and tired. Tim, please, retire with whatever dignity you have left. I felt like I needed a shower after this film.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

249,knight_ca,Fun and fast-paced,8,13 October 2016,"A young man discovers that there is far more to his grandfather's fantastic stories than he ever thought possible. Following clues to a mystery he remembers from his childhood, Jacob stumbles across Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and begins an adventure that spans time itself. This is a peculiar movie but peculiar in a good way in that it's quite original; something we see very little of in movies these days. Eva Green, most recently seen in Penny Dreadful, is the eponymous Miss Peregrine and brings her usual solid portrayal to the movie. The headmistress of a school with children each gifted with an unusual (sorry, peculiar) ability brings a heavy responsibility but you really wouldn't want to mess with her. The young actors also perform well, especially Asa Butterfield taking the lead role of Jacob. We are even treated to Judi Dench in a small role as head of another house. Samuel Jackson heads up the dark side as a group of outcast peculiars out to get the children in all the Houses around the world. He is obviously enjoying himself in this role and gets the majority of the witty one-liners. Sadly, Chris O'Dowd as Jacob's father comes across as a little wooden in places but it's a minor quibble as his screen-time is minor.Humans with unusual powers is a fairly common theme with the Marvel superhero machine still in full swing but this is not the X-Men at all. The children's powers are quite unique and used well. The story is fun and fast-paced and you'll need to pay attention as it twists and flows through time. Time travel is always a tricky one to get right as it invariably ends up with a paradox here and there but the writers do well and the plot is generally solid. This is essentially a movie intended for young adults but there's plenty to enjoy for all ages. It's fun and in some places, even pretty dark. It may be setting up the scene for a prequel or two, but if they're all of this standard, then they'll be ones to watch out for.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

My son, also immensely enjoyed the books and read them as quickly; and my daughter had heard us continuously talking about how good the books were. The movie had so much potential, but sadly left both myself and my children disappointed. Eva Green is mesmerizing as always, but why oh why re-write an excellent story into a hotch-potch of ideas that don't work as well as the original? Was such a drastic re-write necessary? It's not as if modern film making methods couldn't have coped with the magic of the book. The beauty of the original story was lost, rushed and slightly non-sensical in parts.

251,standardpropagation,Abstract Review for an Abstract Movie,8,14 December 2016,"My first question is , is this a children's movie or a movie that derives from the want to be young again. Seems like the harsh tones are favored because people essentially want to be young.This movie was marketed as a Alice in Wonderland-esk type of movie. Emphasizing on the need to be young but the reality of being old. This is why ---- said, if I leave I will instantly be old.Eva Green was at her best. She has a keen eye and a homely appeal. Then later a hunter and a lord appear. These variations of character allude to the reality that a great actress like her has the ability to instill a motherly tone and a motherly strictness.Asa Butterfield was great, his English/American accent was believable and his continuity from teen explorer to young emphatic executor was great. He was a lead actor who never let go of that praiseful exuberance.The WWII partial setting described by his grand father had poise and realism, especially because the polish were used for pulling you out of the SFI, and into the documentary aspect of it. There was a lack of black and Latino actors. While I understand that this is a story derivative of Caucasian stories, there still should have been some minorities. This is a topic for anther time but when your talking about a movie that has an invisible boy and a girl who eats from the back of her head, I couldn't hesitate to state that minorities make up the world, not just imagination. (Especially caused they spoke about Puerto Rico.)Water. Water was a tone that was used to show the capability of weakness and also connection to all. The reason this was placed on an island was because being surrounded by water creates an essence of peculiar vulnerability. This is some thing we all have just walking outside of our home. Samuel L. Jackson always captivates and gave the character he portrayed the time frosted and soul drained look and feel we always love and hate.This was a review based on notes. Its different and I hope its better that just a ""Review"".Thanks",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I really enjoyed the first act and I was intrigued to see where it was heading, but then it felt as if the entire plot was crammed into the second half (and the plot wasn't actually that interesting, nor the villain particularly scary). Asa Butterfield and Eva Green were convincing, but the rest of the acting fell a little flat. For a Tim Burton film about peculiar children I really wanted MORE peculiarity. I feel it suffered from being set in the ""real world"". My favourite Tim Burton films are those that are heavily stylised.

Jackson's acting makes the film scary and even more dark- the acting all round is excellent with Asa Butterfield making another show stopping performance and the wonderful Chris O'Dowd's acting which shocked me as surprisingly fantastic- a very strange thing for a comedy writer. The peculiars are fascinating and very scary, the twins and the scariest for you do not know their powers until the very end of the film. The relationship between Asa Butterfield's character and the girl that is thinner than air is very strong and is a key part of the movie, and works very well. The movie is one of my favorites in a year full of good movies and is certainly the most enjoyable I have seen this year, it is worth going to your local cinema to see this film.

255,maurovicmarin,HALF GOOD HALF BAD? - Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,6,7 October 2016,"Not having read the books nor watched the trailer, I was really thrilled about watching the movie. Of course i had done some research before heading to the theaters, so i knew what to expect from the story itself but it was my first encounter with the characters themselves.The movie is being referred to as the X-men of Tim Burton"" for a good reason. Other than having the same screenplay writer as X-Men: Days of Future Past"" ( Jane Goldman ), the plot that refers to the main and side characters is somewhat comparable, all having a dark and depressed back story by being different from other humans, and finding peace in their own community.The first noticeable (and probably annoying) thing in the movie is the slow- paced introduction. It takes some time to really get in the mood that you are in fact watching an adventure-fantasy movie. But after the boring stay- at-home and family part it really starts to get exciting. Introducing so many different yet amazing characters in such a short period of time makes you want to slow down the pace even more and get to know every single on of them. Sadly, most of them aren't described as much as most of us wanted to, but that's a common fact when a book is turned into a movie, the real spirit of the work stays within the pages.I was completely fascinated with the character of Miss Peregrine (Eva Green), which couldn't be more fitting, the great acting skills of Eva Green really hit the top.The chemistry between the main character, Jake (Asa Butterfield) and Emma (Ella Purnell) didn't really give me that 'awww' feeling, and the action parts didn't get on well with the rest of the movie. I didn't enjoy the last part of the movie that much either.To get this review to an end, the movie has its ups and downs, but overall i would say that the acting and the story itself is pretty consistent, so I would recommend it to those who wish to bond a bit with the characters, while those who seek action and hype should skip it and try something else. Made for all audiences which makes going to the theaters really pleasant.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
256,bmorris-42085,8.5---Tim Burton's 3rd Best Movie!!! (in my opinion) NOT for Die-Hard Fans!!!,8,9 October 2016,"INTRODUCTION: ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" (MPHFPC) is based on the 2012 wildly popular novel by Ransom Riggs. The film is written by Jane Goldman (Writer of ""The Woman in Black"" and most notably, ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service""). And the film is directed by odd-ball, Gothic, pale-faced director... Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Corpse Bride""---and story///character creator of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). The film has gotten mixed reviews. I'm one of those who says... ""Amazing!"". Here's why:GOOD: -The cast. -Costume designs. -Visual effects. -Cinematography. -Tim Burton's direction. -Last action scene at the carnival pier. -Prolouge. -Split - second Tim Burton cameo. -Enjoyable Tim Burton villain. -Jane Goldman's screenplay (a mix of creepy and action and some Tim Burton goofiness). OKAY: -Not really threatening villain. -Accuratness to the book (as a fan of the book). BAD: -Cheesy and confusing ending. OVERALL: This is a film for any fan of Tim Burton (in an amazing way). This film is a great one that I recommend for everyone. Including Tim Burton fans and fantasy fans. If you were a fan of the books and you're looking for a 100% accurate adaptation... You'll hate this. RATING: 8 or 8.5 out of 10. SCORES: 10/13 Good things. 2/13 Okay things. 1/13 Bad things.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The first time i saw it i ignored much of the middle part of the movie as i found it boring. It was the second time around that i enjoyed the film as i paid attention especially to the action scenes with the kids fighting the eye eating monsters.
The acting was good enough. Eva Green is marvelous and has real screen presence but the young man that grabbed my attention is Fin MacMillan who plays Enoch. He has the brooding intensity of a young Oliver Reed or Alan Bates and has in my opinion a great future ahead of him.
Now i am an oldie and have not read the book on which this movie is based so had no preconceived notions about the story line and therefore have no complaint about any liberties taken in the film that so upset many of those who have read the book. I agree with another reviewer here that scenes showing eye balls being extracted and eaten for purposes of transmogrification is defintely not suitable for younger children.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Eva Green is just a splendid actress(as is Sam Jackson, haha), and the two main characters were very well chosen as well. I think they will have a great future ahead and we will see more of them soon. Almost through the whole movie i was emotionally hooked. The 2 hours flew by like nothing. You can really see that Burton has almost perfected movie production, everything just feels so smooth and well done. Don't wanna spoil anything, and i don't recommend watching the Trailer, there are a lot of nice moments in there that you will be glad you didn't spoil for yourself.So if you like a beautiful children's book-story, please go watch this movie.8/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I won't even need to give out spoilers to rate this joke as quite possibly the worst 2 hours of my life I wasted. The only productive part of me being there was that it's super hot in Islamabad right now and the movie theater was very comfortable and air conditioned and the best 20 minutes of this film was the 20 minutes I fell asleep about 30 minutes into the movie. When my girlfriend woke me because I was snoring too loud, I didn't miss anything of significance. Where shall I begin...From the opening scene, it was quite obvious I should have stayed home picking lint balls off my old socks since that would have been much more exciting and worthwhile than to watch this rubbish.Every attempt at filmmaking was predictable and I felt like Nostradamus reborn as I was telling my girlfriend everything that was going to happen right before it happened and all she could do was giggle and chuckle. In fact, there was so much giggling and just plain ridicule laughter going on in the theater you'd think it was a comedy. In fact, if I were to have been told that this was a children's horror suspense film, I might have given it another star as almost every suspense or plot twist scene was laughable. The final scene was enough that I almost regurgitated my 5,000 telats hot dog, only because I was laughing so hard at the shear ridiculousness of it all. When it was all over, everyone just sat there dazed and most were probably thinking what I was thinking...even though it was free, what 8 million other things I could have been doing in these 2 hours of my life I will never get back.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Burton even changed the powers of the central character, Emma. Why would you do that? Eva Green doesn't help by giving the worst performance of her career. The first hour of the film is so dull, and when the film finally starts to move, the story has been totally rewritten.The Harry Potter films were fairly true to the books, because they wanted the films to appeal to the same audience.

It's a great story, with cool characters and well acted.I was intrigued when I first saw the trailer and although trailers don't always represent a whole film well in this case I think they did a pretty good job. If you like the trailer I suspect you'll enjoy the movie.I thought Asa Butterfield did a great job playing the lead role and I also particularly enjoyed Ella Purnell (Emma) and Terence Stamp (Abe) too though all the acting was good. I really like Tim Burton's unique Gothic style in films but didn't notice is so much in this only because I was so caught up in the story. Aside from the obvious adventure part of the film what made it really stand out for me was the emotional side, the love between Jake and his Grandfather and the burgeoning love between Jake and Emma.As others have commented the film definitely felt a bit rushed towards the end and though this by no means ruined the film another 10 minutes or so may have made it even better.Apparently the story deviates from the book so that may be a disappointment for some.

All I'm saying is that it's a GOOD film, but nothing more. This is a short review but it says it all. I recommend to be over 10 to watch this cause it gave me the chills and should be classified as horror.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is unbelievable with the great Tim Burton as director, great actors, great story, great music, great special effects and leaves you with the feeling of wanting moooore, I can't wait for the sequel to see Emma, Jake and Miss Peregrine again! From the beginning to the end you sit tight in your chair,armchair or sofa and feel overwhelmed by the mystery and the beauty of the story, because the movie goes on as a adventure through the supreme imagination that lets you be a part of it.

Tim Burton created magic yet again. Heartily recommend seeing this.There were a couple of flaws tho. Samuel l Jackson as the villain... Uhg. Would have been far better with a skinny brit like Bill Nighy or someone with a bit more character. Also the lead (Asa Butterfield) I thought was bland. Same facial expression the whole time, and there just wasn't enough to like about him. (That ones on burton tho) The ending was also a bit rushed and could have been better explained. But I enjoyed it immensely !! Eva Green is perfect and I,m in love with her. Happy that Tim Burton makes movies ! Huhey 😀",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
269,senesertekin,Book was excellent Tim Burton made it great!,7,10 October 2016,"When you think about the subject of the book, you should give it to Ransom Riggs, just think about it taking something horrible in the history that will never be forgotten and turning into something that people would watch with enjoyment not with fear. The books were exceptional, the movie was not excellent but it was great. Producers did not dare to make it more than one movie, how could they know if it was going to be as great as the books, they were right too, if it would be two movies, it would not be as popular as the first one. The concept of the book is hard to portray on mise en scène. Tim Burton had to change a lot of things in order to adapt it to the silver screen. There were some logical mistakes in the movie, I am aware the world itself is fiction anyway but some mistakes could be corrected in the supervision of Tim Burton. The fact that, hollows took the eyes of the peculiars just did not succeed. It failed. That was not even in the books anyway, do not know why he tried to do that. That adjustment dragged the quality of the movie. I will not get into the details how it had failed, if you watch the movie carefully, you will see the mistakes I am talking about. But mistakes did not entirely made the movie bad, they were small mistakes that is why I called it great. Eva Green tried hard, and she performed just fine. But if to tell the truth, it is very hard to pull off a woman character act who smokes pipe and be very lively at the same time, it was possible to see some incompatibility in that manner for Miss Peregrine's role. Asa Butterfield, was himself again that kid who can not adapt to the story of the current set, but has great potential in some other context. He was good, he did not have any incompatibilities. That is what he has been doing for a long time so he was just fine. Other than that, Samuel Jackson was a bit too much to the overall acting of the movie, similar to Asa Butterfield, he was just himself, he was great and he has way too much experience, that is his difference when compared to Asa in that manner. The man is number one at being the bad character. The movie was great, but it had far more potential, but it is a question, if you would be able to do a better job in 2 hours, probably not.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

271,ryan-03308,An enjoyable adventure from Tim \burton,7,28 November 2016,"Check out our site for more www.moviereviews16.comTim Burton brings Ransom Riggs novel to life, from children with gifts to time travel this is another great movie from Tim Burton. It may feel a little long but the movie is great, with it being Tim Burton my only surprise was that Johnny Depp wasn't in it. The story revolves around Jake (Asa Butterfield), a lonely teenager with no friends from Florida, his grandfather Abe is the only one that pays him much attention, played by Terence Stamp. His grandfather likes to talk about his past and the children's home in Wales where he grew up in and everyone had a gift, and he has the pictures to prove it, from a girl that can float a little girl with the strength of ten men and even an invisible boy. Jake doesn't believe these stories anymore like he did when he was a kid and his grandfather would tell him the stories about monsters and the children's home, he believed them so much he done a class project on it and even took the pictures to show. Obviously the kids laughed all the way through and the photographs were deemed as fake. Jake stopped listening to the stories after that as he was so annoyed that his grandfather would lie to him like that. But as we all know, every bit of it is true. Back to the teenager Jake, we see him at his after school job where his father calls to tell him that he needs to go and check on his grandfather, with his boss driving him to the house we catch a first glimpse of a creepy looking Samuel L. Jackson, Sam with his wild hair and white eyes and only Jake seems to be able to see him. After a few moments trying to get into the house Jake goes into the garden to find his grandfather lying there with no eyes and only enough time to tell Jake to find the home so Miss Peregrine can explain everything, Jake also sees something he cant explain himself, a monster. After a while of seeing a therapist (Allison Janney), Jake decides he wants to go and see the home in wales, with his reluctant father (Chris O'Dowd). After a few scenes we reach Wales and Jake sets off to find the home with the help of a few locals only to find that it was destroyed during WW2. The movie goes on with Jake going back and forth to the home and finally we dive into a world of time travel, adventure and drama. Jake reaches the real home with the help of a few of its residents and we meet Miss Peregrine (Eva Green), she explains that the home is on a time warp and the same day replays, the day the home is destroyed in the war. This is when the film drags a bit and we learn why they are hiding in a time warp and who is looking for them. Without going into detail, a peculiar named Barron (Samuel L. Jackson) creates the hollows, a monster transformed from humans, the only way for them to return to human form is eating the eyes of children. As the movie goes on we find out that Barron is searching for the home and yes he eventually finds it. Barron needs Miss Peregrine as part of his experiment and we end up in 2016 Blackpool, Jake and his friends have to stop Barron and the hollows and save Miss Peregrine, the end does seem a little rushed for the length of the film but it doesn't take anything away from what Tim Burton has done here. I would recommend watching this if you are a Burton fan.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Thus if you love fantasy and dreams made serious and scary go see it in 3d because it's great. If you are more of an adult than the child within and you like films with linear plot and logic and exhaustive explanations you probably won't become a fan and that's OK too. Just don't rate it low just because it's not your type, a movie should be rated for what it was meant to be and for what the team behind it tried to accomplish.

Fans will be disappointed because the film deviates from the original story so much, it is surprising this is called an adaptation. The peculiar children as an example were not all portrayed as written and some were even missing. My daughter kept asking why this child or that child were not there? Miss Peregrine is also not portrayed as she was in the book. I could go on and on. Acting fell very flat and characters were void of emotion except for one scene where Miss Peregrine shows sadness. Jake in the book is humorous and sarcastic but also had some serious feelings to contend with about tough choices. Absolutely none of this was translated to film. The ending was confusing, entire story rushed, and anti-climatic. Also, for 3D lovers, there is almost no 3D effects. There are some at the very beginning which were great, but then the rest was like watching a regular 2D film! Save your money for the DVD or Netflix!",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

When I heard Tim Burton was making it I loved the idea of eerie dreamlike music and odd but beautiful imagery. The book itself is creepy at times but the film almost overdid this, instead of Burton's almost subtle horror; certain scenes were almost grotesque and reminded me of low budget horror. The film itself was actually pretty good as a standalone but as a Tim Burton film based on the Ransom Riggs novels it was somewhat disappointing",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
281,brightlycoloredpaper,"So much potential, so much disappointment",5,5 September 2021,"I was intrigued to check out the story in this movie without expectations, since usually I read the books first. This time I knew very little about its premise and thought I was going to experience a fresh, captivating story. However, it left me with few intentions to buy the book afterwards.Initially, I was underwhelmed by the very few Peculiar Children living in this place. Then, I expected their peculiarities would be explored through some form of classes or ways to improve their control of their abilities or something. Yet, apparently, their don't grow or learn anything in their lives and have nothing to achieve, ever, aside from useless tasks, repeated every day.So, again, I felt underwhelmed by how pointless everything seems instead of this fantastical, extraordinary place with all sorts of possibilities for storytelling. And then... Oh boy... Then, the mystery, which is the only compelling thing happening so far, is unveiled - the villains and monsters. And it is also unveiled the single peculiarity the main character has - which by the end of the movie will be a pointless peculiarity as well.The villains who were supposed to be threatening and intimidating are laughable and easy to confound and defeat. The children seem perfectly able to defend themselves and thrive alone, so there's no point in protecting them.The most interesting aspect of the loop and the aftermath of living through different times isn't explored either and it feels messy and rushed by the end.The levitating/flying effects seemed so off to me, it took me out of the immersion altogether.When I realized Tim Burton directed this, I couldn't believe it.The elements for an extraordinary film are all there, the potential for exploring themes of relationships, growth vs stagnation, finding your place vs losing yourself. All through a lense of fantasy and wonder. The potential for mesmerising cinematography is there. Super-human abilities, idyllic scenery, quirky timeloops.And then, there's nothing.

If I hadn't read the book, I might have tolerated this movie, maybe gave it a 7/10 even. But the fact is, I read the books. I read a series that could have made a very interesting franchise and was expecting to watch the story of the books I read. During the first 45 minutes or so, the movie stuck to the original story and only mixed up characters for no apparent reason what so ever. They kept the name ""Emma"" for Jake's love interest but completely mixed up her character with Olive, which I do not understand. How is this justified? Why do that at all? I understand changing the story so it becomes one movie instead of a franchise but why mix up the characters? Then for the second half of the movie, they diverted tremendously from the original story it became a whole new unrelated story, and rather silly in my opinion. and This is the bigger problem with this movie, it started with high potential and good directing choices, then at the end, things became absurd and childish! The silly ""humor"" people bumping their heads and such, WTH is up with that? why not keep the dark atmosphere and ""seriousness"" of the movie instead of turning it into a silly cartoonish like series of events? I would have been very happy if they stuck to the original story, I would have been satisfied if they changed the story but kept the characters straight, I would have tolerated the movie if it was directed well, but honestly instead I was very disappointed. BTW, I'm not sure who the intended audience is supposed to be? It is certainly too graphic for children, and too silly for adults so who is it for then? The should have picked a different title and said it was inspired from the book, made it either a serious movie all the way and intended for adults or a silly action movie intended for children.

287,wolftopics,Quite the Peculiar and Fun Film,6,6 October 2016,"Though it suffers from a long and difficult to pronounce title, it should not be overlooked. 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' stars Asa Butterfield (Ender's Game/Hugo) as Jake, a young man who gets caught up in a peculiar world of misfits. Now, it should be stated that this movie is certainly not for everyone. Those who don't like the 'peculiar', sometimes creepy, style of Tim Burton's films should probably steer clear of this one. Also, it should be noted that there are some very disturbing scenes that might frighten children, so parents should take their kids to this movie with caution. But, the terrifying aspects of this film are what keep it engaging and interesting throughout. From the start, the viewers are introduced to some unsavory characters and those characters continue to be solid antagonists throughout the movie. Samuel L. Jackson does a fantastic job in a villain role that he seemed to enjoy a little too much. Whenever he is on screen, one can't help but be reminded of the traumatizing Bilbo Baggins scene from The Fellowship of the Ring (you know what I'm talking about). And if the demonic face of this character isn't enough to send chills down your spine, then just look to the faceless, eyeball slurping creatures known as 'hollows' for some real nightmares. If Tim Burton knows how to do anything, it's how to make people's nightmares come to life. To fight against such antagonists, Jake must team up with a group of children, each with their own unique abilities. One of the film's greatest strengths is it's many unique characters. It was fun to see the 'peculiarities' of each child and how they use their abilities to serve the greater purpose. The powers include, but are not limited to, fire, air, extreme strength, puppetry, biting, and bees. That's right. Bees. Yet, this is a curse and a blessing as it's hard to juggle such an extensive cast. But, Tim Burton did a fine job of giving a fair amount of screen-time to the group as a whole rather than focusing on Jake the entire time. One of the other lead characters is Emma Bloom (Ella Purnell), a girl who has a hard time staying grounded (litereally). She had one of the stronger performances in the film and never once did anything to annoy me. Eva Green who portrays the head of the household, Miss Peregrine, also is fun to watch as she speeds through intricate dialogue without stumbling and always seems to be on top of her character. It was refreshing to see famous actors and actresses playing whimsical roles without 'phoning in' their performances. I felt like most of the cast committed to the roles and put their own spin on the characters. The film boasts strong visuals, a lot of great cast members, and a fairly engaging story, but it is not without faults. Not all of the actors in this film gave it their best. Asa Butterfield, for example, was probably not the best choice of actor for the lead role in this movie as he stumbles around with painfully forced dialogue and shows the emotional range of Kristen Stewart. (I personally think it works for her, but it certainly did not work for Asa in this movie). Another aspect that the movie fails to excel on is its pacing and plot development; it jumps around to much and feels like you're watching a movie from the mind of a child hopped up on sugar. This is awfully noticeable towards the end as all reason and logic are thrown out of the window. The biggest flaw is that it feels like the director didn't know how to resolve the plot, so he just through together a torrent of two second scenes to try to tie everything up. These are very blatant and take away from some of the enjoyment of this film, but they don't completely destroy it. 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' is imaginative, beautiful, and enjoyable despite it's flaws and is definitely worth going to see at least at matinée prices.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I enjoyed the characters and the story as it developed, but by the end I had more questions than were answered. It seems like there is SO much content from the original material, and it would take a lot of skill to condense it all effectively into one two hour film. I don't think Burton achieved this. The creepy aspects are generally good, but sometimes a little reliant on familiar horror tropes. There is a child who can bring inanimate objects to life (Frankenstein style), the villains kill children and eat their eyes, and the slender man-esque monsters don't feel like especially fresh or interesting, but may appeal to a younger audience. The storytelling and plot development is not the strongest in this film, but the imagery and themes are present.

Sorry boys, not in this one! She's matured.For me it was excellent entertainment. It worked it's magic on me on so many levels, and gave me exciting experiences I'm not able to have any other way. The scene was set right at my home theater: kids away with their other family members, just me and my sweetie having a watch without distractions or expectations. My old trusted 55"" Philips 3D TV and a pair of glasses, and we were ready to go on a journey. And what a ride it was! Having not read anything about the movie or the book before, everything came as a surprise. And this story is full of imagination, mind-tingling twists and careful details not commonly used in other movies. Not that I even finish so many movies nowadays because I tend to get bored or anxious with most modern action/fantasy efforts, but this one brought perfect balance between light and dark fantasy, and emotion-wise delivered both warm ecstasy and chilling horror. I especially enjoyed the scene where Emma was taking Jake to her secret hideout. Magnificent!Watching the box office reports I'm amazed how much money is made with dull and ridiculous high-budget movies, and seeing this one underperforming. Also considering how highly many dark, depressive, overly violent and serious films are rated here, it's sad to see Miss Peregrine having a relatively low overall score.In my books it's the movie of the year 2016 and it's only natural to give it 10 / 10.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

But, as an adaptation, the movie has its differences from the source material, but Tim, along with screenwriter Jane Goldman (Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service), puts together the pieces of this one-of-a-kind movie experience, which is Burton's triumphant return to the Gothic-dark fantasy genre!!!

It seems like there were or was a hidden agenda or message that never clearly got thru in this one, most confusing most of the time, good points: clear diction and eye contact, costuming and colorization also excellent.

300,riguy3434,"Good Film, Bad Adaption from the Book",6,28 December 2016,"To start off, if you go see Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and have never read the book, you will likely enjoy the film much more than I did. From a film making standpoint, I thought the movie was great. From an adaption standpoint, it was very disappointing. From the beginning, the adaption seemed promising. However the original story line derailed quickly and never recovered. The biggest derailment, in my opinion, was Emma. In the book, Emma's peculiarity is fire, not levitation. Burton swaps Olive and Emma's peculiarities, and considering the main character, Jake, loves Emma, this is significant. However Burton doesn't change the core of the resolution of the book, leaving the door open to make a sequel based on the sequel of the book. To get to this same resolution, Burton ""takes a longer route,"" so to speak. He has Jake leave the children, then go back to his alive-again grandfather (who doesn't come back to life in the book), decide to go back to the children, and then travel through multiple loops around the world until eventually he boards their boat. None of this happened in the book. However this longer route could've been avoided if he had stuck to the original plot in the first place.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
301,vanjadjuric,A terrible experience,1,9 October 2016,"I never really got how could anyone think movie is that bad that he would leave in middle of it. Until today. Even tho i made it through the whole movie, its not something i would recommend to anyone. Last Fantastic 4 movie was a masterpiece compared to this... First of all, its nothing like the book. Second, I know that there is a lot of fiction in this movie, but there are so many illogical things happening it literally makes you wonder what the hell did they think about when they made the movie.For example it seems that people in Wales find it rather normal when a army of skeletons rush to fight some invisible creatures. Their reactions to something so mind twisting is to stand in the way until they are pushed away by something invisible. And still not run away. Its like watching badly developed AI in some computer game. Or main character literally standing in front of cage for full 5 minutes ""trying"" to open it, even tho there is no god damn lock, while the camera is focusing on fight going on in other parts of the building. And when the camera finally focuses him again, than he sees there is some kind of console that's used to open the cage. I can understand that they cant show everything at the same time, but please don't tell me he needs 5 minutes to figure out he literally needed to press one button to open it. If he's spending all that time opening the cage, give him something to do while the camera is focused on something else. Break a rusty lock, crack a password, i don't know, anything. This way he is literally entering room, starting to hit the cage, scene changes for 5 minutes, goes back, he is still hitting that stupid cage. And there is a button right next to it to open it... There is plenty of things like this, that make it seem like no one really cared enough to make it logical. Whole movie is a fine line between boring and making you feel stupid.. At least CGI was good...",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
302,michael_wetherell,"Elegant, Exciting and surprisingly no Helena Carter",8,3 October 2016,"I want to start off by saying I would have given it a solid 7.5 out of 10, but given the limitations of the rating system have rounded up to 8. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was nothing less than masterful. His ability to create a villain who is not simply a two dimensional being is truly remarkable. As a huge Penny Dreadful fan it was great to see Eva Green on the big screen bringing a fan favorite to life. I am worried that she will become typecast with the now booming era of Victorian themed shows and movies.The only major drawback (besides the feeling of being rushed throughout the whole film which I will forgive given they were partially condensing 3 books into a single movie) was the performance by Asa Butterfield. He was brilliant in Ender's Game and Hugo, but during the entire movie his character and notably accent felt extremely forced which detracted from the belief of his role. More of a casting issue than being his own fault, I felt it could have been remedied by casting a young up comer like David Mazouz. Finally, the film was a thing of visual beauty. Tim Burton did not hold back from his usual contrasting themes and colours to establish the very peculiar ambiance which the original photos in the books did for readers. All in all, a enjoyable film It would have been great if it had been told in its entirety, but nobody is perfect and a project of this nature can never be sure if it will be accepted.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
303,billgriffith-58652,Give me my time back,1,10 February 2017,"Tim Burton and Hollywood (in general) must take their audiences as a bunch of low IQ fools. This movie is an example of how to take a million short-cuts in story telling to achieve an outcome or something that represents a complete a story. This movie takes the super- hero/time-travel genre, and injects it with steroids, and in the end, it just doesn't work well at all. I had little respect for Burton's ability to bring a story to the full screen, and after watching this piece of garbage, I have even less .... I don't care how much it pulled in at the box office, I would think any director and/or screen writer who has any artistic integrity, or just plain common sense, would NOT want this movie on their resume.Rather than watch this movie, time would be better spent by painting a wall and watching it dry.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I love Tim Burton and I love the fact that his kind of fantasy goes on and on. Even if miss Peregrine was clearly cut out for Helena Bonham Carter and Eva Green does not come near the mystic madness needed for the part, she was not bad. The boy Jake, played by Asa Butterfield had no chance to begin with, he was just an observer, and the bad guy, Samuel L. Jackson was clearly paid by the hour. Been there,done that. I can see all the good thoughts behind this film though, and hope they will keep on making them in spite of the Harry Potter madness.

As a big fan of the book, I enjoyed seeing many characters and ideas transfers over into the big screen from the pages. The cast was very good for the most part, with Eva Green giving a truly terrific turn as Miss Peregrine. This film did take some liberties from the book, however, and changed many aspects of it (especially things that happened towards the end), but for the most part it transfers what made the book special and is a promising sign for the rest of Tim Burton's directorial career.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
306,sidneyjnickerson,Continues modern Burton trend,5,1 October 2016,"Miss Peregrine's home for Peculiar Children was easily my most anticipated film of this Fall. I had read the book, and I think Tim Burton was an excellent person to direct this film. I had no idea what was in store.The first bit was good, as it was more like the book, except with the character switching of Claire and Emma, though they actually made that work. A lot of the photos were edited, which sucked, but we got a classic Tim Burton stop motion scene. The second half was where it went haywire. For some reason, they went to a carnival, which was pretty stupid. Samuel L. Jackson's villain, was stupid, and never did anything but kidnapping Miss. Peregrine, but mostly cracking jokes. Out of nowhere there was a forced monkey woman, and other crap that had nothing to do with anything. But, at least the twins actually did something instead of just being there. And, for the whole movie, Asa Butterfield does a terrible performance. He looks bored, as if he absolutely despised the film. Maybe he read the Ransom Riggs book. Luckily, he is surrounded by great performances, like Eva Green and Samuel L. Jackson. This film is enjoyable if all the other theaters are playing Pete's Dragon, but trust me, you would rather be watching Suicide Squad.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The ones that are not just sweet romance, but you can feel it in his twisted world.In this movie, he shows the classic world of 1943 where the world is suffered by the war. The term of monsters hunting innocent people in our world is re-interpret to the hollows and Peculiar children. They need to find the safe place and make the loop so they can live there happily forever. Somehow, I feel it really connected to struggle of peace by that time. Tim Burton really gave us another good movie =)The 2 scores out of 10 have to be deducted. The reason is the complication of the loop and the time. In my opinion, I think there are lot of conflict in this movie, specially (spoiler alert), how his grandpa is still alive. I really don't understand that part. However, it's one of the movies I love to watch again. =) Keep creating this kind of movies, Tim. I'm your fan.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

This movie was WOW exciting brilliant very really great movie which is Miss Peregrines Home For Peciluar Children. I just saw it yesterday and when I come out of the movie theater I told my dad that I am going to own Miss Peregrines Home For Peciluar Children and I am right. Best Tim Burton movie to my opinion one of the best like Edward Scissorhands and Alice in Wonderland and Nightmare before Christmas because of the dark parts in the movie best and brilliant special effects. Do not listen to the Critics off of Fandango and Miss Peregrines Home for Peciluar Children is now one of my favorite movies ever made. And my newest favorite movie of all time. It's a family movie I could still talk about movie more. And also Eva Green did the best part as Miss Peregrines. This is the first movie of Eva Green that I have seen. And Samuel L Jackson did the best job as Baron which is a bad day.,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

A school for kids that are mutants and or have powers.Clearly you are wasting your time if you want to see a movie about kids and their teacher with powers, Don't waste your time on this flick. Instead watch the X-Men Trilogy or Days of Future Past, those were good flicks to start you out with X-Men and mutant powers. Age of Apocalypse was good cause it re-sets the X-Men story line with a chance to continue with more X-Men characters. If you want to see Eva Green watch Kingdom of Heaven or Casino Royale she looked good in those movies.Hope you enjoyed my review.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
310,richardkam,"Tim Burton ruined by Benny Hill, starring Time-loops",6,14 October 2016,"Summary: slow ( sometimes too slow) deliberate set up, keeping viewer in suspense, ruined by last third where Benny Hill takes over the studio. In the first 2/3 of the film, Mr. Burton does a decent job setting up the characters, (spoiler) the teenager who travels to Wales to discover the secret behind his grandad's death, leading to the discovery of a bunch of hidden away peculiar kids cared for by schoolmistress, Miss Peregrine, who, despite being central to the film's title, doesn't contribute much towards the film's plot at all. The lead villain, token black guy in an all white fairy-tale movie, Samuel L Jackson as Baron, is given free rein to ham it up for the paycheck, but from the point that Mr. Jackson says ' I was in Florida for 3 weeks disguised as a female counselor'..that's when I knew a certain British king of Comedy was due his royalties...Fortunately this moment only happens 2/3 the way through the film, but when you see kids throwing snowballs, and candyfloss at invisible monsters jumping through time-loops staged to 90's dance/rave music of the Blackpool fairground, everything that Mr Burton worked so hard to set up was ruined, in my opinion. My guess is this was also the point 'the studio' should have stepped in and announced 'all that's missing is a Benny Hill soundtrack'. Other notes: the teenager is American, so why cast cockney/ posh ( his accent kept flitting between the two) English actor Terence Stamp as his grandad? If anything, it would have been more authentic to make the grandad Welsh, and the teenage kid's dad also a welsh immigrant, instead of stereotypical out-and-out Yankee loudmouth.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

But sometimes mediocre movies are decently entertaining.Unfortunately this doesn't even rise to the level of mediocre. Its just plain bad. Bad acting, bad casting, dull story. Seeing the names Tim Burton, Sam Jackson, and that hot brunette from Casino Royal, you'd be excused for assuming it would be a well put-together film. Feels like Tim Burton was handed a massive budget and just rushed through production, hiring untalented nobody actors with a few cameos from big names mixed in.If you're reading this review hoping to find justification on whether or not to sit through this movie, I'd suggest you pass on it and choose something better.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I was even more excited when I found out that Eva Green and Asa Butterfield were going to be the lead actors. But, what put the icing on the cake was that the film was going to be directed by Tim Burton. He is one of my favorite directors of all time. The film was matched perfectly to his style. I love every piece of work he has made and can't wait for his latest. Anyways, there was one little problem about the film. Although the story line was great, the acting was not so much; especially Butterfield. I was expecting more from him. I've seen his previous films and he's exceptional in them. I think the problem was his accent. He seemed unable to transition from having a British accent to an American accent. I'm sure if he were allowed to keep his accent, the acting would've went much smoother. He didn't seem to have the proper emotions one would have in those situations. But other than that, the film was exceptional. Many would argue that it was a disappointment the writers didn't follow the book exactly but that happens very often in a transition from book to film. It's impossible to grasp every little detail.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

It was rather bizzare to see child-murdering, eyeball eating abominations assaulted with snowballs thrown by children, and hit on the head by a carusel, the movie went from truly creepy to Tom and Jerry. It was a compelling story, cute and funny and truly mysterious and creepy, but oddly unsuitable for children while also being rather immature for adults.

318,selahgreene-20331,Collage of Bizarreness,1,11 November 2019,"This film starts with some promising concepts and hopeful plot possibilities, but is cursed with incoherent writing and overly-fanciful characterizations. I have not read the Riggs books that the ideas came from, but I imagine that the ridiculous characterizations are true to the books; and they make for a really silly, empty movie. Think Groundhog Day meets X-Men meets Alice in Wonderland meets the Walking Dead, all on magic mushrooms, trying to do way too much in 2 hours. The plotlines are so disjointed and at times incoherent, it is like watching a collage of an adolescent's LSD-laced fantasies. The 'peculiar' children are supposed to have unique, magical gifts and abilities. They come off as just being a collection of mostly benign, sometimes ugly, fanciful monsters.In the film adaptation, there are too many huge plot holes and ridiculous, pointless anomalies; shoddy, disconnected directing; missing explanations; and the usual allotment of film clichés. The ending should be fulfilling, but, like so many sloppy endings to films today, it is rushed and patched together as if the screenwriters were overdue on the deadline and were in a hurry to produce the finish.Writers in the past 20 years have gotten lazy and stupid with the onset of CGI, with tech enhancements replacing the need for coherent, meaningful plots, character development, and intelligent writing. Writers and directors seem to be saying ""Look! We've got CGI! There's no more need for thoughtful, meaningful stories and logical plot lines since we have all these cool special effects."" But I don't think any screenwriters or directors could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. The only character with any likeability is Eva Green's Miss Peregrine, and Green (Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale) manages to give her some real depth. The others are simply one-dimensional cartoons. There is just no heart to this film. The bizarre, silly characterizations and whacked out plot lines leave a soulless, empty mess.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The continuity errors are so many and so grave it's hard to not get frustrated while watching. The director, editor and script supervisor should have worked closer together so these mistakes wouldn't happen.I haven't read the books and don't know the storyline beforehand. The script wasn't that bad I guess but they didn't give the movie a feeling. The acting was very flat and I got the feeling they put so many famous actors as possible in the movie to attract the adult viewers to the cinema. Everything felt so rushed all the time and there was to many exposition moments. When miss Peregrine shows Jake around the home there is just exposition and it was so bad it was hard to watch.The movie was so bad I couldn't even enjoy the acting from O'Dowd or Stamp. The cinematography was often good and I don't have anything bad to say about the sound or music. It's hard to direct kids i bet so you can't really blame the kids for their lack of acting.

321,klayman89,"Fantastic screen scorching, eye candy, Tim Burton at his Best Again",10,12 October 2016,"The movies Tim Burton have made in the last few years never quite lived up to the hype, but I always found bits and pieces of them that I adored and held on to. In that case I am probably not the best person to be critiquing his movies but here I am. I never read the Peculiar books and the trailer for this one made me think it might be another sub-par thing. When I saw it in theaters though I was really intrigued as the story progressed, where was Timmy B. taking me this time? I think it is the creepiest and darkest thing he has done in a while what with the missing eyeballs, the Jack Skellington/Slenderman Hollows, the Edward Scissorhands/Pee Wee garden, the Corpse Bride-like skeletons, and my favorite the stop-motion animated dolls (which reminded me of something from Beetlejuice) not to mention all the disturbing children. Burton has always teased us with trinkets from his past films; curly Q's, slanted things and crooked crap. But it really felt like he let go with this one, it felt like something more, like it had a purpose there and it just fit in the world. Though not his best, this is the coolest thing Burton has done in a long time. The pacing and story was good, though maybe a bit rushed at the end.

Compared to his previous titles, this movie will make you wonder if he's not been interned in an asylum for the criminally dull. The special effects and prop work quality is simply not there. Every character on screen spits his lines as if newly read from a teleprompter. There is barely any emotions on display. For most of what is noticeable it is done with an unconvincing tang. Samuel Jackson's delivery feels like he didn't take the movie seriously enough to even try fixing it.

323,ivan-planinar,Pure fantasy with some Jewish & nazi analogy,10,4 October 2016,"I went to the theater without any expectations. It's been long since I watched anything from Burton (last being Sweeney Todd), but was quite surprised by what I've found. It was a rich fantasy movie with beautiful cinematography, dreamy music and striking Nazi & Jewish connections. So strong that it left me deeply moved.The following isn't much of a spoiler, but my interpretation of analogies that I've found.The Peculiar children are the Jews, hunted by the monsters - Nazis. It starts in Poland, where WW2 officially began, tormenting the rich and respectful Jewish families.Grandpa was a Jew that survived the Holocaust. He became a Nazi hunter himself - and that was his special-peculiar talent (as a side note - Jews used to have special Nazi hunters. Thanks to them number of Nazi fugitives after WW2 have been reduced). He could see the Hollows (another name-hint for the Holocaust) and fight them, just like his grandson Jake. However, Grandpa died by one of the fugitives that he failed to find.In film, the eyes are being consumed by the torturers, under direction of deranged mind of Baron. Nazis used to take the eyes out of many captives that were tortured in the concentration camps. One of the infamous doctors that instrumented so many horrific deaths was Dr. Mengele (aka Dr. Death) and his psychopath followers. There's a striking resemblance between Baron and all those experiments that Nazis performed on the people in the camps.And finally, I felt that those children actually died and the Home itself was a camp of some sort, but Miss Pergrine found a ""loop"" to save them before disaster and to keep them living in a day, preserving what they truly are.The film gets a lighter tone near the end. I kind of didn't expect that, but I'm glad it did. Because of the strong Holocaust analogy, I think it would've been far too hard to take. That's just not Burton's way. In the end it feels more airy, weird, humorous and bizarre. Above else, it's a pure fantasy story with witty and bizarre characters. A Burton signature film that takes you to another world and time. It's a masterpiece and the best I've seen from him since Corpse Bride & Big fish.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I have read the trilogy and I was looking so much forward to this film. I have to say I also really love Tim Burton. The first half of the film I was generally thrilled (besides some inconsistencies with the book) and I had already start fantasizing how the next 2 films were going to look like! And then the 2nd part begins ... and the only thing that is on my mind is ¨what is going on? Oh this is not supposed to happen! Wait a minute is he going to make it just 1 film? ¨ And all my fears come true and indeed he makes 1 film out of a trilogy.For those who have not read the books ... Just imagine Lord of the rings to be produced in only 1 film with the first half till the formation of the fellowship to be more or less consistent and the 2nd half just people running, throw the ring to the water instead (or whatever) and live happily ever after ...I only hope that there will be a director in the future to give this trilogy a real chance and I do hope that Tim Burton will read the other 2 books and realize the huge mistake he made!

But it has missed a fair amount of detail from the books, I thought the scenes were a bit plain especially in parts with the battle of good versus evil.Character development was good but I think you need to get the mix of actors just right, I think casting could have done a better job. Chris O'Dowd, Judi Dench & Terence Stamp's characters seemed a little out of place. Also I like Samuel L. Jackson just not sure if he was the right fit either.I do hope this film doesn't follow in suite with 'A Series of Unfortunate Events'. If they tackle a second film with Miss Perigrine, and include more attention to detail and make it more spectacular then they can make this film feel more... well more. But it's need to have an improved successor.Eva Green and the actors who play the peculiar children are the shining lights throughout this film.Do not let this review put you off, it is an easy film to watch and it's quite marvelous in parts, Tim Burton stamped, you should enjoy it, but it may leave you feeling a lost.

He takes you to his wonderland and you feel happy in that world. Until the end credits show up. You don't want it to end. This world is sucks. I want to be like one of his characters. Any of them. Peculiar... This movie is just another master piece of him. Characters, costumes, hair styles, lights, camera movements, stop motion animations, visual effects, dialogues etc. everything tells this is Tim Burton's movie and it is fantastic,fabulous,amazing.

333,set_su_na,"Good beginning, terrible second half.",4,8 October 2016,"Let me start off by saying I have actually read all 3 books on which this is based, so I'll admit that has made me a tad nervous about the movie before I had even seen it. The first half of the movie (about up until he meets Miss Peregrin and her children) is fine. It has that classic Tim Burton touch and stays relatively true to the books. Admittedly, this part of the movie does contain some changes from the book that I do not quite understand, like switching the title role characters, but overall it is fine.The second part is where you-know-what hits the fan. It bares absolutely NO resemblance to the books anymore, which makes me believe they only had the rights to the first book en and not to any of the other two. The story takes a ridiculous turn, with scenes that are laughable. They were so bad they made me turn to my partner and just shrug and ask what the hell was going on. A lot of the choices the characters made in this part of the movie, were silly and strange and made no sense. Certain powers were suddenly not used, while that would have tipped certain scenes in favor of the bad guys or the good guys. But because I do not wish to give spoilers I'll keep this part as vague as possible.All in all, whats the first part of the movie, it is a solid 7 at least. The second half is not even worth a 2. It totally breaks the tension from the first half and has some ridiculous scenes and choices that make absolutely no sense. If you liked the first half, read the books, they are brilliantly written and make far more sense.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
334,vespertinebutterfly,A Bland Adaptation,3,9 October 2016,"Tim Burton had all the correct pieces for a brilliant, genre defining project that could have elevated his crumbling reputation as well as excited fans of the original novel while impressing those unfamiliar with Ransom Riggs. He had a covey of excellent actors at his disposal, a haunting location, a whimsically spooky atmosphere, and excellent source material. Sadly, he decided to phone another one in, and create a lackluster waste of time that defiles the original work, uselessly traps its actors in a mundane script, and spends a lot of money to look so very cheap. Anyone having read the novels will be absolutely appalled by the horrific changes made for absolutely no reason while forcing half the plot of the second book into the first, again, with no payoff.Eva Green shines as the title matron, with her devilishly charming smile. But, that's about where the compliments end. Not one of the child actors has any personality, while the characters that are the most endearing of the novels have all their best lines cut in favor of everyone just staring at one another with a vacant expression. Samuel L. Jackson adds another buffoon performance to his ridiculous career of unintentionally hilarious characters. The film is boring, uninspired, and seems like Tim Burton was only a third of the way invested. Skip this trash and just read the rather wonderful novels.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
335,lumpyspaceknight,Movie Nights: Another subpar film from a once great director,4,31 October 2016,"I'm gonna go ahead and ask the obvious question: What happened to Tim Burton? He was responsible for films such as Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks, Ed Wood, etc. Movies that, despite what you might think of them, are undeniably unique and don't feel like pandering tripe, they feel like they come from a very personal place, instead of some hackneyed Hollywood writer's notepad.Despite retaining his obvious talent for visuals, in the last few years Tim Burton has become a slightly more stylized version of your average hack director. His latest projects have involved taking a fairy tale (or in this case, a book series) and giving them his usual Gothic, whimsical look. These movies might look great, but they fail completely in the storytelling department.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is 2 different movies in 1: The first half is a mediocre 5/10 to 6/10 film that doesn't do anything spectacular, but at the same time never does anything offensive or off putting. The second half, however, is hilariously bad, completely rushed and tone deaf.The story is that little boy Jake basically has to find the monster who killed his grand dad. Even though it's almost set up for a mystery story, there's no real mystery element in the movie.The positives: Eva Green's performance as Miss Peregrine carries all the scenes she's in. Despite her character not being given enough depth or screen time, she manages to play her part convincingly. Samuel Jackson on the other hand, completely hams it up to 11 (which is not good for the film, just more entertaining to watch in a ""so bad it's funny"" way). There are some good scenes, the best being Miss Peregrine and her children watching the Nazi planes come in as she reverses the time loop. It's a very powerful scene visually (though i have to ask: why are they wearing gas masks if they know the bombs aren't gonna hit them anyway?). Oh and, the music is effective and works OK.Now onto the bad -Everyone who is not Eva Green is wooden or has minimal time on screen. Asa Butterfield and the rest of the kid actors are especially bad (though they're not helped by the terrible script that rushes through the character development to get to the crucial plot points). As a result, none of the character relationships have any chemistry. Jake and Emma don't have any time to develop their feelings, so when they're suddenly in a romantic relationship at the end it feels jarring and forced. Why do they even like each other? They're so boring -The characters are underdeveloped. The main lead is as bland as an oatmeal and so is his family. The peculiar children don't have much personalities beyond ""he can do this"" or ""he has this quirk"", and most of them do nothing for the plot. The villains are hammy and stupid, impossible to take seriously under any circumstances. Miss Peregrine had a lot of potential to be interesting, but she's barely in the movie. There's no emotion in this movie, Miss Peregrine and Barron are the only characters with any conviction. -The plot holes and conveniences. Leaving aside all the time travel related stuff, there's things that just make no sense, like Barren transforming into the psychologist to trick Jake into going to Wales (Really? That was your plan? There's so many ways in which you can fail), or when the villains inexplicably split like idiots instead of sticking together. Why does no one notice the invisible monsters when they're pushing everyone around and get stuff thrown at them? WHY DID NO ONE REACT TO A BUNCH OF SKELETONS AND KIDS WITH SUPERPOWERS FIGHTING INVISIBLE MONSTERS? -The entire carnival sequence: This entire part is so bad it ended any hope i had for the movie. I was trying very hard to not laugh in the theater. Where do i begin? First off, why a carnival? Second, who's idea was to have the kids throw candy at the monsters in order to make them visible? like what is this, Home Alone meets the X- men? How am i meant to take any of this seriously? One of the villains gets killed by a slow moving railway and Enoch reanimates a bunch of spooky skeletons with swords to fight the invisible monsters no further comments on this sequence. -The main villain is so clueless that all his plans were foiled because of his own faults (Maybe all the birds wouldn't have escaped if he shut off the windows?), in the end he has Jake in his hands, but instead of killing him right there, he lets Enoch and Olive get involved for no reason. Jake was actually a pretty useless protagonist, all he had to do was see the monster in the end and shoot him in the head.I have a couple of more nitpicks, but at it's core these are the main problems with the movie. Everything in it seems like it's marking a checklist of things that are expected to be in an adaptation of a young teen book. Everything is so bare bones and underdeveloped that it feels like this was the plot of 2 movies compressed into one.So in short, do i recommend the movie? Well it's not the worst out there right now, but no. Fans of the books will be disappointed. So will Burton fans. If you like ""so bad it's good"" movies, there are better alternatives. And if you're one of those guys that watches a lot of movies and thinks very hard about them, then avoid this at all costs.4/10see my far more detailed reviews at http://movienights.tumblr.com/",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
336,eqlipsebiz,This movie was awful!,4,1 November 2016,"Even giving this movie a 4 is generous. The acting is so awkward and penis makes you cringe with every sentence. The monster is literally just slenderman, and the whole movie is nowhere near the movie! The plot is confusing as hell! There are so many continuity errors. A great example is when Miss Peregrine (Who is the only good actor in the movie, even though her character doesn't follow the book at all) says that the women who run the loops can't transform into their respective birds when injured, however at the end of the movie, Miss Peregrine is clearly rubbing her shoulder indicating that she's injured, but she transforms anyway. Another thing that made no sense at is, SPOILERS I guess, how the monsters (their name completely is escaping me right now) just walk on the boardwalk near the end of the movie and NO ONE AT ALL REACTS TO THEM HOW THEY SHOULD! THEY JUST GET BUMPED AND KEEP DOING THEIR THING EVEN THOUGH THE MONSTERS ARE COVERED IN SNOW AND ARE VISIBLE!",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Obviously movies adapted from books are never exactly the same, we all know that, but after the first 45 minutes, the movie went from an adaptation to a totally different movie. I'm not sure why the writer and director didn't just write their own movie instead of naming it after the book. It's completely different by the end and fans of the book will be highly disappointed. If you love the book I do not recommend watching this movie. If you do not plan on ever reading the book then you might enjoy this movie.

It was almost like Tim Burton took parts of the book but tried to make it his own, while failing miserably. I honestly don't think that the casting was the best choice for this film and Asa Butterfield didn't fit his roll. His acting was sub-par and took away from the overall greatness of what the movie could have been. I also wasn't a huge fan of how Olive and Emma basically switched what they could do because if you haven't read the book, Emma can create fire with her hands and Olive can float. I did see how that part did benefit the plot progression but I also feel like it could have gone in a different direction without changing a key part of the book. I was excited to watch this movie after having finally finished the book but I found myself skipping parts of it just to get to any interesting scene. There were a lot of things that I wish would have been different to better fit how the book is, but I do understand that not all adaptations will perfectly reflect the book.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
339,schwarzafeen,Appalling/ kind of pedophile after a second viewing,1,5 August 2017,"I've never read the books, but this is a terrible movie even without any expectations from it. All of these actors have talent; sadly, for this movie, it's like someone told them to act as though they weren't going to be paid. Not an ounce of inflection throughout. It's hard to like characters that seem as if they took a bottle of xanax every morning. Despite the fact that this film is based on someone else's books, you could list elements from almost every previous Tim Burton movie. It was appalling in that regard, the fact that he had to incorporate his movies into what should have been an established series brought to life with his cinematic flair. The story isn't explained well, I found myself rewinding in spots because I thought I'd missed important info, only to realize it's just not there. Plot lines are thrown in as an afterthought, taking a place behind the 'visuals'. There's nothing in the visuals you haven't seen before. Even the monsters reminded me of zombies from a Resident Evil video game from back in early 2005. And I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a children's movie with some of the scenes available. I was a bit sick to my stomach watching a dead, eyeless child that was a 'friend' of the group get manipulated like a marionette for what seems to be no reason when everyone living was able to explain what was going on, despite the secretive nature of the place. Maybe that's in the books, but I'm sure the writer would have used more finesse instead of just making it a one time shock value. I couldn't begin to comprehend why Samuel L. Jackson was a villain in a kid's movie, let alone why he was dressed as Don King. I actually think that was supposed to be an homage to George Washington Carver, as the character was a scientist, but it was a foolish mockery. I used to be a fan of Tim Burton, but I've watched the decline of his movies, and if I thought others had hit rock bottom, I would count this as now being at rock bottom and drilling. * I watched it again, to be sure of this, and the second viewing made it clear that I didn't imagine the sexualization of the kids in this film. At least 2 scenes where for no real reason, we see the blond girl's bloomers. Once was actually in front of the 'hollows' (uh, all adults). And I understand where the invisible kid needed to remove clothes to be invisible in the pub scene, though I don't know why that had to be incorporated into the dinner scene, or why after putting clothes on for dinner, he took them off again to watch movies naked on the couch with the other kids. 3 male characters have a sexual interest in the blond girl that looks to be 15 years old, at most. The character Jake even goes so far as to say that he won't kill the monsters or risk his timeline, but tells Emma 'you know the only reason I'd stay', implying her. If it's not to save her life and the rest of the children, that slims the options. The Enoch character is labeled as 'possessive', and it's apparent that the 'Emma' character had/has a thing for Jake's grandfather. Also, Jake comes back after an undetermined amount of time searching for the group for this happily ever after, with a girl that looks like 12 year old Alice. Its very cringe-worthy in its pedophile tones.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

342,bradmil,"Great book, poor film - Incredibly disappointing",3,3 October 2016,"As a massive fan of the books I was really looking forward to the movie adaption but was skeptical when I knew Tim Burton was at the helm. I have disliked a lot of his recent films and thought his Willy Wonka was an insult to the original Gene Wilder version. I was also worried with having Jane Goldman write the screenplay who is known for X-Men and The Kingsman. Eva Green was alright to play Miss Peregrine but I always envisioned her in the books to be an older lady like Judi Dench. The dialogue was also very ordinary and cheesy. Overall the film seemed rushed and had no chance to bring character development.The films first part looked promising and had a lot of what I'd envisioned in the book, the hollows however didn't look right. I'd imaged them to look more partly human (which would have been more realistic) not tall CGI monsters that looked like rejects from a del Toro film. Tim Burton also decided to swap Emma's (fire) and Olive's (floating) peculiar powers around which has no positive effect and Dr Golan was a man in the book and a female in the movie. In the book Emma was very standoffish and annoyed when she first met Jake and took her a while to come around and she had a strong personality and fieriness. In the movie she's not like that at all. She instead just looks pretty bored as do the majority of the cast. The film was all over the place tonally and didn't know whether to be a Gothic horror or a comedy. The climax of the film was dreadful with Tim Burton finishing with a final standoff with the hollows and wight's against the peculiar's at a carnival in Blackpool (not in the book) which looks like something out of the Goonies. Based on the ending, it seems they fast forwarded everything and pushed aside the 2nd and 3rd book which meant no depth to the story could be given.This movie could have been so much better had they chosen the another director (Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson or Alfonso Cuaron comes to mind) and a different screenwriter. Had this been done made by the right people it could have had the eeriness, fantasy and mystery like Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage which was more what I was expecting not some soulless kids adventure that had no emotional center.It's clear Ransom Riggs didn't seem to care about his story being pulled apart by Tim Burton and in various interviews has actually backed Tim Burton's changes which shows his naivety into novel to movie adaptions. J.K Rowling on the other hand was adamant that the directors stay true to her books which is why they were so good. This is something Ransom Riggs should have taken note of.

Even though I usually don't like fantasy films, I really appreciated this movie and this mixture of fantasy and adventure is very pleasant to watch whether for children or adults. The cast is also very good: Eva Green plays very well her role as miss peregrine and Samuel L. Jackson is a very good leader of the monsters. Children are played as well, especially Jake. Regarding scenery and landscapes, they are very beautiful, whether on the island of Wales or scenes shot in Belgium and Florida. The plot is very consistent: on the death of his grandfather, Jake discovered the existence of a magical place, the home of Miss Peregrine. He went on the spot and discovered a time loop on September 3rd, 1943, just before a bombing of the German army. The occupants of the house shows Jake that his power is to be able to see the monsters who want to eat the eyes of peculiar children. Only him can see those monsters, called Hollows. Miss Peregrine, the peculiar children and Jake have to get rid of the Hollows and their leader, Barron, who kidnapped Miss Peregrine in order to do an experience.

345,baomutianxin,I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end! - A Chinese little girl's review,8,8 March 2020,"I like this movie a lot! It's an adventure, fantasy and maybe a bit thrill kind movie. The movie is about a boy Jacob who found a magic world and saved his friends there.
The imagination of the movie is fabulous. The time loop is very creative. Peculiars' time loops are everywhere. It can be in the desert or even in the toilet. Only peculiars are able to get in. In the time loop, time stays at the same day. Everything in that day happens over and over again except the peculiars, but the peculiars are accustomed to it. I think it is interesting to stay in a time loop because something nice can happen time after time. But after ages I might get bored.
The characters are pretty cool. Like the girl Emma, she is lighter than air. Miss Peregrine gave her a pair of heavy metal shoes to keep her from flying up. Emma uses this power to breathe in the sea. She can also help others breathe in the sea. I like her power because I want to take a look at the bottom of the sea without a stubborn oxygen bottle. I also want to fly into the sky freely.
The special effects are terrific too. For example, the large boat on the wide sea, Miss Peregrine turning into a bird, the monsters, and characters' skills, etc. The whole color of the movie is kind of dark, just like it was covered with dust. Some parts of movie are horrific, such as people without eyeballs, monster eating eyeballs and toys with true hearts. When I was watching the beginning of the movie, I was scared. I even didn't want to continue. But after I watched it all, I enjoyed in this movie. But still, I don't think this movie is for milquetoasts.
I gave 8.5 stars. You can watch it if you plan to have an exciting movie and you are over 10 years old. It is a fantastic movie! I hope you watch it. You'll probably like it!

Samuel Jackson was so over-the-top it was ludicrous rather than scary. Judi Dench (whom I love), Repert Everett, and Allison Janney were wasted. Chris O'Dowd (Jake's father) was cardboard.

So what do you do? Hell, your first idea is hooking up with the old bird. Never mind your grandfather, never mind that she must be something like 80+ years, although quite limited in experience.What is even worse is that she wants the 15 year old boy as well. Her former boyfriends grandson comes along, and her first idea is a sweet romance with the kid. That may be just dandy in mr. Burtons world, personally i find it somewhat perverse. Mr. Burton never bothers to explain why these two are attracted to each other to begin with. It just is. Furthermore he never makes it believable how a young boy can go from a slow minded dope to the resourceful man with the plan.

The trailer has succeeded in introducing a dreamy and magic world where there are children who can ""float"", be invisible or create ""alive"" puppets. And the visual is so vivid. Not to mention Eva Green's beauty! But the movie failed me terribly.The plot has a great potential for an enjoyable film but it ends up so shallow and rush!I don't even know where the climax happens, if this movie has any! I keep asking a simple question during watching it: Can the characters be much more irrational? The way the characters coped with their bad situation of being chased and hunted lacks common sense, especially with their own extra-ordinary talents, which can perfectly defense themselves. If invisibility is not enough to help you hiding, which can?For example, one peculiar child was being frozen to death and the moment her life ended was just seconds away. Instead of smashing something to the head of the killer or any immediate action, her friend (also a peculiar children) SLOWLY created a ELEPHANT PUPPET - who way later of course successfully hit the killer! Well, what a fast change in his mind! Because that same guy had not even thought that he could use his ability to defense himself just few minutes before such incident!And there are many more moments where those characters slowly chit chat, slowly dream and slowly do stuffs - illogical and childish stuff!Well, but if you are easy to please or just look for something to kill time, then go ahead!

Honestly, after coming out, I was disappointed. The movie was not all it was hyped up to be and felt a bit empty in places. The villains felt a little flat and 2-dimensional, not dissimilar to all other movie villains of this type, and all in all, it felt a little unimaginative. It strayed a long way from the source material, which would be a large disappointment to all those who were hoping for a movie of the book, rather than the movie based on the book we have today and felt a little watered down.In reflection, I have been able to recognise that this movie was not overly bad. Mrs. Pereguine's performance brought colour to an otherwise drab movie, and the story behind the movie certainly brought with it a strong message. Altogether, while this movie does disappoint if you base your views on the hype that surrounded it, seeing this movie as a standalone based on the book allows you to view this movie in a slightly respectable light. Tim Burton tries to apply his magic to this movie like he has done to other movies before this. While he does this well in some places, it doesn't run throughout the whole movie, leaving you expecting more that what you get. This movie could have been great, but it doesn't really deliver on expectations.If you were expecting 'the next Harry Potter', you will be more than disappointed. But if you are looking for a slightly better than average movie based on 'peculiar' children, with a strong performance in Mrs. Pereguine and an alright performance from Asa Butterfield, then you won't be too disheartened by the final product.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
358,ichaannisa_11,Not For Everyone,7,15 October 2016,"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is an amazing movie. This movie is truly a Tim Burton's element with a lighter tone in it then his usual stuff. I for one don't like a YA-novel-turned-movie kind of thing, but it's Eva Green and Tim Burton, so yes I went to the cinema not expecting that much. But boy I'm hooked. Yes, I still don't like this kind of movie but I damn sure can appreciate this. I love how Tim Burton bring this story forward (even if I have to keep up with the pace), the loop idea is amazing (this type of idea usually paired with many plot holes but not this one), the villain is as I expected from a YA genre, the characters are good (Butterfield is good at portraying Jack but couldn't develop the character that well, the others are perfect though-Eva Green is her usual amazing self). All in all, yes, this movie is awesome, but I believe this is not for everyone. For one, it is a little dark, so everyone who know Tim Burton will expect a more dark theme which they will not get in here while the one who expect to watch a lighter theme will get some moments of cringe worthy (I believe the theme of the movie is the major problem for everyone who disappointed with it). The second will be the pace, it's start out slow as we were given the backstory of the main character, but as the story pick up the pace is getting faster and you have to keep up with it to truly understand and appreciate it (for me at least since I haven't read the book yet). So yes, should you watch this movie? It will be depending on your type of movie; if you like dark, fantasy, adventure, and drama, then this movie is for you. If not, then I think you will regret watching it.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

If it had been an original idea and not an adaptation of a book it would be good. The way Miss Peregrine acted was not how she was in the book. They changed Emma and Olive's powers. Quite a few children weren't even there. Now I understand that a movie can never be exactly the same at the book but this was so far off that it shouldn't even be considered an adaptation, rather another movie completely. The ending was also so far off they're lucky they made it so they might be able to make the second one. However, I don't see that one going very well either.

I had low expectations because Tim Burton's latest movies were boring but he finally made a decent, interesting movie that did not bore me at all!! Eva Green is amazing and thank God Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter were not in this one AGAIN!! The script, the performances, the direction, the special effects all were decent and enjoyable! Don't get me wrong, it is a fantasy movie, don't expect to watch a masterpiece BUT I really liked it. Go with your kids (not very young, i'd say from 10 years of age and older) and your friends, you will relax and watch something interesting. Especially young people will find this movie really good!

363,zhaoyiliu,Tim Burton's style as always,7,2 November 2016,"I almost have watched all the movies from Tim Burton. Nearly all the Tim Burton's films are full of peculiar and adventure vibe, and this film is not an exception. After having the knowledge of his style, I am so sure about this film still rejects his childhood with monster obsession.At first, I think the storyline is as same as other adventure films based on the hero's journey mode. Nothing new but until I had a dream nearly the same as this story after I watched it did I realized how much it related to me. For me, only recalling my dream can sometimes reading my deep and subconscious mind. But I think this film contains so many scenes that are not interlinked to the storyline. If the director deleted these scenes, the film would be shorter and succinct. I don't need to watch it for so long time. I think I can get the same meaning that the director wants to convey with a perfect time length. Maybe that's the beauty of short film which leaves out redundancy but still can build up characteristics and the style of the film.The cinematography is still like his long-standing style, no matter what forms they are, such as animation films. He's always being himself and only being himself. Because using some specific techniques, the faces of the characters are twisted out of shape to indicate how weird they are. Sometimes he was using Godfather lighting to show how evil the demon is. Innocent boys and girls are almost always in the bright light. The contract color and lighting of the characters and the environment is strong. With the Gothic costume and environment, every frame is so amazing which can be seen as a fabulous Instagram picture with properly handled filter. He also used dolly, a crane, even a helicopter when he is going to indicate the environment where the characters are or when the plot keeps going and environment follows to change. All the techniques and effects are super stylized and iconic.Because every peculiar child has different strength, they use a lot of visual effects in this film. The water simulation and the insects are so real and well- done.With all the elements as following and splendid musics, this movie is super good as usual. What I learn from all Tim Burton's movies is you always need to be yourself and keep doing what you want to do all the time. You'll find out what style is the best way to convey yourself.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
364,Gerrard101,A film that enraptures and inspires...wonderment in 127 minutes!,10,4 October 2016,"A truly incredible film, in my personal opinion it typifies the best of Tim Burton. His signature blend of slightly twisted darkness interwoven with a constant feeling of beauteous wonderment. I personally found myself enthralled from the first scene...all the way to the very end(although I will admit the final third of the movie is not quite on par with the rest) and actually went to see it a second time...just a few days later.One of the highlights for me was its place in the YA genre; so frequently in recent times we have seen the production line of these movies throw out the same formula...complete with all the trademark tropes. Whether it is Tris or Katniss...the overwhelming message was 'specialness' and a desire to beat back those who would oppress them into the tiny form of conformity. Each of these stories told the tale of some heroic figure breaking free of the shackles to sing loudly of their own place as unique. However oddly enough I think the original phenomenon that started the YA era spoke of exactly the opposite. Harry Potter may have been the chosen one...the boy who lived, yet the overarching message of his books was never one that he was special. His greatest love was the normality of Hogwarts. Not fighting Voldemort. His greatest strength was never his own abilities...but the love and loyalty of those around him; as Dumbledore said ""We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided."" Yet in most part the YA genre has missed this entirely and focused far more on the fact that he is a Wizard. Miss Peregrine captures this perfectly. Despite their peculiarities, the children try to live as normally as possible. The are more defined by their personalities than what makes them 'special' Burton captures this perfectly, his well designed sets and costumes. As well as the large changes made to the original story(which allow it to actually work as a solo film) create a truly realistic vibe through the whole story.In my opinion however..the movie is defined by the two performances from the leading female cast members. Eva Green once again shows why she is regarded as one of the finest actresses in the business..with a wonderful performance as Miss Peregrine. Her command of every scene and her obvious love for the children and a pleasure to watch.For me however it was Ella Purnell as Emma Bloom that stole the show. Of all the characters she was the most changed from the book..and with a less talented actress it could have been the films biggest failure. Her performance however was nothing less than incredible. She expertly displayed Emma's own strength and older-sister like car...mixed in with the intense streaks of vulnerability that define her character. All the while making her one of the most lovable characters I have ever seen on the silver screen.Overall a wonderful film..well worth the watch Definitely different from the books, however in a very rare twist of fate, i think the changes worked splendidly.Another Tim Burton hit",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Sure the Tim Burton Easter egg's, cinematography, and some interesting scenes were great, but with the dull story, terrible CGI, boring Characters, and mostly mediocre performances made the film a bit underwhelming. It was a very disappointing movie and I hope Tim comes back to become a master director again. But for right now we still have to deal with the mediocre movies.

The movie was very fun to watch and the plot was quite interesting, hoping that there will be a part two.And to anyone open enough to watch a movie and not have expectations of Tim Burton's other movies I say you give this a go, it is quite different from most movies from the director.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Overall the movie was bad, the worst part in my opinion was the acting and the build up towards the emotion, whether it's the romance, the friendship, or any other emotion, you probably didn't even feel the hatred enough to kill Samuel L Jackson beside he took the Eva Green to him self. I really feel like the movie really needs longer time, the crisis and the condition faced by the character wasn't explained enough, the build up towards the character even didn't felt enough, so the emotion towards the character feels nearly as nothing. Good thing is Eva performance is the only thing that came close as natural but still her time is not nearly as enough, the story line was good (not great even perfect), lovely main female character, and that was it. The rating is basically because i was grow up with the book so kinda personal there Overall + Eva Green!!!! + It's Miss Peregrine people!!! - The actor was mostly awful the acting was too stiff (probably because most of them are children) - Bad jokes placement, no, wait, bad jokes at all - Thamuel L Thackton did his best to not say MOTHERF*CKER (not a good attempt tho) - Lack of emotions build and put up to the moviePersonally I really expect an reboot with longer version and more build up because for me that's basically what this adaptation lack of",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
371,imranmarshall11,What a beautiful movie.,9,31 October 2016,"What an absolute beaut of a movie. Sometimes, the thing that stands out about a movie isn't the plot, the pacing, or even the acting. (Although for me, none of these are a let down at all)What stands out about this movie above all else is the magical world it creates. What brings it to life is the absolutely STUNNING soundtrack by Mike Higham and Matthew Margeson. Not since the Harry Potter series have I been so spellbound throughout an entire movie. Aside from the magic itself, the film was beautifully shot with absolutely gorgeous CGI and shot composition. Tim Burton once again, ladies and gentlemen. I really, really liked the characters and the way they were portrayed in the movie. Having only just finished the book after watching the movie first, I have zero complaints about the way they switched some aspects around in the movie version. I can see how people who have read the book could have reason to be upset but the movie kept its fantastical tone. I can't stress how much I loved the cast in this. Of course, one must always return to Eva Green and Samuel L Jackson in this movie. However, the standout performers in this movie, for me, were Asa Butterfield and Ella Purnell. As actors of their caliber, Green and Jackson were rarely challenged in any situation and breezed through with wonderful performances. However, Asa and Ella nailed it with their on-screen presence and chemistry together. All-in-all, I loved every second of this movie. Watching it a second time through allowed me to fully grasp the huge role the soundtrack alone played in bringing this world to life. 9/10",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I'm glad I read it because it was amazing, I would give the book a 10/10. HOWEVER, the movie was a MAJOR disappointment. I think people who have not read the book will enjoy it, because they wouldn't know what to expect, but for the book readers this adaptation is a slap in the face! SO many things have been changed. Emma's peculiarity is swapped with Olive's. Olive was meant to be younger, maybe 10 years old, but she is the same age as Jacob. Fiona was supposed to be older with big, bushy hair, but of course she was not. She had a love interest with Hugh in the book, but I guess they changed that with Olive and Enoch. Miss Peregrine's character was not right... Should have been someone like Angelina Jolie in Maleficent. And THE ENDING.. It was COMPLETELY changed. But I must admit the ending was a little more entertaining than the book because all the children worked together to save Miss Peregrine.Another major flaw to this movie was the ACTING. Especially the protagonist, Jacob. There was absolutely no emotion or connection. It was so uncomfortable to watch. Especially since Asa Butterfield has been so great in other movies like 'Hugo'. I really hope this movie gets a remake in the future because the book is absolutely amazing. The movie definitely didn't do the book justice. The movie could have been so much more, but it was all so average and 'meh'.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

During the entire movie I just was more and more disappointed as it went on. When I first heard they were making this book into a movie, I went out and bought all three books (mainly because after purchasing the first one, I had to read the other two asap). Didn't take me long to read through them. I couldn't wait to see it at home. Granted directors ALWAYS change something when going from book to the big screen, but I figured it would just be a few small things. Nope..I was wrong. Hardly anything in this movie matched with the books. When I heard Tim Burton was directing this I really thought they had found the right director right off the bat to do the book justice. The author can say what he wants, in my opinion Tim Burton slapped him in the face with this one. This movie could've been SOO much better. It could have gone on to make way more money. If done right (for example splitting the movies up into at least three movies like everyone else) it would've been a way bigger hit. Big names, great acting, great effects, great potential..Tim Burton did not do this one justice at all though. Instead, in my opinion, he ruined it. Maybe in time someone will try and remake this movie...feel free to use the same actors..just go along with the book because the book really is great all on its own.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
378,lizwho,One of the great fantasy movies,7,18 October 2016,"I've seen many fantasy films and I can say that Miss Peregrine's is one of the great out of the many average ones. I am not at all familiar with the book, so setting that aside, I'm going to focus purely on the film. To begin with, the story started off on a strong premise that intrigue and enchant like many Tim Burton's works. The plot development was delicately delivered that it successfully managed to grip my interest so that I want to know more about the mysteries that the protagonist, Jake, was set to discover. It didn't threw everything right at you early on, so those mysteries were left to explain themselves one by one as the story goes on and the film progressed without boring me (many family fantasy films failed to do this). The plot got more ordinary once the mysteries have been revealed, though, but it was still fun to watch since it compensated the loss of the initial intrigues with a gripping fight for survival around the climax.Acting wise, I have to give thumbs up for Eva Green. Her Miss Peregrine is effectively multi-dimensional: at first she seemed like this strict headmistress with an enigmatic sense of humor, but at times we could see how she harbored darker secrets and deep emotions that she often tried to hide from her children. Yet the best side of her was when she was being motherly to the children. Eva's acting is emotionally heartbreaking whenever she showed how much she loved her children (such as when she held and cried the dying Victor, or when she sacrificed herself for the kids). The young actors delivered promising performances as well, making the film felt adequately compelling despite its eccentricity. I have to warn, however, that hardcore Tim Burton fans may be a bit disappointed since this one isn't so full-blooded Burton. This wasn't a big deal for me since I'm not that big of a Burton fans. But there were points along the film that I forgot that this was his work. Yet, for a fantasy genre, this movie did delivered. It's definitely a treat for the kids, for those young at heart and for those who value the meaning of being unique and peculiar!",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

They completely got rid of Ricky and replaced him with Shelly. There was no old man watering his lawn, just an old man standing in the middle of the road. They changed so much and I can't say I didn't anticipate it but I didn't expect so many changes. Plus Dr. Nolan being a woman in the movie completely ruins the backstory of Golan in the book(SPOILER: Golan was also Jake's bus driver and the man who took care of their lawn and pool in the novel.)
I still don't understand why they switched around Emma and Olive's peculiarities, and why they made Olive a teenager when she's actually one of the younger children in the books.
The film made so many changes it made it quite difficult to watch.TL;DR If you've read the novel(or the whole series) don't watch the movie, you'll be immensely disappointed. Asa Butterfield was great as always though.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
382,mildgargle,Cancer part 1,1,28 September 2016,"Even giving this movie 1 out of 10 is too generous. This is the worst movie I've watched since Avatar: the last air bender. Tim Burton made really good movies but this is just plain garbage. The acting was horrible. Even Samuel L Jackson's acting looked horrible. The main character(Jake)'s poor acting just ruined the emotion and the suspense of the movie. Well, everyone's acting ruined the plot of the movie. When Jake tries to run away from Emma and the other kids, he trips on a rock and gets unconscious. How he acted the ""trip"" part looks so fake. While he tripped, his forehead made contact with a rock; that's not enough to knock out a teenager unconscious. When he wakes up after that, there is not a single scratch on his forehead. The worst part is that he doesn't make any hurting noises while waking up like, ""Ugh"" or ""Agh"", he gets up super fast and says, ""You're Emma right?"" I mean from him getting up and talking to Emma didn't even take 10 seconds. Are you sure he was knocked unconscious a while ago? The CG was terrible. When he went to Enoch's room. Enoch shows how by putting a heart/s to an object, the object comes alive. Well, this is movie's genre is fantasy so this is all expected. The unexpected part was when he reanimates the objects and let them fight, the objects are shown in stop motion. What the hell Tim Burton? I know the movies you've made are in stop motions but they are cartoons. This movie isn't a cartoon. This movie is filmed by a professional digital camera with real actors and you add stop motion on the movie? This just makes the movie CG look like 80s fantasy movies but in High Definition. Speaking of Enoch, this guy's acting is horrible too. Just as bad as the actor who portrayed Jake. To be honest, I don't know why this guy is a d*ck to Jake. He likes Olive but why does he get jealous of Emma being nice to Jake? The character development is also garbage. I can't understand anything why a certain character behaves that way. The fighting scene is just the stupidest thing in the movie. When the hollows chase after Emma and Jake, Emma gets stuck in the power line. Isn't she supposed to get electrocuted. I mean that power line was even the one the powers the subways. She should've died already. Moreover, when one of the hollows walks across the railway, he doesn't even check if there is a subway passing by. The subway was like ""NOOT NOOT"" and he doesn't even turn his head around to check. The pedestrians are the worst. When a weird looking dude with no iris is walking pushing you and you are pushed hard by something invisible, you should probably call 911 and not stand there looking like a dumb*ss. The kids from the orphanage (I call it orphanage) throw snowballs, jelly worms (the heck?) and Emma blows Cotton candies (The heck x 2 ?) to the invisible hollows to make them visible. Well why couldn't they have done that in the first place when the hollow attacked their home earlier in the movie. Anyways, Enoch reanimates the skeletons. Speaking of skeletons, when Emma showed Jake the place she only knows which is a cruise ship from 1910s, there are skeletons inside the ship. However, all of them are perfectly on their seats and none of the chairs or tables were swept away. Excuse me? When the Titanic sunk, all the chairs and tables were swept away and the passengers weren't on their seats, most of the passengers died outside of the ship.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I don't know if this is a spoiler but, the biggest downside to this movie would be Samuel L Jackson's performance, it seemed rather over the top and not at all that threatening.But this movie is definitely worth the price of admission!8/10!",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Of course, both Eva Green (Ms. Peregrine) and Samuel L. Jackson (Mr. Barron) delivered as always in their respective roles. A great joy was the superb job Asa Butterfield did as Jake the main character of the film.If you like Tim Burton films, this one is a must see and enjoyable story.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

It's about time for her to do roles like this, so people can see her talent and not being blinded for being a very attractive actress. Wishing you all the best Ms Eva Green. Great film as well, any Tim Burton film is something that you would need to watch and understand deeper not just with what you see on his film. His uniqueness and his hidden message on his films are something his fans are looking for. Many people might find his movies plain, dark or lacking with something, but little did they know, there are reason and messages behind that, no eyes could see it but better understanding heart and your mind will see these hidden messages and would understand what life really means.

That being said, I am very disappointed in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children to say the least. This was a THREE book series that they stuffed into one movie. Not only that, but they changed some of the most important characters powers. There was rarely a time that something that happened in the movie actually happened in the book. *SPOILER ALERT* they even made Abe come back to life at the end, which never happened, and was NEVER even HINTED at in the book. If you read the books do not go see this movie, you will only be disappointed. I regret seeing it and they're honestly so lucky I didn't pay for it. If you haven't read the book however, you might enjoy it. But I would suggest reading the books over watching the movie anyway.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
388,filthy-89513,"Tasteless, sad attempt at an adaptation.",4,1 October 2016,"As a HUGE fan of the books, I was thrilled when I saw that Tim Burton was directing a movie adaptation of the first book... Sadly, I Just got back from seeing the movie and I must admit, I am thoroughly disappointed, as I expected. I love Tim Burton's original work, I really do, but when he takes an already existing story and makes it its own, it sucks. The major problem, among many others, the switch of Emma and Olive's peculiarity. What a disgrace. It didn't add anything to the story, just a feeling of incomprehension. The ending, which is already way too different from the original one, is rushed, to a point where it becomes confusing and underwhelming. Asa Butterfield's portrayal of Jake is, well, really bad... Emotionless and without any personality whatsoever. I couldn't feel any sympathy or empathy for him, not even once. Although, Ella Purnell's portrayal of Emma is what I liked the most about the movie, despite her major peculiarity change, which, of course, isn't her fault. I've rarely felt so let down after seeing a movie. I feel like I've been fooled and this was all just a big joke, that Burton will come out and announce that the real movie is coming, that this pathetic one was just a joke... All in all, the movie was a major failure for me, drained of emotion and depth... I suggest you to stick to the books if you want a good, well written story that's both compelling and beautifully rendered. Skip this sad excuse for an adaptation. All spectacle, no heart. A visual fest that leaves you completely unsatisfied in the end. Don't bother.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

THe cinematography was great and their was a smoothness from scene to scene throughout 90% of the movie which I always appreciate. Although I have not read the book but the cast in the film did a good job in particular Ms. P and Mr. Barron, both have comical moments which is always a plus in my opinion. I enjoyed that the main character is imperfect (that his accuracy is not the best) it makes him more believable and relatable. The pace was good at some points because I did not read the book I was left with questions but they were then mostly answered. It is not overly romantic which I highly appreciate.

390,chernabog-60387,Miss Pregrine,1,2 October 2016,"The worst adaptation of a novel to a screenplay ever. The movie has almost, but not quite everything, different from the book, beginning with the loop date (1943, not 1940, as writ). I could go on from there, but space would not me to allow me to list all of the errors. I suppose that if you are Tim Burton, and if you have the rights to the novel, you can re-write it to your personal preferences. For those of us who have read the book(s), all I can say is 'Please do not plan on following this movie with any more!

I usually don't write reviews but I feel like this is needed. The only part of the movie that even remotely resembled the books was the beginning, everything after that left me in a state of WTF am I watching. I left the theater wondering if they had even read the book at all.. I couldn't even focus because 99% of them time I was wondering what the hell was happening.. This is not the book that I fell in love with. I went with a friend who hadn't read the books yet and after the movie she said she liked it.. then I told her all of the things that were left out and she immediately became disappointed.

392,danwestcomedy,"Alright Movie, Terrible Adaptation",3,3 October 2016,"If you haven't read the source material, this is an alright movie. It's as beautiful as any Tim Burton film, with humor and action interspersed throughout. If you have read the books, avoid this movie.There is little to no character development. While the books were a coming of age tale, the main character of this movie doesn't grow at all. He simply has new talents when he needs them, and doesn't have those same talents when the story requires him to be flawed. The best example of this is his archery. He twice manages to shoot a terrifying monster in a vital spot while under duress, but misses repeatedly when aiming in a hallway at an unsuspecting humanoid, to the point where it becomes something the villain taunts him with.There were also rules introduced in the book that the movie announced as rules, but abandoned immediately. The idea that if the children are out of their time loop for too long, they'll age and die is brought up. In the book it says if they're out for more than a few hours, the aging will begin; the movie says it only takes minutes. But the final battle between good and evil definitely took more than 5 minutes (both real time and movie time), and there were no adverse aging effects.The time travel idea at the end was a nice way to wrap up a story so the good guys don't actually suffer any losses, but it made no sense. The movie demonstrates repeatedly that time goes at the same rate whether in the time loop or the real world. So killing the villain in a time loop that was made before Jake's grandfather was killed should in no way affect the real world, and certainly should not restore his grandfather to life.As far as differences between book and movie, after the first 45 minutes the movie might as well have had a different name. The first 45 minutes has minor changes for artistic license, some that didn't make much sense but didn't drastically affect the story. The movie sets up the world the same way as the book, but changes literally every single thing once the conflict starts. From where the final battle takes place to how it happens, to the development of Jake's powers, to who survives. Every detail is different.I recognize that this movie is primarily for children so it doesn't need to be Shawshank. The flaws don't make it unwatchable, but couple the flaws with the glaring changes to source material, and I was very disappointed.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
393,zachmazzie,"Started bland but on point with the book. Then took many ""Creative Liberties"".",7,5 October 2016,"In the first 1/3 of the movie, they followed the story line of the book with very good detail with the exceptions of some very minor details. Aside from the book, the dialogue was very bland and monotone. Jacob sounded not only uninterested in his grandfather, but also uninterested in his role. After traveling to the island, you encounter a very infuriating change that made many readers of the book loose all hope for the movie. The characters Emma and Olive switched peculiarities. Even knowing that it did have a meaning and did increase the quality of the actual movie, this was a detail that seeing what they did before discovering the home, they could have left the same. The middle 3rd of the movie was were the story started to pick up. They took some creative liberties but still made a good balance of book and movie. The last 3rd of the movie however went completely insane. They changed everything except the characters and made a good movie on its own, but added another movie that made a lot of $$$ because it had the same name as a good book.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

The film does not portray what happened in the book the Olive and Emma are the wrong way round. Jake loves Emma a brunette with heat peculiarity and Olive floats. The book goes nowhere near Blackpool and I think he created scenes just to make them scary.i took 2 12-year-olds to see the film and they were unable to watch the film to the end as they found it too scary - it should not have been as the book is not in anyway scary :(inaccurate, disappointing and rated the wrong age",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

It really felt like a movie of it's own, nobody else seems like they've made a movie similar to it. It also was cool with the kids having powers, which everyone had different abilities that I wouldn't have thought of on the spot. It's almost the equivalence of having a super power to only shatter glass, it's not an everyday thing you hear among the words of ""super powers"".The lady who took care of the kids, who's name was said in the title. She seemed as she could've been close enough to play a role of Doctor Who, like she knew what to do. The whole movie was also weird and different, I have to give credit to Tim for that.

They change many things which I don't understand why they choose to change it, like main characters' personality or gender of the character. The support actor/actress are fail to act too. Even the important drama scene but they still just reading the script with flat voice and normal face. The only one who standing out is Eva Green but she appeared in the movie very few even the movie has her name ""Miss Peregrine"" included and she was the only one who can act in this movie. (Actually there's still Judy Densh and Samuel Jackson but they appear very very least too) I feel like I bought the ticket just for beautiful scene that Miss Peregrine resetting the day when the house was bomb by Nazi Soldiers and the scene that she transform to the bird. Other of these I cannot remember which part is good enough to talk about. The fighting scene in the end is quite like young X-Men combination with home alone fight scene. I don't know since when it become a weird mutant children instead of particular children as it's original name. I have the same feeling as when I watched X-Men Origin or Percy Jackson movie.

Adaptions, I understand, are necessary at times. However, this movie was so unoriginal from the book it felt uncomfortable watching it. I felt angry, disgusted and humiliated. Mrs peregrine- although Ava green acted so well that is NOT what Mrs peregrine behaved like in the book, think of her similar to professor McGonagall. And Emma, where to begin? Again the Ella purnell acted well but seriously? Emma and the rest of the peculiars did not come to collect Jake because Mrs peregrine asked her to??? Emma ran away from Jake, was very hostile and dragged him to the peculiar kingdom for questioning. She then broke down when she heard the news of her grandfather. None of that happened. And her power of air? Emma wasn't as half short tempered as she was in the book. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to cover it all. I was very offended at how the hollow gasts were portrayed and how comic Samuel L Jackson played Barron. He was the wrong guy for the role. I was not scared of the hollows in the film. They looked like weird out of shape monsters..and the ending? No comment.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
401,si_anu,I enjoyed the movie,8,12 October 2016,"I am not very familiar with Tim Burton's work (only watched a handful of his movies), neither have I read the book, so I will review this movie as it is, without comparing it to the usual craftsmanship of Mr. Burton nor the characters or events as depicted in the source material.I found the movie entertaining, and at no point did I wonder ""How long more is this going to be?"" Any movie that never prompts me to ask this question automatically gets a 6 out of 10.Many reviews mentioned about huge plot holes in the movie, but I never really understood what the plot holes were that make this a terrible movie. I thought the story was quite easy to follow, even with all the time loops, and makes sense in the make-believe world that we are watching. I usually have trouble making sense of time- travel stories, so the ability to simplify complicated concepts and making it easy to understand for me deserves another star for intelligence. Though probably it wasn't easy enough for a seven year-old to comprehend.I also thought the soundtrack was quite good, I actually stayed till the credits finished rolling to enjoy the music. This, along with the camera work, gets another star to make it 8 out of 10.To be honest, if the voting score is in increment of 0.5, I would be more inclined to vote it 7.5 out of 10. I don't expect character development for all the ""peculiar children"" in a movie like this (that would perhaps be more fitting for a drama series), but the acting can be improved. Eva Green has the best ""on-screen presence"", but she doesn't appear until 30 minutes into the movie, so a bit of patience is necessary. Also I found the editing a bit too abrupt at some points, but that's about all the complaints I have.I am quite satisfied with the movie, considering the amount of bad reviews I have been exposed to. :)",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

They strayed far to much from the book especially parts that link all three books together assuming there's going to be another at least two movies am really unsure how they are going to get back on track with the story. Missing key parts of the book out was a massive mistake.

403,minbiolejeff,Haven't read the book...yet...but enjoyed the watch a lot,8,27 March 2021,"I came into this movie only after watching the trailer, didn't even know there was a book series. I generally like Tim Burton's movies and expect his...peculiar aesthetics in them all. About halfway in I saw that this was based on a book and I immediately purchased the trilogy on Amazon. I'm looking forward to the read, especially after reading other reviews saying that the book is different. Either in the ending or characters. I'm actually looking forward to reading the books a lot after finishing the movie because I want to learn more about this world! It definitely sucked me in and I thought overall it was really good - effects, score, acting (kids can be hit or miss but so we're the Harry Potter kids, the first few movies are pretty tough at some points) but I enjoyed Sam L Jackson's character in this. Others have said his character is scarier in the books, well that he's a combination of villains specifically, but I thought he did a great job for someone not familiar with the books.My only critique is that it is, or at least my wife and I interpreted it as, a children's film but there were definitely some scary imagery in it. We watched it with our kids (10 & 8) and they were definitely creeped out so if you plan on watching this with your kids, maybe watch it first and decide if your kids can handle it. I thought it was really cool and captivating throughout.As for book to movie adaptations, it's OBVIOUS that books give so much more detail and insights into the characters than a movie can hope to give without being 3+ hours. I do my best to separate the experiences and accept them for the medium they are in. For instance, Stephen Kings The Shining had some MAJOR differences between the book and movie. But when you can separate them as their own works they are both great for different reasons. You do get rare movie adaptations that are exactly what you would want (The Green Mile, which is about 85% word for word and scene for scene of the source material) and then others that just take the source material as inspiration for the director to make their own story with some same or similar plot points and characters.Overall, great film. It was good enough for me to buy the books halfway through and I'm looking forward to getting more details and seeing the original material and what it has in store.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Several characters have changed and the plot is very much different. Some of the best story lines were left out and everything was condensed into one terrible film. I was so excited for this movie to come out, but it deviated from the actual book so much that it was nearly intolerable. The books have so many interesting characters and scenery's that Burton completely missed out on. The ball was dropped severely on this film. Tim Burton has ruined another movie and completely rushed what could have been an amazing trilogy into a confusing and soon to be forgotten wait for DVD movie. An absolute shame.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
405,runecallewaert,Worth the wait,9,21 October 2016,"A lot of people were quite disappointed because Burton changed so much nice elements from the books and at first I didn't want to watch it but I'm glad I did. Being a huge fan of Burton's films and drawings(yes,even after Dark Shadows), I read the books because I heard he was going to adapt it into a movie and I really enjoyed them.When you look at the Harry Potter franchise, for instance, they only changed some little things(like Peeves) but mainly kept the plot and details from the books. But when someone like Tim Burton, for who some people go to the cinema just because he's the director, adapts a book you just have to prepare yourself for something different than the exact same plot. He did a good job in combining his style with the style of the books and according to me, this movie shows he's back on track. Dark Shadows was a failed soap opera(I still enjoyed it), while Big Eyes really showed that he's still able to make good, unique and amusing films when there's not to much money involved.Especially the beginning of Miss P has this simple, amusing Big Eyes-feeling with a subtle gray filter. It's true that the middle part goes a bit to fast with some flat characters which are underdeveloped but the visuals are so beautiful that it didn't bother me at all. The ending was a bit confusing but enjoyable. The part when the skeletons appear may have been a bit over the top but it was in a amusing way(unlike Dark Shadows). I think it's absolutely not Burton's best film but after Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows, It sure wasn't a big disappoint for me.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
406,harisivyer,Brilliant film,9,22 October 2016,"After seeing the trailer, I knew that this was a film I wanted to see. I tend to enjoy the kookiness of a Tim Burton film, and this looked to be just the thing. It was what I expected from Tim Burton, although quite a bit scarier than I was expecting for a children's film!Eva Green as Miss Peregrine is possibly the most perfect casting I've seen, and she embodied the mannerisms perfectly. The costume design for her, in particular, was wonderful, and created a great profile when she was in the dark. As protagonist, I have to say I was not enamoured with Asa Butterfield, and I thought that his ~romance~ with Emma was somewhat odd, if not verging on creepy. He knew her for a day and was considering leaving his family behind for her?! The only off note in the entire film, was when the children are all fighting the monsters, I didn't like the tone and music changed and it became almost a farce, which given the dark humour throughout up until that point, didn't sit well with me. Also, having spent the whole film saying how awful these monsters are, how difficult they are to fight, and how they should be very wary of them, all of a sudden about 4 of them are dispatched in under 2 minutes! Nobody seems too fussed at the fact that Emma is floating around (not sure why she ever needed to float in that scene anyway), and to me the whole thing didn't seem right. I thought the scene with the dead child wasn't necessary either, as it painted Enoch in a very poor and twisted light (along with the creepy doll fighting scene!!) only for him to become besties with Jake later on. There wasn't much character development for Enoch, other than I thought he was going to become evil and go with Barron and his crew, and then didn't, so I wasn't sure why he was painted almost as another antagonist for a while.The end of the film - from when they first get to the theatre and see Barron, onwards - felt rushed to me. Like they thought they had to have it under a certain time but wanted to cram bits in. I would have preferred it be about 20 minutes longer, but a less harried feel to it. Overall, I still loved the film, and will likely buy it when it's out on DVD as I can imagine the behind the scenes and making of bits will be fun, and I think it'll become a go-to film in our household at Christmas when all you want is a happy ending for nearly everyone.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Considering this is one of my all- time favorite book series, I left feeling like I had been punched in the stomach. I am not disappointed as much with Tim Burton, as he does what he does. I am more disappointed in Ransom Riggs for approving this adaptation, which changes attributes of major characters, is a hodgepodge of three fantastic books, adds characters that were not in the books, and leaves out plot that is essential to the story.

The book is dark, REALLY dark. Unfortunately Tim Burton didn't capture any of it. For example, the hollows in the book ate the entire kid not just the eyes. Burton swapped kid's characters, changed their ages and added characters not in the book. Terence Stamp and Judi Dench are phenomenal actors that deserved more screen time. Asa Butterfield playing the main character was awful. He has just one expression on his face that he carries from start to finish. This movie would had been better directed by Guillermo del Toro.

I just couldn't get into the story and the movie just didn't flow very well. I found it very very boring. I didn't get the story, maybe a Burton fan would better understand or someone who read the book. Alice in wonderland, as it was a fantasy film was terrific in that IT blended the fantasy world with the realty of Alice's life.

These books are absolutely awesome, however Tim Burton has changed the story so much for this film I don't understand how it has the same title. So much of the story development is cut from this film it doesn't come close to doing the actual story justice. #1 there is little to no mention of how Jacobs (not Jake) grandfather played a role in his development, the scenes are so short and cut from the book version that it leaves the viewer with no understanding of the role he played in Jacobs life. #2 there is no discovery of the home for Peculiar Children itself, he is just there and knows all the additional cast by name (WTF did Tim Burton even read the script of did some underdeveloped retarded primate just give him their version cliff notes) #3 changing the characters and their abilities. This alone I cannot forgive Tim Burton for, something so simple that completely ruined this feature film for fans of the book, and to top it all off there is NO REASON FOR IT!! I truly feel like Tim Burton and Bill Cosby and maybe even Jared Fogle teamed up on Ransom Riggs. Afterward Ransom Riggs was too embarrassed and ashamed to talk about it and let the film be released as Tim Burtons terrible vision. For shame Tim Burton. Why must you keep ruining stories? Your older work was so good, however I feel you have run out of original thoughts, and your imposed will on other peoples stories is absolutely terrible.

They completely changed the main characters ability to control air rather than fire which made the team Jacob and Emma more of a team as she was able to help out more and fit her fire-y personality which I loved. Very disappointing. I was truly surprised seeing Tim Burton was the director and seeing that he did not follow the book which could have made the movie a big hit. Instead it seems like it was more to make money than for you to actually fall in love with the characters. Will not watch this movie as it is completely, completely different from the book except the outline of the plot. It is very hard for people to make movies from a book and follow it completely and still make it wonderful and Tim Burton failed horribly. Was so excited for the movie... So disappointing.

The acting was beyond poor, the story line didn't make sense, characters were weak and didn't blend together and soundtrack was very weak and very random. What on earth was that music during the battle on the pier?!?! It's as though they had various elements they wanted to include in the film and stuck them together in a jumbled mess regardless of the outcome. Such a weak story with bizarre characters loosely thrown together. Why could Samuel L Jacksons character not see the creatures that he was also one of? Such poor scripting to try and force the story along. I like Chris O'dowd but he just didn't fit at all.

418,angelamarkovic25,An amazing visual experience lacking good plot and storytelling,4,12 December 2016,"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a movie adaptation of Ransom Riggs' bestselling novel by the same name.The movie follows Jake's adventure as he unfolds the mystery behind his grandpa's stories and learns his own peculiarity.It was directed by Tim Burton-the master of creating stunning visual films and kind of grotesque yet likable plots and characters.Just the first seconds of this film show that it was directed by Burton;it's beautiful and sort of airy,with a vibe of a dark fairy tale.Even trough the visuals were stunning,everything else,well,was average.The plot,storytelling,characters,ending-everything.What i really liked about Ransom Riggs' novel was the details that make the characters:their past,their adventure in finding themselves and accepting their peculiarities,their relationship and views of the world etc.In the movie adaptation the characters are plain and lifeless,they don't have a backstory of any sort and they are reduced to only their peculiarities.The biggest thing that buged me about the characters is that they are drastically changed and not anything alike those from the book;we're talking about changed ages,looks,names and peculiarities.So,if you really liked the book and it's characters,you will probably be disappointed with these ones.There are huge plot holes and errors in story telling.It feels rushed and underdeveloped,expesily the ending,which was the biggest disappointment for me.The actors did a good job at portraying the characters,all except Asa Butterfield who portrayed the main character,Jake Portman.It felt forced and i didn't feel he did his best in portraying his character.So,in conclusion:if you just want to feast your eyes on something pretty and couldn't care less about anything else,watch this movie.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
419,kimberlydeanne,Bittersweet,5,14 December 2016,I was really sad with how this film was adapted. I read the book before watching the movie. Maybe it was because I was so excited about it being near-perfect that it set too high of expectations. I had a lot of what happened in the book floating in my mind when watching this and I got confused with the movie at times because I kept on reflecting back to the book. I'm sure if I never read the book I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better. I was disappointed with the ending of the movie and left the theater really annoyed. I am still debating if I should continuing reading the remaining books in the series or if I should just wait until the other (maybe) movies will come out. I also felt that this was one of Tim Burton's weaker adaptions of a book (this in itself is a downer since I am a huge fan of Burton's works).,Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
420,gollygracious,Waste of time,1,16 December 2016,"Lots of people will say i'm full of BS but i can honestly say, Tim Burton picked up the book said....i don't like any of this and completely rewrote it. Instead of making Emma the flamethrower she is, he makes Olive? a timid little girl who hides behind an apparently teenage Enoch (when in the book hes a preteen hardly). She is a strong female lead who kicks ass and intimidates Jacob when she catches him. That's right, she hunts HIM down and holds a knife to his throat; bringing him in under the pretenses that he is a Hollow and is trying to kill them. He has to present the letter he found in his grandfathers belongings to prove he is who he is. He completely rewrites the beginning, middle and end. Though some of the elements were the same, he decided to make this movie suitable for children..which it should not have been. Hate me if you must but I'm calling it as i see it. I walked out...literally seething in the Colorado snow falling winter unaffected. He changed the ages, took out good characters, did no character developments of the fact Emma and Abe were serious lover's and Emma was INCONSOLABLE when she finds out Abe is dead. I seriously cannot believe people liked this movie. And the fact Burton had to use a sell out like Jackson to play Barron is disgraceful. The fact he butchered this movie so horribly makes me in shock people actually liked it. Did anybody actually read the book? I've compared the antics of this book to the genius of J.K Rowling. Ransom Riggs really sold out for a little dough. This books twists and turns were so amazing i couldn't put it down. I finished it on a 16-hour flight to Japan and couldn't wait to pick up the second installment. It's sad that we can't even have a good adaptation to a genius book. He changes almost EVERYTHING, no character development, nothing about the fact Jacob absolutely hates his life and finds going to Wales as a way to get away from his terrible neglectful parents. What was with the fact he cared about his job? Or that instead of Ricky taking him to his grandfathers, his boss does? What they couldn't find another teenage boy to play the part? HIS BOSS HATES HIM AND THE ONLY REASON HE WORKS THERE IS BECAUSE HIS PARENTS OWN THE BUSINESS!!! They even used a different nickname for what his grandfather calls Jacob. There were literally PHOTOS in the book giving an illustration of what the characters looked like. Why did Emma wear a blue dress instead of a white one? I don't understand. He didn't stick to the book at all...expectation was not the same as reality.

Floating doesn't have near the same effect.They also cut out a big part which is Abe's best friend, he made him Abe seem more personable. He was there when get found his grandfather and made the ""no trust"" issue more intense because even his best friend didn't believe him.There are so many things that don't add up...important things.

428,jackoutcast,"I love the story, execution was lacking but not really necessary for me",7,21 January 2017,"Idk how the budget looked for this movie but it seems to me they didn't have as much as they should've to be able to make this a truly great movie. Acting was done well, the kids who had been willingly trapped in a certain time period and unable to have many new experiences were very eager to have fun with the new person in their house, and overall acted as awkward and clever as one would imagine from kids living like this. The main character, Jake, was made fun of, had uncaring jack wagons for parents and was thought to be crazy and to love his grandpa to the point of worship. As such he had little confidence but actually had a great mind for things, he uncomfortable with people being so eager to be with him, but also grateful to them for it.However a lot was lost in the lack of character development. Movies that are two hours long would be thought to have amazing character development but as it took a forth of the movie to introduce the major characters other than Jake a lot of opportunity was missed there. Movies that have in depth stories in their original material really have a lot to put out but almost all of the scenes felt very rushed so it was hard to really love any of the characters for the little quirks they had.Another thing the film was lacking in was the CG scenes. In a fantasy story like this CG is necessary, but it seems to me their budget was severely cut in this department as the effects (such as the scenes where the boat is emptied of water, the ones involving Enok's hearts bringing things to life and really all of the scene cuts seemed to be timed terribly) which is honestly where I'm taking points off from a perfect ten. Fantas movies are meant to give a sense of wonder at the world that's taking shape in front of you, but with the lack of skill in these things I really wasn't feeling it as much as I'd like to have.Ovetall this movie was great and I don't regret watching it.

Jackson shows up and in every single scene from this midpoint to the end, delivers nothing but terrible acting, horrible puns and a general sense that the supposedly life-or-death struggle being presented in the screen is a joke.By the time of the climatic final fight, you will be face-palming at the utter stupidity of the antagonists, one dies from not looking both ways while crossing a street ( i wish i was making this up ), while Jackson is still cracking unfunny jokes at the children even after they killed virtually all of his henchmen.This movie also suffers from schizophrenic rating syndrome, it has disgusting gore that no children under 12 would stomach seeing yet the villain is such an imbecile nobody over that same age would take him seriously.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

There were other discrepancies, but this was the most glaring to me.Another reviewer also mentioned the Skeleton Crew vs the Holos. What the hell? Enoch's whole character was like a Nickelodeon kid- villain, the animated elephant he used to rescue his damsel took ages and was no substitute for hitting the dude over the head with something. This whole group of scenes was way too child-viewing for the rest of the film, half of which would give children nightmares.I feel like this movie could have been brilliant, but was let down by silly oversights and poor attention to who the target viewers were, with inconsistencies in the content as a result.Also, most of the younger cast, including Asa Butterfield were a bit lack-lustre in performance.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
433,klingjos,"This is a movie worth watching, even if it's not perfect!",8,22 February 2017,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a refreshing new fantasy that had me interested throughout. It's far from perfect, but it seems to overcome its flaws. To provide some background, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a movie based on a book with the same title. The book is a bit quirky, so naturally the movie is too! This is where hiring Tim Burton really paid off. He directed the film, and although his movies are usually more creepy and strange than I like, his influence was just what the movie needed. Everything from the plot to the costumes has just an edge of Tim Burton's maniacal genius, and it makes this movie pop! To be brief, the movie centers around one teenage boy discovering the secrets of his recently deceased grandfather. His journey leads him to meet a group of children, each with a special power, or peculiarity. He learns that monsters are after them all, and decides to help out. Throughout the movie, he begins to discover his own peculiarity. His abilities, and the changes it presents, are central to the movie's story. Recent fantasy movies such as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them or The BFG have been good, but missing something. It is my opinion that these movies were teetering on the edge of cliché. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is anything but that, as it somehow mixes time travel, two time periods, magic, the relationship of a father and son, and an interesting conflict. The characters also offer a great mixture of evil, comedy, and emotion. The highlights of this movie stem from interaction between the main characters. For example, the main protagonist's father, Frank (Chris O'Dowd), is absolutely hilarious talking to his son. He plays the part of ""clueless dad"" and offers great comedic relief. Throughout the story, he just assumes his son is slightly unhinged whenever he starts talking about the magical events that unfold. He still shows some care for his son though, preventing us from considering him an antagonist. Another example of the great character interaction is Miss Peregrine (Eva Green). She nails the ""eccentric and witty, slightly snappy, but caring"" attitude that I'm sure the writers were aiming for. Every time she talks with one of the characters, she's giving some strong advice without seeming too stereotypical mentor. The movie is not without its flaws, however. Like most big-screen adaptations, the movie fails to capture the entire book. The time travel aspect is slightly confusing at times, and Enoch (Finlay MacMillan), one of the main characters, seems to play no other role in the plot than to annoy the audience with his brooding character. Still, if you look at the sheer number of characters and plot elements that were pulled off, the movie succeeds. All in all, this movie has a few issues that make it less than perfect, but it still impresses the casual watcher. Some may think that it is too strange or random to be good, but this actually lends itself as a strength as the movie progresses. The eccentricity of the movie as a whole makes it something you won't forget for a long while. If you're unsure, I would invite you to give this movie a try. It's certainly worth checking out!",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

I have read the books and I loved them that said I am not one to cry if a movie sails away from the book. But this was just awful. 
Tim Burton has sold out plot and story-telling to visuals and action, which I can't really blame him for as he decided to put content of 3 books into one movie. There was no character development, there was no time to get to know the main character, the relationships between characters have grown almost out of nowhere with no chemistry whatsoever. Hollowgasts that are terrifyingly strong and dangerous in the books are defeated by plastic skeletons in a 7 minute ""epic"" battle with the most boring ass carnival music in the background. I honestly cringed through the 7 minutes. Plot making zero sense, characters behave irrationally and out of character, I really find it hard to believe that the children from the book would have the courage to fight their most feared enemy after in a 2 day interval just because Jake, their hero that they've only known or 2 days gives them some sort of super courage that they can fly around and walk around invisible around fearless. Not to mention the villains, not terrifying at all, honestly Samuel Jackson's character was more cringe that Swartzenegger's villain from Batman. The plot rushed with many plotholes and loopholes to give the audience at least a bit of an understanding.And the acting. HOLY CRAP! The only good acting was the acting of Eva Green, I thought she was brilliant actually, otherwise it was just cringy and not believable at all. The main character's acting was probably worst of all followed by Emma's.I am so dissapointed, this had such a potential if only they made it into at least 2 movies and tried to develop the characters more.

The acting was absolute garbage in my opinion, there was no emotion behind any of the characters, especially in the scene when Jake's grandfather dies- sure he looks concerned, but he shows nothing else to this and is much calmer about his grandfather dying in front of him than let on. The one-liners the children and Mr Barron have during the fight scene are actually yawn-inducing.

439,damoor,Have you read the book?!,1,17 March 2019,"Tim Burton is by far one of my favorite movie director, but he completely destroyed this film-not in a good way. The movie is all over the timeline of events, Scenes were set wrong, and they even mixed up characters. Emma should be the ""sparker"" and olive the ""levitator"". Not including the ""the series of unfortunate events"" style catastrophe of shove 3 books into 1 two hour movie. Two of which are in the last 30 minutes. I've seen so many book-to-movie movies take some artistic liberties but nothing like this. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
440,anar_4732,the movie should have been longer.,10,9 February 2019,"After half the movie is completely different from the book. maybe there should have been a trilogy or a longer movie to tell the story more fluently. we can't feel ourselves in the universe because the parts of the orphanage have been cut off. if the taste of the film remains in your palate, continue with the book.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
